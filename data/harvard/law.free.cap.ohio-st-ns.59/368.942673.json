The provisions of the 10th article of the constitution, requiring the 'general assembly to provide by law for the election of county officers, and that such officers shall be elected on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, disable the general assembly to provide by law for an interval between the official terms of a sheriff and one elected to succeed him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-15\">2. The power conferred upon the general assembly by the 27th section of the second article of the constitution to provide for the filling of vacancies in office, refers to such vacancies as may occur fortuitously. It does not authorize the creation of an interval between the official terms of persons elected to the office of sheriff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-17\">3. The act of April 26, 1898, \u201cto amend sections 1202 and 1203 of the Revised Statutes (93 O. L., 351) is void, including its repealing section, and said original sections continue in force notwithstanding said act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-19\">4. All persons elected at the November election, 1898, to the office of sheriff in the several counties of the state, were entitled upon qualification to enter upon the discharge of their official duties on the first Monday in January, 1899, and those who have not so qualified and entered are entitled to do so now.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b388-25\">(Decided January 17, 1899.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>In the ease of the <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Heffner, </em>the petition alleges that the defendant Heffner, having been elected sheriff of Mercer county for two successive terms of two years each, and having on the first Monday of January, 1899, occupied said office continuously for four years, nevertheless he refused to vacate said office and asserted his right to continue therein until the first Monday of September, 1899, and prayed that he be ousted therefrom. In his answer Heffner admits his election to said office in November, 1894, and his re-election thereto in November, 1896, and that he qualified and held the office for both of the terms for which he was so elected, but that in consequence of the act of April 26, 1898, to amend sections 1202 and 1203 of the Revised Statutes he really believes that he is entitled to hold the office until the first Monday in September, 1899. That the governor has failed to issue to him a commission for that purpose, but that he is ready, able and willing to qualify according to law; - that no candidate was nominated or elected to fill said office during the interim of eight months between said first Monday in January, and said first Monday' in September, 1899, but that at the general election held in November, 1898, one Lawrence Shunk, was duly elected sheriff in Mercer county and thereafter and prior to the first Monday of January, 1899, received his commission from the governor and has qualified according to law, but that he was not voted for by the electors of said county to fill said interim of eight months; but that Shunk has nevertheless made demand upon the defendant for the surrender to him of said office which the defendant has refused. He further alleges that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the second day of January, 1899, the county commissioners of said county of Mercer appointed one James B. Shock, sheriff of said county of Mercer to enter upon the duties of said office and hold the same until the first Monday of September, 1899; and that pursuant thereto the governor commissioned Shock as sheriff, who duly qualified according to law and made demand on the defendant for the surrender to him of said office. Wherefore, the defendant, if not entitled to the office himself, is unable to determine to which of said demandants he should surrender the same. To this answer there is a general demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">In the <em>State ex rel. the Attorney General </em>v. <em>Stallsmith, </em>the petition alleges that the defendant was duly elected and commissioned to the office of sheriff at the general election in 1896, qualified and entered.upon the office on the first Monday in January, 1897, for the period of two years to be completed on the first Monday of January, 1899; that at the general election in November, 1898, the defendant was chosen as his own successor in the office of sheriff of Perry county, but refused to qualify as such elected officer, averring and claiming that in consequence of said amended act he was entitled to hold the same during said interim by virtue of section 8 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, and praying that he be ousted from said office. Defendant Stallsmith answering admits the averments as to his several elections in November, 1896 and 1898 and alleges that he served the full term for which he was first chosen and that pursuant to his re-election in 1898 he qualified as such sheriff for his second term by giving bond to the satisfaction of the commissioners of said county and taking the oath of office which was endorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>upon said bond as required by law. To this answer there is a general demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">In the <em>State ex rel. Saal </em>v. <em>Asa S. </em>Bushnell, as governor, and <em>Charles </em>Kinney, as secretary of state, the relator alleges that at the November election held in 1896 one Theodore F. McConnell was duly elected sheriff of Cuyahoga county for the term of two years from the first Monday of January, 1897, and that he duly qualified and entered upon his office and was the lawful sheriff during the term of two years; that at the general election in November, 1898, said McConnell was duly elected as sheriff of said county for the term of two years to commence on the first Monday in in September, 1899, and that he has duly qualified by executing his bond with sureties and conditioned according to law; that said bond has been certified to be correct in form by the county solicitor of Cuj\u00ed-ahoga county and has been approved by the commissioners of said county and his oath has been endorsed thereon. Relator further says that he has been duly appointed by the county commissioners of Cuyahoga county to fill said vacancy in the office of sheriff for the period between the first Monday in January, 1899, and the first Monday of September, 1899, and is entitled by virtue of said appointment to have issued to him a commission as sheriff by the governor and secretary of state for said term, but that said defendants as governor and secretary of state have refused to issue to him such commission and prays for a peremptory writ commanding the issuance thereof. To this petition there is a general demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">In the <em>State of Ohio ex rel. William A. Kelley </em>v. <em>Charles </em>Thrall, the relator alleges that one Stephen Thrall, by virtue of two successive elections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the office of sheriff of Delaware county, held said office continuously for four years ending as he alleges on the thirty-first day of December, 1898; that at the general election held in November, 1898, one Jacob Schaffner was elected sheriff of said county for a term beginning on the first Monday of September, 1889, and to end on the first Monday of September, 1901; that by virtue of said amending act there existed a vacancy in said office from the first Monday in January to the first Monday in September, 1899, said Schaffner, not having been elected thereto, and said Stephen Thrall being disqualified to hold over. He further alleges that on the seventh day of January, 1899, the court of common pleas of Delaware county pursuant to section 1208 of the Revised Statutes appointed the relator sheriff of said county for said interim. That as such appointee he gave bond and performed the other acts required in qualification for said office; and that the defendant Charles Thrall, claiming to be entitled thereto by virtue of his appointment to said office for said interim made by the county commissioners of said county on the seventh day of January, 1899, usurps and unlawfully holds and exercises said office. The relator prays that the defendant be ousted from said office and that he be inducted therein. To this petition there is a general demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-5\">Brief of <em>F. S. </em>Monnett, Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-6\">The Century Dictionary defines \u201cineligible\u201d (1) \u201clegally, or otherwise disqualified for office; not eligible.\u201d The adjudicated definition of the word, when applied to holding public office, has been defined <em>State </em>v. Murray, 28 Wisconsin, 99, where the court holds \u201cthe term \u2018ineligible\u2019 means as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>well disqualification to hold an office, as disqualification to be elected to an office.\u2019\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>14 Wis., 497; 106 Ind., 203 ; 3 Nev., 566; 50 Miss., 626; Meachem sections 95-96; <em>Thomas </em>v. Owens, 4 Maryland, 189; <em>Page </em>v. Hardin, 8 B. Mon., (Ky.) 648.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\">The two sections of the constitution delegating to the legislature the power to fill vacancies appear in section 27 article 2, and section 18 article 3, the latter section naming executive officers other than that of sheriff can in no way be made applicable to the case at bar. We believe the fair construction of section 27 to be that it delegates the power to fill vacancies where there are no other limitations or disqualifications, expressly provided in the constitution itself. The constitution expressly provided that an <em>alien </em>could not hold office, or a <em>minor, </em>or an <em>insane person, </em>or a person that had disqualified himself by exhausting his rights, such as a <em>limitation </em>as to his eligibilty in holding an office. In each of such cases, whether provided by the state constitution or the constitution of the United States, we hold that it is \u201cotherwise provided \u2019\u2019for by the constitution, and that article 2, section 27; does not apply. <em>Royall </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>28 Grat. (Va.), 130, 26 Am. Rep., 335; <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>6 Grat. (Va.), 534; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>12 Leigh (Va.), 466; 83 Pa. St., 104; 24 Am. Rep., 154; 12 S. W. Rep., 99; <em>Privett </em>v. <em>Bixford, </em>26 Kans., 52; 40 Am. Rep., 301; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>21 La. Ann., 631.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-7\">We cite the above cases to confirm our construction of section 3 of article 10, namely, that the constitution affirmatively making- the term limit a ground of ineligibility or disqualification, that the legislature had no authority, under section 27, article 2, to enact section 8 and section 11 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>statutes to in any way fill such vacancies with a four year sheriff any more than it could provide by said section that an alien, a duelist, a briber, or any other constitutionally prohibited person could hold office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-5\">Hence, when the legislature passed the act of April 26, 1898, pretending to extend the term of office from the first Monday in January to the first Monday in September, and thereby creating- an interim of eight months, it made no provision for filing- said interim for the defendant\u2019s office, and it made no provision for the election to fill said term. And sections 8 and 11 not applying to the defendant, we cannot determine in what way said defendant has any title to said office, either under the constitution or the statute. <em>Carson </em>v. McP., 15 Ind., 327; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>90 Ind., 294; <em>Gosman </em>v. <em>State, </em>106 Ind., 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-6\">Upon the expiration of the officer\u2019s term, unless he is authorized by law to hold over, his rights, duties and authority as a public officer must, <em>ipso facto, cease. Badger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 U. S., 599; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tieman, </em>8 Abb. Pract. (N. Y.), 359; 30 Barber, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-7\">But notwithstanding a general provision that the incumbent of an office shall hold over until the election and qualification of his successor, yet where the incumbent has at the expiration of his term held for the full period permitted by the constitution, as where the constitution forbids the same person from holding the same office for more than a given number of years, he cannot hold over, but the office shall become vacant even where his successor dies before qualifying. Meachem on Public Officers, section 398, p. 258. ,,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Although the petition is not aimed directly at the appointee hut for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the Act of 1898, referred to in the pleading, we believe the issue is before this court in this action to determine the validity of that act creating the interim, <em>Christy </em>v. <em>The </em>Board, etc., 39 Cal. 1; <em>People </em>v. Hastings, 29 Cal., 449; <em>People </em>v. Kelsey, 34 Cal., 470; 39 Cal.,,1. If th\u00e9 foregoing infirmities to the law be found by the court, then there will be no necessity for further discussion of any propositions under this head. But should the law be held to be constitutional on the ground above suggested, then we contend the appointee by the county commissioners has no title to office for the reason that the board of county commissioners being an inferior board created by statute and receiving all their powers from the legislature so far as appointing powers are vested in them that such power must be strictly construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\">We conclude, that the fair construction of section 1208 that the term office as therein used must under the constitution be an elective office and the term \u201cvacant\u201d must be construed to be some portion or period of time that has once been filled by an election of the electors of the county wherein such vacancy occurs and that the \u201cappointment\u201d therein referred to can only be for such elective office and during the unexpired term constitutionally created and constitutionally limited, and that the term \u201cplace\u201d therein used should be construed to be the place vacated by a sheriff duly elected and not <em>an interim </em>created by statute. The court has already construed, as above repeatedly recited, that section 1208 governs and controls in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>eases and not section 11. <em>State </em>v. McGregor, 44 Ohio St., 630.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-4\">And it then necessarily follows that if section 1208 controls and it does not provide for the filling of the interim created by the act of 1898, then there is no statutory or constitutional provision providing for. the filling of said interim, and that the said act is unconstitutional and void in not providing- for a fully equipped court wherever person for an injury done him in his land, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law; and justice administered without denial or delay, as provided section 16, article 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-5\">That if said law of April, 1898 be inoperative as to Mercer county and at least one-third of the remaining counties, it could not be made applicable alone to the remaining portions of the state without contravening- article 2, section 26 for the reason that all laws, of a general nature, should have uniform operation throughout the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-6\">Wherefore, the state claims that said act of April 26, 1898, above herein contested, is unconstitutional and void in that it contravenes and denies to the citizens of Mercer county the rights guaranteed to them under article 1, section 1, and article 1, section 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">Second, it is unconstitutional and void, being a violation of section 1, article 10 of the constitution of the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-8\">Third, in contravening and being in violation of section 2, article 10 of the constitution of the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-9\">Fourth, being in violation of section 3, article 10 of the constitution of the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-10\">Fifth, being- in violation of section 26, article 2 of the constitution of the state of Ohio.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Brief of <em>W. E. TVest.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">The obvious sense, manifest intent, and fixed policy, of sections 1, <em>2, </em>and 3, article 10 of the constitution, and sections 1202 and 1208 of the Revised Statutes, are :</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">1. That every hour in the life of the sheriff\u2019s office shall be embraced within and covered by a regular and prescribed term thereof, to fill which, the people shall have the right and an opportunity to elect an incumbent in the first instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">2. That no hiatus of legislative creation shall ever intervene between such regular terms, the right and an opportunity to fill which by popular election in the first instance shall be denied or prevented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">3. That no period in the life of such office shall be filled by appointment other than a vacancy or period of temporary disability arising in and during such regular term from the operation of causes which legislation cannot prevent nor control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">The truth of these propositions necessarily results from the construction which the mandatory provisions of section 1, article 10 of the constitution must receive, and which may be syllogistic-ally stated thus :</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-11\">1. A constitutional command that permanent provision be made by law for doing- a particular thing in a particular way, is an implied prohibition against any legislation, the effect of which is to make impossible the doing thereof in the way commanded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-12\">2. The mandate of section 1, article 10 of the constitution that \u201cThe general assembly shall provide by law for the election of such county officers as may be necessary,\u201d of which the sheriff is one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>is an implied prohibition against any legislation creating a hiatus of any duration in that office, the right and an opportunity to fill which by election is denied or prevented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">3. Amendatory section 1202 of the Revised Statutes, passed April 26, 1898, created a hiatus of eight month\u2019s duration in the office of sheriff, the right and an opportunity to fill which by popular election, is taken away, and the filling thereof for said period by an elected incumbent made impossible ; for which reason said amendatory section 1202 contravenes the mandate of section 1, article 10 of the constitution and is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">These propositions are sustained by the unanswerable reasoning in <em>State ex rel. </em>v. Brennan, 49 Ohio St., 39.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">All legislation is void, which suspends the functions or seriously impairs the efficiency of any tribunal, the continued maintenance of which is commanded by the constitution; <em>Reid </em>v. Smoulter, 128 Pa. Rep., 324. The common pleas court is a tribunal, the continued maintenance of which is commanded by section 16 of the Bill of Rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">The sheriff is the executive officer of the court. All judicial process, initial, intermediate and final pertains to his office. His official existence and authority are indispensible to the administration of justice and the continued maintenance of judicial efficiency. That legislation is void, which abrogates or suspends the office of sheriff, because the operation and effect thereof is to suspend the functions of the court and prevent the administration of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">Article 10 commands the general assembly to provide by law for the election of sheriff and imposes certan restrictions on its power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>As an adjunct of the judiciary, the sheriff is not only a necessary but an indispensible county officer, and hence one, for the election of which the legislature is peremptorily commanded to provide, for which reason, after the enactment of a law providing therefor, that body is without constitutional power to abolish or temporarily suspend the office or the authority to fill it. In obedience to the constitutional command, the section of the Revised Statutes in force previous to the legislation of 1898 was section 1202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">Where permanent legislation is necessary to the maintenance of any Department, Branch, or Office of the government, a Statute enacted therefor pursuant to a constitutional mandate, can not be repealed or suspended, unless adequate and effectual means exist or be provided for supplying its provision in some other constitutional method, and the statute so undertaken to be repealed or suspended, without the existence or provision of such other constitutional method will continue in force. To illustrate our meaning: This is an elective government for the maintenance of which the enactment of laws for the conduct of election is commanded. Suppose the legislature of 1898 had in its wisdom repealed the election laws or such portion thereof as provides for the selection or appointment of judges, clerks, and other functionaries thereof, and later in the session had passed a separate act providing for the conduct of elections and the appointment of judges and other officers to take effect on the first day of November, 1899, can it be seriously contended that such repealing law would not have been disregarded as an invasion of constitutional rights, the old law be held to continue in force and the elections of 1898 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>be held under the judges it provided, notwithstanding? It is not in the power of the legislature to abolish or suspend temporarily the offices of judges and clerks of election or the statute making- provision therefor, unless some other means exist or be provided for supplying them in some constitutional manner. Other examples might be introduced of statutes enacted pursuant to some mandate of the constitution, but this is sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-4\"><em>Mattingly &amp; </em>Short, for defendant, Heffner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">Defendant eiaims it to be his duty to hold such office for the reasons: First, that section 1202 of the Revised Statutes if valid, operated to extend the term of all incumbents. Second, that section 1202, if valid, operated to create a definite term, and not a vacancy, within the purview of section 1208; and that no person was elected to such term; and such term falls within the provision of section 8, of the Revised Statutes. Third, that county commissioners have no power, under section 1208, to fill a definite term, or vacancy occasioned by legislative omission. Fourth, that the constitutionality of the new act being-in volved, and the office being demanded by a sheriff elect, and by an appointee of the county commissioners, he is unable to safely det\u00e9rmine the rights of such two claimants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">At the very threshold of interpretation of statutes, we are met with the question, whether or not they are constitutional. The following provisions of the constitution, are in our opinion involved :</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-7\">Article X, sections I, II and III; article II, sections 26 and 27 ; article I, section 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-8\">It will be observed that the present constitution expressly recognizes the existence of the office in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>section 3 of article X. It has been said by this court that legislative control of this office, is substantially the same as under the constitution of 1802. <em>Hulse </em>v. <em>State, </em>35 Ohio St., 427. And perhaps the boldest legislator, would not have attempted a vacation of such office, in the face of the provisions found in the former constitution. And even the power to subtract from the duties of that office, and confer on another officer, to the exclusion of a sheriff, is gravely doubted. <em>King </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>65 N. C., 603 ; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Brunst, </em>26 Wis., 412 ; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>People, </em>2 Denio, 272; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Albertson, </em>55 N. Y., 50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-4\">The new law evidently proposed to extend the terms of sheriffs throughout the state. Its impotency to accomplish that purpose, is obvious in the light of section 3, article X, if that section is applicable to other than three-term candidacies and biennial elective officers. It is not of uniform application, but it is a general law. A general law whose operation is so uncertain, and unconstitutional as to one class of persons, is invalid as to all. Article 2, section 26: <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>43 Ohio St., 548.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">There is no provision in the statutes of Ohio, for election to the office of sheriff, except for the regular biennial terms. There is but one way known to the law of filling definite terms, occurring throughout the state, that by election. If then, the election for the biennial term does not provide for this short term, there has been no provision by law or election to fill it. <em>State ex rel. Crawford v. McGregor, </em>44 Ohio St., 633.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-6\">If the law is held invalid, it lifts the office of county sheriff at once from the general confusion now prevailing, and sheriffs elect all over the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>go </em>into office. <em>Derby </em>v. <em>City of Wilmington, </em>76 N. C., 133; 42 Ohio St., 545.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">There is no criticism to be directed to section 1208 ; it is a special provision, answering- every purpose for which it was enacted, but does not provide for filling entire terms of office. Such section was enacted to provide for filling vacancies and completing a term begun by some person elected to that precise term. We believe the new act to be unconstitutional. <em>Moor </em>v. Given, 39 Ohio St., 661.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">It may be said, in respect to the power of county commissioners, that they have none to fill by appointment vacancies in elective county offices, except such as expressly delegated to them by the general assembly, and that any provision of the general assembly, which intends to delegate power to the county commissioners to fill elective offices, must be construed strictly. The 'power of appointment to fill vacancies is not absolute, but limited and qualified, it being an abridgement of the fundamental rights of the people, the repository of all power, and is only to be exercised until the people can act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">The word \u201cvacancy,\u201d as used in the constitution and statutes of states, of the United States, has been many times defined, Lawson\u2019s Concordance of Words and Phrases; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>89 Penn., 425; Dig., 38, 17, 2; De B.Gal., IV, 3; 7 Colorado 611.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-8\">It has also been held, that when the contingency of an \u201cextension of term\u201d happens, as contemplated by such section, as section 8, of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, it is as much a part of the entire term as any portion of the time preceding such extension. <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>10 Cal., 44; <em>Lee </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Evans, </em>8 Cal., 431. It will thus be seen that vacancies occur after the term begins to run. <em>People, </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>2 Cal., 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">The only provision that can be held to apply to such a vacancy, is section 1208, of the Revised Statutes. That is the section under which the appointment was made by the county commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-7\">Prospective vacancies certain to occur are elective. Casual vacancies arising by some unexpected contingency alone, are appointive vacancies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-8\">We have therefore, not a vacancy that can be filled by any provision of existing law, if this new act be upheld. But we have at the taking effect of the law, a short prospective term of definite duration to occur generally throughout the state, the nomination and election for which, when term begins, has gone by default. And why has it been permitted to go by default? For the very obvious reason, that the plain purpose of the legislature was not to create a vacancy for commissioners to flll but to extend the term of incumbency in office. Then we derive no aid from the intention of the law in regarding such a vacancy as has occurred within the term of section 1208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-9\">We therefore conclude, the county commissioners have no power to fill the interim or vacancy, arising by the legislative omission and operation of the new act, of April 26, 1898.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-10\">Can the defendant, (incumbent, having held the office four years) hold over during the interim of eight months under the new law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-11\">On the question of eligibility, it has been held that the word \u201celigible\u201d is defined: \u201ccapable of being- chosen, \u2019 \u2019 \u2018 \u2018the subject of selection or choice. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Searcy v.

But whether an incumbent, who has already served four consecutive years, is eligible for any further period during a period of six years, involves the application and construction of section 3, article X, of the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">And all that can be claimed for this last question is, that, article X of the present constitution has sole reference to elective terms occurring after regular and stated intervals. It most evidently was intended by the framers of such organic law to prevent third term candidates from being eligible. But that it contemplated the rendering ineligible an incumbent from holding his office for some short period or extension of term, or until his successor to such office was legally elected or appointed and qualified, is not so clear.

The legislature cannot temporarily abolish an office especially when the office is a constitutional office. <em>Reid v. Smoulter, </em>128 Pa. St., 324.

The constitution having therefore made him ineligible to finish his term, there is, therefore, as to the eight months remaining, a vacancy in and an unexpired part of the term of office, which the commissioners under section 1208 may fill for the portion thereof, ending on the first Monday in September, when his successor shall take the office.

If at the end of his term he had served four years continuously, it is clear that section 8 would not operate, for the reason that article 10, section 3 of the Constitution provides that he is not eligible to the office of sheriff for more than four years in any period of six years.

To enable sheriffs to serve the full time permitted them by the constitution, the legislature fixed their term of office at two years. This gave them an opportunity of being \"re-elected and of serving the full constitutional period.

The legislature could also constitutionally change the time of the beginning of the sheriff\u2019s term o&gt;f office, as this is a matter left entirely with the legislature.

We think that the title of the plaintiff is invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-8\">A vacancy is a vacancy, and the commissioners may fill it, no matter for what cause it occurs, subject only to the limitation that they cannot encroach upon a succeeding term. Vacancies in other county offices, where there is no limitation, are governed by section 11, unless there is some other provision, as in case of sheriff, governing, and the appointee holds until his successor is elected and qualified. But not so with the sheriff appointed by the commissioners. His appointment terminates at the end of the vacancy, and if his successor should for any reason be disqualified, or fail to to accept the office, and [a vacancy is thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>created at the beginning o\u00ed his term, the sheriff appointed cannot hold any portion of the vacancy thus created at the beginning of the term of the successor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-4\">Section 1218 differs from section 11 only as to the time and not as to the kind of vacancy, or the manner in which the vacancy occurs. The authority to make the appointment is just as broad in filling the vacancy of sheriff by the commissioners as the authority to fill vacancies by the commissioners in the sections of the statutes making provisions for the appointment of other county officers. The clause fixing the time in no way modifies or limits the power to make the appointment, but does limit the time for which the appointment shall be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-5\">Section 1016, which provides that \u201cwhen a vacancy happens in the office of county auditor, from any cause, the commissioners of the county shall appoint some suitable person, resident of the county, to fill such vacancy.\u201d <em>State ex rel </em>v.

L.),351, \u201cto amend sections 1202 and 1203 of the Revised Statutes.\u201d Prior to the amendment section 1202 provided: \u201cThere shall be elected in each county biennially a sheriff and coroner who shall hold their office for two years, beginning on the first. Monday of January next after their election.\u201d Section 1203 provided for the qualification of the officers so elected before said first Monday of January. The only change attempted by the amending act is the substitution of the first Monday of September for the first Monday of January. The sheriffs elected at the November election in 1896 were chosen and commissioned for official terms of two years to be completely ended on the first Monday of January, 1899.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Assuming the constitutional validity of the ' amending act, the briefs of counsel present a variety of views touching the manner in which the office is to be filled during\u2019 the eight months intervening between the first Monday of January and the first Monday of September in the year 1899. By one it is contended that there is a vacancy to be filled by appointment to be made by the county commissioners pursuant to the first clause of section 1208 providing that \u201cWhen the office of sheriff becomes vacant the county commissioners shall appoint some suitable person to fill the vacancy who shall give bond and take the oath of office prescribed for .the sheriff, and hold his office for and during the unexpired term of .the sheriff whose place he fills.\u201d Another contends that there is a vacancy to be filled by appointment to be made by the court of common pleas pursuant to the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>clause of section 1208, providing that \u2018 \u2018When the sheriff is incapable by reason of absence, sickness or other disability, of serving any process required to be served, or by reason of interest is incompetent to serve, the court of common pleas may appoint some suitable person * * *. \u201d Another presents the view that, notwithstanding the expiration of their official terms, the sheriffs elected in 1896 continue in office during said interim of eight months until the first Monday of September, 1899, when the sheriffs chosen in November, 1898, may take office according to the terms of the amending act, and this view is supposed to be supported by section 8 of the Revised Statutes providing that \u201cAny person holding an office or public trust shall continue therein until his successor is elected or appointed and qualified, unless it is otherwise provided in the constitution or laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Since all of these views assume the validity of the amending act, and since its validity is challenged by the petition against Heffner and in some of the briefs, it seems to present the question of first importance. It is said by those who maintain the validity of the act that the question was decided in accordance with their view in <em>State ex rel. Attorney General </em>v. Brewster, 44 Ohio St., 589. If this question was involved in that ease, it is strictly accurate to say that it was overlooked. The report shows that counsel agreed as to the existence of a vacancy resulting from the amendment of both the constitution and the statute, and the consideration of the court was devoted exclusively to the manner in which the admitted vacancy should be filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">It is also said that this act should be held valid in view of the decision of this court in <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>rel. </em>v. McCracken, 51 Ohio St., 123. That ease, however, related to the office of the clerk of the court, and gave effect to section 16 of article 4 of the constitution \u2014 a part of the Judicial Article\u2014 relating to that particular office, and ordaining that \u2018 \u2018there shall be elected in each county by the electors thereof one clerk of the court of cdmmon pleas, who shall hold his office for the term of three years and until his successor shall be elected and qualified, * * A\u201d The effect of this section was distinctly held to be to take the office of clerk out of the operation of other provisions of the constitution which might otherwise have been controlling. In the view taken of the act there considered, it was vital to its validity that5 because of the constitutional provision quoted, the act did not create a vacancy in the office. Moreover neither of the cases cited was affected by section 3 of article 10 of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It has never been held by this court that the legislature may create a vacancj^ in an existing county office to be filled by appointment, although it was held that the official term of an elected clerk of the court may, by the operation of the constitutional provision referred to and an act of the legislature, be in effect extended beyond the term for which he had been elected, the extended term not exceeding any limitation placed thereon by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Although the power exercised by the general assembly in this instance is legislative in character it must be exercised conformably to the pertinent sections of the 10th article of the constitution : \u201cSection 1. The general assembly shall provide by law for the election of such county and township officers as may be necessary. Section 2. County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>officers shall be elected on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November by the electors of each country, in such manner and for such term, not exceeding three years, as may be provided by law. Section 3. No person shall be eligible to the office of sheriff or county treasurer for more than four years in any period of six years.\u201d The mandatory provision that the general assembly shall provide by law for the election of county officers is a clear denial of its power to provide for their appointment, and the requirement that such officers shall be elected on the day named negatives the view that they may be appointed by any authority. <em>State ex rel </em>v. Brennan, 49 Ohio St., 33. The power of the general assembly with respect to the subject is completely comprehended in these sections of the 10th article and section 27 of the second article: \u201cThe election and appointment of all officers, and the filling of all vacancies, not otherwise provided for by this constitution, or the constitution of the United States, shall be made in such manner as may be directed by law * * *.\u201d The nature and the terms of the power granted by this section indicate that, in its application to county offices, it is subordinate to the provisions of the 10th article. The vacancies for which it authorizes' the legislature to provide are those which occur fortuitously, as by death or resignation, in offices for which there has been provided, in obedience to the 10th article, an elected incumbent. The power to provide for the filling of such vacancy does not imply a power to create an interval in the office between the official terms of two persons elected to fill it. With respect to the interval which the general assembly has attempted to create by the legislation in question it is \u201cother<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>.wise provided\u201d by the 10th article, and as to the principles involved the act does not differ from that considered in the <em>State </em>v. Brennan.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">But it is said that the act does not create a vacancy in the office, because the sheriff in office on the first Monday in January should hold until the first Monday inSeptember when his successor may qualify under the amending act. This proposition is completely answered by the third section of the 10th article disqualifying all persons to serve as sheriff for more than four years in any period of six years, and the fact appearing in the <em>State ex rel </em>v. Heffner, that on the first Monday in .January the defendant had held the office for four years continuously. We are not advised of the number of counties in the state in which the same condition exists. But in the <em>State </em>v. <em>Stallsmith, </em>we learn that the defendant was first elected in November, 1896 and again in November, 1898; and it is clear as to him, that although he would be qualified to hold over during the interval referred to, there is to be, by the terms of the act, at the close of his second term an interval of disqualification of like duration and origin for which a sheriff cannot be elected under any provision of law now existing. But the number of such instances of disqualification cannot be important. In view of the general nature of the subject the act is void since it cannot operate in every county of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The word \u201celigible\u201d in the third section of the 10th article refers as well to qualification to continue in office as to qualification to take office. By its terms the test of eligibility relates to continuance in, or occupancy of, office. It prescribes no qualification peculiar to the taking of office but as to the two offices of sheriff and treasurer, with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>spect to which there are peculiar reasons for limiting the duration of incumbency, it prescribes such limitation. The term has been usually so interpreted in similar connections. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Mur</em>ray, 28 Wis., 96; <em>Carson </em>v. McPhetridge, 15 Ind., 326; <em>Smith </em>v. Moore, 90 Ind., 204; <em>Gossman </em>v. <em>State ex rel., </em>106 Ind., 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Original sections 1202 and 1203 were enacted in obedience to the mandate of' the 10th article of the constitution. The repealing section of the act of April 26,1898, is void as are the other sections. The original sections are now in force notwithstanding said act. The persons who were elected to the office of sheriff in November, 1898, were entitled to qualify and enter upon the duties of the office on the first Monday in January, 1899. Those who failed to do so then are now entitled to qualify and enter upon such duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Since we entertain no doubt as to the validity of the official acts of the 'persons who have occupied the office of sheriff since the first Monday of January, by whatever claim of title, no such doubt should be inferred from any of the views here expressed. It is with becoming regret that we reach a conclusion regarding the effect of these constitutional provisions which defers the accomplishment of such important public purposes as must have moved the legislature to pass the act in question. Should such purposes continue to commend themselves to the judgment of the members of the general assembly, it is obvious that they may be attained by an act changing the date of the commencement of the official term of the sheriff, and providing for the election for the interval of someone who will not, in consequence, serve more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>than four years in any period of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In <em>State ex rel. </em>v. Heffner, the demurrer to the answer will be sustained and there will be a judgment of ouster.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Stallsmith, </em>the demurrer to the answer will be overruled and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In <em>State ex rel. Saal </em>v. <em>The Governor et </em>al., the demurrer to the petition will be sustained and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In <em>State ex rel. Kelly </em>v. Thrall, the demurrer to-the petition will be sustained and the petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
