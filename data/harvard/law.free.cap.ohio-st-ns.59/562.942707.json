Sections 4158, <em>et seq. </em>of the Revised Statutes provide for the descent of real estate in cases of intestacy. The pertinent provisions of section 4159 are: \u201cIf the estate came not by descent, devise or deed of gift it shall descend and pass as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">First, to the children of the intestate and their legal representatives;</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Second, if there are no children or their legal representatives, the estate shall pass to and be vested in the husband or wife, relict of such intestate;</p>\n<p id=\"Abk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Third, if such intestate leaves no husband or wife, relict to himself or herself, the estate shall pass to the brothers and sisters of the intestate of the whole blood, and their legal representatives. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">This statute was in force when Smiley Mathews died. His estate in these lands, not having come to him by descent, devise or deed of gift, and he having died without children or their legal representatives, their descent as to any intestate interest therein was, by the second paragraph of the section, cast upon his wife. From the fact that it was not in force when his will was executed, it may be conjectured that he did not then intend that she should take more than a life estate in the lands. But it cannot be assumed against the terms of the will and the statute operating\u2019 upon the lands at the time of his death that, if such was his intention, it remained unchanged. By its terms the statute operates in every case \u201cwhen a person dies intestate having title or right to any real estate or inheritance in this state,\u201d and there is no presumption of more obvious force or propriety than that the testator had knowledge of the change in the statute and acquiesced in the larger provision which it made for his wife. The comprehensive language in which the statute is made applicable to all cases of intestacy compels the acceptance of the rule, generally recognized, that the heir at law can be disinherited only by a devise of the property to another. <em>Denn ex dem. </em>v. <em>Gaskin, </em>2 Cowper, 329; <em>Crane et al. </em>v. <em>Doty et </em>al., 1 Ohio St., 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>Jicdgrnent affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
