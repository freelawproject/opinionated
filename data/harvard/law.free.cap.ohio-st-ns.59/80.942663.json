Youtsey and others became the owners of a tract of land in Hamilton county, Ohio, known as the Hyde Park Syndicate property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-22\">The interest of Mr. Youtsey in the property was somewhat greater than the undivided one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>sixth part thereof. The legal title to the property was taken in the name of James E. Mooney, in trust for the persons composing the syndicate. As such trustee he had full power to sell, convey or lease the property, or any part thereof, at such times, to such persons, and upon such- terms as he might deem best.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">To enable Mr. Youtsey to pay for his interest in the property, the plaintiff in error, James C. Wright, executed as maker, for the accommodation of Mr. Youtsey, promissory notes, payable to the order of the latter, which were discounted by the First National Bank of Newport, Ky.,of which Mr. Youtsey was the cashier at the time, and of which the other plaintiff in error, George P. Wilshire, is now the receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">The proceeds of the notes so discounted were applied by Mr. Youtsey to the payment of his proportion of the purchase money of the syndicate property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">Prior to January 16, 1895, the total amount of the notes executed by Mr. Wright for the accommodation of Mr. Youtsey, and discounted and used by the latter in paying for his interest in the property mentioned, was'$14,650.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">January 16, 1895, to secure Mr. Wright, Mr. Youtsey executed and delivered to him the writing of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-10\">\u201cJanuary 16, 1895.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-11\">James C.

My interest in said syndicate is liable for the payment of said notes. The interest of said James C. Wright is that for the execution of said notes by him and all previous and subsequent similar ones he is to have from the profits of said venture, six thousand dollars. This does not include money loaned by him to me in said venture, for which he holds my notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">T. B.

Wilshire, was appointed its receiver and qualified as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">January 18, 1897, the defendant in error, The Franklin Bank, began an action in the common pleas court of Hamilton county, Ohio, against Thomas B. Youtsey, to recover $20,000.00, and in the same case, caused a writ of attachment to issue, and to be levied upon Youtsey\u2019s equitable interest in the Hyde Park Syndicate property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">January 19, 1897, by the confession of Mr. Youtsey, it obtained a judgment against him for the amount of its claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-10\">January 21, 1897, Mr. Youtsey, who was a citizen of Kentucky, and a residentof Newport, Campbell county, in that state, executed a deed of assignment, for the benefit of his creditors, to the defendant in error, C. W. Nagel. This deed of assignment was recorded January 22,1897, in the \u25a0county clerk\u2019s office of Campbell county, Kentucky, and January 25, 1897, in the recorder\u2019s office of Hamilton county, Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>January 23, 1897, the plaintiff in error, James C.

Youtsey, to recover of him the sum of $25,717.81.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">Embraced in the sum sued for by Wright, and forming a part of his cause of action, was his claim against Mr. Youtsey for $14,650.00 and interest, the amount of the liability of Mr. Youtsey to Mr. Wright, as accommodation maker, of the five notes hereinbefore mentioned, the proceeds of which Mr. Youtsey had used in paying for his interest in the Hyde Park Syndicate property. By confession of Mr. Youtsey, Mr. Wright obtained a judgment against him immediately for the amount sued for, upon which an execution was issued forthwith and levied upon the interest of Mr. Youtsey in the Hyde Park Syndicate property which had been attached by the Franklin Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">The day that the judgment was obtained and the execution levied, January 23, 1897, Mr. Wright began the action, from the judgment in which the petition in error in this case is prosecuted, against the Franklin Bank, Mr. Nagel, assignee, and others, to enforce and marshal the liens against Youtsey\u2019s interest in the Hyde Park Syndicate property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">In his petition and the amendment thereto Mr. Wright asserts and relies upon the lien which he claims to have obtained by virtue of the writing of January 16, 1895, signed by Mr. Youtsey and hereinbefore set out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-9\">The judgment which Mr. Wright obtained against Mr. Youtsey, he subsequently assigned to the First National Bank of Newport, and the plaintiff in error, George P. Wilshire, receiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>that hank, is entitled to the benefit of said assignment, and to the lien, if any, which Mr. Wright obtained by the above writing of January 16, 1895, and he was, therefore, by supplemental pleading, made a party to the action in the lower court and filed his answer and cross-petition, and he is before this court as one of the plaintiffs in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">Upon the hearing of the cause b.y the circuit court, it adjudged that the Franklin Bank had a superior lien upon Mr. Youtsey\u2019s interest in the Hyde Park Syndicate property by reason of its attachment, and that C. W. Nagel, assignee of Mr. Youtsey for the benefit of his creditors, upon the sale of Mr. Youtsey\u2019s interest, would be entitled to the balance of the proceeds of sale of the property, after the satisfaction of the claim of the Franklin Bank. The petition in error in this court is prosecuted to reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-6\"><em>Mackoy &lt;&amp; </em>loioman, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">The writing of January 16, 1895, signed by ' Youtsey, created an equitable lien upon his interest in the Hyde Park Syndicate property in favor of James C. Wright, and the words clearly express an intention on the part of Youtsey that Wright should have a lien from the date of the writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-8\">It is an established rule that a writing or agreement must be construed so as to uphold and sustain it and not to make it nugatory. It must be held always that the parties to an agreement intended to accomplish something and not to do a vain thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-9\">The question is always one of the intention of the parties.

The cases are: <em>Stansell </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>13 Ohio, 149; <em>Mayham </em>v. Coombs, 14 Ohio, 428; <em>Holliday </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>Bank, 16 Ohio, 534; <em>White </em>v.

While it is true that there are some earlier cases, among which are the Kentucky cases cited by Mr. Mackoy, in which it is held that equitable estates were not governed by the registry laws, the modern rule is almost universally to the contrary. Webb on Record Titles, sections 19 and 36, and 2 Pomeroy on Eq. Jur., section 649 and notes ; <em>Bank </em>v. Clapp, 76 N. C., 482; <em>Mann </em>v. Alexander, 9 Ark., 112; <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Sevier, </em>25 Ark., 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">It was held in <em>Graves </em>v. Graves, 6 Gray, 391, that an attaching creditor of an equity of redemption, takes precedence of a previous assignment of the equity which, though recorded, was not acknowledged, and was therefore improvidently admitted to registration. <em>United States Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shriver, </em>3 Md. Chan., 381; <em>Digman </em>v. <em>McCullom, </em>47 Mo., 372; <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>West, </em>86 N. Y., 280; 5 Ohio <em>Hisi Prius, </em>61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">Under the statutes and decisions in Ohio, relating to attachments, an attaching creditor obtains a lien at law upon the attached property, even though it be an equitable estate in land. Section 5555, Revised Statutes; <em>Carty </em>v. <em>Festermacher, </em>14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Ohio St., 457; <em>Bank </em>v. Nash, 1 Handy, 153 ; <em>Finnett </em>v. Burt, 2 Handy, 202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-5\">The suit brought by Mr. Wright against Youtsey, in which the judgment for money was recovered, was wholly inconsistent with, and contradictory of, the existence of any trust in favor of Wright. Youtsey could not be at the same time a trustee of this land for Wright and a debtor to Wright for the money expended in the purchase of land; and the suit was brought by Mr. Wright, treating Youtsey not as a trustee of the land for Wright, but as a debtor to Wright, and upon that theory a judgment for money was recovered against Youtsey. When a man imposes a lien upon his own property for the benefit of another person, the former does not become a trustee for the latter; he does not hold the land in trust for the other, but holds the land for himself, charged with a lien in favor of the other person.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-6\"><em>Gustavus II. Wald; Chm-les B. Wilby </em>and Z, <em>J. </em>Crawford, for defendant, C. W. Nagel, Assignee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-7\">Mr. Mackoy in- his argument uses the term \u201c equitable mortgage \u201d in several different senses which should be discriminated one from another. In his brief he adopts the language of Jones on Mortgages, section 162: \u201cWhatever the form of a contract may be, if it is intended thereby to create a security, it is an equitable mortgage.\u201d That however is not the law in Ohio unless the instrument claimed to be an equitable mortgage has been executed and recorded as prescribed by our statutes. An \u201c equitable mortgage \u201d in this sense is not, properly speaking, a mortgage, but a contract to give a mortgage,\u00ae which contract equity will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>specifically enforce. <em>Bloom </em>v. Noggle, 4 Ohio Sfc., 46; <em>Bank </em>v. Johnston, 47 Ohio St., 306; <em>Dodd </em>v. Bartholomew, 44 Ohio St., 171; <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>11 Ohio St., 232; <em>Strang </em>v. Beach, 11 Ohio St., 283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">The recording or delivering for record (of a mortgage) is part of the execution; and hence before that act is done the instrument is not a mortgage. <em>Holliday </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>Bank, 16 Ohio, 536; <em>Mayham </em>v. Coombs, 14 Ohio, 435; <em>Fosdick </em>v. <em>Barr, </em>3 Ohio St., 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-6\">Why these propositions should be true of mortgages of the legal estate, and untrue of mortgages of the equitable estate is not readily seen. <em>White </em>v. <em>Denman, </em>1 Ohio St., 110; Jones on Mortgages, section 476 and 138. White <em>&amp; </em>Tudor\u2019s L. C. in Eq., 4th Am. ed., vol. 2, pt. 1, 203-4, <em>Lincoln B. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>10 Neb., 581; <em>Laughlin </em>v. <em>Braley, 25 </em>Kan., 147; <em>Christian </em>v. <em>Am. F. Land Mort. Co., </em>92 Ala., 130.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">The reasons for holding mortgages of an equitable title or interest to be within the registry-act are, however, stronger in Ohio than in any other state, by reason of the changes made by the legislature in the language of the act. The precise point contended for by Mr. Maekoy, has, so far as we can discover, been raised but three times before this court, and in cases none of which he cites. Of these the first is <em>Paine v. Mason, </em>7 Ohio St., 198; <em>Philly </em>v. <em>Danders, </em>11 Ohio St., 490; <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Little, </em>23 Ohio St., 301.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-8\">In all these cases the contention of counsel was based, and in the case last cited the decision of the court rested, upon the ground that the operation of the statute was limited by its own terms, <em>verbis ypsissimis, </em>to instruments conveying, affecting or incumbering land in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The statute then in force was the act of June 1, 1831, 29 O. L., 346, S. &amp; C., 458. In 1887, (Revised Statutes 4106,84 O. L., 132-3) the statute was amended to read as follows: \u201cA deed, mortgage or lease of any estate or interest in real property shall be signed by the grantor, mortgagor or lessor in the presence of two witnesses, etc.\u201d These changes in the language of the act cannot for a moment be supposed to be other than intentional and deliberate; the legislature is presumed to have acted with a full knowledge of the decisions of the Supreme Courton the subject. <em>Buckley v. Stephens, </em>29 Ohio St., 620.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">It is true, as stated by Mr. Mackoy, that the deed of assignment made to Nagel was not, and could not be filed for record in the probate court of Hamilton county. Revised Statutes, section 6335, requiring deeds of assignment to be filed in the probate court of the county, of the residence of the assignor, relates, and can only relate, to assignments made by residents of Ohio. It is impossible to suggest any probate court in Ohio, in which this assignment made by a resident of Kentucky should have been filed under the requirements of the statute. It is conceded that the deed of assignment to Nagel complied with all the requirements of the laws of Ohio as to conveyance of lands. Under it, therefore, Nagel succeeded to all the rights of his grantor, in trust for creditors. Assignments for benefit of creditors, made by nonresidents covering real estate in Ohio, have, if the deed of assignment complied with the requirements of our statutes as to conveyances, always been given full effect and force by this court. <em>Sortwell </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>9 Ohio, 180; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>31 Ohio St., 611.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>It is true, also, that the deed of assignment to Nagel was not \u201cfiled for record in the recorder\u2019s office of Hamilton county, Ohio, until January 25, 1897, two days after Wright had begun his suit to enforce and marshal liens. \u201d But equally true it is, that as to Wright, the,deed of assignment need never to have been recorded at all. Deeds have to be recorded only as against subsequent purchasers for value, a position not claimed, and which could not be claimed for right. <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>17 Ohio, 226; <em>Betz </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>48 Ohio St., 492.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">That mortgages void against creditors, are void against an assignee for creditors, is a proposition conclusively established by the decision of this court. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Shuey, </em>8 Ohio St., 509; <em>Straman </em>v. <em>Rechtine, </em>40 Bull., 74.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-7\">Burket, <em>3.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AO\">The defendants in error do not seem to contend that the body of the writing1 of January 16, 1895, signed by Mr. Youtsey, is insufficient in form to create a lien upon his interest in the syndicate property, and for the purposes of this case it may be conceded to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">To properly dispose of this case it is necessary to consider the principles of law applicable to the subject matter in hand generally which we now proceed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">It has been held by this court that where an owner of land contracts to sell the same to another person, such vendor holds the title in trust for the purchaser, to the extent that the purchase money has been paid. <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Little, </em>23 Ohio St., 308; <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>1 Ohio Rep., 257; <em>Minns </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>15 Ohio, 569; <em>Lefferson </em>v. <em>Dallas, </em>20 Ohio St., 68 ; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Ohio St., 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>It has also been held that lands held in trust for another cannot be levied upon and sold upon execution against the trustee to pay his debts; and judgements against the trustee are not liens upon the lands held by him in trust for another. <em>Manley </em>v. Hunt, 1 Ohio Rep., 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In that ease the court say : \u201cIt would be productive of much mischief to make trust estates liable to judgments against the trustees. Such a principle never has been, and we trust never will be recognized in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">That case was followed and approved in <em>Butler </em>v. Brown, 5 Ohio St., 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">From these holdings it follows that lands held in trust cannot be taken in execution against the trustee for the payment of his debts. But lands held subject to liens, whether legal or equitable, may be taken under execution or attachment and sold with the liens resting thereon ; or if no purchaser can be found, the liens, including the executions and attachments, maybe marshaled and the proceeds of the sale distributed according to the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Lands held in trust for another are thus preserved for the beneficial owner free from the debts of the trustee, but lands burdened with liens are liable to be seized in execution for the payments of the holder\u2019s debts. This difference between trusts and liens reconciles many cases which otherwise seem in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Lands held by a properly executed, but unrecorded deed, are also free from the debts of the grantor, whether attempted to be reached in an assignment for the benefit of creditors made by him, or upon an attachment, judgment or execution against him. The title under such a deed is good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>as against everything except a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">By section 5374, Revised Statutes, lands and tenements including vested interests therein, are made subject to the payment of debts, and liable to be taken on execution and sold at judicial sale; and by virtue of section 5555, Revised Statutes, lands and tenements, whether held by legal or equitable title, are made liable to be seized and sold under attachment for the payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">To make the statutes as to real estate, and all interests therein, consistent, the General Assembly in 1887, so amended sections 4106, 4133 and 4134, Revised Statutes, as to require deeds and mortgages of any estate or interest in real property to be signed by the grantor or mortgagor, and acknowledged before a proper officer in the presence of two witnesses, and to be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county. Mortgages so executed, whether on an estate in real property or on only an interest therein, take effect from the time of the delivery to the recorder, and deeds so executed, conveying the estate or only an interest therein, that is, an equity, take effect from delivery, except as against subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchasers without notice, and as against such the deed must be also recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">These amendments of the statutes require all instruments in the nature of a mortgage, either legal or equitable, to be signed, acknowledged, witnessed and recorded; and until so signed, acknowledged, witnessed and delivered for record, the same are without effect as to third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The statutes on this subject before the amendments of 1887, were substantially different from the present acts, and the decisions of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>construing those statutes are not always applicable to the statutes as now enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Coming now to this case, it is clear that the paper signed by Mr. Youtsey was intended to create only a lien in favor of Mr. Wright,- and not a trust. The paper cannot be construed to create both a lien and a trust, as they are the opposites of each other. In a trust the property is held for another, while in the case of a lien it is held by the holder for himself, but burdened with a charge, commonly called a lien, in favor of another. The law applicable to liens must therefore rule this case, and not the law applicable to trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Neither does this case depend upon the law of purchasers for value, but upon the law of the priority of an attachment or deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, over a defective unrecorded mortgage. By virtue of section 5555, Revised Statutes, the interest in the syndicate property, even though it was only an equity, could be attached and sold as upon execution, and the purchaser would receive a g\u2019ood title to such interest in the syndicate, and the Franklin Bank and the assignee under the deed of assignment would receive the proceeds of the sale without the aid of a court of equity. Should there be no bidder, the liens could be marshaled and the proceeds of the sale distributed, but the lien of the attachment and the conveyance under the deed of assignment, would remain in full force as legal rights fastened upon the estate held by an equitable title, and would both have preference over the defective and unrecorded mortgage held by Mr. Wright. If Mr. Wright\u2019s paper had been acknowledged, witnessed and recorded it would have operated as a legal mortgage upon an estate held by an equitable title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and would have taken priority over the attachment and deed of assignment; but as the case stands his paper created no charge or lien, legal or equitable, upon the interest in the syndicate property, as against third parties asserting legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The deed of assignment was executed and delivered in the state of Kentucky, where all the parties resided, and conveyed property in Hamilton county in this state. Such a deed could not be filed with the probate judge and take effect from the time of its delivery to him as required by section 6335, Revised Statutes. The deed in this case was in due form and took effect from the time of its delivery to the assignee. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>31 Ohio St., 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">This was two days before the suit to marshal liens was commenced, and therefore, no question of <em>Us pendens </em>ari ses in this case. True the deed of assignment was not recorded in the office of the recorder of Hamilton county until two days after the commencement of the action to marshal liens, but such record is only necessary as to subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchasers without notice, and there is no such purchaser in this case. The deed of assigment, therefore, passed title from its delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Much reliance is placed by counsel for plaintiff in error upon the case of <em>Kemper </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>44 Ohio, St., 210, but that case is in full accord with the views here expressed. There is no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\n<em>Judgment afivrmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
