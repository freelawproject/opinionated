L. Douglas Shoe Company, he, the said Pohlmeyer, did unlawfully and fraudulently embezzle and convert to his own use, without the assent of his said employer, the sum of $287 which had come into his possession and care by virtue of his said employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ment. The slate offered evidence tending to show that Pohlmeyer was employed on August 11, 1896, in Hamilton county as the agent for the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company a corporation organized under the laws of Massachusetts, doing business as a corporation with its principal office at Brook-ton, Massachusetts, and further tending to show that about the time alleged in the indictment the sum of money charged, being the property of said company, came into the possession of Pohlmeyer as such agent, and that he embezzled and converted \u25a0 the same to his own use without the consent of his employer. Thereupon the defendant called as a witness Charles Kinney, the secretary of state of Ohio, who testified that as such officer he is the custodian of the records, papers and certificates of foreign corporations filed in the state of Ohio, is personally familiar with such records, papers and certificates that he has carefully examined them and finds from such examination that the <em>W. </em>L. Douglas Shoe Company has not filed with the secretary of state the certificate required under section 148c and section 3269-5, and that said company has filed no paper or papers, certificate or statement whatever with the secretary of state since the passage of the act. To this testimony the prosecuting attorney objected. His objection was overruled and to that ruling he took an exception. The defendant thereupon rested his case. The court thereupon instructed the jury that in view of this evidence the accused was not and could not be the agent of the <em>W. </em>L. Douglas Shoe Company, and there could be no conviction under the indictment and further instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant, to which instruction the prosecuting attorney excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>John G. </em>Schwartz, prosecuting attorney and <em>Thomas II.

Pohlmeyer is not an agent of the W. L. Douglas Shoe Co., although were it not for this statute he would be, without any possible question, and therefore he cannot be convicted in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">The Douglas Shoe Company may be estopped from denying Pohlmeyer as its agent, but Pohlmeyer has done nothing by which the public or any one dealing with the Douglas Shoe Company was defrauded through any fault of his.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">The Douglas Shoe Company was not a corporation \u201cin this state.\u201d It could not exercise corporate rights in this state. An unlawful corporation cannot maintain an agent; or, rather, a body of persons assuming to act as a corporation cannot, as a corporation, maintain an agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-8\">This was first decided in England in 8 C. &amp; P., 642, the case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wm.

The sections clearly disclose the purpose of the general assembly that foreign corporations shall be put upon the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>footing with domestic corporations with respect to fiscal burdens, to the business which they may carry on in the state and to service of judicial process within the state. They do not disclose a purpose on the part of the general assembly to make booty of the property of a corporation which does not comply with the provisions of the act. Under the statute defining embezzlement (section 6842) the offense consists in converting to one\u2019s own use \u2018 \u2018anything of value which comes into his possession by virtue of his employment as * * * agent * * * servant or empk^e.\u201d The statutory definition of the offense regards the actual relation of the agent, servant or employe, and not the legality of the mode in' which it was created nor the extent of the authority conferred. And the rule that one who receives money or any other thing of value in the assumed exercise of authority as agent for another, is estopped thereafter to deny such authority, applies in criminal prosecutions as well as in civil actions. 2nd Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law, section 364. <em>State </em>v.
