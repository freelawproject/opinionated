Kihlken, deceased, brought suit against Frederika Kihlken, his widow, to have a conveyance to her of certain described lands, made by John H. Kihlken, set aside, and such other relief as they 'in equity might be entitled to. After a judgment in the common pleas, the defendant appealed to the circuit court, where the case was tried on the pleading\u2019s and evidence, and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiffs requiring the defendant to convey the land to them, subject to a life estate in herself. Error is prosecuted here to reverse this judgment. At the request of the defendant the court made a finding of the facts and its conclusions of law thereon. The finding of facts is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\"><em>First </em>\u2014 That the plaintiffs are brothers and sisters and are the only heirs at law of one Henry B. Kihlken, who died intestate on the twenty-eighth day of February, 1894, leaving the defendant his widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-10\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 That on the twenty-first day of May, 1888, said decedent, Henry B. Kihlken, was seized in fee simple of the following described real estate: situated in the township of Carroll, county of Ottawa and state of Ohio, and known as and being the south half of the northeast quarter of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>twenty-nine, township seven, range fifteen, containing eighty acres of land more or less, and that said Henry B. Kihlken acquired said real estate by devise from his- father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\"><em>ThwcL </em>\u2014 That on the twenty-first day of May, 1888, said Henry B. Kihlken executed and delivered to one of the plaintiffs, John H. Kihlken, a deed of the aforesaid real estate, whereby he conveyed the legal title of said real estate to said John H. Kihlken; that as the sole consideration for said conveyance, the said John H. Kihlken and Henry B. Kihlken entered into a contract in writing whereby it was agreed by and between said John H. Kihlken and Henry B. Kihlken that Henry B. Kihlken had that day sold and conveyed to said John H. Kihlken the real estate above described; that the said John H. Kihlken agreed to reconvey said premises to said Henry B. Kihlken at any time on demand made by him in person; that should the said Henry B. Kihlken, die before making such demand, then said agreement to be void and of no effect; that said agreement was executed contemporaneous with said deed, and was a part of the same transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\"><em>Fov/rth </em>\u2014 That on the fifteenth day of January, 1894, the said Henry B. Kihlken duly performed all the conditions of said agreement on his part to be performed and duly demanded of the said John H. Kihlken a reconveyance of the said real estate to him, Henry B., as provided in the said contract, which reconveyance the said John H. was then ready and willing to make, and thereafter and .at all times remained and was ready and willing to make. That on the fifteenth day of January, the said Henry B. and John H. Kihlken agreed that a few days later they would meet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Port Clinton, and have a proper deed of conveyance drawn up, and the said John H. agreed he would then execute the same. And at the time agreed upon the said JohnH., together with his wife, went to Port Clinton for the purpose of meeting his brother Henry B., and for the purpose of executing a deed of conveyance to him in accordance with the terms of the said written contract, and also in accordance with the terms of the verbal arrangement made on the fifteenth day of January, 1894. But the said Henry B. Kihlken did not meet John H. at Port Clinton at the time agreed upon, but was on that day confined at home by sickness, which soon after caused his death, and which occurred before a reconveyance of the said property was made to him by the said John H. Kihlken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\"><em>Fifth </em>\u2014 That said Henry B. Kihlken, on said day, May 21, 1888, for the purpose of defrauding the said Caroline M. Miller out of her just claim against him as aforesaid, and to hinder and delay her, the said Caroline M. Miller in collecting any judgment that she might recover against him in any bastard proceedings that she might institute against him, made said conveyance of the aforesaid real estate to the said John H. Kihlken and without any other motive or purpose or consideration, and the said John H. Kihlken received said deed to said premises for the purpose of assisting his said brother to defraud said Caroline M. Miller, and to hinder and delay her, the said Caroline M. Miller, in collecting her just claim against the said Henry B. Kihlken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\"><em>Sixth </em>\u2014 That at the time said conveyance and agreement to reconvey was entered into, the said Henry B. Kihlken was an unmarried man, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>afterwards, to-wit, on the twenty-eighth day of June, 1893, the defendant, Frederika Kihlken, and said Henry B. Kihlken were married and that said marriage relation existed until his death on February 28, 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\"><em>Seventh </em>\u2014 That on or about the eighth day of March, 1894, the said Frederika Kihlken, by her father, Henry Sehwiek, requested the said John H. Kihlken to convey said real estate to her, and that the said John H. Kihlken did on said day convey said real estate to said Frederika Kihlken by a warranty deed and that said conveyance was made by the said John H. Kihlken, in ignorance of the law, and was made by him unadvisedly, improvidently and without due deliberation and under the supposition that he was carrying out the intention of the parties as provided for by the terms of said contract: And that the said Frederika Kihlken never paid to said John H. Kihlken any consideration whatever for said conveyance, and no .consideration for said conveyance has ever passed between the said Frederika E. Kihlken and John H. Kihlken.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">As a conclusion of law the court found that the conveyance of May 21, 1888, by Henry to John Kihlken, was made in trust for Henry; and that the plaintiffs, as heirs at law of Henry, are entitled to a reconveyance of the property from the defendant, subject to a life estate in herself. The defendant excepted and prosecutes error here for the reversal of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-8\"><em>O.

Miller, gave John tbe absolute legal title as against Henry and all tbe world, except Henry\u2019s creditors and as to them John would be regarded as holding the title in trust, but as to Henry he did not hold the title in trust but held the absolute title, and he had a right to sell it give it away or do with it as he pleased, and Henry was forever estopped from claiming the land and he could not have been heard setting up his own fraud to avoid the conveyance. As between John and Henry, the fraudulent conveyance was an absolute conveyance, and no court would have given relief to Henry in securing a reconveyance of the property, but the court would have left him with his own fraudulent transaction where it found him, and treated John as the absolute owner as though he had paid full consideration for the land; 'and for these reasons, the conveyance of the land to John destroyed its ancestral character as ancestral property, and as John was the owner, and had a right to do with it as he pleased, and having paid nothing for the land, he had a right to give it to plaintiff in error, and as he did give it to her voluntarily, he has not mistaken his legal rights or those of his brothers or sisters, and no one has been deprived of any title in the property which they might have claimed, except John, and while he is a party to the transaction and nothing out, and no fraud has been practiced on him, and his act has been voluntary, there is no foundation in equity for the relief which hq seeks. <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>18 Ohio St., 311; <em>Temper </em>v.

B. could never have recovered the property from John, still if John was ready to execute the moral obligation imposed upon him by the trust, although he was not legally bound to do so, a court of equity will certainly aid him when he has made a disposition of the property under a mistaken idea of the law and not in accordance with a true interpretation of the terms and objects of the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">No third party could take advantage of the illegality of the consideration between Henry B. and John.

There was no real consideration for the conveyance, but was done for a purpose we will not now consider. Before his death Henry made the request, but died before a reconveyance was made. Thereupon John conveyed the land to Henry\u2019s widow, believing at the time that, under the trust, this was in accordance with his duty. This presents the first aspect of the question arising upon the facts as found. The claim of the plaintiffs below is, that by reason of the fact that the land in question was devised to Henry by his father, and that Henry died without issue, it should descend to them as ancestral property under section 4158, Revised Statutes, notwithstanding the conveyance to John and by John to Henry\u2019s widow. This we think is erroneous. Had John as requested conveyed to Henry just before his death, the <em>immediate </em>title of Henry to the land would have been the deed of John and not the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>vise of his father. In <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>18 Ohio St., 311, after partition had been made between brothers of land devised to them by their father, two of them, Jacob and Thomas, exchanged the lands each had received in the partition by a reciprocal execution of deeds. There was no other consideration received by either for his conveyance than the land received from the other. The court held that by this exchange the lands lost their ancestral character. The reasoning is stated as follows by White, J.: \u201cThe title mentioned in the statute is the title under which the intestate <em>immediately </em>holds. The title to these lands came to Thomas by deed of conveyance from Jacob, and the character of the consideration cannot alter the fact and make that a title by devise from the ancestor which was in fact a title by deed from. Jacob. \u201d It is true that in partition, though effected by deeds, it is held to be different; because partition acts only on the possession and not on the title. Partition does not change the character of the title. <em>Freeman </em>v. Allen, 17 Ohio St., 527; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Day, ante. </em>We are unable to see why the reasoning in <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>does not apply with equal force to the case before us. Had the conveyance been made by John to Henry in his lifetime as requested, he would have died seized of them as non-ancestral lands under the deed; for whatever previous equity he had would have been merged in the deed; and the lands would have descended to his wife under section 4159, Revised Statutes, as an absolute estate in fee simple. It is said in <em>Stemble </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>50 Ohio St. 495, 525: \u201cThe descent of real estate is controlled by the legal title; and when the legal and equitable title unite in the same person, the latter becomes merged in the former, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>does not descend separately. The legal title draws to it the whole estate, and carries it in the same channel of descent as if the equitable estate had never existed.\u201d So in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Lampson, </em>45 Ohio St., 77, the same principle was applied. There a father desiring to make an advancement to his daughter on the eve of her marriage, purchased a tract of land, paying therefor $6,000, and caused the deed to be made directly to her. On her death without children, the land was held to be non-ancestral; because the immediate title under which she held the land was the deed of the person from, whom her father purchased it. Hence John did not mistake his duty under the trust when he conveyed the lands to Henry\u2019s wife; for it was his duty to convey them, if there was any in the premises, to the person that would have inherited them, had the reconveyance been made to Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">There is no room for a question of good faith or fraud on the part of the owner of ancestral lands, in changing their character. He has, during life, the power to dispose of them as he pleases; and it is only where he does not, and dies seized of them without issue, that his brothers and sisters take any estate whatever in them. They simply take in the character of heirs and not otherwise. In Indiana it appears that the surviving wife of a deceased husband inherits one-third of his lands in fee simple, subject to the provision, that if she again intermarries, she cannot, during such marriage, alienate them; and if she dies during such subsequent marriage, the lands go to the children of the husband from whom the lands came. And in <em>Nesbitt </em>v. <em>Trindle, </em>64 Ind., 183, it was held that a widow could change the heritable character of the lands descended to her from her deceased hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>band, by a deed made without consideration to a third person, who after she had remarried, reconveyed to her. She, as the court observed, had the power, before her remarriage, to dispose of the lands as she pleased; and whether she did so for a consideration or not, was immaterial to the rights of her children by the former husband from whom she derived title; for they, as heirs, liad no vested estate in the lands, while she remained a widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The second aspect of the question on the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, arises upon the fact averred in the answer of the defendant, and found by the court to be true, that the deed made by Henry to his brother John in 1888, was made for the fraudulent purpose of hindering and delaying one Catherine Miller in the collection of any judgment she mig'ht recover against him in a contemplated bastardy proceeding; and was accepted by John to assist him in this purpose. This we think is an additional reason why the plaintiffs below are not entitled to recover. It is too well settled in this state to need the citation of many authorities, that neither a grantor nor his heirs, can have any relief in law or equity for the recovery of lands so conveyed. <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Doty, </em>16 Ohio St., 119; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>17 <em>id., </em>480; <em>Vanzant </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>6 Ohio St., 52; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>15 Ohio, 408, 431; <em>Tempner </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>18 id., 418, 422. But it is claimed that these cases do not apply here, because it is not shown or found by the court, that the Miller girl had any valid claim against him, or had in fact commenced any proceeding in bastardy. Conceding- that this is a correct construction of the finding, which is doubtful, as the finding is that the conveyance was made to defraud her out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cher just claim,\u201d still it does not help the plaintiffs below. This very question here raised was., disposed of in <em>Fridge </em>v. Andrews, 51 Ohio St., 405. It was there held that \u201cwhere an owner, during the pendency of a suit against him, and in view of a possible judgment being rendered adversely to him, conveys his property to another with intent to defeat the satisfaction of such judgment as may be recovered against him in the suit, he cannot, after judgment in such suit in his favor, have the aid of a court of equity to compel the grantee to reconvey to him the property. \u2019 \u2019 The fact that no suit is pending at the time of the conveyance cannot vary the application of the principle, where it was made to defeat the satisfaction of any claim that might be established against him. The fact of the conveyance having been made, may have dissuaded the girl from commencing any suit, just as was said in <em>Pride </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>it may have caused the party to abandon his suit, rather than enter upon the task of pursuing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The case of <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Blinn, </em>39 Ohio St., 145, much relied on, is not in point. There Norton as <em>agent </em>received from Blinn $500 to be invested in margins on wheat. He invested the money and made $395 and refused to account for the principal and what was made, on the ground that the transaction was an illegal one. The agent was required to account, on the ground that \u201cit is contrary to public policy and good morals, to permit employees, agents or servants to seize or retain the property of their principal, although it may be employed in illegal business and under their control.\u201d In the case before us the defendant below was not acting in the capacity of agent for any one. The conveyance was made to and accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>by her, in her own capacity and rig'ht; and not as a trustee, or agent to transmit the title to some one else. If the application here claimed for <em>Norton v. Blinn </em>were admitted, it would result in overruling all the decisions heretofore made, denying any relief to one, making a conveyance to hinder and delay his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The defendant below, by leave of the court, amended her answer, adding a prayer that her title to the property be quieted. We think she is entitled to the relief asked. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; and judgment for the widow quieting her title.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
