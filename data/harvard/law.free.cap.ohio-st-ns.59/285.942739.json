The petition alleges:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-17\">\u201cThat the defendant, the City of Circleville, Ohio, is a municipal corporation of the fourth grade of the second class, duly organized under the laws of the state of Ohio. That there is a certain street in said city called Court street, with sidewalks on both sides of the same, which have been constructed and maintained, upon grades established by said defendant for the use of public travel by pedestrians having occasion to travel thereon; that the said street is, and was at the date hereinafter mentioned, one of the most public streets in the said city, and that the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>sidewalk, at the points hereinafter named, was a greatly frequented place and much traveled by the general public, being within two squares of the business center of said city; that on the west side of said street, between Mound and Union streets, there is an alley called South Area alley, extending from Canal street and intersecting\u2019 said Court street at a point between the lots of G. F. Wittich and Dorothea Turney, that from a point near St. Philip\u2019s Episcopal Church to the said Court street, said alley descends and slopes rapidly, and where the same crosses said sidewalk it has a slope of at least two feet in sixteen feet, thereby making said slope dangerous for persons traveling thereon, in times when the same is covered with ice and snow; that said sidewalk at said point, crossing said alley, is constructed in a dangerous and defective manner, by reason of said unusual and abrupt slope, and having rough and uneven stones thereon, and between which there are large fissures; that the same is so constructed at said point as to have a depression or gutter in the middle, for the purpose of permitting and allowing drainage on and through said alley, from said Episcopal church, and from lots adjoining on said alley, and over said sidewalk, and emptying into a gutter running along the said Court street, between the said sidewalk and the street proper; that in times of rainfall there is a large flow of water over and through said alley at said point; and in times of freezing, the said sidewalk, at said point, becomes covered with ice from said drainage, and also from the drainage from lots adjoining on both sides of said alley, thereby making said sidewalk from all said causes aforesaid unusally dangerous to persons walking thereon;, that said alley and said sidewalk have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>remained in said condition, as to the construction thereof, for a great many years, to-wit: for at least ten years, with the full knowledge of the defendant of all the conditions aforesaid; that accidents have frequently happened at said point to persons walking on said sidewalk, by said persons slipping and falling, when the same was covered with ice and snow; that the said G. F. Wittich and the said Dorothea Turney have, with the knowledge and consent of said defendant, for a \u25a0long time prior to the injury hereinafter alleged, to-wit: for at least ten years prior thereto, and at the time said injury occurred, used said alley way as a means of drainage for their slops and surplus water, coming from their said premises, and the same has been allowed and permitted by the defendant to flow over and across said sidewalk, and into said gutter, continuously, for the said period of time aforesaid; that on or about the sixteenth day of March, A. D. 1895, and for more than a month next preceding, said defendant, with full knowledge of all the facts heretofore stated, had carelessly and negligently suffered ice, frozen snow and sleet to accumulate on said sidewalk, at said point, and the same was, at said date, dangerous to persons passing along the same, by reason of its slippery condition, and the defective condition of said sidewalk, as hereinbefore stated;' that at said date aforesaid, about eight o\u2019clock in the evening, this plaintiff was passing along the sidewalk, in the usual way, using all due care, and ignorant of its defective and dangerous and slippery condition, and while so walking she fell, and broke, fractured and sprained her right limb near the ankle joint, and ruptured the ligaments, and otherwise injured her said limb. That by reason of the injury aforesaid, she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>laid up and confined to her bed, for the period of five days, and has suffered great bodily pain and mental anguish, and was prevented for the last three months from attending to her business, and incurred about $125 expense for medical attendance and nursing, in attempting to be cured of said injuries ; and this plaintiff further avers that she is still lame and crippled from said injuries, and is only able to attend to her business by the use of her crutches; that the said injuries still exist, and that she will, as she verily believes, be and remain permanently lame, crippled and disabled from said injuries.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">By an amendment the following allegations were added to the petition:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">\u201cThat in consequence of the defective condition of the said alley, where the same crossed the said sidewalk, as it was at the time of her said injury, as described in her petition, and of the said unusual, abrupt and dangerous slope thereof at said point, and of the accumulation and flow of the water over and through said alley and across said sidewalk, from the sources and causes as averred and described in her petition, and the freezing of the said ice and snow thereon, in the defective condition of the said sidewalk at said point, at the time qf said injury so caused and brought about by the negligence of said defendant, and by the negligence of the said defendant in permitting the same to be and remain in said condition, the said plaintiff became and was injured, as described in her petition. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">The defendant answered, denying, sustantially, the alleged defective condition of the sidewalk, and all negligence on its part, and charging ihe plaintiff with contributory neglig-ence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The plaintiff controverted the allegations of contributory negligence, and upon a trial of the issues thus joined the defendant prevailed.

Her petition in effect charges the city with having been negligent in adopting the particular grade of the sidewalk that it did at that point where she fell. She has no cause of action unless this averment m her petition states one. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Northern Liberties, </em>35 Pa.

They agree that there is no responsibility unless there has been such an accumulation as will amount to an obstruction of the way which is dangerous, and they also agree that a city is not liable for the manner in which its walks and other structures and ways are planned. <em>Detroit </em>v. Beckman, 34 Mich., 125 (22 Am. R., 507); <em>Urquhart </em>v. <em>The City of Ogdensburg, </em>91 N. Y., 67; Mr. Dillon, Municipal Corporations, section 1051.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">The plaintiff alleged in her petition that there was a defective condition of the sidewalk or alley \u2022crossing. There was no evidence offered by her to show that there was any such defect whatever, unless the court should consider the grade or slope which has been testified to as a defect. <em>Bretsh </em>v. <em>The City of Toledo, </em>33 Bul., 1 Dec., 96.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT2\">It is apparent, therefore, that if the defendant in error failed to establish any direct and proximate connection between her injury and a defect in the sidewalk or crossing,, if such defect existed, that she could not have been prejudiced by the matters which we have been considering.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC2\">Mr. Rowe was a surveyor, and, as the evidence shows, an expert in the establishing of grades for street and alley crossings, and his testimony shows that the plan of the alley crossing complained of was a reasonable and proper plan to adopt and maintain, taking into consideration all of the purposes for which the same was to be and is used. If the special charge had been properly con-</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV3\">structed it would not have availed the defendant in error unless the evidence showed that her injury was caused by the defect and not by the ice. 105 N.

Klyne, 100 Penn. St., 119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">We claim that the defendant in error was guilty of such contributory negligence, as shown by the evidence, as to preclude her from recovering. Her testimony, in substance, was that she had, as a usual thing, been passing along that side of the street and over that crossing once a day for about four years. We submit that in view of that fact that if there had been such a defect in the crossing as is claimed, one that was apparent to many others who testified in her behalf, that it must have been apparent to her; that is, if it be assumed that the grade or slope of the walk which was testified to by her witnesses is a defect. Even if it be claimed that it was only dangerous when covered with snow and ice, and its dangerous condition was open, apparent, and obvious to others, it must have been so as to her, and it was her duty to have avoided the crossing. <em>Shaefler </em>v. <em>The City of Sandusky, </em>33 Ohio St., 246; <em>Village of Conneaut </em>v. <em>Louis Naef, </em>54 Ohio St., 529; <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>The City of Muscatine, </em>30 N.

The gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was the unusual and dangerous slope of this sidewalk, and the manner in which it was constructed, where the plaintiff received her injury; and whether this defective condition was caused in its original construction according to some plan or established grade, or from subsequent failure of the city to keep it in proper repair, we maintain that in either ease the city was guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">From the case of <em>Rhodes </em>v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio, 159, to <em>Zanesville </em>v. Fannan, 53 Ohio St., 605, the current of judicial decisions has been in the direction of holding municipal corporations liable for injuries resulting from their neglect in the performance of the duties imposed upon them by law. <em>Mc Combs </em>v.

Their duties to the public and to each individual member thereof, commence as soon as they have once resolved to make the improvement, and have started upon its construction. No dividing line of reponsibility is drawn between the character or method of their action in devising the plan or design of the improvement, and in the -execution of the plan or design. The maxim <em>respondeat superior </em>applies, and from start to finish it is charged with the duty of exercising reasonable care and skill in the discharge of its duties to the public. It must make its streets and sidewalks safe, and it must keep them safe for public travel. This is the polar star of its duties to the public.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">If the rule of exemption applied by the court\u2019s charge in this case, were to prevail, we submit that it would strike down the principle of law which the Supreme Court, for more than a half a century, has held to be the policy of this state, with regard to municipal corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">The corporation resolves to make or repair some needed improvements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">It makes no difference how defective the plan, how unskillful! y or negligently it was prepared, no matter how negligent the council was in failing to examine the plan itself, or in ascertaining whether the construction if made according to the plan would be safe or not; \u201cit is our plan, we adopted it, and we acted judicially, we were judges when we did so, and we laugh at your injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">And so long as the sidewalk or street, as the case may be, does not actually become out of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>pair, and thereby show negligence, the corporation is absolutely safe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-6\">The overwhelming weight of authority in other states sustained the principle that municipal corporations are liable for injuries to person or property, where such injury arises from negligence on the part of the corporation in maintaining and keeping its streets, avenues, sidewalks, alleys, public grounds and bridges within the corporation, in a reasonably safe condition-for public travel. <em>Blyhl </em>v.

Our answer is, in the first place the evidence shows that there was no smooth surface across this alley way. It was rough, ragged and uneven, as well as slippery, as the testimony of twenty witnesses will disclose if the court will take the time to read the testimony. And secondly, her own testimony discloses the fact that she was below the flagging, where the cobble stones were placed, and slipped and fell on the cobble stones. And they were a part of this pavement.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>And yet, in the face of this testimony, counsel insist that she knew the sidewalk at this point was dangerous and that she voluntarily walked into the danger, and that this case is like the one reported in 54 Ohio St., 529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">Her testimony shows that the first intimation she had of its dangerous condition, was when she stepped into the alley way and began to slip, and her first impulse then was, to try to g\u2019et out into the street, but it was too late.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">There were also other alley crossings which she passed over on her way down, and she did not slip and fall, because they were safe. It was because the defective condition of the sidewalk at this point, having ice on it, rendered it unsafe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">This testimony was competent, and was admitted. <em>Brewing Company </em>v.

It was its structural defects which caused it to become dangerous when covered with ice and snow. <em>Shaeffer </em>v. <em>Sandusky, </em>33 Ohio St., 246; <em>Village </em>v. <em>Kallagher, </em>52 Ohio St., 183; <em>Village </em>v. <em>Naef, </em>54 Ohio St., 529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">Where a plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused partly by a fall on the ice with which the road was covered,' and partly by a defect in the road itself, the city was liable for its negligence in not repairing the defect, which was the cause of the injury, even though the ice as a condition contributed to it.

The position of counsel and the charge of the court would indicate that it could, if that was its \u201cplan.\u201d <em>Railroads </em>Dayton, 23 Ohio St., 510.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-8\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlA\">The instructions given and refused by the court of common pleas for which its judgment was reversed by the circuit court, raise the question whether a municipal corporation is exonerated from liability for injuries caused by an unsafe condition of a public way under its control which it has suffered to remain after notice, when the defect arose in the execution of a plan adopted by the corporation for a local improvement. Its immunity from liability is defended here on the ground that, in the adoption of plans for local improvements, municipal bodies are in the exercise either of a legislative power, which is discretionary and not subject to judicial control, or of a judicial power, and not responsible for errors of judgement. Cases are cited in support of the proposition, some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>which place the exemption from liability on one of these grounds and some on the other; but none on both. It is said in <em>Detroit </em>v. Beckman, 34 Mich., 125, that \u2018 \u2018when complaint is made that the original plan of a public work is so defective as to render the work dangerous when completed, it is apparent that the fault is with legislative action.\u201d And in <em>Urquharty. Ogdensburg, </em>91 N. Y., 67, it is declared that the exercise of the power to make local improvements is <em>quasi </em>judicial. The courts of these states, in numerous decisions, maintain respectively these divergent views of the grounds on which municipal corporations are not liable in such cases, but concur in holding their non-liability; and on that question they are at variance with a large number of reported cases, especially of those decided by the courts of the middle and western states. In <em>Blyhl </em>v. Waterville, 57 Minn., 115, it is held that; \u201ca municipal corporation is liable for an injury caused by having an unsafe sidewalk, the condition of which is due to the plan adopted for its construction, when the city could have remedied the defect, but did not do so.\u201d And in <em>Gould </em>v. Topeka, 32 Kas., 845, the court hold that a \u201ccity has no more-right to plan or create an unsafe and dangerous condition of one of its streets than it has to plan or create a public or common nuisance.\u201d The same doctrine is maintained in Indiana, Iowa, and other states. We will not attempt a review or discussion of the cases on this subject. In their briefs, which show diligent research, counsel have collected the cases on both sides, and ably presented their different views.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Text writers on the subject, lean to the side of municipal liability in such cases. In Dillon on Municipal Corporations, vol. 2, page 1294, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>section 1024, it is said: \u201cDoes the principle that actionable negligence cannot be predica!ed of the plan itself, (post section 1046), go so far as to exempt from liability if that plan leaves the streets in an unsafe and dangerous condition for public use? In the author\u2019s opinion this question ought to be answered in the negative.\u201d And in Harris on Damages by Corporations, (vol. 1, page 165), that author says: \u201cAs to the liability of a city for damages for an injury resulting from a defective plan, the decisions are not all harmonious, but the weight of authority is now perhaps in favor of holding the city liable for defects in the plan a!s well as in the execution of the work.\u201d And see Elliott on Roads and Streets, Chap. 20; and Jones on Neg. Mun. Corp. Chap. 4, page 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">It has been held in this state, in a number of reported cases, that municipal corporations are liable for injuries caused to property abutting on streets, by changes in their grades, notwithstanding the establishment of the grade was a lawful exercise of municipal authority, and the work was done in conformity with the plan so adopted. The court recognizes that in this class of cases it has taken ground in advance of some adjudications elsewhere, and its position is maintained on principle. The doctrine established by them has since been adopted and followed in several other states. In <em>Dayton </em>v. Pease, 4 Ohio St., 80, the city of Dayton was held liable in damages for injuries to property resulting from the fall of a bridge forming part of one of its streets over a canal, where the fall was owing entirely to defects in the-plan of the bridge which had been approved by the council, and the bridge was constructed under its direction and in accordance with the plan. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the question here is not precisely the same as in that case, it is nearly so, and involves an application of the same principle. And, in view of the irreconcilable conflict of decisions elsewhere, on this question, we are at liberty to adopt such rule as will best harmonize with those of this court, and our legislation on the subject, and as to us seem most reasonable and practicable. Our statute, in express terms, places the public ways of each municipality, in its control, coupled with a positive command to keep them open, in repair, and free from nuisances. In the performance of that duty, the municipal authorities are required to remove, and keep removed from its streets, all dangerous defects, obstructions and nuisances of every kind, as they may arise, from time to time, from any cause. There is no exception from the requirement, in favor of defects, obstructions or nuisances which are placed, or caused to be placed, in a street, by the corporation or by its officers or agents; nor, is there any the less reason for holding the corporation liable for a disregard of its duty to remove such obstacles from its streets when placed there by its own act or the act of its officers, than there is for making it answerable for its negligence in permitting similar obstacles to remain when placed in the street by other persons. The statutory duty is ministerial in its nature, and mandatory in terms; and was imposed for the benefit of those having occasion to use the streets, so that they might use them with safety, and not for the benefit of the corporation; and ample means for its prompt and efficient performance are placed in the control of the corporation. While municipal legislation may be necessary in providing means and measures for the performance of the duty, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>it is with respect to many strictly ministerial duties, its performance, or the omission to perform it, is not the exercise of legislative or judicial power, nor is it discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">We are of opinion, therefore, that a municipal corporation should be held liable for injuries caused by a dangerous defect or obstruction in a street or sidewalk which it suffers to remain after reasonable notice of its existence, though it arose in the construction or alteration of the street or sidewalk in accordance with a plan adopted by the municipal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We express no opinion in regard to the weight of the evidence. There was not a total lack of evidence tending to support the issues for the plaintiff, and its sufficiency is for the jury under proper instructions, and for the lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-7\">Shauck, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
