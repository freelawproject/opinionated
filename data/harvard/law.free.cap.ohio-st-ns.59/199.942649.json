Kennedy, George F. Leick, William Leick and C. M. Vorce, assisted in procuring the passage by the legislature of the state of Ohio, of the act of March 13, 1894, 91 O. L., 64, and that of said plaintiffs, George F. and William Leick, H. Houck and John Marzell, signed the petition'presented to the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>county commissioners for the widening and improvement of said road, limiting the width thereof to one hundred (100) feet; and all the other plaintiffs signed a petition presented to the county commissioners asking that the width of the improved road be limited to eighty (80) feet. That accompanying\u2019 said petition there was filed with the said county commissioners a bond duly certified and attested, containing as the conditions thereof a recital of the substance of the said petition, and in all respects conforming to their requirements of law in such case made and provided; and that all of said -plaintiffs were present with the viewers when they made the survey, and participated in their action; that all of said plaintiffs presented claims for damages growing out of said improvement, to the said viewers, and damages were awarded by said viewers to all said plaintiffs upon such application; that the action of the viewers was approved by the county commissioners, and the road established as prayed for-under said statute at the width of one hundred (100) feet. That from the award of damages thus made, two of the plaintiffs, O. F. Rowers and H. G. Vorce, and others not plaintiffs, appealed to the probate court and had a trial in that court on the question of the damages which should be awarded to them by reason of said improvement, and in said court, were awarded greater damages than they were given by the viewers, which award in the probate court was afterwards certified to the county commissioners and approved by them, and included by them in the assessment thereafter made to defray the expenses of said improvement. Costs were made in said proceeding in the probate court to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>$629'\u2019. 63; that the costs of the proceedings down to the report of the reviewers and the order of the county commissioners approving the report and establishing the road, amounted to $583.60; that thereafter the county commissioners made an assessment to defray the costs of making said improvement in accordance with the said statute, among others upon lands owned by all of said plaintiffs respectively; that all of said plaintiffs appeared before the county commissioners and participated in the proceedings of making said assessment; that thereafter all of\u25a0 said plaintiffs except George F. Leick and William Leick excepted to said assessment on their respective lands so made by the county commissioners, and necessitated the appointment by said county commissioners under said act of March 13, A. D. 1894, of a board of equalization ; that thereafter all of said plaintiffs, except George F. Leick and William Leick, appeared before said board of equalization and participated in the equalization of said assessment made by said board of equalization; that thereafter said assessment so equalized by said board of equalization was approved by the board of county commissioners; that the costs of making said assessment before said county commissioners and by said board of equalization, amounted to $430.85; that the total expense of the said proceeding toward the making of said improvement, amounted to $1,644.08, of which sum $1,060.48 was made after the county commissioners had approved the report of the viewers, and ordered the improvement made; and that all of said expenses are included in the assessment for the costs of said improvement in said petition; that all of said costs have been paid by the county except the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>costs made in the probate court as above stated; that all of the steps and proceedings in reference to the widening and improving of said road, are in accordance with said act, and the other statutes bearing upon the cause; that nothing has been expended in grading or improving the said road. The court in addition to the foregGing facts is of the opinion that it should, and it does, take judicial notice of the fact that there is a necessity for wide and better improved roads in counties containing a city of the first class, second grade, and in the vicinity of such city than in counties containing no populous municipality ; but no evidence was permitted to be given in support of such proposition. \u201cFindings of Law.\u201d First\u2014 The appeal in this case to the circuit court vacated the entire decree in the common pleas court; <em>Second </em>\u2014 -That plaintiffs are estopped from asserting the uneonstitutionality of said act of March 13, 1894; <em>Third </em>\u2014 That the law in question is constitutional, the classification as to roads made by it is just and not illusory, reasonable and not arbitrary, judicious and not unnecessary; that the whole amount of said assessment was legally assessable upon the lands fronting upon said road, it is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the interlocutory injunction heretofore allowed herein be, and is dissolved; that the petition herein be dismissed, and that defendants recover of plaintiffs their costs herein to be taxed, to collect which execution, as of a judgment at law is awarded them, and that plaintiffs pay their own costs herein.

In the first, it was held that signing a petition for the improvement estopped the petitioners from qhestioning the constitutionality of the act. <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Sohl, </em>44 Ohio St., 479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">In the second case, it was held that voting at the election of the commissioners, estopped from questioning\u2019 the constitutionality of the act, even though afterwards the voter remonstrated against the improvement. <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Slyh, </em>44 Ohio St., 484; <em>Treasurer </em>v.

Potter, 18 Ohio St., 85; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Judges, </em>21 Ohio St., 1; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Capeler, </em>39 Ohio St., 207; <em>Hart </em>v.

TFbf\u00f3cr, 37 Minn., 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-6\">First of all, the classification in the statute in question is based upon the classification of municipalities within its borders. After considerable question and many doubts, it seems to be now set-tied that proper classification of municipalities by population is valid. <em>Ohio ex rel. </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>29 Ohio St., 102; <em>State </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>38 Ohio St., 54; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>39 Ohio St., 653; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>43 Ohio St., 98; aff. 15 Bull., 66; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>44 Ohio St., 98; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>44 Ohio St., 137; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>48 Ohio St., 211; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>55 Ohio St., 1; <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>55 Ohio St., 82; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>55 Ohio St., 117; <em>Dietz </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>55 Ohio St., 645; <em>Seifert </em>v. <em>Weidner, </em>12 O. C. C., 1; -5 C. D., 506; aff. 55 Ohio St., 646.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">This right to classify municipalities does not-rest, as has been sometimes stated, merely upon the clause in the constitution relating to the classification of municipalities, but rather rests upon the general right and duty of the legislature to properly classify the subjects of legislation. <em>Haskell </em>v. Burlington, 30 Ia., 232; <em>Iowa R. R. Land Co. </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>39 Ia., 112; <em>Wheeler </em>v. Philadelphia, 77 Pa. St., 338; <em>Kilgore </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>85 Pa.

This is fairly well answered by the cases above cited from Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which lay down the right to classify by population as applicable to all political subdivisions of the state. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Archibald, </em>52 Ohio St., 1; <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Polk, </em>92 Ia., 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-9\">Such classification as to roads has also been specifically upheld by this court. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Turnpike Co., </em>37 Ohio St., 481.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-10\">So an act was held constitutional authorizing cities of the first class, third grade, to borrow money and issue bonds to buy territory and rig\u2019ht of way, sink and buy natural gas wells and gas works and lay pipes and supply the city with natural gas. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>48 Ohio St., 112; <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Sioux City, </em>91 Ia., 190; <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>New Brunswick, </em>47 N.

Section 26, article 2 of the constitution. <em>Hixson </em>v. <em>Bur</em>son, 54 Ohio St., 470; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Davisi </em>55 Ohio St., 15. The act is, therefore, unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">All of the plaintiffs in error signed the petition to the commissioners asking for the widening and improving of said road ; all of them were present with the viewers when they made the survey, and participated in their action; all presented claims for damages growing out of said improvement, and damages were awarded to all but never paid; and all appeared before the county commissioners and participated in the proceedings for making an assessment on the lands abutting on the road or benefited thereby. Some of the plaintiffs in error assisted in procuring the passage of the special act, some of them appealed to the probate court, and some caused a board of equalization to be appointed, and by reason of all the proceedings thus had, costs accrued to the amount of $1,644.08, and the plaintiffs in error were not only seeking to have the entire act declared unconstitutional, but to prevent an assessment upon the abutting and benefited lands to pay these costs so incurred by' reason of the affirmative action taken by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The costs having been incurred upon proceedings invoked by them, and actively participated in by them, they are now estopped from defeating an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>assessment upon the lands for their payment. <em>Tone </em>v. Columbus, 39 Ohio St., 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The court finds that nothing has been expended in grading or improving the road, and as parties \u00e1re not estopped from questioning the constitutionality of a special act by them procured to be passed, as to such matters as yet remain to be done in the future under the act, it follows that a perpetual injunction should be granted as prayed for, except as to the $1,648.08 costs already incurred, for the payment of which an assessment on the abutting and benefited lands should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>] Judgment of the circuit court r&amp;oersed and judgment modified.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-7\">Minshall, J., dissents as to the first proposition of the syllabus.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
