While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>both deeds recite that a deed was also executed and delivered for lands in Franklin county, it appears that the deed for the Franklin county lands was never executed or delivered, and there is nothing to show whether Mr. Jones had any lands in Franklin county or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">On the fifteenth day of October, 1897, The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company' filed the following application in the probate court of Delaware county :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">\u201cAnd now comes The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, a corporation, and represents to the court that it is a creditor to said John W. Jones; that on or about January 19, 1897, the said John W. Jones, then a resident of Delaware county, Ohio, made, executed an assignment to James W. Gallant, Stephen C. Thomas and Charles M. Wambaugh, as trustees of all of his real estate in trust for the benefit of his creditors, said assignment being made by three deeds, each bearing date January 19, 1897. One of said deeds conveying to said trustees real estate in Delaware county, Ohio, another of said deeds conveying real \u00abstate in Marion county, Ohio, and another of said deeds conveying real estate in Franklin county, Ohio. That said deeds of assignment were delivered to said trustees and were filed for record respectively in the recorder\u2019s office of Marion, Delaware and Franklin county, Ohio, for record on or about January 19, 1897. That neither said deeds of assignment nor any copy thereof has been filed in the probate court of Delaware county, Ohio, wherein said John W. Jones resided, at the date of the execution of said assignment, though more than ten (10) days have passed after the execution of the same, and have failed to give bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>for more than ten (lOj days after the execution of said deeds of assignment to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">Wherefore, The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, a corporation and a creditor as aforesaid, asks the court to make and enter an order removing said trustees, and to appoint a trustee in their place to administer said trust under the Statutes of Ohio, relating to insolvent debtors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">The grantees in said deed filed a demurrer to this application which was overruled and exceptions taken, and thereupon they filed the following answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">\u201cAnd now come the trustees named in the application herein filed, and for their answer herein say, that they admit that The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company is a creditor of the said John W. Jones, but they deny that said John W. Jones executed a deed of assignment on the nineteenth day of January, A. D. 1897, or at any other time, but on the contrary, they say that said John W. Jones made deeds of trusts at the time named for certain lands and tenements for the purpose of paying all his creditors alike without preference or priority, and that they accepted said trust, and have ever since been and are still proceeding to execute said trust under the control and direction of the court of common pleas of Delaware county, Ohio, and they deny all other allegations of said application not herein admitted to be true.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-8\">The matter was heard in the probate court and the two deeds were introduced in evidence, and the court found that Mr. Jones, at the time of making said deeds, was a resident of Delaware county, that The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company was and is a creditor of Mr. Jones, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that neither said deeds nor copies thereof were filed in the probate court of Delaware county within ten days after the execution and delivery of said deeds to said trustees, that the said trustees, being the grantees named in said deeds, did not file in the probate court within ten days after the execution and delivery of said deeds their bond for the faithful discharge of their duties as trustees. And thereupon the probate court rendered judgment in favor of the said application and removed said trustees and appointed a trustee to execute said trust, treating said two deeds as a general assignment of said John W. Jones for the benefit of his creditors, which said trustee accepted the trust and gave bond according to law and entered upon the discharge of his duties. The grantees in said deed excepted to the ruling of the probate court and filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and they also took a bill of exceptions setting out all the evidence that was offered on the hearing, and filed a petition in error in the court of common pleas to reverse the judgment of the probate court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">The court of common pleas affirmed the judgment of the probate court, and thereupon James W. Gallant and Stephen C. Thomas refused to prosecute the case further. And Charles M. Wambaugh, trustee, filed a petition in error in the circuit court seeking to reverse the judgments of the lower courts, and made said James W. Gallant and Stephen C. Thomas defendants in error. The circuit court affirmed the judgments, and thereupon Mr. Wambaugh as trustee filed a petition in error in this court, still joining said James W. Gallant and Stephen C. Thomas as defendants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>error, seeking to reverse the judgments of the courts below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-5\"><em>Powell c&amp; Minaban </em>and <em>John A. </em>Gone, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">We claim that the jurisdiction of the probate court in such cases depends upon two facts : First, that the debtor is insolvent; and, second, that he has made a voluntary assignment in trust for the benefit of his creditors. Neither of these facts appeared in the pleading\u2019s or evidence offered in this ease. The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, in support of its application, presented to the probate court the two deeds of trust hereinbefore referred to. This did not give the court jurisdiction in the premises. The probate court is only authorized to act when a regular deed of assignment has been presented to it executed by an insolvent debtor in trust for the benefit of his creditors. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">In this application there was no claim made that John W. Jones was insolvent or that this deed of trust was made in contemplation of insolvency or that he undertook to prefer some creditors, or to hinder and delay others. These deeds of trust specifically direct the three trustees to take possession of the property described and to sell the same at public or private sale upon such terms as the trustees may think proper and distribute the proceeds in the manner provided for in the deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-8\">It is not within the power of the probate court to change the character of these instruments. That can only be done by the court of common pleas. It can only be done by petition filed charging that the instruments were fraudulent as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>creditors and having them declared to be deeds of assignment for the benefit of all creditors alike.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">These deeds were drafted after forms which have been approved by this court in several cases, especially in the cases of <em>Hoffman et al. </em>v. <em>Mackell et </em>al., 5 Ohio St., 124; <em>Conklin et al. </em>v. <em>Coonrod &amp; </em>Crum, 6 Ohio St., 612; <em>Floyd et al. </em>v. Smith, 9 Ohio St., 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">The probate court would have power under these sections (6343, 6344) to appoint a trustee only after a court of competent jurisdiction had declared the instruments to be void as fraudulent against creditors. <em>Spoors </em>v. Coen, 44 Ohio St., 497.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-8\"><em>Sayler &lt;&amp; Sayler; J. D. Van Deman </em>and <em>Wolford c&amp; </em>Crissinger, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">In order to fully comprehend the force and effect of the present statutes of Ohio relating to assignments for the benefit of creditors, as contained in chapter 4 section 6335, etc., Revised Statutes, of Ohio, it will be profitable to review the history of the assignment laws of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-10\">Prior to the act of April 6, 1859 (56 Yol. Statutes, 231; 4 Curwen\u2019s Statutes, 3352), there was no general act regulating the mode of administering assignments in trust for the benefit of creditors in Ohio. Under the constitution of 1802, and at the time when there was no probate court existing in Ohio, the legislature passed laws directing the mode of proceeding in chancery. One of the early acts thus passed was that of February 23, 1835, found in 1 Curwen\u2019s Revised Statutes, of Ohio, 161; 1 Swan &amp; Critchfield, 712, and note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-11\">That act was supplanted in 1838 by section 3, found in 1 Curwen\u2019s Statutes, 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>After the adoption of the constitution, of 1851 the legislature passed an act on March 14, 1853; 3 Curwen\u2019s Statutes, 2239; <em>Mitchell </em>v. Gazzam, 12 Ohio, 336.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">The only difference between the act of 1853 and the acts of 1835 and 1838 is the fact that the act of 1853 drops out the reference to the court of chancery, and places the jurisdiction \u201c subject to the control of the courts.\u201d In 1853, therefore, the cqmmon pleas court took jurisdiction under that section of the act, the probate court not having jurisdiction over assignment matters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">On April 6, .1859, the legislature passed an act regulating the mode of administering assignments in trust for the benefit of creditors, 56 Vol. Statutes, 231; 4 Curwen\u2019s Statutes, 3352; 3 Am., and Eng.

Sharp, </em>31 Ohio St., 611; see note in 3 Curwen\u2019s Statutes, 2239.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">That the probate court now has complete jurisdiction under chapter 4 of title 2, sections 6332 <em>et seq., </em>Revised Statutes there can be no doubt. It is no longer an open question in Ohio. This jurisdiction in the probate court is exclusive of all other courts, except as is provided in section 6344 and also, except under section 6351, Revised Statutes (amended in 93 Ohio L., 132). See also for jurisdiction of probate court section 6335 Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">Under section 6336 the probate court acquires jurisdiction to compel an assignee to file the assignment, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-9\">This act is a special act made especially applicable to assignments for creditors, and being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>special act it becomes exclusive and deprives all other courts of jurisdiction of such deeds, and therefore outsets the common pleas court from the jurisdiction which it had of assignment matters prior to the act of April 6, 1859 (4 Curwen, 3352). <em>Betz </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>48 Ohio St., 492; <em>Lindeman </em>v. <em>Ingham, </em>36 Ohio St., 1; <em>Blandy </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>42 Ohio St., 295; <em>Sayler </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>45 Ohio St., 141; <em>Clapp et al. </em>v. <em>Banking Co. et al., </em>50 Ohio St., 528; <em>McNeill, Assig. </em>v. <em>Hagerty, Auditor, </em>51 Ohio St., 255; <em>Havens et al. v.

Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The insurance company claims that the conveyances are in legal effect an assignment to trustees for the benefit of creditors, while the plaintiff in error claims that the conveyances do not constitute such an assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">All conveyances made to a trustee in contemplation of insolvency, or made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, are assignments under the provisions of sections 6343 and 6344, Revised Statutes, as they stood before the amendment of April 26, 1898, and are to be administered as such. A conveyance in trust may therefore be an assignment when made in contemplation of insolvency. Can it be an assignment when not made in contemplation of insolvency?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>While sections 6343 and 6344 provide that conveyances made in contemplation of insolvency with intent to prefer one or more creditors, or made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, shall be held to be general assignments, and shall inure to the equal benefit of all creditors, these sections do not provide what shall constitute an assignment when not made in contemplation of insolvency, and not with the wrongful intent mentioned in said sections; and we have no statute in this state defining what shall constitute a general assignment for the benefit of creditors. The statutes on the subject of such assignments assume that it is known what constitutes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and treat the subject from that standpoint. Whatever constitutes an assignment for the benefit of creditors at common law, will be held to be an assignment under our statutes, and in some respects our statutes are broader than the common law, but never narrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">At common law any person of sound mind could make an assignment of his property to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors. 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law., 2d ed., 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">And such assignment could be made at common law by a person fully solvent. <em>Hunter </em>v. Ferguson, 3 Col. Appeals, 287; <em>Ogden </em>v. Peters, 21 N. Y., 23; <em>Angell </em>v. Rosenbury, 12 Mich., 241; <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Mud</em>ldrow, 18 S. W. Reporter, 55; <em>Penzel Company </em>v. Jett, 54 Ark., 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The form of the instrument making the conveyance is not material. Any instrument which transfers the property to a trustee in trust for the benefit of creditors, constitutes an assignment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>common law. In such cases the conveyance is in tr\u00fast for the benefit of others, and such trust characterizes the transaction as an assignment, rather than as a simple conveyance. It has been held that the form of the instrument is immaterial when the conveyance is made in contemplation of insolvency, and we hold the same to be true when the conveyance is made by a person fully solvent. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Hennick, 52 </em>Ohio St., 177, 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The deeds in question in this case conveyed the property to trustees in trust for the benefit of creditors and therefore, in legal effect, they constitute an assignment, even though Mr. Jones may have been fully solvent at the time of the making and delivering of the deeds. Whether he was then solvent or not does not fully appear in the record, but for the purposes of this case he is regarded as solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">A.s said deeds in legal effect constitute an assignment, it is clear that under section 6335, Revised Statutes, it was the duty of the trustees to file the deeds, or copies thereof, in the probate court of Delaware county, where Mr. Jones resided, within ten days, as required by that section of the statute, which reads as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u201cWhen any person, partnership, association or corporation, shall make an assignment to a trustee of any property, money, rights or credits, in trust for the benefit of creditors, it shall be the duty of said assignee, within ten days after the delivery of the assignment to him, and before disposing of any property so assigned to appear before the probate judge of the county in which the assignor resided at the time of executing the said assignment, produce the original assignment, or a copy thereof, cause the same to be filed in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>bate court, and enter into a bond, payable to the state, in such sum and with such sureties as shall be approved by the court, conditioned for the faithful performance, by said assignee, of his duties according to law; and the court may require the assignee, or any trustee subsequently appointed, to execute an additional undertaking whenever the interests of the creditors of the assignor demand the same; any such assignment shall take effect only from the time of its delivery to the probate judge, and the exact time of such delivery shall be indorsed thereon by the probate judge, who shall immediately note the filing on the journal of the court; and it may be delivered by the assignor to the probate judge either before or after its delivery to the assignee. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The public policy established by this section regards a man who places his property into the hands of a trustee for the benefit of. his creditors, and thereby deprives himself of the power of using his property for that purpose, the same as dead as to such property, and the trust a public one in which the state is interested, because the state is always interested to see that creditors receive their just dues. Therefore, the state requires that such a trust shall be administered, under the direction of its courts, and bonds are required of the trustee for the faithful performance of his duties as such trustee, that is for the faithful administration of the trust. The trustees in this case, having failed for more than ten days to file the said deeds, or copies thereof, in the probate court, it became the duty of that court to remove said trustees and appoint others as provided in section 6336, Revised Statutes, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201cIf any such assignment or a copy thereof shall, for ten days after the execution of the assignment, not be filed in the probate court as aforesaid, or if the assignee named thereon fail for that time to give bond as aforesaid, the court shall, on the application of the assignor, or of any of his creditors, make an order removing such assignee and appoint a trustee in his place: provided, that if more than one assignee be named in the assignment, and some of them fail as aforesaid, the court may permit the assignee or assignee's complying with the preceding section to qualify and enter upon the discharge of the duties of the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The deeds were not m ade in contemplation of insolvency, with intent to prefer one or more creditors, nor with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, and therefore no action is required in the court of common pleas as provided in section 6344, Revised Statutes, as it stood before the amendment of April 26, 1898. The object of the action provided for in that section is to set aside a fraudulent conveyance and ascertain the trust, and declare it \u25a0to inure to the equal benefit of all creditors. Here the deeds themselves declare the trust to be for the equal benefit of all creditors, and there is no action necessary to establish that which the deeds have already established. The effort here is not to set aside a conveyance, but to have the conveyance executed according to its terms, and administered under the orders and supervision of the probate court. All parties concede the deeds to be valid, and the only controversy is as to the manner of executing the trust thereby created.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Before the passage of the act of April 6, 1859, entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the mode of administering\u2019 assignments in trust for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>creditors,\u201d 56 Ohio Laws, 231., S. &amp; C., 709, such trusts were administered in the court of common pleas, which might under former statutes require security of the trustees for the faithful execution of the trust, or remove them and appoint others as justice might require. See act of March 14, 1853 51 Ohio Laws, 463, S. &amp; C., 712, <em>Note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">By the act of April 6, 1859, the jurisdiction in matters of assignment was vested exclusively in the probate court, where it has ever since remained and now the court of common pleas has no jurisdiction in matters of assignments, except as provided in sections 6344 and 6351, Revised Statutes, and therefore the cases of <em>Hoffman </em>v. Mackall, 5 Ohio St., 124 ; <em>Conkling </em>v. Coonrod, 6 Ohio St., 612, and <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Ohio St., 546, are not applicable here, because they all arose and were decided before the probate court obtained jurisdiction of assignment matters, and while such jurisdiction was exercised by the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The deeds in the above cases of <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Mackall, </em>and <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Coonrod, </em>were very much like the deeds in the case at bar, and they were treated as assignments by the parties and by the court, and the effort in those cases was to set aside the conveyances as fraudulent, and not to execute the conveyances as is the case here. The conveyances in both cases were upheld as valid and no question was made as to the manner of administering the trust, as it had then to be administered in the court of common pleas, the probate court not yet having acquired jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The above case of <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>was an action by Mr. Smith, to whom a transfer of personal property\" had been made-in trust, against the sheriff who had taken the property in execution in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>suit against the assignor, the sheriff claiming the transfer to be fraudulent and void. The question was as to the validity of the transfer, and the transfer was sustained. No question was made as to the manner of executing the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">For the reason that the probate court had not then acquired jurisdiction, and the further reason that the questions presented and decided were entirely different from the questions in this case, those cases are not applicable here, and throw no light upon the questions involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">&lt; All assignments, or copies thereof, are required by section 6335, to be filed in the probate court, and it has been urged that before such filing can be legally required, there must be an adjudication in the court of common pleas to the effect that the deeds in question constitute an assignment. That adjudication is not necessary and is not required by any provision . of the statute. The probate court having jurisdiction in matters of assignment, can determine that question itself upon the application of the assignor or a creditor, subject to a review on error in the higher courts as was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">It is contended by counsel for plaintiff in error that the deeds of conveyance vested the title to the lands in the trustees, and that their removal and the appointment of a trustee by the probate court cannot have the effect to vest title in such trustee, and that a purchaser from such trustee would not take a good title. This contention is not sound. It was said in <em>McNeill </em>v. Hagrty, Auditor, 51 Ohio St., 255, 263, that in such cases the legal title follows the order of the court and vests in the trustee appointed by the probate court. In this case the title vested in the trustees under the deed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>trust for the creditors, and such trust is under the jurisdiction and control of the probate court, and certainly the removal of the trustee by the order of the probate court, and the appointment of another trustee has the legal effect, when a sale is made and confirmed by the court, and deed executed and delivered by the new trustee, to divest the legal title out of the original trustees, and vest the same in the purchaser as a good and indefeasible title. Such being the case, the purchaser will take a good title.</p>\n<p id=\"ABX\">A persistent effort has been made by counsel for the insurance company to have this case disposed of on technical points of practice, without reaching the merits of the controversy between the parties, but we regard the points raised as not well taken, and have considered the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
