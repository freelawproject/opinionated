And this gas plant was continued and operated with considerable profit at times until the latter part of the year 1898, when the city council, with the approval of the board of improvements and board of gas trustees, entered into a contract to sell the gas plant together with a franchise to use the streets, alleys and public grounds of the city by the purchaser, for the purpose of continuing and carrying on the business of supplying natural gas to the city and its citizens, the same as had been previously done by the city itself. Thereupon A. W. Thompson and Thomas Kelly, citizens and tax-payers requested the city solicitor to apply to the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>court for an injunction to restrain the city from so selling and disposing of its gas plant. The city solicitor refused to commence such action, and thereupon Mr. Thompson and Mr. Kelly, on behalf of the city of Findlay, commenced this action against the mayor and the city council, naming them individually, to restrain the execution of said contract. The defendants demurred to the petition and the court of common pleas sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition. The cause was appealed to the circuit court, and that court also sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition. Thereupon a petition in error was filed in this court seeking to reverse the judgments of the courts below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>George II. Phelps, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-7\">The statute (Sec. 1777-8) is remedial; for the benefit and protection of the city and her citizens, against excesses by and on the part of her various municipal agencies; and the prompt application for the injunctive remedy is to be commended rather than discouraged. <em>Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Elyria, </em>57 Ohio St., 383; 29 Ohio St., 291; 26 Ohio St., 625; <em>Lutman </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>56 Ohio St., 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-8\">Both the city, herself, and all her agencies, are alike subject to the settled rule respecting all power derived from legislative enactment. They possess such power, and such only as is expressly conferred, and such as is incidental or implied, as being necessary to carry into effect those powers which are expressly granted ; and doubtful, claims to power are resolved against them. <em>Ravenna </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>45 Ohio St., 121; <em>Markley </em>v. <em>Mineral City, </em>58 Ohio St., 439; <em>City of Wellston </em>v. <em>Morgan, ante </em>147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The general powers of cities and villages in Ohio, including that to take, hold and dispose of property, for the use of the city, is conferred by the Revised' Statutes, section 1692,' in its various subdivisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\">Subdivision 34 of that section, is that relating to the power of the city generally to take, hold, sell, lease and dispose of property, for the use of the corporation.

This was not in the nature of a speculation, but was disposing of property which the city did not desire to longer hold or use, and the statute just quoted clearly gives the city the power to make such sale whenever in the judgment of the officers of the city it becomes for the best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>of such city. The petition does not claim that there was any fraud or improper motive in the proceedings to sell the gas plant, but everything was in good faith, and in the judgment of the officers of the city, for the best interests of the municipality. It is therefore clear that the city has the right and power to make such sale, and that' the judgments of the courts below in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the petition were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
