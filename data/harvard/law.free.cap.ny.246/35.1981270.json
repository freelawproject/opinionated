Assessors, 135 N. Y. 245; <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 N. Y. 330; <em>Kain </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>141 N. Y. 144.) The petition alleges the illegality of the assessment \u201c nine and one-half miles of railroad $26,000 \u201d and specifies the grounds of the illegality of such assessment. <em>(Matter of Corwin </em>v. <em>Assessors, </em>135 N.

Co. </em>v. <em>Budlong, </em>25 App. Div. 373.) The allegations of the petition as to overvaluation are sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari to review the assessment of the relator\u2019s property on the ground of overvaluation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>10 N. Y. Supp. 295; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feitner, </em>95 N. Y. Supp. 10; <em>Parmenter </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>135 N. Y. 190; <em>People ex rel. N. Y. C. R. R.

The allegations of the petition are sufficient to raise the question of inequality. <em>(People ex rel. Ward </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>230 N. Y. 339; <em>People ex rel. N. Y. C. R. R.

Sutphen </em>v. <em>Feitner, </em>45 App. Div. 542; <em>People ex rel. Grossman </em>v. <em>Goldfogle, </em>219 App. Div. 68.) The statute requires that the instances in which inequality exists and the extent thereof be stated. <em>(People ex rel. O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>188 App. Div. 485; <em>People ex rel. American Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, etc., </em>104 Misc. Rep. 703.) Failure to state in the petition the matters required by the statute constitutes a jurisdictional defect. <em>(People ex rel. O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>188 App. Div. 485; <em>People ex rel.

Co. </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>210 App. Div. 865; <em>People ex rel. Sutphen </em>v. <em>Feitner, </em>45 App. Div. 542.) The complaint or statement filed with the assessors failed to state the grounds of illegality, the extent of overvaluation, or the instances and extent of inequality. <em>(National Bank of Chemung </em>v. <em>City of Elmira, </em>53 N. Y. 49; <em>Matter of N. Y., O. &amp; W. R. Co., </em>155 App. Div. 866; <em>People ex rel. Soeurbee, Inc., </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>179 App. Div. 748; 222 N. Y. 657.) The objection sought to be raised as to the assessment of the railroad belonging to the Dexter Sulphite Pulp and Paper Company is insufficient both as stated in the complaint and as stated in the petition, to present a question for review in this proceeding. <em>(People ex rel. Dunkirk &amp; Fredonia Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Cassity, </em>46 N. Y. 46; <em>People ex rel. Buffalo &amp; State Line Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>48 N. Y. 70; <em>Young Women\u2019s C. Assn. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>220 N. Y. 365.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-6\">Pound, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB2\">The Supreme Court at Special Term made an order denying a motion to quash a writ of certiorari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>herein, issued on the application of appellant to review tax assessments of its property for illegality, overvaluation and inequality, holding, however, that the petition on which the writ was issued was insufficient to raise the question of overvaluation. The Appellate Division reversed the order and granted the motion to quash on the ground that the petition was insufficient and inadequate even to raise the question of inequality.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>Illegality. </em>The assessors entered on their tax roll: \u201c Dexter Company, 9^&gt; miles of Railroad, $26,000.00.\u201d If this is an assessment of real property alone it is legal. If it includes an assessment of rolling stock, such property should be assessed elsewhere as personal property <em>(Hoyle </em>v. <em>Plattsburgh &amp; Montreal R. R. Co., </em>54 N. Y. 314, 320) in the town where relator\u2019s principal office for the transaction of business is located. The assessment applies to a private railroad and the word does not mean such railroads as are operated by public service corporations for the transportation of persons or property. The statutory definition of \u201c railroad \u201d in the Public Service Commission Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 48, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 6) includes equipment but the Tax Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 60, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 6) while it includes all railroad structures, etc., in the definition of land and real property, does .not include equipment. As to the general meaning of the term, authorities differ. Cases hold that it includes all the property of a railroad, as the law treats the railroad and its appurtenances and equipment as one entire thing. Others cling to the dictionary definition a road for cars, not including the rolling stock. (See Words &amp; Phrases, 1st and 2d series.) Circumstances alter cases. A railroad considered as a public utility is a unit, made up of real and personal property, but relator is not a railroad company. The presumption of regularity of official action permits the conclusion that the word <em>\u201c </em>railroad \u201d as here used by the assessors implies real estate as defined in the Tax Law and does not include equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>Overvaluation. </em>The complaint and petition enumerate many parcels of relator\u2019s land which it asserts are overvalued. The assessed value is given but the true value is not given. This is inadequate. Tax Law, section 290, requires the petition to state <em>\u201c </em>the extent of such overvaluation.\u201d The extent of overvaluation, which may be trifling or excessive, is omitted. <em>(People ex rel. City of New York </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>237 N. Y. 332, 335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><em>Inequality. \u201c </em>The instances in which * * * inequality exists, and the extent thereof \u201d (Tax Law, \u00a7 290) are stated in the petition as follows: <em>\u201c </em>the property of your petitioner is assessed at more than its full and true value while the real property belonging to property owners and occupants thereof, other than your petitioner, is assessed at not more than 25 to 40 per cent of full and true value.\u201d This is sufficient. <em>(People ex rel. Ward </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>230 N. Y. 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The petition nowhere states the value of relator\u2019s land or the amount of overvaluation. It appears, however, that the assessments of. its property are for more than the true and full value thereof and that all the other property in the town is assessed at from 25 to 40 per cent of its true and full value. Inadequacy is thus alleged as the rule to which relator is the sole exception. The petition meets the requirement of the Tax Law by showing \u201c that the assessment has been made at a higher proportionate valuation than the assessment of other property on the same roll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the order of Special Term denying the motion to quash the writ affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Crane, Lehman, Kellogg and O\u2019Brien, JJ., concur; Andrews, J., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
