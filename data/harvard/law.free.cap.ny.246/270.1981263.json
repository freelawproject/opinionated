Judgment was entered thereon; that defendant herein refused and failed to defend the Tanenbaum action; that plaintiffs instituted this action to recover the amount of the judgment recovered against them by the landlord, Johanna Tanenbaum, for the cost of installing the sprinkler system, together with a reasonable counsel fee incurred by the plaintiffs in defending the Tanenbaum action.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The answer puts in issue the allegations in the complaint that defendant was obligated by the terms of its lease to install the sprinkler system; that it made the place more injurious by the conduct of its business; and that it was bound by the Tanenbaum judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Plaintiffs moved to strike out the defendant\u2019s answer and for summary judgment on the pleadings, which motion was granted at Special Term, the order directing, however, the assessment of plaintiffs\u2019 damages by a jury. Both the plaintiffs and defendant appealed from the order of the Special Term, and the Appellate Division modified it by granting judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of the judgment recovered against them in the Tanenbaum action.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The respondents contend that the defendant was obligated to install the sprinkler system under the terms of its lease with the plaintiffs and was bound by the judgment in the Tanenbaum action on being properly \" vouched in,\u201d and that the question as to whether the defendant was using the premises for purposes more dangerous than those stipulated in the lease, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Appellant first contends the defendant\u2019s lease does not cover the installation of a sprinkler system in any event; that the specific reference to a sprinkler system in clause (b) above, by implication excludes such system from the operation of clause (a). On the question of the proper construction of the lease in this regard, we are in accord with the decision below in including such system in paragraph (a). By its terms, the defendant lessee agrees to execute and comply with all orders of the city of New York or its governmental departments which are <em>\u201c </em>applicable to the demised premises \u201d whether the charge or expense is ordinary or extraordinary. Nothing suggests that this agreement applies to all orders except an order requiring the installation of an automatic sprinkler system. The clause (b) relative to repairs, alterations and modifications of the sprinkler system ordered by the New York Board of Fire Underwriters or the New York Fire Insurance Exchange does not become operative until the system is installed. The two clauses relate to two distinct situations and are to be read disjunctively and not as excepting the sprinkler system from the operation of the first clause. Words of general description do not follow words of particular description in relation to the same subject-matter and the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The question remains, however, whether the order is <em>\u201c </em>applicable to the demised premises \u201d (the basement) within the reasonable construction of the lease. Parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>may make their own bargains and they should be held to the terms of their agreement, but in ascertaining the fair intent and meaning of the lease we may not overlook the fact that the entire rental of the basement for the short term of three years is $4,500, and that the cost of installation is more than one-half of that amount; that it is alleged that plaintiffs had been notified to install the sprinkler system prior to the time when defendant took possession of the premises; that the complaint itself contains an allegation from which it may be inferred that the order was due to defendant\u2019s more hazardous use of the premises and that defendant denies this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Whether the sprinkler system was ordered because the character of defendant\u2019s occupancy of the premises made them more dangerous or because the safety of the entire premises required such installation is thus at issue in this action. We cannot say that this is an immaterial question and that as a matter of law the order of the fire department was <em>\u201c </em>applicable to the demised premises \u201d alone, merely because the sprinkler system was installed in the basement. Location is not the governing consideration. It may be that the order is applicable to the entire premises when fairly considered. We seek the intention of the parties, not as . much from the letter of the lease as from a reasonable construction of their agreement, having in mind the rent payable, the terms of the lease, the nature of the construction required, the relative benefit thereof to the respective parties, and what the parties had in contemplation when they executed this agreement. <em>(Second U. C. R. Corp. </em>v. <em>Price &amp; Schumacher Co., </em>242 N. Y. 120.) If the order is applicable to the safety of the entire premises defendant ought not to pay therefor. If it is applicable to conditions existing in the basement alone defendant should be held hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">This is an action on a judgment. Plaintiffs have been held liable to their landlord for the cost of installing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sprinkler system. Defendant, if liable over to the plaintiffs therefor, should be concluded by the judgment against plaintiffs of which it had notice and an opportunity to defend. If it is not thus , liable over to the plaintiffs herein, the question of its liability was not adjudicated in the former action and it is not concluded by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The rule which governs liability where a third party has been <em>\u201c </em>vouched in \u201d is thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * The theory of the rule that a party who is liable over and has notice and an opportunity to defend an action is bound by the judgment is not limited to cases of direct liability or suretyship, or those where the liability is predicated upon the same contract or duty. The rule is based on sound public policy in order that different judicial decisions may not be made on the same state of facts, and to prevent the same questions being Htigated over and over in different suits, and it applies where any privity exists between the parties by which one is liable over to another. It is not essential that the party who is ultimately liable shall be Hable on the same contract or could have been held liable in the former action, or that he shall be directly a party to the transaction by which the person to whom he is Hable over becomes obHgated; it is sufficient that between him and the party sued, the duty for a violation of which the action is brought rests primarily upon him, and that the material facts have been Htigated in the former action of which he had notice and an opportunity to defend.\u201d <em>(Prescott </em>v. <em>LeConte, </em>83 App. Div. 482, 490; affd., 178 N. Y. 585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The question whether the provision of defendant\u2019s lease is appHcable to the basement as distinguished from the entire premises leased by plaintiffs was not litigated and determined in the previous action. The court must determine in this action whether, as between the parties hereto, the duty of instaHing the sprinkler system rests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>primarily on defendant before defendant can be held bound by the determination of the Tanenbaum action.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and plaintiffs\u2019 motion denied, with costs in all courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Crane, Andrews, Lehman, Kellogg and O\u2019Brien, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
