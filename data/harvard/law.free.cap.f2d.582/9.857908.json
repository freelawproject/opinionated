On cross motions for summary judgment the district court entered an order pursuant to section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award. This is an appeal by Markle from the adverse district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The collective bargaining agreement between Markle and the Union established the standard for the arbitrator\u2019s review of the Company\u2019s decisions. Markle contends that the arbitrator erred in his interpretation of the standard mandated by the agreement. Article IX, Section 4, of the agreement reads in pertinent part: \u201cIf the Arbitrator finds that the Company had substantial reason for arriving at its decision and for taking action in any matter before him then the Company\u2019s decision and/or action shall stand.\u201d Markle argues that \u201csubstantial reason\u201d defines a standard analogous to the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard employed by United States Courts of Appeal in reviewing decisions of the National Labor Relations Board under section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). Under this view the arbitrator could not disturb the Company\u2019s decisions unless he found them unsupported by substantial evidence. On consideration of the agreement as a whole the arbitrator rejected this interpretation of the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">We need not express an opinion on the proper interpretation of the above quoted clause. Interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, like findings of fact, is a matter within the province of the arbitrator. \u201c[S]o far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 599, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1362, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960); <em>Walters v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 557 F.2d 521; <em>International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers v. Leona Lee Corp., </em>5 Cir., 489 F.2d 1032, cert. <em>denied, </em>419 U.S. 829, 95 S.Ct. 51, 42 L.Ed.2d 54 (1974). Moreover, in the instant case the arbitrator specifically found that even under the standard advanced by the Company the dismissals failed to pass muster. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
