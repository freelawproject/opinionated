All three testified at the trial of Charles Kenneth (Kenny) Masson, the appellant here, who had been charged on two counts of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 and aiding and abetting violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found Masson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>guilty on both counts, and the trial judge fined him $500 on each count and placed him on probation for five years. On appeal, Masson raises three arguments: (1) whether Count 2 of the indictment was \u201cduplicitous\u201d by charging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1955 and 2; (2) whether certain testimony of the government\u2019s expert witness should have been excluded; and (3) whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Masson first argues that Count 2 of the indictment charged him with the commission of two offenses in violation of Fed. R.Crim.P. 8(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Analysis of this issue properly begins with the words of the indictment, which charged that Masson and other named individuals \u201cunlawfully, willfully and knowingly did, and aided and abetted each other in order to, conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct and own all or part of an illegal gambling business, . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1955 and 2.\u201d Masson views this language as charging him with the commission of two separate crimes, i. e., \u201caiding and abetting\u201d and \u201cillegal gambling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">This argument is flawed for at least three reasons. First, one cannot be convicted of merely \u201caiding and abetting.\u201d One must aid and abet the commission of some substantive offense in order to be punishable as a principal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. <em>Powers v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 470 F.2d 991; <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>2 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 547, 553. Second, an aider and abettor may be charged as a principal, and the words \u201caid and abet\u201d do not have to appear in the indictment in order to sustain a conviction as an aider and abettor. <em>Pigford v. United States, </em>4 Cir. 1975, 518 F.2d 831, 834-35; <em>United States v. Romero, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 495 F.2d 1356, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 995, 95 S.Ct. 307, 42 L.Ed.2d 267 (1974); <em>United States v. Trollinger, </em>5 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 527, 528 n. 3. If one can thus be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of an offense without being specifically so charged in the indictment, then the indictment in this case merely made explicit what was already implicit as a matter of law. For purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, therefore, Masson has been convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, the substantive statute, and he is being punished as a principal by virtue of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, Masson does not claim, and probably could not claim, that his ability to defend the accusation of the grand jury was prejudiced by the phraseology of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">Masson\u2019s second challenge is to the admissibility of certain parts of the testimony of the government\u2019s expert witness. The expert witness, an FBI agent with extensive experience and knowledge of bookmaking operations and terminology, was properly qualified as an expert. Defense counsel did not object to his qualifications, but rather on the grounds that the witness had an \u201cinterest\u201d in the outcome of the trial. That objection was correctly overruled by the trial judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>The expert\u2019s testimony was necessary to aid the jury in understanding the meaning of 12 tape-recorded conversations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which were admitted in evidence and implicated Masson in the illegal bookmaking operation. These conversations were carried on in the jargon characteristic of the gambling business, and the expert clarified the meanings of the various phrases and terms for the jury. We have previously sanctioned the use of such testimony. See, e. g., <em>United States v. Milton, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 555 F.2d 1198, 1203-05; <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 539 F.2d 1050, 1062-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">Masson specifically objects to the expert\u2019s testimony that appellant is a \u201csub-bookmaker working for a commission, calling in betting wagers to the main recording center, and is in fact not a mere player.\u201d (A. 136). Rule 704 of the Federal Rules of Evidence specifically permits expert testimony on an \u201cultimate issue\u201d so long as the testimony is otherwise admissible. This testimony was surely relevant, there was no waste of time, and any prejudicial impact did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the testimony. The trial judge did not abuse his broad discretion in admitting this testimony. <em>See Milton, supra; McCoy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-21\">Appellant\u2019s last contention is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>conviction. This contention fails if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Warner, </em>5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 821, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 829, 92 S.Ct. 65, 30 L.Ed.2d 58 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Vigelette, the ringleader in this bookmaking operation, testified that appellant placed wagers with his book on a twenty-five percent commission basis. Call No. 7 of Government Exhibit 4 was a telephone conversation between the appellant and Vigelette, who testified that the call indicated that appellant was a commissioned sub-bookmaker. Valenti, Vigelette\u2019s partner, initially testified that he thought appellant was a mere bettor, but that he could not remember if appellant was also placing wagers with the book on a commission basis. However when confronted with his grand jury testimony, Valenti admitted that appellant was in fact placing wagers on a twenty-five percent commission basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Further evidence was supplied by the tapes and the FBI agent\u2019s interpretation of them. On the tapes, the caller identifies himself as \u201cKenny\u201d and makes bets on various horse races and football games. In successive calls, he makes different bets on the same game and is instructed to change his point spread on a particular game. Significant sums of money are bet within a short period of time. The agent testified that the pattern of calls indicate that the caller is more than a bettor and is making bets for others. In addition, he testified that the terminology used in the calls was consistent with that conclusion. Another tape of a conversation between Vigelette and Valenti indicates that the two men discussed the \u201cbottom line\u201d and the \u201cmakeup\u201d of the appellant. The agent testified that the terminology refers to the commission which a sub-bookmaker is paid. Vigelette also supported this interpretation of the terms \u201cmake-up\u201d and \u201cbottom line\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">This evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant was more than a mere bettor. He was a participant in the illegal gambling enterprise and was, in the phraseology of the profession, a sub-bookmaker. As such, he is well within the ambit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 566 F.2d 929, 934-35; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 551 F.2d 967; <em>United States v.

The indictment also charged Donald Melancon and Casey Killian with similar violations. Killian pled guilty to a Bill of Information charging a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 and was fined. Masson moved to sever his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>from that of Melancon, and the trial judge granted that motion. Melancon was subsequently convicted by the jury in his trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">.

In cases of group criminality, such as we have here, it is not necessary that each defendant commit every element of the offense. For instance, any single member of the group might never generate $2000 of revenue in a single day for the illegal activity, but if he contributed some revenue or aided in the accumulation of such an amount of revenue, he could be found guilty of aiding and abetting the commission of the substantive offense. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 526 F.2d 1236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1041-15\">. Defense counsel attempted to demonstrate that the agent had an interest in securing a conviction, but he was unable to establish sufficient bias or prejudice to warrant exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>the testimony, as the following colloquy amply demonstrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-6\">MR. BURGLASS: Were you an investigating agent in connection with this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-8\">Q. You have an interest in the result of these proceedings, then, as the investigating agent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-9\">A. Not the outcome as to whether it is win, lose or draw, only that it is my job to obtain evidence, and when I obtain the evidence I turn it over to the United States Attorney\u2019s office and from that point on, of course, it is not in my hands. I am merely an investigator who gathers the evidence, so I can't say that I have a vested interest in the outcome of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-10\">Q. I wasn\u2019t talking about a vested interest, Agent Baken. You would prefer, would you not, that the defendant be convicted than acquitted, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-11\">A. Only if guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-12\">Q. Well, you believe that he is guilty, do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-13\">MR. DUPLECHIN (Prosecutor): Your Honor, I object to that form of question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-14\">THE COURT: I sustain the objection. That is for the jury to determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-15\">MR. BURGLASS: You have no interest in the outcome of what the jury determines in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-16\">A. That is the province of the jury and I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahvn\">Q. I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-17\">A. I can\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-18\">Q. I am asking you if you have an interest. Do you care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-19\">A. Well, as a human being, of course 1 would care, but it is not \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really make any difference to me personally whether or not the jury finds an individual innocent or guilty. It is based on the evidence, and it is not a personal matter with me, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-22\">THE COURT: The Court will accept the witness as an expert in bookmaking operations and bookmaking terminology. Now, you may make your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-23\">MR. BURGLASS: We object, Your Honor, that the agent obviously has an interest in the outcome of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-24\">THE COURT: Well, the objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-25\">MR. BURGLASS: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-26\">THE COURT: I suppose every agent, every good agent, every good policeman, has an interest in doing his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-27\">MR. BURGLASS: I object to that statement, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-28\">(A. 78-81). Appellant objects that he was not allowed to question the expert as to whether he believed the defendant guilty. The trial judge correctly refused to permit this line of questioning. Many witnesses probably do have a personal opinion as to whether a defendant is innocent or guilty, but that fact alone does not disqualify them as witnesses. If the rule were otherwise, trials might well become a sterile battleground of documentary evidence with few, if any, live witnesses with actual knowledge of the crime. The job of a witness is to testify as to his knowledge of the facts, and the jury is then free to accept or reject that version of the facts. Furthermore, a witness\u2019 expression as to the guilt of a particular defendant would be a legal conclusion, against which we have previously cautioned courts to \u201cremain vigilant.\u201d United <em>States v. Milton, 5 </em>Cir. 1977, 555 F.2d 1198, 1203. In short, no reversible error was committed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1042-29\">.
