A truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>owned by plaintiff Black was destroyed in a collision with a car on July 18, 1975, in Choctaw County, Miss. However, 11 days before the wreck, defendant insurance company had mailed notice of cancellation to Black, advising him that his insurance policy covering the truck would be cancelled on July 17 for nonpayment of premium. The company refused to pay Black\u2019s ensuing claim on the ground that the policy had been cancelled on the day prior to the accident, and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">The district court granted partial summary judgment for plaintiff on the issue of defendant\u2019s liability, holding that the cancellation became effective ten days following actual receipt of notice by plaintiff, not ten days after it had been mailed. A jury then found that the other vehicle in the accident was uninsured and awarded plaintiff $6000 for property damage and $2250 for loss of income resulting from the property damage. The district court, which had refused to present a punitive damages issue to the jury, subsequently held that, under the policy plaintiff was not entitled to recover for the lost income. Judgment for plaintiff was entered for $6000, plus statutory interest, and defendant appealed. Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of damages. For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">I. NOTICE OF CANCELLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Defendant contends that the district judge erred in holding that the cancellation became effective ten days after plaintiff received notice, and argues that under Mississippi law, cancellation for nonpayment of premiums is effective ten days after notice of such cancellation is mailed to the policyholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">In 1964, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that an insurance policy was properly cancelled when the insurer mailed notice of that cancellation to the insured, since the policy itself provided that such mailing constituted sufficient proof of notice. Actual receipt of the notice was thus not required. <em>Employers Mut. Cas. Co. v. Nosser, </em>250 Miss. 542, 164 So.2d 426 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">The court was careful to point out that the state had no statutory provisions affecting notice and cancellation of insurance policies and indicated that the presence of such a statutory scheme would possibly call for a different result. 164 So.2d at 434. In 1970, the Mississippi Legislature filled the void by passing the following statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-9\">\u00a7 83-11-5. Notice of cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-10\">No notice of cancellation of a policy to which section 83-11-3 applies shall be effective unless mailed or delivered by the insurer to the named insured at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of cancellation; provided, however, that where cancellation is for nonpayment of premium at least ten (10) days\u2019 notice of cancellation accompanied by the reason therefor shall be given. Unless the reason accompanies or is included in the notice of cancellation, the notice of cancellation shall state or be accompanied by a statement that upon written request of the named insured, mailed or delivered to the insurer not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of cancellation, the insurer will specify the reason for such cancellation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">This section shall not apply to nonrenewal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-12\">\u00a7 83-11 \u2014 9. Proof of notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-13\">Proof of mailing of notice of cancellation, or of intention not to renew, or of reasons for cancellation to the named insured by a certificate of mailing, at the address shown in the policy, shall be sufficient proof of notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">The section references are to the Mississippi Code of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-15\">A case spawned by the ill winds of Hurricane Camille reached the state\u2019s highest court in 1975. In <em>Nelson v. Phoenix of Hartford Ins. Co., </em>318 So.2d 839 (Miss.1975), the court distinguished <em>Nosser </em>and held that actual receipt of the notice was required when the insurance policy provided that notice of cancellation was to be <em>given. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>The policy in <em>Nosser </em>stated that the company could <em>mail </em>notice to the insured and that the mailing constituted sufficient proof of notice. In <em>Nelson, </em>however, the policy required that notice be \u201cgiven\u201d to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">The <em>Nelson </em>decision does not address the impact of the 1970 legislation because the policy was cancelled almost a year before the statutes became effective. Neither party in the instant case cites a Mississippi decision construing the statutes, and our research reveals none. Accordingly, we must embark on an Erie<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> journey into virgin judicial territory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Defendant argues that because the policy provided for cancellation \u201cby mailing to the named insured . . . written notice,\u201d <em>Nosser </em>is controlling. In addition, defendant asserts that the statutes enacted in 1970 represent a codification of the <em>Nosser </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">We disagree, although candor compels admission that the statutory scheme is less than clear and is'capable of varying interpretation. In these circumstances, and when state decisional law affords no guidance, the interpretation of the district judge, who is well versed in the intricacies and trends of local law, is entitled to great deference. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 346 &amp; n.10, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">Section 83-11-5 clearly distinguishes between cancellation for nonpayment of premium and cancellation for any other reason.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the former situation, at least ten days\u2019 notice \u201caccompanied by the reason therefor shall be given.\u201d In the latter, notice of cancellation is not effective \u201cunless mailed or delivered by the insurer to the named insured at least twenty days prior to the effective date of cancellation.\u201d We can overlook neither the different terms employed in each situation nor the grammatical structure of each clause. The legislature could have easily repeated the words \u201cmailed or delivered\u201d in connection with notice of cancellation for nonpayment, but it utilized the word \u201cgiven\u201d instead. Moreover, the clauses are not parallel grammatically. One states that \u201cno notice . shall be effective unless mailed or delivered,\u201d while the other says that \u201cnotice . shall be given.\u201d If, as defendant argues, the term \u201cgiven\u201d is simply a generalized synonym for the previously used terms \u201cmailed or delivered,\u201d one would think that the sentence would have been written to make the parallel obvious.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-15\">More significantly, the Mississippi Supreme Court in <em>Nosser </em>emphasized that it was writing on a clean slate, unimpeded by statutes. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-16\">[I]n all cases with the exception of one California and one Minnesota case where actual receipt of the notice of cancellation was held necessary, despite the policy provision that notice of cancellation mailed to the address of the assured . should be sufficient notice, a <em>statute required that the insured be given notice of the cancellation in a specified number of days. </em>Apparently such a statutory provision overrides a clause in the policy which would tend to nullify the intention of the legislature .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>164 So.2d at 434 [emphasis original]. After <em>Nosser </em>was decided, the Mississippi Legislature passed such a statute, requiring that at least ten days\u2019 notice \u201cshall be given\u201d when cancellation is for nonpayment of premium. The <em>Nelson </em>case, though decided after the adoption of \u00a7 83-11-5, also indicates the distinction between requiring that notice be \u201cgiven\u201d and allowing a mere \u201cmailing\u201d to be sufficient. 318 So.2d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">In dealing with other types of insurance policies, the legislature has distinguished between notice of cancellation that must be \u201cgiven\u201d and notice of cancellation that may simply be \u201cmailed or delivered.\u201d For example, \u00a7 83-9-5, which deals with accident and health insurance policies, provides in subsection (2)(e) that the insurer may cancel the policy at any time by written notice \u201cdelivered to the insured, or mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer.\u201d In contrast, \u00a7 83-41-201, which pertains to hospital, medical, or surgical insurance, states a general rule that an insurer shall not cancel such a policy \u201cwithout first giving written notice to the insured.\u201d Therefore, we cannot assume that the legislature picked the word \u201cgiven\u201d out of the air when writing \u00a7 83-11-5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 83-11-5 requires that notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium be given at least ten days before the effective date of the cancellation and that the timeliness of the notice is to be determined by the date of its receipt rather than by the date of its mailing. If cancellation is for a reason other than nonpayment, the notice may be mailed or delivered at least twenty days before the cancellation date. The district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment on the issue of defendant\u2019s liability under the policy is thus affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">II. LOSS OF INCOME</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">Plaintiff by cross-appeal argues that the district court erred in striking the jury\u2019s award of $2250 in damages for loss of income. The district court did so after defendant filed, some three months after entry of judgment, an amendment to its timely filed motion for judgment n. o. v., new trial, or remittitur. In this amendment, defendant argued for the first time that such an award is impermissible under the state\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 83-11-101.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The thrust of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the issue was not properly before the district court, having been raised in untimely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Rather than address the thorny question of whether a timely motion under Rules 50 &amp; 59, Fed.R.Civ.P., can belatedly be amended to assert a new ground,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we choose to examine that ground itself. Although the policy itself provided for \u201cinsurance against uninsured motorists,\u201d with no words of limitation or condition,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the district court concluded that \u00a7 83-11-101 limits uninsured motorist coverage to damages for bodily injury or death. The Mississippi Supreme Court, however, has made clear that the statute simply \u201crequires each policy to provide the minimum coverage,\u201d <em>Harthcock v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>248 So.2d 456, 462 (Miss.1971), and that an insurer and an insured are \u201cfree to contract as to uninsured motorist coverage <em>in any respect </em>so long as the required coverage is not cut down by the policy provisions.\u201d <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>291 So.2d 699, 701 (Miss.1974) (emphasis added). A post-Talbot amendment to \u00a7 83-11-101 added a maximum for excess bodily injury <em>coverage </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>\u201cnot to exceed [the limits] provided in the policy of bodily injury liability insurance of the insured\u201d \u2014 but did not otherwise limit the freedom of the parties to contract for additional uninsured motorist coverage. The district court thus erroneously granted defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">III. UNINSURED MOTORIST</p>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">Having concluded that the district court erred in striking the jury\u2019s award of $2250 for loss of income, we turn to a related question raised by defendant: was there sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the vehicle that hit plaintiff\u2019s truck was uninsured? This question is relevant only to damages awarded for loss of income, since the physical damage portion of the policy covers the loss of the truck itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Defendant moved for a directed verdict on this issue, thereby preserving the sufficiency of evidence question for review. The district court denied the motion, and in making its ruling, the court was required to apply a federal, rather than state, test for sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5 Cir. 1969) (en banc); <em>Midland Ins. Co. v. Markel Service, Inc., </em>548 F.2d 603 (5 Cir. 1977). Under <em>Shipman, </em>the standard applicable on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings. We are required to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party \u2014 the plaintiff in the instant case \u2014 and to draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">The jury could have reasonably concluded that the vehicle involved in the wreck with plaintiff was uninsured. The driver and his stepfather testified that they carried no insurance on the car and knew of no one who did. The driver also stated that he did not own the vehicle, that the owner had died some two years before the wreck, and that the car had apparently been abandoned at a third person\u2019s house for at least six months. Moreover, plaintiff testified that he had made an attempt \u2014 -perhaps a halfhearted effort, at best \u2014 to determine whether the car was insured. Although the evidence was in some respects contradictory,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is clearly sufficient to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>jury\u2019s findings, especially considering that the defendant offered no evidence whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\">IV. PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Plaintiff contends on cross-appeal that the district court erroneously directed a verdict in favor of defendant on the issue of punitive damages. Plaintiff\u2019s claim was based on his allegation and subsequent testimony that an employee of the local insurance agent had orally agreed to renew the policy a few days prior to the wreck. In sum, plaintiff claimed that he went to the agent\u2019s office after receiving notice of cancellation, offered to pay his premium, and inquired about increasing his coverage. The employee allegedly told him that she could not write a policy in the amount of the increase and explained that she would have to contact the company\u2019s state office. Plaintiff then \u201coffered her a check to keep the other policy in force till the [new] policy came through,\u201d but she refused, indicating that she would rather handle everything at one time and that meanwhile the present policy would stay in effect. He also testified that when he telephoned the employee after the accident had occurred, she told him that the policy had been reinstated, that the agent had signed it, and that the policy was at that moment on the agent\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Defendant denied these allegations in its answer, and the employee\u2019s deposition refutes plaintiff\u2019s story. However, the deposition was not offered into evidence, and the district court had before it only the plaintiff\u2019s testimony when confronted with defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in its favor on the issue of punitive damages. The court granted the motion on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s proof was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">Under Mississippi law, an insurance company that has a legitimate or arguable reason for refusing to pay a claim is not subject to punitive damages. <em>Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Veal, </em>354 So.2d 239 (Miss. 1977). In the absence of such a justifiable reason, the refusal is deemed an intentional wrong and an independent tort giving rise to punitive damages. <em>Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Keys, </em>317 So.2d 396 (Miss.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">Plaintiff contends that the company did not have an arguable or legitimate reason for refusing his claim, since the policy had been orally renewed prior to the accident and had been officially reinstated by the day of the mishap. The district court, in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict, simply concluded that plaintiff\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish the oral renewal. We disagree, for in these circumstances the district court must \u2014 as we must on appeal \u2014 view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, supra. </em>Because the defendant offered no evidence to contradict plaintiff\u2019s story, his version must be taken as true for purposes of the motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">The district court should have determined whether, on these \u201cfacts,\u201d the insurance company had a legitimate or arguable reason to refuse the claim. This determination requires analysis of whether the alleged oral representation constituted a valid renewal of plaintiff\u2019s policy. The question, which implicates Mississippi law of agency,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> oral agreements,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and waiver and estoppel,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is best left to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>court in the first instance. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings. If there is no arguable basis under Mississippi law for contending that the oral representation was ineffective, plaintiff is entitled to have the issue of punitive damages submitted to a jury, which would be required to determine whether the representation was in fact made.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">The district court\u2019s striking of the jury\u2019s award of $2250 in damages for loss of income is reversed and the case is remanded for reinstatement of that amount. In addition, the plaintiff is entitled to a new trial limited to the issue of punitive damages, the district court having erred in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant on this issue. In all other respects the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">. Plaintiff is a Mississippi resident, and defendant is incorporated and has its principal place of business in states other than Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-32\">The complaint sought nearly $40,000 in damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">. <em>Erie R.R.

Our journey would be unnecessary if the Mississippi courts would accept certified questions. This case is an excellent example of the utility of certification. <em>See generally </em>Brown, <em>Certification </em>\u2014 Federalism <em>in Action, </em>7 Cumberland L.Rev. 456 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">. The various grounds for cancellation are set out in \u00a7 83-11-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">. Defendant would have us read the statute as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">[N]otice of cancellation is effective if mailed or delivered by the insurer to the named insured . . with ten (10) days notice for cancellation for nonpayment of premium and twenty (20) days notice where cancellation is for any of the other grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-19\">Reply brief at 3. Had the legislature so intended, it could have said so in precisely that fashion. It did not do so, however, and we must assume that it used the term \u201cgiven\u201d for a reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">. Defendant makes three other arguments in opposition to our interpretation, and we find all unpersuasive. First, defendant contends that our reading of the statute is at odds with its obvious rationale, i. e., to give more notice protection to persons who have paid their insurance premiums than to those who have not. Such a rationale does seem obvious, but it is not illogical or inconsistent to suppose that the legislature also intended to make mailing of the notice sufficient for the longer 20-day period while requiring receipt for the shorter 10-day time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Second, defendant argues that if our reading of \u00a7 83-11-5 is correct, the effect of the statutory language must have escaped the Mississippi Supreme Court when it decided the <em>Nelson </em>case some five years after the statute was passed. We need only note that the <em>Nelson </em>court was not presented with a question of statutory interpretation, since the policy involved had been cancelled well before the statute went into effect. Finally, defendant claims our interpretation makes \u00a7 83-11-5 inconsistent with \u00a7 83-11-9, which provides that proof of mailing of a cancellation notice \u201cshall be sufficient proof of notice.\u201d We find no inconsistency, for that section obviously applies when the \u201cmailed\u201d notice portion of \u00a7 83-11-5 comes into play and does not apply when notice is required to be \u201cgiven\u201d under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">. This statute, as amended in 1974, provides: No automobile liability insurance policy or contract shall be issued or delivered after January 1, 1967, unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums which he shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, within limits which shall be no less than those set forth in the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law, as amended, under provisions approved by the commissioner of insurance; however, at the option of the insured, the uninsured motorist limits may be increased to limits not to exceed those provided in the policy of bodily injury liability insurance of the insured or such lesser limits as the insured elects to carry over the minimum requirement set forth by this section. The coverage herein required shall not be applicable where any insured named in the policy shall reject the coverage in writing and provided, further, that unless the named insured re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>quests such coverage in writing, such coverage need not be provided in any renewal policy where the named insured had rejected the coverage in connection with a policy previously issued to him by the same insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1067-8\"><em>. </em>See 6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice jl 59.09[2] (2d ed. 1974); 11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2013 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">. Defendant filed the belated amendment only after the district court denied its motion to supplement the record with a copy of its \u201cstandard\u201d uninsured motorist policy that limits coverage to bodily injury or death.
