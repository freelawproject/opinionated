Motion to Suppress the Fruits of the Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Abdalla first moves to suppress the firearms that were found in his residence because the information used to obtain the search warrant was allegedly stale. According to the Search Warrant Affidavit, three controlled buys of narcotics were made over a span of four months. More specifically, it states that (1) on February 2, 2017, a confidential informant (\"CI\") went to the New Hope Road residence, \"made contact\" with Courtney Paris, and purchased $90 worth of heroin while Abdalla and Ernest Tanner were in the home; (2) on March 16, 2017 the CI went to the residence and made contact with both Abdalla and Paris and purchased $150 worth of heroin; and (3) on June 2, 2017, the same events were repeated with the CI making contact with both Abdalla and Paris, but this time a Ruger 9mm pistol was displayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In the context of drug crimes, information goes stale very quickly 'because drugs are usually sold and consumed in a prompt fashion.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Three purchases were made from two individuals in the residence in a four month period. This suggests not a \"chance encounter in the night,\" but rather purchases from \"a secure operational base.\" Moreover, a 9mm handgun was displayed during the last purchase. While Abdalla correctly points out that DeKalb County Judge David A. Patterson issued the Search Warrant after finding probable cause to believe that felony trafficking or felony money laundering might be occurring at the New Hope road premises, the judge also described the evidence to be seized as including \"firearms, ammunition, [and] receipts of purchase of firearms[.]\" (Doc. No. 20-1 at 14-15). Any reasonable jurist knows that \"drugs and guns go 'hand in hand' \" and that \"firearms are tools of the drug trafficking trade.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hornbeak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177236\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/575/618/#p621\">\n    575 F. App'x 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (6th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). Accordingly, the firearms will not be suppressed on the grounds that the information in the warrant was stale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his Second Supplemental Brief, Abdalla argues that the search warrant was improperly issued because there was insufficient information supplied to Judge Patterson to determine whether the CI was reliable. Arguing the typical indicia of reliability was lacking, he writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   There is no statement that the confidential informant was reliable or had been used before. There is no statement that the confidential informant was named to the magistrate judge. There is no statement that officers searched the confidential informant before and after the controlled purchases, which is in many ways the very definition of a \"controlled\" purchase. Although we are told that the confidential informant was given \"buy money,\" there is no statement that it was pre-recorded or otherwise documented. Although we are told that the confidential informant was issued \"monitoring equipment,\" there is no statement that officers used this equipment to monitor the confidential informant. There is no statement that the drugs allegedly acquired in the controlled purchases were field-tested positive for narcotics. In fact, we now know that they were not tested until months later, and the powder purchased in one of the three controlled buys contained no narcotics at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. No. 28 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Were the Court addressing the issue of probable cause in the first instance, Abdalla's arguments might have some purchase. However, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly said that after-the-fact scrutiny\n   by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\"\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

He was presented with information that a CI had made narcotics purchases there, not once, but on three occasions in the past few months. He was also informed that the CI had been issued \"monitoring equipment and drug buy money,\" and that, after each transaction, the \"evidence [wa]s logged into the 15th Drug Task Force Evidence.\" (Doc. No. 20-1 at 8). Further, the Search Warrant Affidavit stated that, on the first two occasions, the CI and an undercover agent were \"surveilled\" going to the house; on the third occasion an undercover agent drove the CI to the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While the Search Warrant Affidavit could have been more detailed and written clearer, \"line-by-line scrutiny\" is inappropriate and an \"affidavit should be reviewed in a commonsense rather than a hypertechnical-manner.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Woosley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645427\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/924/#p926\">\n    361 F.3d 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (6th Cir. 2004). Even though the search warrant affidavit does not state that the CI had proven reliable in the past, by the time he made his third purchase, the CI had successfully purchased what he thought to be heroin\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the residence at 332 New Hope Road on two prior occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Abdalla's suggestion that the transactions were not monitored and the buy money was not recorded is untrue (as he now knows). Besides, \"[t]he affidavit is judged on the adequacy of what it does contain, not on what it lacks, or on what a critic might say should have been added,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743253\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/970/#p973\">\n    211 F.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (6th Cir. 2000), and Judge Patterson was required to read the Search Warrant Affidavit \"in a commonsense and realistic fashion,\"\n   <em>\n    Coffee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931840\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/887/#p893\">\n    434 F.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on such a reading, he could have properly concluded that the monitoring equipment was used, the money was recorded, and the CI was watched going to and from the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Abdalla also moves to suppress the firearms on the ground that the Search Warrant was executed on the wrong house. He notes out that, immediately above Judge Patterson's signature is the command that officers search the residence and buildings located at 245 Carey Road in Hartsville, Tennessee. Not only is this the incorrect address, Hartsville is located in Trousdale County, while Alexandria is located in DeKalb County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In support of his position that suppression is necessary, Abdalla relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Durk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362753\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/464/\">\n    149 F.3d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1998) for the proposition that \"[i]t goes without saying that a search warrant that only authorizes search of the\n   <em>\n    wrong home\n   </em>\n   creates a high likelihood that officers would have searched the wrong premises in relying on this search warrant.\" (Doc. No. 20 at 9) (emphasis in original). He also quotes that case for the observation that a court's inquiry should be on whether the place to be searched is \"described with sufficient particularity to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort, and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premises might be mistakenly searched.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Durk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362753\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/464/\">\n    149 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   465 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In reality,\n   <em>\n    Durk\n   </em>\n   supports the Government's position that the firearms should not be suppressed. In that case, an officer seeking a warrant twice transposed the address number from 4216 Fulton, Royal Oak, Michigan, to 4612. He also identified the house as being approximately 3 houses to the east of Grandview when, in fact, it was 3 houses to the west. Upholding the execution of the search warrant, the Sixth Circuit wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The evil that the framers of the Constitution were trying to eradicate with the particularity requirement was the so-called general warrant that allowed officers to search at random. This requirement eliminates generalness and provides both a reason for and limitation of the search. These purposes were served in this case as the warrant sufficiently describes [defendant's] house despite the two inaccuracies. The warrant correctly identifies the house as a single-family red brick ranch home on the north side of Fulton street. Although brick, ranch style homes may be common in [defendant's] neighborhood, the warrant also describes a more unusual feature: a ten by fifteen foot metal storage shed, the entrance of which is secured by a plastic tie.... Courts routinely have upheld warrants, such as the one at issue, \"where one part of the description of the premises to be searched is inaccurate, but the description has other parts which identify the place with particularity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Durk,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362753\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/464/\">\n    149 F.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even more so in this case than in\n   <em>\n    Durk\n   </em>\n   , \"no reasonable probability existed that the officers would search the wrong\n   premises as a result of the inaccuracies in the warrant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362753\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/464/\">\n    149 F.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the address above the judge's signature was wrong, that was clearly the result of Agent Brandon Gooch cutting and pasting from an earlier warrant. Regardless, in the first paragraph of the warrant the address is correctly stated, with clear and detailed directions to the residence. Specifically, the warrant provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   TO ARRIVE AT THESE PREMISES, TRAVELING WEST ON I-40 TAKE EXIT RAMP 254. TURNING LEFT ONTO ALEXANDRIA HIGHWAY AND TRAVELING SOUTH 6.8 MILES TO DEKALB COUNTY LINE. CONTINUE TRAVELLING [SIC] SOUTH ON ALEXANDRIA HIGHWAY FOR 0.5 MILES. TO THE INTERSECTION OF ALEXANDRA [SIC] HIGHWAY AND NEW HOPE RD. TURNING LEFT ON TO NEW HOPE RD AND TRAVELING EAST FOR 0.1 MILE TO THE DRIVEWAY OF 332 NEW HOPE ROAD LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Doc. No. 20-1 at 13). Lest there be any misunderstanding, the warrant also described what the premises looked like:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ON [THE] PROPERTY THERE WILL BE A WHITE DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER WITH A GREEN FRONT PORCH AND A BLACK SHINGLE ROOF. IN THE BACK YARD THERE WILL BE A ALUMINA [SIC] BUILDING WITH AN UP STAIRS PORCH. ALSO ON THE FRONT PORCH OF THE DOUBLE WIDE THERE WILL BE AN AMERICAN FLAG AND AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE DRIVE WAY THERE WILL BE AN AUTO DETAIL SIGN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   . Absent exact GPS coordinates, the actual location of the search could not have been any clearer. Nor could any officer mistake this house for the one in Trousdale County, unless that residence, too, was a black shingled, white double wide trailer, flying an American flag, with an aluminum building on the premises and an auto detail sign at the entrance to the driveway. There is no evidence of that in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Additionally, Agent Gooch, who drafted the affidavit, also participated in the search, and the Sixth Circuit \"has previously upheld searches conducted pursuant to warrants listing incorrect addresses or property descriptions in part because the police officers involved in executing the search had also served as affiants or were otherwise familiar with the location to be searched.\"\n   <em>\n    Knott v.

Instead, Agent Gooch was called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Agent Gooch testified that he was present when Thompson recited from memory the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to Abdalla. He testified that Abdalla (1) appeared calm and coherent; (2) did not appear to be intoxicated; (3) appeared to be oriented as to time and place; (4) did not ask that the rights be repeated or indicate that he did not understand his rights; and (5) nodded appropriately while the warning were being given. Agent Gooch also testified that Abdalla verbally relinquished his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and appeared to do so knowingly and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even though the Court finds Agent Gooch's testimony on this score entirely credible, it only goes so far. Agent Gooch conceded that his observations were limited to the few minutes or seconds required to advise Abdalla of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. As such, he was not in a position to testify regarding Abdalla's conduct during, or leading up to, the interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   According to the testimony of Rebecca Wright, a Putnam County Sheriff's Deputy, when officers arrived at 332 New Hope Road they made a forcible entry into the premises. Abdalla was located in the bedroom wearing nothing but shorts, and lying next to his girlfriend. Realizing people had entered his bedroom, Abdalla became startled and began fighting with the officers. In a later interview, Abdalla explained that he had injected heroin and fentanyl and taken methamphetamine before the raid, and that he thought he was in a video game when he was fighting with the officers. This is, of course, self serving. Regardless, Deputy Wright testified that Abdalla tried to bite two officers and came close to being shot during the struggle. As it happened, it took four officer to subdue Abdalla. Even when he was placed in flex-cuffs he managed to break them, something Deputy Wright had never seen before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While there was some testimony at the evidentiary hearing that Abdalla had calmed down and became coherent between the time of the fra\u00e7as with the officers and the interview with Director Thompson, the Court cannot make such a finding based upon the preponderance of the evidence. Nor does it have any evidence about what transpired during the interrogation because Director Thompson did not testify. Accordingly, the Court will suppress the statements that Abdalla made to Director Thompson at the New Hope Road residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court will not, however, suppress the statements made by Abdalla at the DeKalb County Jail on June 12, 2017 because the same evidentiary infirmities do not exist. To the contrary, while Deputy Wright conceded learning from Abdalla during his statement that he was a drug\n   addict who used 3 grams of heroin or fentanyl a day, had used both methamphetamine and fentanyl on the morning of his arrest, and that withdrawal from drugs could be painful and take some time, she did not recall ever hearing Abdalla say that he was \"dope sick,\" nor did she see the need to request medical treatment She also testified that she read Abdalla his rights. Although Abdalla agreed to talk to her, he would not sign the waiver she provided him, which, as already noted, is not fatal. Upon further questioning by the Court, Deputy Wright said that on the morning of the 12th, Abdalla appeared normal, and that he was talkative, cordial and engaging. She further testified that he was clean, groomed and coherent, and did not appear to be under the influence of any narcotics. Further, his speech was clear and Abdalla was easy to understand. The Court finds Deputy Wright's testimony entirely credible and, therefore, the June 12, 2017 statement will not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

With this standard of review, it is clear that a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, counsel limited Abdalla's request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing to the issue of the failure of the Search Warrant Affidavit to explain that the amount of heroin (real or counterfeit) purchased on each occasion was approximately 3 to 5 grams, and that Abdalla allegedly used 3 grams daily. In his view this small amount goes to the issue of staleness because, presumably, a personal user is less likely to deal than a big-time trafficker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Abdalla's argument relates to an act of omission, not commission, and the Sixth Circuit \"has repeatedly held that there is a higher bar for obtaining a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing on the basis of an allegedly material omission as opposed to an allegedly false affirmative statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Fowler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897355\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/408/#p415\">\n    535 F.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court must then consider the affidavit along with the omitted portions and determine whether probable cause still exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Regardless, Judge Patterson could not have been misled into thinking that Abdalla was a large drug trafficker because he was specifically informed that the purchase amount on the first occasion was $90 of heroin, and on both of the last two occasions it was $150 worth of heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Besides, even if Judge Patterson was aware that the purchases were made in the 3 gram range and that this was a personal use amount (at least for Abdalla), this does not change the fact that the New Hope Road residents had enough additional heroin to make sales to others on at least three occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Abdalla's Motion to Suppress Evidence (Doc. No. 20) will be granted in part and denied in part. The Motion will be granted with respect to the statements he made to Director Thompson at the scene of the search on June 9, 2017, but in all other respects will be denied. His request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing will also be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   An appropriate Order will enter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In his Supplemental Brief, Abdalla notes that a September 2017 report from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations indicates the substance purchased on February 2, 2017 contained \"no controlled substances.\" (Doc. No. 28 at 2). From this he argues that \"[one] third of the probable cause in the warrant was likely baking soda or some other benign powder.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). This argument goes nowhere.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    There is absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that either the CI or the occupants of 332 New Hope Road entered into an agreement to purchase $90 worth of non-narcotic powder. The only evidence before the Court is that the CI went to the address to purchase heroin. That later tests revealed the substance not to be heroin is beside the point because, under Tennessee law, it is a felony to sell a \"counterfeit controlled substance.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-423\">\n     Tenn.
