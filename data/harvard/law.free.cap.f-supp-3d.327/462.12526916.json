Although\n   <em>\n    Columbia Univ. v.

Trump\n   </em>\n   enlightening. In that case, Judge Buchwald declared that \"the blocking of the individual plaintiffs from the @realDonaldTrump [Twitter] account because of their expressed political views violates the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524508\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/541/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524508\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/541/\">\n    579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Defendants do not dispute the first prong of the First Amendment retaliation claim, the Court views Judge Buchwald's ruling worth noting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court also finds the discussion on blocking access to social media helpful for\n   the third element of the First Amendment retaliation claim. With respect to blocking the plaintiffs' @DonaldTrump Twitter access, the court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   When a user is blocked, the most significant impediment is the ability to directly interact with a tweet sent by the blocking user. While a blocked user is also limited in that the user may not view the content of the blocking user's tweets or view the blocking user's timeline, those limitations may be circumvented entirely by using an internet browser or other application that is not logged in to Twitter, or that is logged in to a Twitter account that is not blocked. By contrast, the ability to interact directly cannot be completely reestablished, and that ability-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   access to the interactive space-is therefore best described as the access that the individual plaintiffs seek.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524508\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/541/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524508\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/541/\">\n    at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The court then stated that \"the blocking of the individual plaintiffs has the discrete impact of preventing them from interacting directly with the Presidents' tweets, thereby restricting a real, albeit narrow, slice of speech;\" the court concluded, \"No more is needed to violate the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524508\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/541/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524508\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/541/\">\n    at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Dingwell learned that two firearms were possibly missing from the Meriden Police Department armory in January 2015 and on undisclosed dates he reported these issues to various Meriden officials as well as the ATF, State Police, and the Record Journal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 18-22, 28-29].

While the Amended Complaint does not indicate Mr. Dingwell, Sr. subsequently made any public speech about the missing firearms, it does allege that four months later in March 2016, a Meriden police officer asked to meet him in a parking lot and threatened that \"if he did not leave the story alone, the Department would ... go after his family if necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Only a few weeks later, Mr. Dingwell, Sr.'s son was arrested, charged with several crimes, and the Meriden Police Department issued a Facebook post and notified the newspapers of the incident.

The Court finds Mr. Dingwell, Jr.'s arrest could be understood as making good on the police officer's threat to \"go after his family,\" particularly in light of the close temporal proximity.

The Court distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Laird\n   </em>\n   in which the plaintiffs' alleged their First Amendment rights were chilled by \"a governmental investigation and data-gathering activity\" stemming from the United States Army's surveillance of public activities thought to have the potential for public disorder based on incidents in Detroit, Michigan shortly after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6, 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782769\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/1/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The United States Supreme Court discussed prior chilling decisions and observed that \"[i]n none of these cases, however, did the chilling effect arise merely from the individual's knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or from the individual's concomitant fear that, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency might in the future take some other and addition[a]l action detrimental to that individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782769\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/1/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Laird\n   </em>\n   , this case does not involve just an investigation and it is not the existence of the investigation alone that is alleged to have chilled Mr. Dingwell, Sr.'s speech.

Defendants seek to avoid liability under a qualified immunity defense on the basis that (1) Detective Williams sought to report about an arrest that was legitimately made; (2) Detective Williams asserted his own First Amendment rights in emailing Mr. Dingwell, Sr.; and (3) Police Chief Cossette did not take any actions other than receiving an email. These arguments do not, however, speak to the allegations about their retaliatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mandell v.

Taking the Amended Complaint as true, it is plausible that Detective Williams and Police Chief Cossette colluded to publicly shame and discredit Mr. Dingwell, Sr. and his son about the arrest, thereby intimidating him from exercising his First Amendment rights; and that Detective Williams threatened and sought to intimidate Mr. Dingwell, Sr. from contacting him about matters of public concern.

It would be contrary to the purpose of the qualified immunity doctrine to construe it to allow a police department to intentionally silence its critics by using its power and authority, conferred to protect and defend the public, to threaten, intimidate, and embarrass members of the public they are empowered to protect.
