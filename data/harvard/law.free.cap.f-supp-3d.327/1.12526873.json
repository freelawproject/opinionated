In July 2013, Leopold, a journalist currently employed by BuzzFeed News, filed a petition to unseal nearly twenty years of sealed government applications, pursuant to various statutory authorities, plus related affidavits and orders, regarding the government's collection of information during law enforcement investigations, \"except for those which relate to an ongoing investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leopold's Pet. at 1. Leopold asserted that both the First Amendment and the common law established rights of access to these materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 12-18. Three years later, after the case was reassigned to the undersigned Judge, the Reporters Committee was permitted to intervene,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reporters Comm.'s Unopposed Mot. Intervene, ECF No. 16, and filed its own petition to unseal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reporters Comm.'s Appl. Over the next year, the petitioners and the USAO, with guidance from this Court, engaged in discussions on how properly to vindicate, in light of substantial law enforcement investigative and individual privacy concerns, the public's interest in transparency of judicial records concerning the government's use of statutorily authorized investigative tools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    300 F.Supp.3d at 67-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the course of these discussions, the petitioners agreed to limit the scope of their unsealing request by shortening the time period covered and seeking only records relating to (1) SCA warrants, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (2) SCA orders, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; and PR/TT orders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At all times, the petitioners' limited the scope of their requested relief to materials from closed investigations. This limit necessarily precludes real-time disclosure of any information or records, including docketed case numbers, for these criminal investigative matters, since the USAO only seeks, and the Court only grants, such orders in \"ongoing criminal investigation[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3123(a)(1).

The Court explained, in an accompanying Memorandum Opinion, that the petitioners' First Amendment right of access claim failed because the petitioners had failed to establish \"the prerequisite [ ] showing [of] a longstanding tradition of public access ... as to the PR/TT and SCA materials at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    300 F.Supp.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, no retrospective right of access under the common law was recognized, in light of the considerable administrative burden that such extensive unsealing of nearly a decade's worth of surveillance materials would impose on the USAO and the Clerk's Office, due to the necessity of identifying, reviewing and redacting sensitive law enforcement and privacy-protected information from any unsealed records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    at 97-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held, however, that the common law afforded the petitioners a limited prospective right of access to certain information on the materials sought \"in light of the changes recently adopted by the USAO and Clerk's Office in the processing of such materials.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Court held that the petitioners enjoyed a prospective common law right of access to information, to be disclosed periodically, \"regarding the total number of PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant applications filed by the USAO, the number and type of accounts that such applications target, the names of the providers to which these applications are directed, and the primary criminal offense under investigation for these applications.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioners have now filed a motion for reconsideration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pet'rs' Mot.

Congress's provision of less public disclosure regarding searches and seizures conducted pursuant to SCA warrants than those conducted pursuant to traditional search warrants belies the notion that Congress, merely by employing the term \"warrant,\" designed SCA warrants to disclose the government's collection of evidence to the same extent as does a traditional search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   That an SCA warrant incorporates the probable cause standard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), does not make an SCA warrant more akin to a traditional search warrant, because an SCA warrant, like a subpoena, lacks those features of a traditional search warrant that necessitate the probable cause standard in the first place. \"[T]he immediacy and intrusiveness of a search and seizure conducted pursuant to a warrant demand the safeguard of demonstrating probable cause to a neutral judicial officer before the warrant issues.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Subpoena Duces Tecum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11227607\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/341/#p348\">\n    228 F.3d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (4th Cir. 2000).

Va. 2004) (Ellis, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This case presents no need definitively to construe the SCA's good faith exception, but the point is that while a target typically will be unable to move to quash an SCA warrant prior to execution, the provider to whom the SCA warrant is directed has an incentive to move to quash an apparently defective SCA warrant-namely, to avoid the risk of civil liability-and\n   thereby stands somewhat in the target's shoes to vindicate the target's interests in ensuring a valid SCA warrant. In fact, the Cloud Act added grounds for which the provider may seek to quash or modify \"legal process\" for \"the contents of a wire or electronic communication\" if the provider reasonably believes the customer or subscriber is not a U.S. person or resident and \"the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2)(i)-(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A provider's ability to move to quash, to be sure, is not a perfect substitute for a target's ability to do the same. The question, however, is not whether an SCA warrant is identical to a subpoena in every respect, but merely whether an SCA warrant is more like a subpoena or a traditional search warrant. The existence of an actor-the provider to whom an SCA warrant is directed-with both the opportunity to move to quash a seemingly-deficient SCA warrant and incentives to do so makes an SCA warrant more akin to a subpoena than to a traditional search warrant in this regard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

In so saying, the petitioners appear to assume that a search warrant is the only instrument by which the government can effectuate a Fourth Amendment search. That an SCA warrant's execution constitutes a search within the Fourth Amendment's meaning, however, would not establish that an SCA warrant is more analogous to a traditional search warrant than to a subpoena, as either instrument is used to effectuate a Fourth Amendment search. \"[T]he Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonableness\" applies to \"\n   <em>\n    compulsory\n   </em>\n   production of private papers,\" and thus, to a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Subpoena Duces Tecum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11227607\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/341/#p348\">\n    228 F.3d at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hale v.

As such, the petitioners' contention that \"the government's collection of the content of private communications in electronic form constitutes a search,\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 8, is a non-sequitur with no bearing whatsoever on whether an SCA warrant is more analogous to a subpoena or to a traditional search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Any Impact the Court's Ruling Will Have on the Privacy Protection Act's Construction is Not Ground for Reconsideration.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The petitioners argue, for the first time on reconsideration, that \"[t]he Court's determination that SCA search warrants are akin to subpoenas .... introduces troubling uncertainty into a realm of well-established existing legal protections for the news media.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 12. Under the Privacy Protection Act (\"PPA\"), the government may not, \"in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, [ ] search for or seize\" (1) \"any work product materials possessed by a person reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper, book, broadcast, or other similar form of public communication\" or (2) \"documentary materials ... possessed by a person in connection with a purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper, book, broadcast, or other similar form of public communication,\" except under certain enumerated circumstances. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000aa(a) - (b). One such excepted circumstance is that the government may search for and seize \"documentary materials, other than work product materials,\" otherwise subject to the PPA's protections, where \"such materials have not been produced in response to a court order directing compliance with a subp[o]ena duces tecum\" and \"there is reason to believe that the delay in an investigation or trial occasioned by further proceedings relating to the subp[o]ena would threaten the interests of justice.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000aa(b)(4)(B). In this circumstance, \"the person possessing the materials shall be afforded adequate opportunity to submit an affidavit setting forth the basis for any contention that the materials sought are not subject to seizure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/#p544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2000aa(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The petitioners contend that \"[t]he Court's Opinion gives rise to uncertainty with respect to the PPA's application to SCA search warrants, which can be used by the government to obtain the contents of communications between reporters and their sources.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is unavailing for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, as noted, the petitioners' previous briefing did not mention the PPA whatsoever,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pet'rs' Mem. Supp. Mot. Unseal. Thus, even if the petitioners' assertions\n   regarding the PPA somehow amounted to reversible error, the petitioners' failure to raise this argument in their earlier briefing prevents them from doing so for the first time on a motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leidos, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275140\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/213/#p217\">\n    881 F.3d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, more significantly, the petitioners' argument is not a claim of legal error, but rather, a concern about the precedential impact the Court's ruling may have in future, yet-to-be-litigated matters concerning \"laws and procedures not directly at issue in this case,\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 12, to which the petitioner may or may not be party. The petitioners' dismay that the Court's ruling may have undesired precedential value in some future proceeding does not amount to a showing of error at all, much less a showing of \"clear error or ... manifest injustice\" that the petitioners must make to obtain reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    Messina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3453896,31229\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/755/\">\n    439 F.3d at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637568,3691597\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/1205/\">\n    76 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1208 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Third and finally, it is far from clear that the PPA's procedural limits on the issuance of search warrants for information possessed by reporters, properly construed, do in fact apply to SCA warrants. The PPA was enacted in 1980, prior to the Internet's widespread usage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Indeed, the petitioners identify no case evaluating the PPA's applicability to SCA warrants, much less holding the PPA to apply to SCA warrants, nor has the Court identified any such cases. In any event, this matter does not involve the PPA and presents no need to construe that statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

The very first document the Reporters Committee filed in this matter was a motion to intervene expressing the Reporters Committee's intent to seek unsealing of \"records relating to applications for court orders for the use of electronic surveillance tools in investigations\n   <em>\n    that are no longer active\n   </em>\n   ,\" as well as \"public access to dockets and docket entries concerning applications and orders for the use of\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   tools.\" Reporters Comm.'s Unopposed Mot. Intervene, Attach. 1, Mem. Pts. &amp; Auths. at 13, ECF No. 16-1 (emphasis added). The Court granted the Reporters Committee's motion the next day,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order, dated Aug. 18, 2016, and the Reporters Committee immediately filed an application \"to unseal all applications and supporting documents ... seeking\" SCA warrants, \u00a7 2703(d) orders, and\n   PR/TT orders, \"as well as any court orders granting or denying any [such orders], in connection with any investigation\n   <em>\n    that is no longer active\n   </em>\n   ,\" as well as to make public \"dockets and docket entries reflecting\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   applications and orders.\" Reporters Comm.'s Appl. at 1 (emphasis added). Based on a plain reading of these papers, the Reporters Committee's request was understood to be limited to \"\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   applications and orders\" appearing in \"\n   <em>\n    no longer active\n   </em>\n   \" criminal investigations. To seek unsealing of docket information only in closed investigations is of course logically inconsistent with seeking real-time unsealing of such information, as the USAO only applies for, and the Court only grants, surveillance orders in active, ongoing investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Any ambiguity in the records sought to be unsealed was resolved by the petitioners reiterating over the litigation's course that they sought relief only as to closed investigations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hr'g Tr. at 26:16-17 (Dec. 19, 2016), ECF No. 31 (\"[W]e understand the open investigations issue, and we have stayed away from it.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:3-5 (reiterating that the petitioners do not seek to \"expos[e] an ongoing investigation\" and have \"limited [thei]r requests to closed investigations\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:4, 16-17 (asserting that \"we understand the open investigations issue, and we have stayed away from it,\" including with respect to \"docket sheets\"). The Reporters Committee thus limited, from its very first filings in this matter, the unsealing of docket information it sought to closed criminal investigations. In any event, even had the Reporters Committee sought real-time disclosure of docket-information from the outset, the common law would afford no right of access to such information in light of the significant administrative burden, which the Court has detailed at length,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    300 F.Supp.3d at 97-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that would attend the process of redaction to avoid impinging on personal privacy or revealing information that would jeopardize related ongoing investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Significantly, the petitioners cite no case law whatsoever recognizing any entitlement to real-time unsealing of the type and magnitude of information the petitioners seek.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Furthermore, the purpose the materials at issue serve do not weigh so heavily in favor of disclosure as the petitioners seem to think. SCA warrants, \u00a7 2703(d) orders, and PR/TT orders enable the government to collect information in the course of an ongoing criminal investigation. Pre-indictment criminal investigations require secrecy to function, so as to curb \"the risk that those about to be indicted would flee\" or spoliate evidence and assure that persons exonerated by the investigation, or who assist the government as cooperating witnesses, \"will not be held up to public ridicule.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779812\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/211/#p218\">\n    441 U.S. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779812\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/211/#p218\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Negative Practical Consequences Will Not Attend Recognition of Administrative Burden as Cognizable Under\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The petitioners argue that recognizing administrative burden as a cognizable factor under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   will have two \"significant practical implications that both disadvantage members of the public seeking to assert their right of access to judicial records and run counter to any goal of conserving judicial resources.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 21. First, the petitioners argue that allowing courts to \"deny the public access to judicial records ... based upon the type or extent of access that is sought ... will shift the burden to members of the public to attempt to identify the exact right amount of access that a court will not deem too administratively burdensome for the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is correct. A petitioner seeking access to dockets maintained under seal must be mindful that an overly-broad request for unsealing may impose on the Clerk's Office and/or USAO such undue administrative burden as to weigh against disclosure under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   . This does place on the petitioner some responsibility to exercise good judgment in deciding the scope of unsealing to seek, especially where, as here, the judicial records to be unsealed require careful, page-by-page review prior to disclosure to ensure that no information properly left under seal inadvertently is disclosed, so as to protect ongoing investigations and the considerable privacy interests of potential subjects or targets of criminal investigations that may not have resulted in any formal charges. To require a petitioner to\n   contemplate the possibility that an overly-burdensome request for unsealing may be denied does not amount to legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, the petitioners argue that allowing courts to deny requests for unsealing that pose undue administrative burden \"will also incentivize future petitioners to file multiple petitions, each seeking a different, limited form of access, in the hopes of satisfying what is an entirely unclear standard for determining what level of public access to judicial records is low-burden enough to be available under the common law.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 21. This assumes courts will turn a blind eye toward such transparent gamesmanship. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   compels courts to indulge such tactics, of course. A court reviewing a petition for access to sealed judicial records properly may consider, under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , the access to such records already granted through other, notionally separate petitions, as well as the administrative burden that granting each notionally separate petition collectively may impose on the Clerk's Office and government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, the petitioners describes the Court's conclusion as holding \"that administrative burden to the Government outweighs the public's common law right of access with respect to the specific relief sought by Petitioners as to SCA Search Warrant, Section 2703(d), and PR/TT matters.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 25. This characterization is inaccurate, suggesting the Court concluded that the public in fact has a retrospective common law right of access to the surveillance materials the petitioners seek to unseal, and that considerations of administrative burden \"outweigh[ed]\" this right of access.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is not what the Court said. Rather, the Court recognized that under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , a court may consider administrative burden in deciding whether to recognize any right of access in the first place, not that such a right of access exists but nonetheless gives way to countervailing considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    300 F.Supp.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he common law right of access does not entitle the petitioners to any additional retrospective relief.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/\">\n    at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"No retrospective right of access is recognized, in consideration of the significant administrative burdens that retrospective disclosure would impose on the Clerk's Office and USAO.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Similarly, the petitioners' assertion that \"the Court's recognition of administrative burden as a new\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factor will allow violations of the public's common law right of access so long as those violations are broad and systemic enough to be administratively challenging to remedy,\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 24, is predicated on a misunderstanding of the Court's decision. First, as explained above, administrative burden is not a new\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factor, but one\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   has always allowed a court to weigh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (instructing courts to weigh \"the particularized privacy\n   <em>\n    or other\n   </em>\n   interests that\" a \"defendants may assert\" to oppose unsealing (emphasis added) ). Second, also as explained above, cognizing administrative burden under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   will not \"allow violations of the public's common law right of access\" to go unremedied, as a court may conclude that no asserted common law right of access exists in the first place where recognizing such right of access would impose undue administrative burdens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

This is incorrect.
