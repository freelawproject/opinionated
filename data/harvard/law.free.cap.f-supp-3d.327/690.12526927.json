As the Board Chairman testified, in deciding whether to approve BRA's proposed Advisory Fee, the Board looked at \"the\n   <em>\n    Gartenberg\n   </em>\n   factors and anything else we consider[ed] relevant,\" including each of the\n   <em>\n    Gartenberg\n   </em>\n   factors. Deposition Transcript of Robert Hernandez (\"Hernandez Dep.\"), 35:3-11. At a subsequent meeting, usually held in May, the Board voted on whether to renew BRA's Advisory Fee. SOF \u00b6 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During and after the Fee Approval Meetings that were held in 2013, 2014, and 2015, the Board and the Board's Counsel also submitted to BlackRock written questions and requests for additional information and materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 142. During the Relevant Period, BlackRock provided over 300 pages of written responses and materials to the Board's follow-up inquiries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 143. For example, in 2014, the Board asked BlackRock for additional information regarding the fees that BlackRock receives for advisory services rendered to institutional investors, and requested that BlackRock perform a review of the advisory fee breakpoints contained in fee schedules across all funds under BlackRock's management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 145. The parties dispute the adequacy of BlackRock's responses to these inquiries.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; PRSOF \u00b6 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On at least two occasions during the Relevant Period, the Board negotiated to obtain fee concessions in favor of shareholders. First, in 2014, the Board asked\n   BlackRock to consider a voluntary fee reduction as a result of Equity Dividend's performance and BRA's estimated profit margin. SOF \u00b6 146. Although BlackRock initially rejected the Board's overtures,-based on its belief that Equity Dividend was priced competitively and the fact that additional breakpoints had been added to Equity Dividend's fee schedule in recent years-BlackRock ultimately agreed to modify the breakpoints in Equity Dividend's fee schedule to provide for reductions in BRA's Advisory Fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146. Additionally, in 2015, the Board asked BlackRock to agree to a temporary reduction in BRA's Advisory Fee for the Funds. SOF \u00b6 148. After initially objecting to these proposed fee reductions, BlackRock later agreed to temporarily waive a portion (.025%) of Equity Dividend's management fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D. BRA's Services to the Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To operate the Funds, BRA relies on a team of investment and non-investment personnel, including portfolio managers, senior analysts, quantitative strategists, marketing and communications strategists, research analysts, and administrative staff.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 149-150. It is undisputed that BRA provides certain investment advisory services to the Funds in exchange for the Advisory Fee, including investment research, securities selection and trading, and risk management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 149. The parties diverge, however, on the degree to which BRA, as opposed to third-party firms, provides the additional services necessary to operate the Funds, and as to whether BRA is compensated for any such additional services under the Advisory Fee, as opposed to under separate agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to Defendants, in addition to investment advisory services, BRA performs or oversees the following services (collectively, the \"Support Services\") required to operate the Funds: (i) providing accounting services, including the publication and verification of Funds' NAY,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 154-58; (ii) designing and implementing the Funds' compliance program,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 159-176; (iii) providing legal services to the Funds,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 177-84; (iv) supporting the Board in performing its reporting and management duties,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 185-97; (v) hiring and overseeing the Funds' service providers, including the Funds' accountant, custodian, and transfer agent,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 198-222; (vi) coordinating and ensuring compliance with the Funds' regulatory reporting and financial disclosure requirements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 223-30; (vii) overseeing the Funds' distribution partners and the distribution of the Funds' shares through various distribution channels,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 231-34; (viii) managing the Funds' dividend requirements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 235-36; (ix) complying and managing tax issues confronted by the Funds,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 237-39; and (x) providing recordkeeping services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 241-43. Defendants contend that BRA performs these Support Services in exchange for the Advisory Fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Conversely, Plaintiffs maintain that the Support Services are not performed by BRA under the IMAs or in exchange for the Advisory Fee. PSSOF \u00b6 27. In that regard, Plaintiffs point to the language of the Funds' contracts with third-party service providers-including the State Street Adm. Agreement, the BNY Agreement, the BBH Custodian Agreement, the State Street Custodian Agreement, and the Distribution Agreement-and contend that many of the Support Services identified by Defendants are actually provided by third-party service providers, for a separate fee.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs assert that, to the extent BRA plays a role in providing any of the Support Services to the Funds, the Funds pay fees and expenses to BRA separate from the Advisory Fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62-78. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that,\n   pursuant to certain reimbursement provisions in the IMAs, BRA receives separate compensation for various Support Services, including separate compensation for compliance services such as the compensation of the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer (\"CCO\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-67. Plaintiffs also assert that the Funds have reimbursed BRA for accounting services under the terms of the Accounting Agreement, and have reimbursed BRA for shareholder services pursuant to the SAS Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 68-73. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the Funds pay directly for certain operating expenses, including for reimbursement of the CCO's compensation and disinterested directors' fees, printing expenses, professional fees, registration fees, and other miscellaneous expenses.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-76. In total, Plaintiffs assert that, in addition to and apart from the Advisory Fee, Global Allocation paid BRA and third-party service providers approximately $846,095,752 in fees and expenses during the Relevant Period, with Equity Dividend paying approximately $330,617,830 in additional expenses and fees over the same timeframe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Subadvised Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The core of this case surrounds the scope and extent of the services that BRIM, an affiliate of BlackRock, performs as a subadvisor for seven mutual funds (collectively, the \"Subadvised Funds\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   organized and sponsored by various financial institutions unaffiliated with BlackRock, which serve as the investment advisers for the Subadvised Funds (collectively, the \"Independent Advisers\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   SOF \u00b6\u00b6 244-45. Like the Funds, the Subadvised Funds are open-end mutual funds registered under the ICA. PSSOF \u00b6 80. Each Subadvised Fund has its own board of directors or trustees. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 253, 255. The Subadvised Funds retain their own service providers, including advisers, transfer agents, and custodians.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 255, PSSOF \u00b6 83. These service providers conduct the Subadvised Funds' operations under the oversight of the Independent Advisers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 255; PSSOF \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Through subadvisory agreements with the Independent Advisers, BRIM renders subadvisory services to the Subadvised Funds in exchange for a fee (the \"Subadvisory Fee\"). SOF \u00b6 244; PSSOF \u00b6 85. The parties agree that BRIM performs substantially the same investment advisory (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , portfolio management) services for the Subadvised Funds that BRA performs for the Funds, including using substantially the same investment strategies, research and analysis, and systems, technology, and other resources in providing investment advisory services. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 261-63; PRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 261-63. Outside of portfolio\n   management services, however, the parties significantly dispute the scope and extent of the subadvisory services that BRIM renders to the Subadvised Funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOF \u00b6\u00b6 257-93; PRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 257-93; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 88-126; DRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 88-126. Specifically, the parties dispute whether BRIM performs the same Support Services, such as risk management, legal and compliance services, shareholder services, and accounting services, for the Subadvised Funds that BRA performs for the Funds, and, to the extent that BRIM does perform any of the same Support Services for the Subadvised Funds, the parties dispute the scope and extent of BRIM's role in providing those services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOF \u00b6\u00b6 257-93; PRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 257-93; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 88-126; DRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 88-126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the same way that BRA receives an Advisory Fee from the Funds, the Independent Advisers receive an advisory fee for performing advisory services for the Subadvised Funds.

For example, the nature and scope of the services provided to the proprietary mutual funds incorporates dedicated teams at BlackRock who work to support various functions, including but not limited to, legal, compliance, board governance, fund accounting, distribution, shareholder servicing, product development, and fund administration. Also, when BlackRock is acting as sub-adviser, we typically do not bear exposure to expense caps (as we do for our proprietary mutual fund business). The exposure to total expense caps on our proprietary mutual fund business exposes BlackRock to the risk of having to potentially subsidize the expenses of funds with small AUM levels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Naturally, the factors listed above, including the cost and the build out of a dedicated team to service a proprietary mutual fund business to provide a broad array of services to the mutual funds are significant factors in determining prices in that business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   The nature of the limited services we provide institutional and sub-advised accounts and associated costs are relevant to setting appropriate pricing for an institutional or sub-advised account. This is, however, only one of many factors. In addition, we consider, among other things, the capacity, size, and experience of the portfolio management team, the strategy, the amount and the varying level of risk, both with respect to liability and reputational risks, the type of account, the overall client relationship and the distribution level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   Sub-advisory fees are typically lower than \"standalone\" advisory fees paid by propriety funds as they take into account the lower risks associated with sub-advising third-party mandates and the limited nature of services being provided to the third-party fund family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   In summary when reviewing the management fee for different products managed by BlackRock the following items should be considered:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   \u2022 Diversity of services provided\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   \u2022 Diversity of distribution channel\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   \u2022 Differing levels of liability exposure and risks (e.g., liability from errors, reputational risk)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   \u2022 Market driven pricing\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   \u2022 Amount of aggregate assets managed by the team\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5803-04, 5083-05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The record also reflects that, although not included in the Services Checklist, the Board was provided with separate presentations and documentation regarding the role of third-party service providers in performing services for the Funds, the amounts that BRA receives as reimbursement for expenses from the Funds, and any services provided by BRA pursuant to agreements other than the Funds' IMAs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 203-04.

The record shows that, after engaging with BlackRock regarding the profitability of BRIM's subadvisory services, the Board determined that such an analysis would not be \"meaningful\" with regard to evaluating BRA's Advisory Fees. DRSOF \u00b6 207 (citing Hernandez Dep. at 152:6-155:16). Similarly, while Plaintiffs take issue with the fact that the Board never received a quantitative analysis of BlackRock's cost data to determine economies of scale, Defendants presented the Board with estimates of BRA's profitability from economies of scale, which were based on a cost allocation methodology developed by BlackRock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DRSOF \u00b6\u00b6 208-10.

And, as Plaintiffs conceded during oral argument, outside of the comparative fees factor, the only other evidence of excessive fees proffered by Plaintiffs in this case relates to economies of scale and profitability. See Transcript of Oral Argument (\"Tr.\") at 6:24-9:11,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackrock Mut. Funds Advisory Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-1165 (D.N.J. May 29, 2018) (ECF No. 144). Accordingly, even assuming that Plaintiffs have met their burden on the comparative fees factor, to withstand summary judgment, they must also have raised a dispute of fact as to either economies of scale or profitability. With that framework in mind, I turn to the parties' arguments on the comparative fees factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Defendants contend that a comparison of BRA's Advisory Fee to BRIM's Subadvisory\n   Fee is inapt, because the scope and scale of the services that BRA provides the Funds are vastly different from the services that BRIM provides the Subadvised Funds. Specifically, Defendants argue that, in addition to portfolio management services, BRA provides the Support Services to the Funds. Defendants' Brief in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defs.' Br.\"), at 10. Defendants maintain that although BRIM takes a limited role in performing some of those Support Services for the Subadvised Funds, BRIM's involvement pales in comparison to BRA's role in providing Support Services to the Funds, because BRA is responsible for performing, or supervising the performance of, all services essential to the operation of the Funds, including the Support Services, and bears a different amount of risk than BRIM. Tr. at 14:9-15:8. Thus, in light of the different services provided by BRA and BRIM, Defendants argue that a comparison of the Advisory Fee and the Subadvisory Fee is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that genuine issues of material fact exist, precluding this Court from determining that any comparison between the Advisory Fee and Subadvisory Fee is inapt as a matter of law. First, Plaintiffs note that BlackRock concedes that: (i) BRA and BRIM perform substantially the same portfolio management services for the Funds and the Subadvised Funds; (ii) the same portfolio managers are responsible for managing the assets of both the Funds and the Subadvised Funds; and (iii) BRA and BRIM employ substantially the same investment strategies, research and analysis, systems, technology, and other resources in providing investment advisory services to the Funds and the Subadvised Funds. Defs.' Br. at 12; SOF \u00b6\u00b6 261-63. Plaintiffs argue that because portfolio management is the main service that investment advisers perform for mutual funds, Defendants' concession that BRA and BRIM perform substantially similar portfolio management services, standing alone, is sufficient to find that the comparison between the Advisory Fee and the Subadvisory Fee is apt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs contend that the Support Services cannot serve as a justification for the disparity between the Advisory Fee and the Subadvisory Fee, because: (i) BRIM performs many of the same Support Services for the Subadvised Funds that BRA performs for the Funds, including providing similar compliance, recordkeeping, reporting, and operational services to the Subadvised Funds; (ii) most of the Support Services for the Funds are performed by third-party service providers under separate agreements and in exchange for separate fees, rather than by BRA in exchange for the Advisory Fee; (iii) to the extent that BRA has an oversight role in providing the Support Services, including monitoring and overseeing the work of third-party service providers, BRA is separately compensated for that role outside of the Advisory Fee; and (iv) BRA's contention that it provides a broader array of services to the Funds than BRIM provides to the Subadvised Funds is undermined by cost data analyzed by Plaintiffs' expert, Ian Ayres, Ph.D., which shows that BRIM's costs for providing services to the Subadvised Funds were comparable to, and sometimes greater than, the costs incurred by BRA in performing services for the Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that BRA cannot point to its risk and responsibility as a distinguishing factor, because: (i) there is no evidence in the record as to what that risk is; (ii) BRA's agreements with service providers include indemnification and limitation on liability provisions that limit BRA's risks; and (iii) BRIM has risks with respect to the Subadvised Funds. Tr. at 30:2-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Based on the record before me, I cannot find, on this Motion, that Plaintiffs' comparison between the Advisory Fee and the Subadvisory Fee is inapt as a matter of law. Significantly, this is not a case where Plaintiffs have failed to proffer any evidence that would tend to show that BRIM provided the Subadvisory Funds \"with the same sort of services that [BRA] provided to the [Funds], or that [BlackRock] incurred the same costs when serving different types of clients.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Harris Assocs. L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316372\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/611/359/#p361\">\n    611 F. App'x 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361 (7th Cir. 2015).

In that regard, Plaintiffs rely on the terms of BRA's agreements with various third-party service providers, including State Street, BNY, and BBH, in arguing that these service providers perform many of the Support Services that Defendants seek to use as a distinguishing factor from the services provided by BRIM to the Subadvised Funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 28-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that, for the fiscal years 2013 to 2016, Global Allocation paid more than $229 million annually in additional fees and expenses for services other than BRA's advisory services, with Equity Dividend paying more than $85 million annually in additional fees and expenses over the same period. Pls.' Opp. at 5 (citing PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 77-78). And, although Defendants argue that BRA monitors and oversees the work of these third-party service providers, Plaintiffs point to provisions in the IMAs, State Street Adm.

As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs cite to portions of the prospectuses for the Subadvised Funds that detail the risks faced by the Subadvised Funds, and argue that, based on BRIM's role in providing services to the Subadvised Funds, it shares in those risks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Thus, a dispute of material fact exists regarding the degree of risks assumed by BRA and BRIM in performing services for the Funds and the Subadvised Funds, respectively, and whether any differences in risk justify the disparity in fees.

Here, however, because a dispute of fact exists regarding the comparability of BRA and BRIM's services, and because Plaintiffs have proffered evidence regarding BRIM's Subadvisory Fee, drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs on this Motion, the potential exists for a finding at trial that the comparison between BRA and BRIM is apt, and therefore, that the Subadvisory Fee received by BRIM constitutes the relevant arm's-length range. While Lipper provides a competing set of data regarding the appropriate bargaining range, the Court cannot weigh those two comparisons at the summary judgment stage.

At the outset, Dr. Ayres states that economies of scale \"result when a provider of goods or services can increase its output without a proportionate increase in its costs of production.\" Ayres Rpt. \u00b6 94. According to Dr. Ayres, in such circumstances, \"the provider's per-unit costs of production decrease as output increases,\" and the resultant savings can either \"be captured by the producer in the form of higher profits, or they can be passed through to the consumer in the form of lower prices or fees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201084140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   With respect to the mutual fund industry, Dr. Ayres opines that, absent economies of scale, \"mutual funds would have no reason to exist, because they would offer no competitive advantage relative to other forms of investment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99. In that regard, Dr. Ayres explains that in a mutual fund, investors can pool their money together to pursue an investment strategy based on a diverse portfolio of securities, while spreading the fixed costs of maintaining such a portfolio among investors.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 99-100. For example, Dr. Ayres states that mutual funds incur transaction costs \"whenever shares are purchased or sold in order to re-balance the mutual fund's portfolio in a manner commensurate with its investment objectives (or to adjust the portfolio in light of changing market conditions).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100. According to Dr. Ayres, while these transaction costs would be prohibitively expensive for an individual investor, by pooling the assets of a large number of investors, \"mutual funds spread transaction costs among all fund shareholders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In turn, \"[p]ooling allows mutual funds to exploit scale economies with respect to the major costs involved with maintaining a diversified pool of stocks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99.

Specifically, Dr. Ayres noted that, from 2007 to 2015, BRA's income statements for the Funds reflect the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    AUM.\n   </strong>\n   Global Allocation's AUM grew from approximately $20.1 billion to $52.4 billion (a 159.9% increase, or 12.7% increase annually), and Equity Dividend's AUM grew from approximately $1.5 billion to $24.7 billion (a\n   1,501.4% increase, or 41.4% increase annually).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Figure 32-33.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Operating Expenses.\n   </strong>\n   Global Allocation's operating expenses rose from [redacted] and Equity Dividend's operating profits grew from [redacted].\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Revenue.\n   </strong>\n   Global Allocation's revenue grew from [redacted] and Equity Dividend's revenue grew from [redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Operating Profits.\n   </strong>\n   Global Allocation's operating profits grew from [redacted] and Equity Dividend's operating profits grew from [redacted].\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Operating Margin.\n   </strong>\n   Global Allocation's operating margin increased from [redacted] and Equity Dividend's operating margin increased from [redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Ratio of Operating Expenses to AUM.\n   </strong>\n   Global Allocation's ratio of operating expenses to AUM decreased from [redacted] and Equity Dividend's ratio of operating expenses to AUM decreased from [redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Relying on this financial information, Dr. Ayres asserts that economies of scale were realized from 2007 to 2015, because the increase in operating expenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Funds [redacted] annually for Global Allocation and [redacted] annually for Equity Dividend) were \"significantly less\" than the increases in either AUM (12.7% annually for Global Allocation and 41.4% annually for Equity Dividend) or revenue [redacted] annually for Global Allocation and [redacted] annually for Equity Dividend).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 106-07. Next, because BRA's profits from the Funds increased at a higher rate than both AUM and costs ( [redacted] for Global Allocation, and [redacted] for Equity Dividend), Dr. Ayres concludes that BRA retained the benefits of economies of scale, rather than passing them along to the Funds' shareholders in the form of lower fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107. Stated another way, after defining economies of scale as increased output without a proportional increase in production costs, Dr. Ayres found that the BRA realized economies of scale from the Funds between 2007 and 2015, because the Funds' AUM (output) and revenue increased without a proportional increase in operating expenses (production costs). And, because BRA's profits from the Funds increased at a higher rate than either AUM or operating expenses over that period, Dr. Ayres submits that BRA retained the benefits of economies of scale, rather than passing them on to the Funds or their shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Additionally, to show the extent to which BRA benefited from economies of scale, Dr. Ayres conducted an alternative analysis based on a comparison of BRA's actual profits and the profits that BRA would have enjoyed from the Funds, had profits increased at the same rate as the Funds' AUM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109. Based on his analysis, Dr. Ayres concluded that, from 2007 to 2015, BRA realized [redacted] in additional profits than it would have received had BRA's profit margin from Global Allocation increased at the same rate as the Fund's AUM (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , at [redacted] ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the same period, Dr. Ayres calculated that BRA realized [redacted] in additional profits from Equity Dividend than it would have if profits had increased at the same rate as the Fund's AUM (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , at [redacted] ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, Dr. Ayres determined that, in the Relevant Period alone, BRA realized [redacted] in additional profits from the Funds than it would have had profits increased in proportion to the Funds' AUM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 193, 195 (citing Ayres Rpt. if \u00b6 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Notwithstanding Dr. Ayres' report and deposition testimony, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden on either prong of the economies of scale test. Specifically, Defendants argue that Dr. Ayres' analysis is flawed, because: (i) it takes into account \"additional profits\" beginning in 2007, despite the fact that the recoverable damages period for Plaintiffs' \u00a7 36(b) claim began in February 2013; (ii) it fails to acknowledge that the economies of scale factor does not require that an adviser share all realized economies of scale with shareholders; and (iii) it fails to account for non-pecuniary benefits, such as BlackRock's investments in personnel, technology, and infrastructure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. at 28. Defendants also argue that Dr. Ayres' analysis is insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish that BRA realized economies of scale, because Dr. Ayres failed to show that BRA's per-unit transaction costs decreased as the Funds' assets increased.

The Court will address each of these arguments as they apply to the relevant prongs of the economies of scale test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Prior to analyzing whether Plaintiffs have met their summary judgment burden under each prong of the economies of scale test, however, I must first resolve the parties' dispute regarding the applicable timeframe in analyzing economies of scale. Defendants argue that Dr. Ayres' economies of scale analysis is flawed, because Dr. Ayres calculates economies of scale beginning in 2007, when the relevant timeframe on Plaintiffs' \u00a7 36(b) claim began in February 2013, one year before the commencement of this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. at 28.

Opp. at 27. Indeed, Plaintiffs note that Dr. Ayres explained during his deposition and in his rebuttal report that looking to a broader period is particularly appropriate in this case, because it better corresponds to increases in the Funds' AUM.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Deposition Transcript of Ian Ayres (\"Ayres Dep.\"), at 8:12-10:11 and Lakind Decl., Ex. 190, Rebuttal Report of Ian Ayres (\"Ayres Rebuttal Rpt\"), \u00b6\u00b6 57-59). Specifically, in his rebuttal report, Dr. Ayres explained that he examined economies of scale from 2007 to 2015, rather than just in the Relevant Period, because: (i) \"[w]hile failures to share profits from economies of scale over the shorter period would be an independent grounds for an opinion, seeing such a failure over a longer time period is also a reasonable basis for an opinion that BlackRock had a continuing policy of not sharing profits from economies of scale, particularly where the longer time period corresponds with significant increases in AUM\"; and (ii) \"[a]nalyzing multiple time periods also limits the effects of outlier years.\" Ayres Rebuttal Rpt. \u00b6 57. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that, even if limited to the Relevant Period, Dr. Ayres' analysis shows that BRA realized and inequitably retained more than [redacted] in economies of scale from the Funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

At the outset, the court recounted the findings in\n   <em>\n    Krinsk\n   </em>\n   , and explained that a plaintiff bears the following burden of proof on the realization prong of the economies of scale test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   [T]o demonstrate breach of fiduciary duty in respect of economies of scale, an investor must first prove that in fact the fund realized economies of scale.

To place that burden of proof upon a plaintiff accords with logic and common sense, as Judge Pollack observed in\n   <em>\n    Gartenberg I. Economies of scale do not exist in a vacuum. The concept is meaningful only if increased size of a fund (more shareholders, more assets under management) directly reduces the manager's costs of processing each transaction and servicing each shareholder.\n   </em>\n   A plaintiff must prove that the fund actually realized such economies of scale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1238-39 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Having set forth the applicable standard, the\n   <em>\n    Kalish\n   </em>\n   court turned to whether the plaintiffs satisfied their burden of showing that economies of scale were realized. Significantly, the court noted that, as acknowledged by the plaintiffs' expert at trial, the \"plaintiffs did not attempt a study to determine if the per-unit cost of each transaction for the Fund decreased as the number of transactions increased.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1238-39. Rather, to show economies of scale, the expert pointed to the fact that expenses had increased at a slower rate than revenues at a time when the fund's assets grew, and drew an inference from these circumstances that the adviser's per-unit cost of performing fund transactions declined as the fund grew in size.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1239-40. However, the court found that these statistics were insufficient \"to carry plaintiffs' burden of proving the realization of economies of scale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1240. With respect to the declining ratio of expenses to revenues at a time of increasing size, the court explained that \"Judge Walker squarely held in\n   <em>\n    Krinsk\n   </em>\n   that economies of scale could not necessarily be inferred from those circumstances, and the Second Circuit affirmed him on the point, adding its own analysis of what a plaintiff had to prove.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, because the plaintiffs did not show that the fund's per-unit transaction costs declined as its assets grew, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden on the economies of scale factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1239-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

There, the plaintiffs sought to establish the existence of economies of scale by relying on the analyses and trial testimony of their expert, who opined that economies of scale could be inferred from the fact that the ratio of expenses to assets for the at-issue fund did not increase proportionally from one year to the next.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *29.

Moreover, the court found that the expert's \"analyses of whether economies of scale were realized [were] also defective because he improperly assumed that any changes in Defendants' costs were the result of economies of scale, when in fact those cost changes may have been caused by other factors unrelated to scale,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , such as technological changes, changes in input pricing, or changes in the level of service provided by an adviser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *28.

App'x 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (9th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Here, at first read, it appears that Dr. Ayres' analysis for establishing economies of scale is substantially similar to the analyses that were rejected in the foregoing cases. That is, Dr. Ayres has opined that economies of scale existed based on disproportionality between the growth in the Funds' AUM and the increase in operational costs between 2007 and 2015. Significantly, however, it is unclear, from the record before me, whether Dr. Ayres performed the additional step that the courts in\n   <em>\n    Krinsk,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalish\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Mut. Funds Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   found was necessary to demonstrate the realization of economies of scale;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , conducting a per-unit transaction cost analysis. In that regard, my ability to consider this purported deficiency in Dr. Ayres' analysis is limited by the fact that Defendants raised the issue of Dr. Ayres' failure to conduct a per-unit transaction cost analysis for the first time in their reply brief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   and failed to question Dr. Ayres on that issue while taking his deposition. Moreover, unlike the post-trial decisions in\n   <em>\n    Krinsk,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalish\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Mut. Funds Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   , here, the Court is without the benefit of Dr. Ayres' trial testimony. Accordingly, based on the limited record regarding transaction costs, this Court lacks a sufficient basis to conclude that Dr. Ayres failed to conduct a per-unit transaction cost analysis in determining the existence of economies of scale, or otherwise failed to exclude external factors that could have resulted in the disproportionate growth rates between BRA's operating expenses and the Funds' AUM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Moreover, when questioned on this point at the summary judgment hearing, Plaintiffs argued that Dr. Ayres did, in fact, perform a per-unit transaction cost analysis. Specifically, Plaintiffs responded to this Court's inquiries as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   THE COURT: In [Defendants'] reply brief they point to the following standard that: \"For economies of scale you must demonstrate that BRA's cost per\n   transaction for the funds decreased as its AUM increased.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   So my question for you-and certainly there are a couple of Circuits that have used that and many cases that have used that-first, do you agree that that's the proper standard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   PLAINTIFFS: No, your Honor, I do not. It depends on what \"cost per transaction\" means. Because, your Honor, what we have done here is we have shown that, as these [Funds] have increased in size, [BRA's] cost of providing services to those [Funds] has decreased as a percentage of assets under management. What that means is that for every new dollar that comes into one of these [Funds] [BRA's] cost of managing each dollar decreases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   So insofar as cost per dollar is cost per transaction, then I agree and that's an appropriate standard. If cost per transaction is supposed to mean something different from cost per dollar of assets under management, then I disagree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   Assets under management or AUM is absolutely a standard measure of scale or size in the mutual fund industry. It's regularly used by academics in analyzing scales. That's the measure that Dr. Ayres used-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   The last point I'll mention on the per transaction question is that Dr. Ayres looked at all of BlackRock's costs including whatever costs there are for supervising the transfer agent, for supervising State Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   Any costs that they claim are included in there, any costs that they claim to have incurred are included in Dr. Ayres' analysis. So insofar as he's showing cost decreasing as assets increase, he's captured the cost of servicing shareholders or anything else that BlackRock claims to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Tr. at 45:21-46:23, 51:3-13. As this excerpt shows, Plaintiffs contend that Dr. Ayres' analysis of BRA's costs for providing services to the Funds does in fact show a decrease in expenses relative to assets on a per-unit (per-dollar) basis. While Defendants have raised the per-unit transaction cost issue on this Motion, they had the opportunity to question Dr. Ayres regarding his purported failure to conduct such an analysis during his deposition, and failed to do so. Without that information, I have no basis for rejecting Plaintiffs' contention that Dr. Ayres performed the requisite analysis, and thus, a dispute of fact exists as to whether BRA realized economies of scale from the Funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   In short, the fact remains that Plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Ayres, opined that the disproportionality between the growth in the Funds' assets and operating expenses shows that BRA realized economies of scale from the Funds, and a factual dispute exists regarding whether Dr. Ayres conducted the requisite per-unit analysis to demonstrate economies of scale. While the post-trial decisions in\n   <em>\n    Krinsk,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalish\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Mut. Funds Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   ultimately found that the experts' failures to conduct a per-unit transaction cost analysis precluded a finding that economies of scale were realized, at this stage, absent testimony on that issue, this Court cannot conclude that the disproportionality between the increase in operating expenses and AUM was not the result of economies of scale. Indeed, while I agree that it will be Plaintiffs' burden at trial to prove that the decrease in operating expenses was the result of economies of scale, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs\n   on this Motion, the possibility remains that the lack of proportionality was due entirely to economies of scale, rather than other cost changes. Accordingly, although I find that Plaintiffs have sustained their burden of raising a triable issue on the economies of scale factor, as the post-trial decisions in\n   <em>\n    Krinsk,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalish\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Mut. Funds Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   illustrate, it will be Plaintiffs' burden at trial to show that any disproportionality between the Funds' asset growth and operating expenses is attributable to economies of scale, rather than other cost savings unrelated to scale economies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Having found that Plaintiffs have raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the Funds realized economies of scale, I turn, next, to the question of whether the Funds have adequately shared any economies of scale with investors. In that regard, once a plaintiff demonstrates that economies of scale have been realized, it then must show that the savings realized from economies of scale were not adequately shared with the at-issue fund or its investors.\n   <em>\n    Pirundini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525089\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/156/\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201084140\">\n    2018 WL 1084140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7393809\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/742/1222/#p1237\">\n    742 F.Supp. at 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If a plaintiff makes [the threshold] showing, then the question becomes whether the fund has permitted shareholders to participate, at least in part, in the economies of scale it has realized.\"). \"Economies of scale can be shared with fund shareholders in a number of ways, including breakpoints, fee reductions and waivers, offering low fees from inception, or making additional investments to enhance shareholder services.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Opp. at 26. In that regard, Plaintiffs once again point to the report of Dr. Ayres, who determined that, even after any sharing, BRA captured [redacted] in economies of scale from 2007 to 2015, and [redacted] in additional profits from economies of scale during the Relevant Period alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ayres Rpt. \u00b6 109, Figures 38-39; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 191-95.

Defendants further maintain that the fact that BRA's profit margins for managing the Funds are within the range upheld by other courts is dispositive on the profitability factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   First, I reject Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs cannot compare BRA's profitability from the Funds to BRIM's profitability from the Subadvised Funds.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Schuyt\n   </em>\n   , however, here, Plaintiffs have raised a dispute of fact regarding the comparability of the services rendered by BRA to the Funds and BRIM to the Subadvised Funds. Should trial reveal that the services provided by BRA and BRIM are in fact comparable, Plaintiffs may present their theory as proof that BRA's profitability from the Funds is disproportionate to the services that BRA provides to the Funds. Indeed, in light of the substantial disputes regarding the services that BRA actually performs for the Funds, it necessarily follows that a dispute exists regarding the ultimate question on profitability in this case-whether BRA's profitability from the Funds is disproportionate to the services rendered. Moreover, Defendants have not cited to any authority holding, as a matter of law, that a comparison of profit margins across different clients cannot factor into the profitability analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I find that Plaintiffs have raised a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether BRA's profitability from the Funds is disproportionate to the services provided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Notwithstanding Plaintiffs' comparative profitability arguments, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate excessive profitability, because BRA's profit margins for managing the funds are within the range that other courts have upheld as appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kasilag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20773880\">\n    2017 WL 773880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *22 (finding that the plaintiffs \"failed to meet their burden of establishing that the Funds were so profitable that their fee could not have been negotiated at arm's-length,\" where the adviser's pre-tax profit margins ranged between 45.6% and 80.3%, excluding distribution fees);\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

With respect to the non-dispositive nature of the cases cited by Defendants, Plaintiffs emphasize that in\n   <em>\n    Schuyt\n   </em>\n   , the court clarified that it was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   ...\n   <em>\n    not holding that a profit margin of up to 77.3% can never be excessive. In fact, under other circumstances, such a profit margin could very well be excessive.\n   </em>\n   For example, if advisory services being challenged were not of the highest quality and if the directors were not so obviously qualified, fully informed, and conscientious, a similar fee structure could violate section 36(b). This Court is simply holding that on the facts presented here, the fee schedules at issue represent charges within the range of what would have been negotiated at arms-length in the light of all of the surrounding circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7399514\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/663/962/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 989 n. 77 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Defendants' arguments regarding the profit margins upheld by other courts are unavailing, because: (i) a factual dispute exists regarding the differences between BRA and BRIM's profit margins; and (ii) \u00a7 36(b) requires a totality of the circumstances approach, and thus, a profit margin that is not excessive upon certain facts may be excessive under another. Indeed, the fact-intensive nature of the profitability inquiry is highlighted by the fact that each of the decisions relied upon by Defendants was rendered after trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kasilag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20773880\">\n    2017 WL 773880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *24 (entering judgment in favor of the defendants after a bench trial);\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Nonetheless, I note that the examples cited by the\n   <em>\n    Schuyt\n   </em>\n   court as potentially requiring a different result on profitability-the quality of the advisory services and independence and conscientiousness of the board-are not issue in this case, and thus, cannot be asserted at trial as a basis for distinguishing this case from those decisions upholding certain profitability margins on similar facts. Rather, in seeking to overcome the weight of authority holding that the profit margins realized by BRA fail to indicate excessive fees, as well as the considerable deference afforded the Board on this factor, Plaintiffs will be limited to presenting their comparative theory of profitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

In light of this Court's finding that the Board's approval of BRA's Advisory Fee is entitled to substantial deference, this factor does not weigh in favor of finding that the Advisory Fee is outside the range of arm's-length bargaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201394347\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Gartenberg\n    </em>\n    Outcome\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that genuine disputes of material fact exist regarding the comparative fees, economies of scale, and profitability factors of the\n   <em>\n    Gartenberg\n   </em>\n   test, and thus, as to whether the Advisory Fee falls outside the range of arm's-length bargaining, rendering summary judgment inappropriate. However, in light of this Court's finding that the Board's decision to approve BRA's Advisory Fee is entitled to substantial deference, the Court expects that trial will be limited to the other relevant\n   <em>\n    Gartenberg\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO PRECLUDE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Plaintiffs move, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, to preclude Defendants from relying on evidence and arguments regarding the following three\n   topics based on Defendants' failure to provide complete discovery on those matters: (i) the legal services that BRA performs for the Funds; (ii) the distribution-related services that BRA performs for the Funds;\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) the analysis conducted by E &amp; Y and provided to the Board regarding BRA's Advisory Fee. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that preclusion is warranted, because Defendants objected to discovery concerning legal services on the grounds of attorney-client privilege, refused to respond to document requests regarding distribution, and failed to produce the E &amp; Y analysis even though it was responsive to Plaintiffs' requests. Additionally, Plaintiffs seek to strike certain portions of the Certification of John Perlowski in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Perlowski Cert.\") regarding materials provided to the Board (\u00b6\u00b6 14, 16) and purported savings from breakpoints (\u00b6\u00b6 35-36) as violative of Federal Rule of Evidence 1006. Conversely, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs' Motion to Preclude is both procedurally and substantively defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The Court need not resolve Plaintiffs' Motion at this time, because, even though the Court generally referred to the E &amp; Y analysis and BRA's legal and distribution-related services, the Court did not rely on those facts in deciding Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Stated differently, the E &amp; Y analysis and legal and distribution services did not form the basis for this Court's consideration of any of the factors at dispute in this case. Moreover, the Court did not refer to the paragraphs of the Perlowski Certification that Plaintiffs argue must be precluded. Therefore, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' Motion to Preclude without prejudice. To the extent Plaintiffs seek to renew these arguments prior to trial, they may file motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to that effect, in accordance with the forthcoming trial scheduling order that will be issued by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, insofar as Defendants seek a ruling that the decision of the Board to approve BRA's Advisory Fee is entitled to substantial deference, and denied, insofar as Defendants seek the dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims.
