Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged assault, battery, excessive force, false imprisonment,\n   failure to intervene, gross negligence, abuse of process, and trespass in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as corresponding state law, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, municipal liability, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court held a jury trial commencing on May 15, 2017. Upon a motion by Village Defendants, at the close of evidence, the Court dismissed Mr. Greenaway's claims of gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Village of Hempstead Police Officer (\"Village Officer\") Ohr. The following claims were submitted to the jury: false imprisonment, excessive force, unlawful entry/trespass, failure to intervene, municipal liability, gross negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Ct. Ex. 1, ECF No. 131.) On May 22, 2017, the jury returned a verdict finding as follows: (1) Nassau County Police Officers (\"County Officers\") Papa, Schmitt, Hudson, Stio, and the County of Nassau (the \"County\") liable on Plaintiff Greenaway's claim for false imprisonment, fixing damages against the County at $100,000; (2) County Officers Hudson, Stio, and the County liable on Plaintiff Greenaway's claim of excessive force, fixing damages against the County at $7,500,000; (3) Village Officer Ohr and the Incorporated Village of Hempstead (the \"Village\") liable on Mrs. Knight and Mr. Knight's claims for excessive force fixing damages against the Village at $50,000 and $35,000, respectively; (4) all officers, the County, and the Village liable on Mr. Greenaway, Mrs. Knight, and Mr. Knight's unlawful entry/trespass claims, fixing damages against the County and Village at $100,000; (5) all officers liable on Mr. Greenaway, Mrs. Knight, and Mr. Knight's failure to intervene claims, fixing damages evenly against the individual officers at $120,000, $50,000, and $30,000, respectively; (6) Village Officer Ohr liable on Mrs. Knight and Mr. Knight's claims for gross negligence, fixing damages against Village Officer Ohr at $50,000 and $35,000, respectively; (7) County Officers Hudson and Stio liable for punitive damages to Mr. Greenaway, fixing damages against the individual officers at $100,000 each; and (8) Village Officer Ohr liable for punitive damages to Mrs. Knight, fixing damages against Village Officer Ohr for $50,000.

(Mot. J. Matter of Law, ECF No. 140.)

(Tr. 27-28, 530, 778-84, 862-64, 887, ECF No. 150-2, Ex. 2-7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Greenaway's therapist testified that he was making consistent progress, intensely working towards recovery, developing goals, verbalizing himself emotionally, and challenging his core beliefs system. (Tr. 782-83.) During this time, Mr. Greenaway resided with his parents at 218 Amherst Street in Hempstead, New York. (Tr. 29.) Mrs. Knight, Mr. Greenaway's mother, is a retired\n   district manager for the Social Security Administration. (Tr. 26-27.) Mr. Knight, Mr. Greenaway's stepfather, formerly worked for the state of New York as a disability analyst. (Tr. 586, 660.) Together, the Knights owned their residence located at 218 Amherst Street and a nearby rental property located at 221 Amherst Street. (Tr. 28, 584.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 25, 2010, Mr. Greenaway had planned to move from his parents' home to the rental property. (Tr. 29.) By this date, Mrs. Knight had grown concerned that Mr. Greenaway may have stopped taking his medication. (Tr. 30-33, 68-69.) At some point that day, Mr. Greenaway left his parents' home and Mrs. Knight was uncertain of his whereabouts. (Tr. 33.) Mrs. Knight shared her concerns about Mr. Greenaway's mental status with Mr. Knight, who subsequently drove around the Village of Hempstead searching for Mr. Greenaway. (Tr. 587.) While driving, Mr. Knight happened upon Village Officer Lonnie Johnson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Knight asked Village Officer Johnson to either assist in his effort to locate Mr. Greenaway or \"be on the lookout\" for his son because, as he indicated to Village Officer Johnson, Mr. Greenaway was decompensating. (Tr. 587-88.) When Village Officer Johnson asked what \"decompensating\" meant, Mr. Knight testified that he left to continue his search alone believing that nothing \"fruitful\" would come from further interaction with Village Officer Johnson. (Tr. 595.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Mr. Knight was searching for Mr. Greenaway, Mrs. Knight spoke with Mr. Cleaster Brooks, the Knights' tenant of five years. (Tr. 34-35, 88-89.) Mr. Brooks informed Mrs. Knight that he and Mr. Greenaway had just had a \"pushing match\" and suggested to Mrs. Knight that Mr. Greenaway go to the hospital. (Tr. 34, 69, 89-91.) After hearing about the pushing match, Mrs. Knight grew increasingly concerned and called 911 seeking assistance in taking Mr. Greenaway to the hospital. (Tr. 34-35.) Mrs. Knight informed the 911 operator that Mr. Greenaway suffered from bipolar disorder and he was not \"that violent.\" (Tr. 35.) At some point, Mr. Knight received a phone call informing him that Mr. Greenaway was at home. (Tr. 595.) Mrs. Knight then went across the street to join her husband, who had since arrived at the 221 Amherst Street home. (Tr. 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the 221 Amherst Street residence, Mr. Greenaway was found in the bathroom adjacent to the master bedroom where he was alone and painting the walls. Mr. Knight encouraged Mr. Greenaway to go to the hospital. (Tr. 35-36, 625, 868-69.) In response, Mr. Greenaway \"very calm[ly]\" stated that he was painting at the moment and did not want to go to the hospital. (Tr. 36, 70, 625-26.) A similar exchange took place between Mr. Greenaway and Mrs. Knight. To Mrs. Knight, however, Mr. Greenaway indicated that he would prefer to go to the hospital the following day. (Tr. 36-37, 70, 103-04.) Mrs. Knight then went downstairs to see if assistance had arrived. (Tr. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Mrs. Knight arrived downstairs, she noticed two Village police cars pulling up to the rental property. (Tr. 37.) Mrs. Knight then escorted two officers (identified at trial as Village Officers and Johnson) upstairs to assist with getting her son to go to the hospital. (Tr. 37-38, 644.) When they arrived at the master bedroom, Mr. Greenaway was still in the bathroom painting. (Tr. 150.) At this time, Village Officer Reado asked Mr. Greenaway a number of questions and suggested that they go to the hospital together. (Tr. 38, 643, 869, 925.) Mr. Greenaway continued to paint and expressed that he did not want to go to the hospital at that time. (Tr. 39.) During the conversation, Mr. Greenaway provided Village Officer Reado with his\n   drivers' license, which indicated that he resided at the 221 Amherst Street home. (Tr. 39, 603, 629-30, 869-70.) Mr. Greenaway asked Village Officer Reado if he was under arrest or had any outstanding tickets; Village Officer Reado responded, \"no.\" (Tr. 39, 604, 629-30, 644, 869-71.) Nonetheless, Village Officer Reado remained \"persistent\" that Mr. Greenaway go to the hospital. (Tr. 869-70.) Mr. Greenaway then asked Village Officer Reado to leave his home-and indicated that he was fine. (Tr. 39, 62, 630, 644, 870-71.) Throughout this exchange, Mr. Greenaway maintained a calm demeanor and continued to paint. (Tr. 39, 602, 871.) Mrs. Knight testified that she did not want Village Officer Reado to leave at this time because she felt that he was doing a good job engaging her son. (Tr. 103.) Village Officer Reado's conversation with Mr. Greenaway lasted at least fifteen to twenty minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additional officers from the County and Village, some of whom were members of the County's emergency special unit, subsequently arrived at the scene. Mr. Knight testified that once the additional officers arrived, there was a \"change.\" (Tr. 49, 101, 605, 607.) According to Mr. Knight, the \"attitude\" in the room became confrontational and aggressive as Village and County Officers began to crowd Mr. Greenaway. (Tr. 605, 607.) Mr. Knight asked the police officers to leave his home two or three times. (Tr. 611-12.) Village Officer Ohr told Mr. Knight, \"You got to get the fuck out of here. We need you the fuck out of here.\" (Tr. 605, 656.) Mrs. Knight heard Village Officer Johnson say, \"Fuck this shit. This is enough.\" (Tr. 49, 103.) As she heard that statement, she stepped out of the bathroom and saw County Officer Hudson crouched down with what she believed was a gun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 49, 76-78.) When she questioned County Officer Hudson about the \"gun,\" Village Officer Ohr began to shove her forcibly out of the master bedroom. (Tr. 49-50.) Next, Village Officer Ohr took Mrs. Knight's phone and threw it out of the bedroom. (Tr. 50.) He then pushed Mrs. Knight out of the bedroom door causing her to land on her back. (Tr. 50.) Shortly thereafter, Village Officer Ohr began to shove Mr. Knight out of the master bedroom as well. (Tr. 608.) Mr. Knight, who was trying to stay close to his son, clung to the doorframe, but after a minute or two, was forced out into the hallway by Village Officer Ohr. (Tr. 51-52, 608-09, 619-20, 658.) The bedroom door slammed shut and Mr. Knight heard the deadbolt lock. (Tr. 52-53, 105, 609-10.) Mr. Knight began to bang on the door and yell, among other things, for the police officers to leave his home. (Tr. 62-63, 105, 610-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Inside the master bathroom, Mr. Greenaway continued to paint. He testified that he then noticed Village Officer Reado look back and step to the side. (Tr. 872-73.) Village Officer Reado then gave a command for an officer to tase Mr. Greenaway. (Tr. 182-83, 243.) Without warning, Mr. Greenaway was shot with the Taser by County Officer Hudson. (316, 872-73.) County Officers Hudson and Stio testified that at the time the Taser was first deployed, Mr. Greenaway was not threatening any officer. (Tr. 319, 720.) County Officer Stio, who also shot Mr. Greenaway with a Taser, testified that he did not deem Mr. Greenaway a danger to himself. (Tr. 769-70.) In total, Mr. Greenaway was shot with a Taser four times. (Tr. 185, 613, 872-73.) Throughout the ordeal, Mr. and\n   Mrs. Knight could hear the electrical popping noises of the Taser as it was discharged and the simultaneous screams from their son. (Tr. 53-54, 80-81, 612-13.) Mr. Greenaway too could hear his parents screaming in the hallway. (Tr. 873-74.) Minutes later, Mr. Greenaway was carried out of his home on a gurney; he was naked, covered in white paint, and had a sheet strewn across his body. (Tr. 54-57, 615.) As Mr. Greenaway was carried out of the home, Mr. Knight observed that Mr. Greenaway was semi-conscious. (Tr. 615.) Mrs. Knight, however, feared that Mr. Greenaway was dead. (Tr. 54-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Greenaway was taken to the hospital, where he remained for almost two weeks.

Nothing about this motion could have put Plaintiffs on notice that Village Defendants were moving to dismiss the failure to intervene claim for lack of evidence. The motion was made on the grounds of qualified immunity. As Village Defendants are assuredly aware, the application of qualified immunity necessarily presumes the underlying conduct. It says in essence that although an officer may have engaged in wrongful conduct, he is shielded from liability nonetheless. It is, therefore, inconceivable that by arguing for qualified immunity on behalf of Village Officer Ohr, Plaintiffs would be put on notice that Village Defendants were challenging the sufficiency of the evidence for the underlying charge of failure to intervene-let alone any specific element necessary to prove that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Village Defendants correctly point out that they can potentially overcome this deficiency because waiver can be excused to prevent manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruz v.

Instead, Village Defendants' argument amounts to nothing more than an improper procedural workaround for a patently untimely motion. Even if, as Village Defendants suggest, they would have prevailed on a timely motion, it cannot overcome the requirements read into Rule 50.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mealey v.

For instance, can the emotionally disturbed person be lawfully confined against his or her express wishes? Is it okay to use or order the use of a Taser on that person as a means to effectuate his or her confinement? Undoubtedly, training would assist an officer in making the choice whether to involuntarily confine someone.

County Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    County Defendants' Failure to Preserve Arguments Constitutes Waiver\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As with Village Defendants, County Defendants move pursuant to Rule 50 to dismiss certain of Plaintiffs' claims. In particular, County Defendants move for judgment as a matter of law on the following claims: (1) false imprisonment claim on the grounds that several Officers testified to circumstances that form bases for probable cause, (County Defs.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Set Aside J. (\"County Defs.' Br.\"), at 18-20, ECF No. 142-1.); (2) excessive force claim on the grounds that the use of the Taser was reasonable, as \"the least amount of physical force to seize Greenaway,\" (County Defs.' Br. at 23.); (3) unlawful entry/trespass claim on the grounds that exigent circumstances justified the Officers remaining in the home, (County Defs.' Br. at 30.); and (4) punitive damages on the grounds that County Officers Hudson and Stio did not violate any constitutional right of Mr. Greenaway, (County Defs.' Br. at 32.). None of these arguments were raised by County Defendants at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At trial, County Defendants made the following Rule 50 motion: \"I will make it simple [J]udge, in that I join in the Village's application on the Rule 50 application in all respects and as to all charges, a reasonable jury could not find the facts according to the law.\" (Tr. 1031.) County Defendants tethered their Rule 50 application to Village Defendants' application. Thus, to the extent Village Defendants did not raise an issue neither did County Defendants. With respect to the excessive force, unlawful entry/trespass, and punitive damages motions, County Defendants are left, therefore, to rely only on the highly unspecific motion made by Village Defendants for dismissal of all claims on qualified immunity grounds. This motion fails to properly notice Plaintiffs of County Defendants' current arguments on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Likewise, the trial motion made by Village Defendants on the false imprisonment claim did not properly preserve County Defendants' current motion. Village Defendants stated: \"Your Honor, at this time we also move to dismiss the false imprisonment claim against the Village of Hempstead Officers. I don't think there's any testimony that has been presented to the [C]ourt or the jury that the Village Officers took Mr. Greenaway into custody.\" (Tr. 1025.) Nothing about Village Defendants' motion would put Plaintiffs on notice that County Defendants were arguing that purported evidence of probable cause precluded a finding of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, County Defendants do not press an argument that an exception should apply to prevent manifest injustice-nor could they successfully. Each of County Defendants' Rule 50 arguments were waived and their motion is denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530742\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/1148/#p1155\">\n    34 F.3d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1155 (\"Thus, if an issue is not raised in a previous motion for a directed verdict, a Rule 50(b) motion should not be granted unless it is 'required to prevent manifest injustice.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Jury's Verdict Was Supported by Sufficient Evidence\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    1. County's Rule 59 Motion for a New Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At trial, Plaintiffs presented the jury with a narrative that was sadly\n   straightforward. Mr. Greenaway suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. (Tr. 28.) In the months leading up to the April 25, 2010 incident, he had made substantial progress in several respects. (Tr. 782-83.) He was going to school, working, improving interpersonal relationships, and having conversations with his therapist about maintaining balance and self-awareness. (Tr. 781-84.) One day, concerned that Mr. Greenaway may be decompensating, Mrs. Knight called 911 seeking police assistance to transport Mr. Greenaway to the hospital. (Tr. 34-35.) When the police arrived to Mr. Greenaway's home, he was calmly painting the bathroom. (Tr. 39, 150.) For at least fifteen to twenty minutes, Mr. Greenaway calmly engaged the Officers, asked them to leave his home, and declined to go to the hospital. (Tr. 39, 175-76, 604, 629-30, 644, 870-71.) Mr. Knight too asked the Officers to leave the home. (Tr. 611-12.) An Officer forcibly removed Mr. and Mrs. Knight from the master bedroom. (Tr. 49-52, 608-09, 619-20, 658.) Then, without provocation, Mr. Greenaway was tased four times. (Tr. 185, 613, 872-73.) None of the Officers intervened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   All told, the evidence adduced by Plaintiffs at trial, if credited, was sufficient to sustain liability for excessive force, punitive damages, false imprisonment, failure to intervene, and unlawful entry/trespass. It is clear by the jury's verdict that they indeed credited Plaintiffs' version of events. Of course, the Court cannot state with any certitude why the jury credited Plaintiffs' version over Defendants' version. However, at trial the jury was instructed that they were the \"sole judges of credibility of the witnesses and the weight [the witness's] testimony deserve[d].\" (Tr. 1046.) In making the decision about whether to believe all or part of a witness' testimony, the jury was further instructed that they were permitted to consider any number of factors, including: (1) \"the witness' opportunity to see, hear and know about the events he or she described\"; (2) \"the witness' ability to recall and describe those things\"; (3) \"the witness' manner in testifying[-]was the witness candid and forthright or did the witness seem as if he or she was hiding something, being evasive or suspect in some way\"; (4) \"how the witness' testimony on direct examination compared with how the witness testified on cross-examination\"; (5) \"the reasonableness of the witness' testimony in light of all the other evidence in the case\"; (6) \"whether the witness had any possible bias, any relationship to a party, any motive to testify falsely or any possible interest in the outcome of the trial\"; and (7) \"whether a witness' testimony was contradicted by his or her other testimony, by what that witness said or did on a prior occasion[,] or by the testimony of other witnesses[,] or by other evidence.\" (Tr. 1046-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is possible that against this backdrop, the jury noted evasive responses from some defense witnesses. For instance, on at least three occasions, the Court had to instruct County Officer Schmitt to answer the question posed by counsel, and only the question posed. (Tr. 938-41, 945, 947.) The jury may have observed that at other times, County Officer Schmitt gave answers that were nonresponsive. Plaintiffs' counsel asked County Officer Schmitt the following yes or no question: \"You didn't see Mr. Greenaway try and use a roller as a weapon, did you?\" (Tr. 954.) County Officer Schmitt responded, \"I saw a roller moving around by the doorway.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Only after the Court directed County Officer Schmitt to respond to the question did he answer: \"no.\" (Tr. 954-55.) Perhaps the jury noted contradictions between the testimony offered by defense witnesses and other evidence in the record. For example, police reports prepared in connection with the events of April 25, 2010, indicated that\n   Mr. Greenaway began to reach towards his boot, potentially for a weapon, and that Mr. Greenaway used his paint roller as a weapon. (Pls.' Trial Exs. 21, 30.) These contentions were repeated in the EMS report. (Pls.' Trial Ex. 10.) However, at trial and under oath, County Officer Hudson testified that he did not recall Mr. Greenaway reaching for a weapon; Village Officer Reado, County Officer Schmitt, and County Officer Stio each testified Mr. Greenaway never used the paint roller as a weapon. (Tr. 186, 362-63, 720, 954-55.) Former Ambulance Medical Technician Daniel Arce testified that no weapons were recovered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 472-73.) Other defense witnesses likewise testified that Mr. Greenaway was not violent. (Tr. 151, 205, 247, 250, 472, 479-80.) Similarly, when examined by Plaintiffs' counsel, County Officer Stio testified that he neither witnessed Mr. Greenaway do anything toward the Officers when he had paint on his hands nor heard anything Mr. Greenaway said. (Tr. 694-95, 697, 706.) Yet, when examined by the defense, County Officer Stio testified that Mr. Greenaway was rubbing paint on his genitals and saying \"[d]o you want some of this.\" (Tr. 741, 769.) Lastly, perhaps the jury observed that County Officers were impeached, multiple times, by Plaintiffs' counsel when the testimony they offered at trial differed from that given at their deposition. Notably, at trial County Officer Schmitt testified that he did not see Mr. Greenaway swing the paint roller at County Officer Hudson; however, in his deposition, he testified that Mr. Greenaway swung at County Officer Hudson multiple times. (Tr. 965-67.) County Officer Schmitt explained the discrepancy by admitting that his deposition testimony \"wasn't true.\" (Tr. 967.) If these were indeed the observations by the jury, they were shared by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The verdict was not seriously erroneous nor was it a miscarriage of justice.

Excessive Force\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The parties agree that the $7.5 million awarded on Mr. Greenaway's excessive force claim is excessive. (County Defs.' Br. at 36-37; Pls.' Resp. Opp. County Defs.' Mot. Set Aside J. (\"Pls.' Opp. County Br.\") at 20, ECF No. 149.) Indeed, Plaintiffs have already agreed to remit the excessive force award by $2.5 million. County Defendants urge the Court to reduce the award significantly more to $100,000. Neither party has provided the Court with case law particularly useful to the Court's remittitur analysis. County Defendants rely on four cases. Two of the cases were resolved through settlement. Of course, settlement terms are often driven by considerations not before a jury. The other two cases are from other jurisdictions. Not only are those cases not binding on this Court, they also do not speak to what a jury in this circuit may find. Plaintiffs fare no better having offered the Court only one case that too is from outside of this circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, in pressing for remittitur County Defendants focus on cases where the plaintiff tragically died and was awarded less than Mr. Greenaway. For this reason, County Defendants argue that any award here should be significantly lower. Certainly, the loss of life is the ultimate loss. However, as crafted, County Defendants' argument largely ignores the loss suffered by Mr. Greenaway attendant to\n   <em>\n    living\n   </em>\n   with the consequences of the events of April 25, 2010. Since the incident, Mr. Greenaway testified that he remains fearful and terrified. (Tr. 888.) Mr. Greenaway's therapist testified-that, among other things, Mr. Greenaway suffered additional trauma that manifested in the form of flashbacks, distrust of all people, feeling unsafe, paranoia, depression, and nervousness. (Tr. 788-95.) She further testified that Mr. Greenaway's experience with Village and County Defendants triggered \"the opposite\" of the growth he achieved prior to April 2010. (Tr. 793.) Mr. Greenaway testified that he never got back on track with either counseling or school. (Tr. 884-85, 920-21.) Mr. Greenaway lost trust for his parents and his siblings, and isolated himself from his family as a result. (Tr. 63-64, 616-17, 882, 887-88.) He no longer trusts the police. (Tr. 882.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In any event, in the absence of comparable cases upon which the Court can rely, the Court is left to be guided by the principle that courts should endeavor to be the \"most faithful to the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Earl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10590\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1320/#p1328\">\n    917 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1328 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zeno v.

Br. at 39.) In support of this contention, County Defendants refer the Court to cases where awards of up to $10,000 were upheld for confinement ranging from three to five hours. Here, Mr. Greenaway was confined at a hospital for almost two weeks. As Plaintiffs note, County Defendants should be liable for at least some portion of that time.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816915\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/903/237/#p245\">\n    903 F.Supp.2d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the time plaintiff spent at the hospital could factor into the compensatory damages award where there was no intervening cause that triggered plaintiff's hospitalization).

Village Defendants' Rule 50(b) motion is denied in its entirety. Village Defendants' Rule 59(e) motion with respect to the gross negligence and failure to intervene claims is granted and the following awards are reduced to zero: (1) Mr. and Mrs. Knight's awards for their gross negligence claims against Village Officer Ohr; and (2) Mr. Knight, Mrs. Knight, and Mr. Greenaway's awards for their failure to intervene claims against Village Officers Ohr and Reado. Village Defendants' Rule 59(e) motion concerning Mrs. Knight's punitive damage award against Village Officer Reado is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   County Defendants' post-verdict motions are also granted in part, and denied in part. County Defendants' Rule 50(b) motion is denied in its entirety. County Defendants' Rule 59 motion for a new trial is denied in its entirety. County Defendants' Rule 59 motion for a conditional order of remittitur is granted only as to the issue of Mr. Greenaway's $7.5 million excessive force damage award. Unless Mr. Greenaway agrees in writing, by April 25, 2018, to a remittitur reducing the award to $2.5 million, there will be a new trial solely as to the excessive force damages. Should Mr. Greenaway opt for a new trial, the Court will permit limited discovery. Further, Mr. Knight, Mrs. Knight, and Mr. Greenaway's award for their unlawful entry/trespass claim against County Officers Hudson, Papa, Schmitt, and Stio as well as Village Officers Ohr and Reado is reduced to $10,000.

Plaintiffs have since conceded the argument and by agreement of the parties, the damages of these claims are reduced to zero. (Korenbaum Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, ECF No. 150-1.) The Court, however, will not vacate the findings of liability on these claims, as these Rule 50 motions were not properly preserved.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    It should not go without mention that the Officers testified to varying standards of the Mental Health Hygiene Law. Village Officer Reado testified that, at the moment an individual \"appears to be a danger to himself and others,\" the decision to go to the hospital is no longer up to the individual; at that point, he has an \"obligation to make sure [the individual] gets to the hospital and to get reevaluated.\" (Tr. 199.) County Officer Hudson testified that officers may involuntarily confine someone either \"if [the officers] determine that they might be a danger to themselves or to others\" or \"if [the individual is] on medication and [is] noncompliant.\" (Tr. 348.) County Officer Stio testified that, per his training, he could involuntarily confine a person \"in need of medical treatment.\" (Tr. 761-62.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court is unaware whether the police reports, which are readily accessible within the public domain, have ever been corrected such that they are consistent with the sworn testimony given at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court remits the jury's awards for failure to intervene as Plaintiffs have conceded the motion. (Brewington Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF No. 149-3.) Plaintiffs Greenaway, Sharon Knight, and Avery Knight must remit $80,000.00, $33,333.32, and $20,000.00 respectively on the failure to intervene claim. The Court, however, leaves the findings of liability intact, as there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    With respect to the second factor, County Defendants note only that because the compensatory damage award is \"so grossly exaggerated,\" punitive damages should be \"minimal.\" (County Defs.

County Defendants do not address the third factor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In viewing comparable cases, the district court may adjust the dollar amount for inflation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dancy v.
