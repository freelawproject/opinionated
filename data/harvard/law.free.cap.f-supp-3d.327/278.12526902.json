Saris, Chief United States District Judge\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs AER Advisors Inc. (\"AER\"), William J. Deutsch, and Peter E. Deutsch bring this action against Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (\"Fidelity\"), alleging that its unauthorized lending of the Deutsches' shares in China Medical Technologies Inc. (\"China Medical\"), caused a market disruption in June 2012. To cover up its role in the market disruption, Fidelity allegedly implicated Plaintiffs in a false Suspicious Activity Report (\"SAR\"), filed with the government. As a result of the SAR, Plaintiffs claim they were subject to investigations by various state and federal securities-related agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 8, 2017, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ordered that the case be transferred to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40. One month later, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") (Docket No. 64), asserting 13 causes of action, all of which are primarily based on the SAR. The claims are for negligent reporting (Counts I and II), tortious interference with existing business relationships (Count III), tortious interference with prospective business relationships (Count IV), breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Counts V and VI), promissory estoppel (Count VII), breach of fiduciary duty (Count VIII), unjust enrichment (Count IX), negligence or gross negligence (Count X), deceptive and unfair trade practices (Counts XI and XII), and prima facie tort (Count XIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fidelity moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing first that it enjoys absolute immunity from liability for any SAR filed. Second, Fidelity maintains that any claims predicated on its alleged unlawful lending of the Deutsches' shares must be dismissed under the doctrine of claim preclusion. Finally, Fidelity argues that AER's claim for tortious interference with existing business relationships is barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Fidelity's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following factual background comes from Plaintiffs' SAC. Plaintiffs' factual allegations must be accepted as true at this stage of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foley v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315539\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/63/#p71\">\n    772 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71 (1st Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AER, a registered investment advisor, served clients nationwide with \"discretionary investment management services.\" SAC \u00b6 17. AER joined Fidelity's Wealth Central platform in 2009 and exclusively relied on that platform to provide its investment services to clients. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Fidelity promised to assist AER with business development and growth. SAC \u00b6 21. In reliance on that promise, AER actively solicited business from clients nationwide. SAC \u00b6 21. In 2011, AER introduced the \"China Gold\" investment strategy and decided to make the strategy the focus of its business model. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 22, 111. The China\n   Gold strategy was based on the expectation that the anomalously low prices at which some Chinese securities were trading would \"trigger a management buy-out or another privately driven exit transaction (e.g., a strategic acquisition).\" SAC \u00b6 22. Fidelity supported China Gold and incorporated the strategy into its own investing. SAC \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   William Deutsch is the Chairman of Deutsch Family Wine &amp; Spirits, and Peter Deutsch serves as the company's Chief Executive Officer. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The Deutsches were clients of Fidelity's Family Office Services (\"FFOS\"), and eventually participated in AER's China Gold strategy. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. When Peter Deutsch decided to join FFOS in November 2011, he accepted Fidelity's service proposal, which offered him \"seamless and flawless\" strategy execution, institutional-quality brokerage services, and a \"client first,\" \"conflict-free environment.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Peter Deutsch relied on Fidelity's promises about the services it would provide. SAC \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The China Medical Investment and Market Disruption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Peter Deutsch joined FFOS, the Deutsches decided to accumulate a large number of shares of China Medical, gain control of the company, and sell it to a buyer or private equity firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Peter Deutsch began acquiring China Medical shares through his FFOS account in December 2011. SAC \u00b6 33. By February 28, 2012, the Deutsches owned nearly 4.4 million shares of the company. SAC \u00b6 34. They had purchased around 8.6 million additional shares by June 30, 2012. SAC \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fidelity emailed AER on March 5, 2012, with an offer for the Deutsches to join its \"fully paid lending program\" for their China Medical shares. SAC \u00b6 35. In the email, Fidelity represented that its \"securities lending desk in Capital Markets [was] paying a 5% rate ... for these hard to borrow shares.\" SAC \u00b6 35. The email also acknowledged that there was \"a 100% requirement to hold this position\" and that a \"service agreement [would] need to be signed by the end client to enter into this program.\" SAC \u00b6 35. If the Deutsches had accepted Fidelity's offer, they would have been in a good position to accomplish a short squeeze.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 36. However, AER replied to Fidelity's offer with a straightforward rejection: \"Client is not interested in lending stock.\" SAC \u00b6 37. After receiving AER's email, Fidelity never advised the Deutsches that they should move their shares and trade in a cash account, as required by Fidelity's internal policy. SAC \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite the fact that Fidelity had not received consent to lend, between May and early June of 2012, the company lent nearly 1.8 million of the Deutsches' China Medical shares to short sellers or their brokers. SAC \u00b6 41. Fidelity made money from these loans, but the Deutsches were not notified of the lending, were not paid any compensation for the loans, and did not receive any collateral. SAC \u00b6 42. When AER asked Fidelity whether it had lent the Deutsches' stock without their authorization, Fidelity responded that it could not disclose that information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 49. Peter Deutsch was also told by Amanda\n   Topping at FFOS that the portion of China Medical stocks that Fidelity could lend out from his account was \"very small.\" SAC \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The wine turned to vinegar in June 2012. On June 11, 2012, after \"a routine monthly transfer of [China Medical] shares between the Deutsches' margin accounts,\" Fidelity's lending triggered a recall obligation. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. The company then issued a recall for about 1.5 million shares on June 13, 2012, eventually recalling approximately 1.8 million shares over the next few days. SAC \u00b6 46. The Senior Vice President and head of the Securities Lending Desk of Fidelity Capital Markets, Ugyen Sass, anticipated a short squeeze due to the company's loans and failed recalls on June 15, 2012. SAC \u00b6 46. Then, on June 18, 2012, Fidelity issued its final batch of recalls. SAC \u00b6 46. Because the recalls failed, Fidelity bought roughly 1.2 million shares of China Medical on the open market between June 19 and June 27, 2012. SAC \u00b6 46. The price of the stock increased from $4.00 per share on June 13, 2012, to $11.80 per share on June 29, 2012. SAC \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 29, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") halted the trading of China Medical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 46.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     The SAR and the January 2013 Letter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fidelity filed a SAR on July 5, 2012. SAC \u00b6 56. A SAR is the document a \"broker or dealer in securities\" files with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\"), to report \"any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201023.320\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1023.320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1). The internal draft SAR reports that Fidelity observed suspicious activity in the Deutsches' and AER's accounts, \"which ha[d] the appearance of attempting to influence a short squeeze in the stock of China Medical.\" Docket No. 64-2 at 3; SAC \u00b6 56. The draft SAR also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 18, 2012, 11,945,520 shares of China Medical (from five separate Deutsch accounts) were journaled from type 2 (margin), to type 1 (cash).... The result of this action caused previously loaned out shares to be recalled, and since they were not delivered, stock loan had to execute buy-in transactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Docket No. 64-2 at 4; SAC \u00b6 57. Plaintiffs believe that this draft SAR reflects the contents of the SAR Fidelity actually filed. SAC \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the transfers between the Deutsches' accounts did not result in the recall of a single share of China Medical. SAC \u00b6 60. Based on this fact, Plaintiffs allege that there was no possibility that they had orchestrated the short squeeze. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 58-59. Moreover, they allege that Fidelity knew that Plaintiffs did not initiate the short squeeze-even though the SAR accused them of it-because Fidelity issued the recalls for the shares it had loaned. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 59-64. The SAC alleges that the SAR was simply a smokescreen intended to disguise the fact that Fidelity's unlawful lending had truly triggered the short squeeze.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To cover up the SAR, Fidelity hid documents throughout an extended Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") arbitration. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. Only after the United States District Court for the Southern\n   District of New York ordered documents to be produced on May 6, 2015 did Plaintiffs learn of Fidelity's internal draft of the SAR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the SAR was filed, Fidelity attempted to \"poach\" AER's clients. SAC \u00b6 114. \"[I]n or around January 2013,\" Fidelity sent letters to AER's existing clients, which stated that the two companies no longer had a relationship and that Fidelity was no longer accepting instruction from AER on any accounts. SAC \u00b6 114. The letter also gave clients options for managing their Fidelity accounts going forward. SAC \u00b6 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Investigations and Damages\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a result of the SAR filing, AER was investigated by the SEC and required to attend a five-hour interview. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 99-101. Ultimately, the SEC decided not to pursue an enforcement action against AER. SAC \u00b6 102. Both the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, Division of Securities, and New Hampshire's Bureau of Securities Regulation also investigated AER's actions, but neither pursued enforcement. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 103-06. AER spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on these investigations and \"could not, and did not economically recover.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 106, 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The SEC also investigated Peter Deutsch's trading activities related to China Medical. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 107-08. He was required to attend an interview with the SEC, which focused on whether he \"intended to artificially manipulate the market through moving his shares from margin to cash.\" SAC \u00b6 108. The SEC did not pursue an enforcement action, but Peter Deutsch expended hundreds of thousands of dollars on the investigation, suffered emotional distress, and had his attention diverted from his business activities. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 109-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the factual allegations in a complaint must \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

In the opinion, the First Circuit reasoned that Congress did not intend to include a good faith qualification to immunity because (1) it easily could have written the requirement into the statute; (2) it removed a good faith requirement from an earlier draft of the provision; and (3) any limitation on immunity would discourage disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    at 31-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the First Circuit concluded that \u00a7 5318(g)(3) immunizes financial institutions whose SAR disclosures are \"wilfully [sic] false\" or \"unfounded, incomplete, careless and even malicious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, focus on the fact that \u00a7 5318(g)(3) only grants financial institutions immunity when they report \"any possible violation of law or regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 72 at 7-10; Docket No. 77 at 1-3. They claim that while Fidelity allegedly reported the Deutsches for market manipulation in the form of an illegal short squeeze, SAC \u00b6 56, the Deutsches' activities could not possibly have caused the short squeeze,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 72 at 8-10; Docket No. 77 at 3. Plaintiffs specifically point to paragraphs 45 through 47 and 60 through 64 in the SAC to show that Fidelity knew the Deutsches could not possibly be responsible for the market disruption\n   because Fidelity itself had caused it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 91 at 41:21-42:5. Since Fidelity was not reporting an actual \"possible violation of law,\" according to Plaintiffs, the conclusion follows that Fidelity has not met the threshold requirement for immunity. But in light of\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   , the Court is not persuaded by this argument or by the state court cases Plaintiffs cite in their briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   deals specifically with the \"any possible violation\" language. In that case, Banco Popular reported the plaintiff to the FBI for check kiting, or \"knowingly writing a check against an account with insufficient funds,\" which can be a federal offense.\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    320 F.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First Circuit noted that the bank's report \"was\n   <em>\n    cast\n   </em>\n   as the disclosure of a possible case of bank fraud, assuredly a possible violation of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

In assessing the bank's motion for summary judgment, the First Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Conceivably, Stoutt could argue that the report was not one of a possible violation, even though so termed and colorably disclosing a possible crime, if the Bank knew that there was (in reality) no violation. But this is a non-literal reading of the statute, which speaks of \"any possible violation,\" and we think it more straightforward to confront any requirement of good faith or due care as an implied qualification of immunity rather than an issue of initial scope. Here, whatever its internal beliefs, the Bank did by any objective test identify a \"possible violation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Fidelity's SAR accused them of manipulating stock prices by orchestrating an illegal short squeeze. SAC \u00b6 56. Based on Plaintiffs' own allegations, the SAR, on its face, \"was cast\" as a disclosure of a possible violation of securities law. Accordingly, Fidelity's SAR met the \"possible violation\" threshold for \u00a7 5318(g)(3) immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs make an additional argument that fraudulent SARs intended to misdirect suspicion do not insulate financial institutions from civil liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 72 at 3-7; Docket No. 77 at 3-6. This argument does not make it past\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   either. In its analysis, the First Circuit considered but discounted the fact that plaintiffs like Stoutt \"could be left without any civil redress against malicious or wholly unfounded accusations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite that reality, the court said that government authorities can filter out SARs reporting \"false charges\" and decide not to pursue those investigations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/#p30\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Fidelity, the FINRA arbitration\n   award resolved all of the Deutsches' unlawful lending claims and precludes their re-litigation here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67 at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court need not decide whether applying the claim preclusion doctrine would be appropriate in this case. On two occasions, Plaintiffs have expressly disavowed that any of their claims in the SAC are premised on unlawful lending and have reiterated that all claims are based on the SAR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 72 at 16 (\"While claims in the Arbitration were predicated on the unlawful lending of the Deutsches' [China Medical] shares, the Second Amended Complaint asserts claims predicated on Fidelity's fraudulent cover-up scheme and SAR Referral.\"); Docket No. 77 at 10 n.10 (\"The six counts Fidelity identified as [relating to unlawful lending] are expressly predicated on Fidelity's 'fraudulent scheme' including the filing of a bogus SAR....\"). According to Plaintiffs, the facts about unlawful lending are included only to provide \"\n   <em>\n    background or context\n   </em>\n   to a different set of claims (those arising from Fidelity's bogus SAR and fraudulent cover-up scheme).\" Docket No. 72 at 17 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have disclaimed unlawful lending and reaffirmed the SAR as their foundation for all asserted claims, the Court does not decide the claim preclusion issue.

To succeed on this tort claim, a plaintiff must prove that (1) \"a business relationship ... of economic benefit\" existed; (2) the defendant knew of that relationship; (3) the defendant intentionally and maliciously interfered with that relationship; and (4) the plaintiff suffered a \"loss of advantage\" as a direct result of the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Comey v.

Plaintiffs allege that these letters were attempts to \"poach\" AER's clients. Docket No. 64 \u00b6 114. Fidelity has moved to dismiss Count III on multiple grounds, including that the tortious interference claim is time-barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67 at 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs' position is that the letters are \"intertwined with the SAR\" and are \"actually part and parcel of the entire fraudulent scheme by Fidelity which related to the SAR referral.\" Docket No. 91 at 46:5-18. They maintain that the discovery of the existence of the SAR in 2015 should count as the date of accrual because malicious intent was not clear until that time. Maybe so, but allowing AER to use the SAR to show bad intent as a basis for Fidelity's liability would violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205318\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3).
