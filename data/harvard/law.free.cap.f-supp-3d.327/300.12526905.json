This case centers on allegations that defendant's reimbursement claims overcharged the government\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by means of an invoicing arrangement devised to circumvent Medi-Cal's billing regulations. Set forth below are the relevant facts which, when disputed, I view in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the party opposing summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v.

Medi-Cal's Upper Billing Limit Regulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The California Department of Health Care Services (the \"Department\") administers Medi-Cal. In 2003, it filed an emergency regulation called the Upper Billing Limit (\"UBL\") to address \"abusive billing conduct,\" including \"the practice of obtaining steep discounts (whether legitimate or not) and then turning around and billing Medi-Cal at maximum reimbursement rates.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California Ass'n of Med.

In\n   passing the UBL, the Department sought to close a \"loophole in state law that did not effectively link reimbursement to the provider's purchase cost.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20692\">\n    at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting rulemaking record). In relevant part, the regulation achieves its purposes by limiting claims for reimbursement to a 100% markup of provider's \"net purchase price\" for an item. \"Net purchase price\" is \"defined as the actual cost to the provider to purchase the item, including any rebates, refunds, discounts or any other price reducing allowances, known by the provider at the time of billing the Medi-Cal program for the item, that reduces the item's invoice amount.\" Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 51008.1(a)(2)(A). The UBL also requires that \"[t]he net purchase price shall reflect price reductions guaranteed by any contract to be applied to the item(s) billed to the Medi-Cal program.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22, \u00a7 51008.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B).

How rebates and discounts should be treated for \"net purchase price\" calculations was among the topics discussed. For example, in response to an industry request that the UBL be amended to explicitly exclude \"growth or volume discounts\" from a product's net purchase price, the Department declined to change the rule and instead responded that the UBL \"already excludes after the fact discounts.\" Docket # 309 \u00b6 6. In response to other comments, Medi-Cal also clarified that \"net purchase price includes rebates, discounts, credits and other price-reducing adjustments known to the providers at the time they bill for the item.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Response to \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Shield-Coloplast Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2010, defendant's supplier agreement with medical supply manufacturer Coloplast was expiring and the two companies negotiated a new contract. The agreement set forth the price of Coloplast's products in a series of tables attached to the contract. It also provided that, when Shield purchased enough products in a given three-month quarter, it would receive rebates to be paid by check no later than 60 days after the quarter's end. The rebates were structured into four tiers; the highest rebate (\"Tier 4\" for \"Category A\" products) equaled a 66% discount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Herman, then President of U.S. Coloplast, and plaintiff Roseff, then Coloplast's Director of Distribution, were involved in the contract negotiation process. According to Roseff, the 2010 Shield-Coloplast agreement was \"different\" and \"unusual.\" Docket # 311-4 at 6. The prices Coloplast was offering to Shield were \"substantially higher than [for] any other customer,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    at 12-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as were the \"substantial discounts and rebates\",\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr.\n   Roseff \"had never seen a contract that had this type of incentive schedule attached to it,\" and the \"double digit\" rebates \"jumped out\" to him given their relationship to the high invoice prices.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, evidence in the summary judgment record shows that Coloplast and defendant\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   defendant would receive the rebates because they were based on sales figures defendant had previously met. Docket # 311-6 (December 2010 internal Coloplast email stating that new contract \"increased [defendant's] invoice price significantly, but kept their net price the same\"); Docket # 311-5 (deposition testimony of plaintiff Herman that Coloplast and defendant discussed a \"purchase level commitment\" during the 2010 contract negotiations which was \"related to the rebates themselves\" in that Coloplast \"knew the level of business Shield was currently doing with the company\" and defendant stated to Coloplast that they \"intended to grow\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Like Roseff, plaintiff Herman, too, had concerns with the unusual contract and whether it was \"compliant with what [she knew] about reimbursement [from Medi-Cal] and the way that it works.\" Docket # 311-5 at 11. She expressed these concerns during an in-person meeting with defendant and asked what it would do if Coloplast decided to abandon the agreement's structure. According to Herman, defendant told her it would not do business with Coloplast unless the agreement was set up in this fashion. Herman also remembers Shield telling her that the contract was arranged this way \"because of issues related to how [defendant] bill[s] Medi-Cal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Herman believed that Shield was \"gaming the system\" by insisting on this type of contract, which required \"pretty high prices and very high rebates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She directed Roseff to work with Shield to add a disclaimer to all invoices stating, essentially, that the bills \"may not reflect discounts, rebates, charge backs that may be recognized in the future.\" Docket # 311-4 at 5. Shield refused. In fact, when Roseff spoke with Shield's Purchasing Director Kyle Dunham about adding the language, Dunham said \"if you do it, we don't have to do business with you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the end, Coloplast relented and the high-price, high-rebate agreement went into effect in March 2010. From December 2010 through February 2014, defendant achieved the highest or second-highest level of rebates for every quarter. When Shield sought reimbursement from Medi-Cal\n   for products it had purchased from Coloplast and then sold to patients, Shield calculated \"net purchase price\" using just the high invoice prices and never factored in the rebates. In 2014, Shield entered into another supplier agreement with Coloplast that again featured the high rebates, some as great as 70%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant admits that it \"has never included off-invoice, after-the-fact rebates, such as those provided by Coloplast, to calculate the 'net purchase price,' \" but denies that this practice transgresses the UBL or resulted in any false claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 302-2 \u00b6 8. It maintains that the Coloplast rebates \"are properly excluded from the 'net purchase price' calculation because these after-the-fact rebates are not known at the time of billing and do not reduce the invoiced amounts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It further believes that the invoice prices \"reflect[ ] the actual purchase price,\" since Shield would pay Coloplast for the invoiced amount and only later, \"[a]fter the end of each quarter, Coloplast calculated and paid to Shield any quarterly volume rebates earned by Shield.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Shield argues that this method of calculating net purchase price \"had been blessed by state and federal officials,\" and contends that its practice is \"based on communications received in 2003 and 2004 from Medi-Cal officials and assurances it received from the DOJ in resolving a prior qui tam lawsuit based on similar facts.\" Docket # 301-1 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The\n    <em>\n     Donath\n    </em>\n    Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That prior lawsuit is\n   <em>\n    United States ex. rel. Donath v.

There,\n   <em>\n    qui\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tam\n   </em>\n   relator Terry Donath alleged that his employer Whitestone Corp., a supplier of defendant's, and defendant struck a deal that employed an off-invoice, after-the-fact rebate program similar to that alleged in this case. The\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation also involved other allegations, including that defendant violated the UBL in a more straightforward manner by simply not factoring into net purchase price discounts that actually appeared on its invoices (so-called \"on-invoice discounts\"). In addition, on April 19, 2010, Donath filed an amended complaint which included allegations that, beyond Whitestone, \"Shield also entered into sham volume rebate agreements with ... most or all of its other suppliers,\" including Coloplast. Docket # 302-4 \u00b6 148. The amended complaint alleged that defendant's invoice scheme \"continues ... to this day,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   April 19, 2010.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%2051008.1\">\n    \u00b6 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The United States Department of Justice and the California Attorney General investigated Donath's allegations. Defendant cooperated and produced documents in response to a March 2008 investigative subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The California Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse then conducted an audit examining defendant's claims for four types of medical supplies submitted between March 1, 2003 and December 1, 2007. In due course, defendant resolved the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation in November 2011 by a $5 million settlement with the United States, California, and the relator. Docket # 121-1 at 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Important details about the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   settlement are in dispute. In defense of its billing practice, defendant contends that it \"paid nothing ... for the off-invoice rebates/phony invoices allegations made by Donath,\" Docket # 302-2 \u00b6 5; that the government \"expressly declined to base any damages\" on the alleged off-invoice scheme, Docket # 307-1 at 3; and that \"the parties agreed\" that the settlement was repayment for the on-invoice rebate omissions only, Docket # 306-1 \u00b6 11. Defendant further contends that the government gave\n   it \"written assurances\" to \"protect it from future court and/or administrative actions seeking remedies for the off-invoice rebates allegations.\" Docket # 302-3 \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs offer a different view. According to the sworn affidavit of Siobhan Franklin, a Deputy Attorney General with the California Attorney General's Office who worked on the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   investigation and the settlement, defendant's version of events is false. First, in response to defendant's claim that it \"paid nothing\" in the settlement relating to the phony invoicing allegation, Ms. Franklin states that \"there was no such allocation of the settlement payment in the actual Settlement Agreement.\" Docket # 312 \u00b6 12. She also notes that the \"Covered Conduct\" is specified as \"Shield's overbilling the Medi-Cal program by charging more than twice the net purchase price of incontinence and other medical supplies in violation of [the UBL] during the period of March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2009.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Next, Ms. Franklin states that the \"written assurances\" described by Shield were merely unsigned, draft letters (one of which she herself wrote). She has no record of ever signing or sending a final version of such a letter and she points out that the draft letters did not give the assurances Shield claims. The letters \"make[ ] no statement that Shield 'would not be sued again for the off-invoice allegations' \" and instead both simply recite that the California DOJ and United States Attorney General's Office did not have a \"present intention\" to bring or recommend a civil or administrative action with respect to any\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   claim that might be dismissed without prejudice under the proposed settlement. Docket # 312 \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket ## 301-20, 301-21 (unsigned draft letters). Finally, Ms. Franklin denies that Shield ever told her-during\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   or thereafter-that \"in determining the net purchase price for medical supplies billed to Medi-Cal, Shield would [exclude] any large quarterly volume rebates paid by a manufacturer that may have been consistently achieved during the course of Shield's contract(s) with that manufacturer.\" Docket # 312 \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Summary judgment is therefore inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant argues that the government's failure to suspend reimbursement payments, seek recovery of overpayment, or \"take[ ] other steps to stop the alleged fraud\" means that the practice of excluding the Coloplast rebates was immaterial to payment. Docket # 301-1 at 14. But a jury could see things differently. First, a jury could find that the government\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   seek recovery and take steps to stop the alleged scheme when, in\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   , it obtained a $5 million settlement payment from defendant for \"overbilling the Medi-Cal program by charging more than twice the net purchase price of incontinence and other medical supplies in violation of [the UBL].\" Docket # 312 \u00b6 12. Though defendant protests that the settlement was related to\n   <em>\n    Donath's\n   </em>\n   \"on-invoice\" allegations only and that it received \"cold comfort\" letters condoning the exclusion of \"off-invoice\" rebates like those it received from Coloplast, those assertions are hotly disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, a jury could find that the government's continued payment of defendant's post-\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   reimbursement claims has no bearing on whether the practice of excluding the Coloplast rebates was material to payment. A jury could find that the government did not have \"actual knowledge\" of defendant's billing practices because it reasonably assumed defendant would not persist in excluding discounts like the Coloplast rebates after settling\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the record includes evidence from Attorney Franklin that, contrary to defendant's assertion, Shield never informed her it would continue to exclude such rebates from net purchase price when submitting claims to Medi-Cal. Docket # 312 \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Were a jury to discredit Shield's view of these disputed facts, it could find materiality in this case. Noncompliance with the UBL is plainly material to the government's\n   decision to pay a claim for Medi-Cal reimbursement. The billing regulation goes straight to the \"essence of the bargain\" between Medi-Cal and providers like defendant because it deals precisely with the amount that providers can bill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobar III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122937\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/103/#p109\">\n    842 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs have submitted ample evidence for a jury to find that defendant was overcharging Medi-Cal by improperly omitting rebates when it reported the price it was paying for items in its claims for reimbursement. Specifically, there is evidence (recounted in greater detail above) that (i) the UBL at the very least requires rebates to be included in \"net purchase price\" calculations when they are both known and reduce an item's invoice amount; (ii) Coloplast and defendant entered into a supplier agreement under which Shield agreed to pay inflated invoice prices (1.5 to 2.5 times higher than other companies were paying) and received large rebates at the end of each quarter (ten times higher than the rebates received by other companies); (iii) defendant knew it would receive the rebates and in fact always did receive them; (iv) defendant purposefully structured the agreement and took actions during negotiations to prevent the rebates from appearing or being mentioned on its invoices, even though the rebates effectively reduced its actual costs by double-digit percentages; and (v) defendant never accounted for the rebates it received from Coloplast in its claims for reimbursement. If credited by the jury, this evidence makes out a scheme that would be \"sufficiently important to influence\" the government's decision whether to pay defendant's reimbursement claims.\n   <em>\n    Winkelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924187\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/201/#p211\">\n    827 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   211 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To begin, even assuming that the regulation is indeed ambiguous, a jury could nevertheless find that defendant's interpretation of the UBL is not objectively reasonable. Defendant reads the UBL as permitting exclusion of the Coloplast rebates because (1) they are \"off-invoice\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   Coloplast did not list them on its bills to defendant); and (2) \"after-the-fact\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the rebates were paid at the end of each quarter, presumably after defendant had submitted reimbursement claims to Medi-Cal). As support for its reading of \"off-invoice,\" Shield points to the UBL's statement that \"net purchase price ... includ[es] any rebates ... that\n   <em>\n    reduce the item's invoice amount\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). As support for an \"after-the-fact\" exception, Shield notes that \"net purchase price ... includ[es] any rebate ...\n   <em>\n    known by the provider at the time of billing\n   </em>\n   the Medi-Cal program for the item ....\" (emphasis added). A jury could find that neither of these interpretations is objectively reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The UBL says, first and foremost, that \"net purchase price\" is \"the\n   <em>\n    actual cost\n   </em>\n   to the provider to purchase the item from the seller ....\" Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 51008.1(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Given that the Coloplast rebates, once received, effectively reduced defendant's purchase costs by as much as 70 percent for a given product, a jury could determine that it was not objectively reasonable to interpret the phrase \"reduce the item's invoice amount\" as allowing omission of large discounts simply because they did not appear on a bill. That is especially true given the UBL's purpose of curbing \"the practice of obtaining steep discounts (whether legitimate or not) and then turning around and billing Medi-Cal at maximum reimbursement rates.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California Ass'n. of Med. Prod. Suppliers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20692\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr.3d at 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Similarly, in the context of the Coloplast rebates at issue here, a jury could determine that it was not objectively reasonable to interpret the word \"known\" to mean that the rebates were excludable simply because they were paid later. Plaintiffs have adduced sufficient evidence that defendant did \"know\" it would receive the rebates even before they were actually paid. Specifically, there is evidence that\n   Coloplast \"knew the level of business Shield was currently doing with the company\" when the rebate thresholds were established and knew that defendant \"intended to grow.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 311-5 (deposition testimony of plaintiff Herman). There is also evidence that the rebates \"kept [defendant's] net price the same\" despite the significantly increased invoice prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 311-6 (December 2010 internal Coloplast email). A jury crediting that evidence, especially in combination with the fact that defendant did achieve Tier 3 or Tier 4 rebates every quarter, could reasonably infer as alleged in plaintiffs' operative complaint that: (1) \"Shield ... and Coloplast agreed on the 'true' price of an item,\" then \"artificially set the invoice price at or above the amount necessary to allow Shield ... to bill Medi-Cal at the maximum reimbursement amount,\" and \"then set up a 'rebate' ... which reduced the amount paid by Shield ... down to the true agreed-upon price,\" Docket # 121 \u00b6 132; and (2) that \"[t]he 'tiers' in the rebate agreement were pre-determined such that Shield ... would always qualify for a rebate. Thus, the rebates were known to Shield ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149. If the jury found those facts and made those reasonable inferences, it could well determine that defendant's reading of \"known\" in the UBL rule to allow exclusion of the Coloplast rebates was not objectively reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, turning to the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   framework, a reasonable jury could find that the government warned defendant away from its interpretation. Defendant was aware that California regulators drafting the UBL believed that \" 'net purchase price' is understood by the regulated community to be the amount actually paid for an item after all discounts and rebates have been taken.\" Docket # 311-1 at 4. A jury could find that statement was sufficient warning that defendant's self-serving reading of the terms like \"reduce the item's invoice amount\" and \"known\" contravened the regulation. Furthermore, defendant was also aware that Medi-Cal rejected industry representatives' request to amend the UBL \"to exclude 'after the fact discounts' dependent on ... aggregate volume of purchase from the seller from the net purchase price.\" Docket # 311-10 at 1. Rather than amending the UBL, Medi-Cal responded by clarifying that it \"already excluded discounts\n   <em>\n    not known to the provider\n   </em>\n   at the time of billing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). A jury could find that this statement warned defendants that structuring its contracts to pay high invoice prices up front and regularly receive large rebates each quarter was not license to omit those rebates from its net purchase price calculations where, as here, defendants consistently achieved those rebates and reaped large discounts they never passed on to Medi-Cal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Stepping outside the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   framework, the foregoing discussion makes plain that a jury could find defendant submitted reimbursement claims to Medi-Cal with at least \"reckless disregard\" for whether the UBL required that the bills incorporate the Coloplast rebates.
