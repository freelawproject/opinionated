Conner, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We begin by delineating what the issue in this case is and what it is not. This\n   matter concerns the constitutionality of a policy regarding who may present invocations at the commencement of a legislative session. It is not a challenge to the religious content of legislative prayer. To the contrary, it is well settled that sectarian prayers are entirely proper invocations for legislative sessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Pennsylvania House of Representatives opens legislative sessions with an invocation delivered by a member of the House or a guest chaplain. The Speaker of the House maintains a guest chaplain policy that categorically excludes those who would present an uplifting message of hope, mutual respect, and peace yet-based upon their nontheistic beliefs-would fail to incorporate theistic entreaties to a divine or higher power. Each of the individual plaintiffs desires to deliver an opening invocation before the House. The Speaker has denied plaintiffs this opportunity due solely to the nontheistic nature of their beliefs. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , we find that the House policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Brian Fields, Paul Tucker, Deana Weaver, Scott Rhoades, Joshua Neiderhiser, Rev. Dr. Neal Jones, and Richard Kiniry are nontheist Pennsylvania residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 90 \u00b6 16). They desire to act as guest chaplains and deliver nontheistic invocations at House sessions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). Plaintiffs aver that such invocations would not proselytize or disparage any faith and would be \"positive, uplifting, unifying, and respectful toward all-similar to moving and inspiring invocations that have been delivered by nontheists at many governmental meetings around the country, which have invoked authorities or principles such as the Founding Fathers, the U.S. Constitution, democracy, equality, inclusion, fairness, and justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Interestingly, plaintiff Weaver has given just such an invocation in the Pennsylvania Senate, invoking ideals of compassion, understanding, and tolerance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Opening Invocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Pennsylvania House of Representatives opens most of its daily legislative\n   sessions with an invocation delivered by either a House member or an invited guest chaplain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1). After calling the House to order, the Speaker of the House announces the invocation presenter, and, if a guest chaplain, the name of the presenter's church or organization and the name of the sponsoring representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). The Speaker then requests that everyone in the chamber rise for the invocation, after which the presenter delivers the invocation from the Speaker's position on the Speaker's rostrum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Pledge of Allegiance immediately follows. (Doc. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Guest chaplains, if inclined, are permitted to bring additional guests to sit in the House chamber during the invocation, and one or two of the guests may sit on the raised dais along with the invocation giver and other House leaders. (Doc. 90 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Before delivering the invocation, guest chaplains usually meet the Speaker, the Parliamentarian of the House, and their representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Guest chaplains also receive a commemorative gavel, a photograph with the Speaker and their representative, a thank-you letter from the Speaker, and recognition on social media by the Speaker's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Guest chaplains testified that they consider the opportunity to be an honor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Guest Chaplain Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beginning in 1865 and continuing largely uninterrupted until 1994, the House annually or biannually appointed a permanent chaplain to deliver the opening invocation. (Doc. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Doc. 77-7 at 67, Expert Report and Decl. of Professor Paul Finkelman, Ph. D. (\"Expert Rpt.\") at 17). During the following ten years, the House invited guest chaplains occasionally in addition to using monthly rotating chaplains. (Expert Rpt. at 17). The House began frequently utilizing guest chaplains or House members to deliver the opening invocation around 2004. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 5; Doc. 92 \u00b6 5; Expert Rpt. at 17). By 2008, the House had established the current practice of exclusively inviting guest chaplains or having House members deliver the invocation. (Expert Rpt. at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Representatives nominate potential guest chaplains by passing their names along to the Speaker's office. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 10). Those interested in giving the invocation may also petition the Speaker's office directly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, House staff may recommend guest chaplains. (Doc. 92 \u00b6 10; Doc. 90 \u00b6 13). The Speaker's office performs \"non-intrusive background research\" on proposed guest chaplains \"to ensure compliance with House Rules and avoid any public[-]relations issues.\" (Doc. 81 \u00b6 12). The Speaker's office is responsible for selection of guest chaplains. (Doc. 90 \u00b6 60). Selected guest chaplains receive a standard letter explaining that \"[t]here are 203 members of the House coming from a wide variety of faiths,\" asking the guest chaplain to \"craft a prayer that is respectful of all religious beliefs,\" and noting that \"efforts to deliver an inter-faith prayer are greatly appreciated.\" (Doc. 81 \u00b6 13; Doc. 64-2 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   House Rule 17 states, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he Chaplain offering the prayer shall be a member of a regularly established church or religious organization or shall be a member of the House of Representatives.\" GEN. OPERATING RULES OF THE PA. HOUSE OF REP. R. 17 . The House, through its interpretation of House Rule 17 and particularly the word \"prayer,\" has established a policy that permits only guest chaplains who adhere to, or are members of a religious organization that subscribes to, a belief in \"God\" or a \"divine\" or \"higher\" power. (Doc. 90 \u00b6 44; Doc. 77-3 at 15-28, Myer Dep. 10:15-23:11 (\"Myer Dep.\"); Doc. 77-4 at 29-39, Turzai Dep. 15:5-25:4 (\"Turzai Dep.\"); Doc. 77-5 at 4-20, Smith Dep. 12:13-28:25 (\"Smith Dep.\") ). As defendants describe the policy, \"the opportunity to offer the prayer is dependent upon the prayer-giver's willingness to...provide a theistic communication to God or a higher power seeking blessing, guidance, or inspiration.\" (Doc. 58 at 5). The Parliamentarian plays a key role in determining whether a potential guest chaplain qualifies under this House policy. (Myer Dep. 9:6-19). The Speaker, however, is ultimately responsible for interpreting the House Rules and for deciding whether someone is qualified to serve as guest chaplain. (Turzai Dep. 10:15-16, 11:5-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Guest chaplains are given priority over House members in presenting the invocation, but the House does not receive enough requests to enable a guest chaplain to deliver the opening prayer before every session. (Doc. 90 \u00b6 65). From January 2008 to July 2017, approximately half the House invocations were delivered by guest chaplains and half were delivered by House members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 65). The vast majority of guest chaplains represented Christian denominations, and all represented monotheistic faiths or delivered monotheistic invocations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Only two prayers over this period represented religious traditions other than Christianity, Judaism, or Islam: one delivered by a Sikh guest chaplain in 2017, and one Native American invocation delivered by a Christian House member in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). Most guest chaplains during this time period were ordained clergy; others included prison, police, healthcare, and military chaplains; a missionary; a college chancellor; a member of a religious healthcare sisterhood; a lay president of a Jewish temple; and a person unaffiliated with a particular religious organization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Invocation Requests and Denials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In August 2014, Weaver emailed then-Representative Mike Regan on behalf of Dillsburg Area FreeThinkers, requesting an opportunity for someone from the organization to deliver the opening prayer. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 28). Several weeks later, Carl Silverman (a non-party to this litigation) sent correspondence on Pennsylvania Nonbelievers' letterhead to then-Representative Glen Grell, copying the Speaker, the Parliamentarian, and Fields, requesting that either Silverman or Fields be permitted to deliver an opening invocation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Both requests were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). In a letter dated September 25, 2014, then-Speaker Samuel Smith told Silverman that the House \"would not honor\" the request for a member of Pennsylvania Nonbelievers to serve as guest chaplain. (Doc. 64-5 at 3). The letter explained that the House did \"not believe that governmental bodies are required to allow non-adherents or nonbelievers the opportunity to serve as chaplains.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Representative Regan responded to Weaver's email request with a copy of the September 25, 2014 letter, explaining only that \"[t]his [letter] was forwarded to all legislative offices relative to an atheist offering the opening of session.\" (Doc. 64-6). Thereafter, the House approved its 2015-2016 General Operating Rules, which amended\n   House Rule 17 to require that every guest chaplain \"shall be a member of a regularly established church or religious organization or shall be a member of the House of Representatives.\" (Doc. 90 \u00b6 42; Doc. 64-8); GEN. OPERATING RULES OF THE PA. HOUSE OF REP. R. 17 .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 9, 2015, plaintiffs' counsel sent a letter to the Speaker and Parliamentarian requesting that a member of Pennsylvania Nonbelievers be allowed to deliver the House's opening invocation. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 32; Doc. 92 \u00b6 32; Doc. 64-7). The Parliamentarian denied the request, referencing the September 25, 2014 letter from Speaker Smith and also citing the recent amendment to House Rule 17. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 33; Doc. 64-8). Plaintiffs' counsel subsequently sent separate letters to the Speaker, the Parliamentarian, and various representatives on behalf of Fields, Tucker, Weaver, Rhoades, Neiderhiser, Pennsylvania Nonbelievers, Dillsburg Area FreeThinkers, and Lancaster Freethought Society, requesting that the individuals named therein be permitted to deliver a nontheistic opening invocation. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 34; Doc. 92 \u00b6 34; Doc. 77-21 at 11-21). The Parliamentarian denied the requests. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 35). In his denial letter, the Parliamentarian emphasized House Rule 17 and its recent amendment and concluded that \"[t]he individuals about whom you inquired do not meet the requirements of House Rule 17.\" (Doc. 64-14). The letter did not specify how the individuals failed to satisfy the requirements of House Rule 17. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 19, 2017, plaintiffs' counsel sent a similar letter on behalf of Rev. Dr. Jones, Kiniry, and the Philadelphia Ethical Society. (Doc. 81 \u00b6 36; Doc. 77-21 at 32-33). This time, the Parliamentarian's denial letter indicated that \"[b]ecause the individuals and organization you represent are unwilling to offer a prayer appealing to a higher power, they do not meet the requirements under House Rule 17. We therefore need not address whether they are members of a regularly established church or religious organization.\" (Doc. 77-21 at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The House's Opening Invocation Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before the invocation and Pledge of Allegiance, the Speaker calls the House to order and, typically, introduces the guest chaplain. (Doc. 90 \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75). The Speaker then states, \"Members and guests, please rise as able,\" pounds his gavel three times, and steps aside to allow the guest chaplain to deliver the prayer from the Speaker's rostrum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Speaker's present practice differs from that in effect at the time this litigation commenced. Prior to January 2017, the Speaker simply stated, \"Members and all guests, please rise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77). The House at that time maintained a policy that visitors in the gallery must stand for the opening prayer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81; Doc. 77-20 at 48-66; Doc. 77-25 at 36). When visitors did not stand, a Sergeant at Arms (otherwise known as a legislative security officer) would sometimes approach seated visitors and tell them to follow the Speaker's directive to stand. (Doc. 90 \u00b6 81; Doc. 77-2 at 16, 54; Myer Dep. 99:1-100:5, 102:20-23, 103:14-22; Smith Dep. 58:6-18; Doc. 77-20 at 48, 65-66; Doc. 77-25 at 36-37). Fields and Rhoades attended a House session in February 2012 and chose to remain seated after the Speaker's directive to rise for the opening invocation. (Doc. 77-2 at 16, 54). Both recalled that a Sergeant at Arms approached them in the gallery and loudly and repeatedly directed them to stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Parliamentarian testified that he had not been aware of the Sergeants at Arms' practice and that this policy was changed in January 2017 \"mostly because of the [current] litigation.\" (Myer Dep. 100:3-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Posted signage also addresses visitors' conduct during House sessions. A sign located directly outside the visitors' gallery states, \"Session days begin with an inter-faith prayer and the pledge of allegiance. All guests who are able are requested to stand during this order of business.\" (Doc. 90 \u00b6\u00b6 71-72). Prior to October 16, 2017, the sign was nearly identical except that the word \"physically\" appeared before the word \"able.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action in August 2016. In their original complaint, plaintiffs named as defendants the Speaker, the Parliamentarian, and five House representatives in their official capacities. Plaintiffs asserted claims under the Establishment, Free Exercise, and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment, and under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After briefing and oral argument, we dismissed the Free Exercise, Free Speech, and Equal Protection claims but permitted the Establishment Clause challenges-both to the House guest chaplain policy and the opening invocation practices-to proceed. In July 2017, plaintiffs amended their complaint to include three additional plaintiffs (Rev. Dr. Jones, Kiniry, and the Philadelphia Ethical Society) and four additional defendants (the House Director of Special Events and three other House representatives).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discovery is complete, and the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After extensive and excellent briefing, the motions are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Through summary adjudication, the court may dispose of those claims that do not present a \"genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and for which a jury trial would be an empty and unnecessary formality.

Two legal questions remain:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , whether the House guest chaplain policy that facially discriminates against nontheistic religions violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , whether the pre-2017 or current iteration of the House opening invocation practices involving directives to stand for prayer are unconstitutionally coercive and violative of the Establishment Clause.

Establishment Clause Challenge to House Guest Chaplain Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the House guest chaplain policy violates the Supreme Court of the United States' recent\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   decision and other long-held Establishment Clause principles. They argue that the policy, which intentionally excludes nontheists and nontheistic belief systems, cannot pass constitutional muster even in the\n   <em>\n    sui generis\n   </em>\n   legislative prayer context.

There is no historical evidence of nontheists requesting, or being denied the opportunity, to give the invocation in either chamber of Congress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). As Professor Finkelman notes, this is most likely because, in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, those who did not believe in the existence of God were afraid to let their beliefs become public due to the threat of \"severe physical punishment[ ]\" as well as imprisonment.

Taken to its logical extension, defendants' argument implies that a guest chaplain policy explicitly permitting, for example, only Christian and Jewish presenters would not offend the Constitution because the government is not affiliating itself with a \"single\" religious perspective.

The House chaplain rejected Barker's request because Barker no longer practiced or represented the faith in which he was ordained.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More importantly, although Barker contended that he was challenging the constitutionality of intentional discrimination against atheists and nontheists rather than theistic legislative prayer itself,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n    at 363, 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court construed his claims as \"a challenge to the ability of Congress to open with a prayer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n    at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that to side with Barker \"would be to disregard the Supreme Court precedent that permits legislative prayer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522634\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/346/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This construction of Barker's claim doomed it from the start: after\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , no serious dispute remains as to the constitutionality of legislative prayer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Furthermore, seeking to include secular or nontheist invocations does not automatically impugn the constitutionality of legislative prayer. As plaintiffs in the instant case exhaustively demonstrate, many legislative bodies have granted requests from atheists, Secular Humanists, and other nontheists to deliver opening invocations while simultaneously permitting theistic invocations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 91 at 48; Expert Rpt. at 10, 25; Doc. 77-10 at 15-43). Granting such requests has not resulted in a concomitant challenge to the ability of the legislative body to open with prayer. The two concepts are not mutually exclusive. To hold otherwise implies that \"prayer\" in\n   the legislative prayer context\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be defined as a theistic invocation, which of course is not so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Nontheists Cannot Satisfy House Requirements or Legislative Prayer Purposes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants next argue that because the House has defined \"prayer\" in House Rule 17 to mean an appeal to a higher or divine power, the nontheist plaintiffs are incapable of providing an opening invocation meeting this definition. Defendants further contend that plaintiffs cannot fulfill the purposes of legislative prayer, to wit: to \"accommodate the spiritual needs\" of the legislators and to solicit \"divine guidance for the benefit of the legislators.\" (Doc. 82 at 28, 29, 39-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We reject defendants' narrow view of legislative prayer and its objectives. First, while the Speaker of the House may interpret \"prayer\" and House Rule 17 to require an appeal to a higher or divine power, that definition does not dictate the constitutionality of the House's prayer practice. The Speaker could, presumably, define \"prayer\" in an exclusively Christian manner and apply that definition to categorically exclude every non-Christian from delivering opening prayers in the House. Such exclusion through definition would unquestionably run afoul of the Establishment Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, defendants' perception of the purposes of legislative prayer is myopic. In\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained that legislative prayer \"lends gravity to public business, reminds lawmakers to transcend petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and expresses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful society.\"\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1818 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

It is meant to \"reflect values long part of the Nation's heritage\" and to be \"solemn and respectful in tone,\" inviting our legislators \"to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1823. As Justice O'Connor observed in an earlier case, legislative prayer serves \"the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing public occasions, expressing confidence in the future, and encouraging the recognition of what is worthy of appreciation in society.\"\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p693\">\n    465 U.S. at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p693\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (O'Connor, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nontheistic invocations are equally capable of satisfying these lofty objectives. We reiterate that many legislative bodies across this nation have opened with nontheistic invocations, and there is no evidence that such prayers fared worse than their theistic counterparts at fulfilling the foregoing purposes. We further observe that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   theistic and nontheistic invocations could contravene the purposes of legislative prayer if they were divisive, exclusionary, or disparaging. In other words, it is the content of the prayers, rather than their theistic or nontheistic nature, that matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, we find no merit in defendants' insistence that plaintiffs could not deliver invocations that accommodate the spiritual needs of the lawmakers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 82 at 28, 29, 39-41). At least one House member openly identifies as a secular agnostic. (Doc. 90 \u00b6 62). He testified that he occasionally\n   would like to hear secular opening invocations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another member testified that he would be \"more than happy\" to sponsor an atheist's request to give an opening invocation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). Further exploration of the scope of lawmakers' spiritual needs is unnecessary, as we do not understand defendants to argue that the spiritual needs of the minority are less important than those of the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Prohibiting Discrimination Based on Religion Would Remove Ability to Regulate Invocations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants warn that if the House policy is found to be unconstitutionally discriminatory, the House will be obligated to invite as guest chaplain any person who \"practices religion,\" resulting in \"no permissible means of excluding faiths and belief systems that might be abhorrent or antithetical to its Members or legislative mission.\" (Doc. 82 at 48). Defendants reference fringe religious groups that align with white supremacy, mockery of religion, and subjugation of women, as well as extremist sects like Westboro Baptist Church, known for its virulent anti-LGBTQ beliefs and rhetoric,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

We find defendants' floodgate concerns misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants insist that \"if the House is constitutionally prohibited from excluding 'minority faiths,' it is also constitutionally required to invite any number of groups who embrace hateful (or otherwise unwelcome) religious beliefs.\" (Doc. 100 at 26 (emphasis omitted) ).
