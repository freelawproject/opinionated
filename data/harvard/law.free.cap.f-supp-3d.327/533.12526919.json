R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 12(c) to United States Magistrate Judge Anne Y. Shields for a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\"). On July 24, 2018, Judge Shields issued an R &amp; R, recommending that the Court grant the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the Plaintiff's complaint, and deny the Plaintiff's corresponding motion for judgment in her favor. The R &amp; R found that the ALJ did not err in affording partial weight to the opinions of the Plaintiff's treating physician; the ALJ appropriately concluded that the Plaintiff had the residual functional capacity to perform light work with few limitations; and that the Appeals Council appropriately considered the new evidence submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court are the Plaintiff's objections to the R &amp; R (\"Dkt. 28\"). As the Plaintiff merely repeats his initial arguments, the Court reviews the R &amp; R for clear error. Finding none, the Court adopts the R &amp; R in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
