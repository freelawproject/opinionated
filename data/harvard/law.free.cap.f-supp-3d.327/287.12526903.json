(Compl. Ex. A \u00b6 5). It was founded by Howard Present in 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). It launched its first \"AlphaSector\" index in October 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). The \"AlphaSector\" investment strategy was an exchange-traded fund (\"ETF\") sector rotation strategy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   F-Squared would apply ETF trend data to determine whether a particular ETF was in or out of the AlphaSector portfolio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between October 2008 and September 2013, F-Squared marketed the AlphaSector strategy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). F-Squared's marketing materials included inaccurate statements portraying AlphaSector indices as actual performance in the period from April 2001 to September 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Specifically, F-Squared claimed the strategy\n   was \"not back[-]tested,\" when in fact it was. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7 n.3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, F-Squared incorrectly applied ETF trend data such that the AlphaSector strategy implemented buy and sell signals one week before the price shifts creating the signals actually occurred.

In December 2014, F-Squared and the SEC entered into a settlement in order to resolve the matter. The settlement involved an administrative proceeding, not a civil enforcement action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The settlement took the form of an \"Offer of Settlement of F-Squared Investments, Inc.\" that was accepted by the SEC, although presumably the terms were negotiated in advance. The settlement agreement indicated that F-Squared \"submits this Offer of Settlement ... in anticipation of public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings to be instituted against it by the [SEC]\" pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. (Def.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 VII). F-Squared also \"consent[ed] to the entry of the attached Order by Commission, in which the Commission\" (1) found that F-Squared willfully violated \u00a7\u00a7 204, 206, and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act and various rules promulgated under that act, and aided and abetted a violation of \u00a7 34(b) of the Investment Company Act; (2) ordered that F-Squared cease and desist from committing any future violations; (3) ordered that F-Squared \"pay disgorgement of [$30 million] to the United States Treasury\"; (4) ordered that it pay a \"civil money penalty\" of $5 million to the Treasury; and (5) ordered that it comply with certain undertakings, largely relating to compliance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The \"Offer of Settlement\" also included the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   By submitting this Offer, Respondent hereby acknowledges its waiver of those rights specified in Rules 240(c)(4) and (5) [ 17 C.F.R. 201.240(c)(4) and (5) ] of the Commission's Rules of Practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 V).

He seeks to represent a class of all securities-law violators who have paid disgorgement to the SEC over the past six years. The complaint does not distinguish between disgorgement orders in administrative or judicial proceedings. It asserts two counts, both brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 06. Count 1 is a claim that the SEC \"exceeded its statutory authority by obtaining 'disgorgement' \" in enforcement actions. Count 2 is a claim that the SEC failed to comply with the procedural requirements of federal securities laws by failing to obtain an accounting of profits before ordering disgorgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The SEC has moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.

The trustee has multiple hurdles to overcome to establish such a claim. First, and as set forth below, the SEC has explicit statutory authority to enter disgorgement orders in administrative proceedings. Thus, the settlement is valid unless the SEC's exercise of its statutory authority to obtain disgorgement was somehow illegal. Second, and as noted above, F-Squared entered into a binding settlement with the SEC in which it expressly waived judicial review. Therefore, the Court may consider the trustee's claims only if that waiver is somehow void or otherwise ineffective. Third, Congress has created a process for judicial review of SEC orders in administrative proceedings, and that process does not involve the federal district courts. Accordingly, this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the trustee's claims only if that statutory scheme is somehow inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Supreme Court's Decision in\n     <em>\n      Kokesh\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Following the stock market crash in 1929, Congress enacted a series of laws to regulate the securities industry.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31 (alleging that the agency did not \"conduct[ ] an accounting or return[ ] funds to investor victims.\") ). Because Congress has separately provided statutory authority for civil money penalties, the trustee reasons that the SEC is \"double-dipping despite statutory limitations\" and attempting to rewrite \"clear statutory terms.\" (Mem. in Opp. at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Util.

EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=572%20U.S.%20302\">\n    572 U.S. 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20S.%20Ct.%202427\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2446,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20372\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ) ). In other words, the trustee contends that as a matter of statutory construction, the term \"disgorgement\" does not include disgorgement as a\n   form of penalty, and that therefore such disgorgement is not authorized. The trustee also contends that because no accounting occurred, the $30 million disgorgement amount paid in the settlement had no connection either to the net profits obtained by F-Squared from the scheme or the gross proceeds it received from investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As noted, Congress in 1990 expressly gave the SEC the authority to obtain disgorgement in administrative proceedings. Whether Congress intended only to provide authority for \"disgorgement-as-remedy,\" but not \"disgorgement-as penalty,\" is not obvious from the statutory language. The statute simply uses the word \"disgorgement\"; it does not say, for example, \"disgorgement of profits\" or \"disgorgement of proceeds in order to provide restitution to victims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trustee argues that the term \"disgorgement\" necessarily excludes punitive disgorgement because the provision permitting civil penalties elsewhere in the statute necessarily precludes other monetary penalties. But many statutory schemes provide for multiple, overlapping forms of penalties (such as imprisonment, fines, and forfeitures in criminal cases). Furthermore, as the trustee himself notes, a broad interpretation of \"disgorgement\" had been accepted by the courts since the 1970s. It is a basic canon of statutory construction that \"Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Astoria Fed.

Twenty years elapsed between the time when the SEC first exercised disgorgement authority in\n   <em>\n    Texas Gulf Sulphur\n   </em>\n   and when the Penny Stock Reform Act became law. Arguably, Congress was aware of that long-standing practice and intended to codify it, at least in administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In any event, this Court need not resolve that issue. Whatever the merits of the trustee's argument as a matter of statutory interpretation, that argument has clearly been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Waiver Is Valid\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As noted above, F-Squared, as part of the settlement, clearly and unambiguously waived the right to judicial review by any court. The trustee nonetheless disputes the validity of the waiver on multiple grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, the trustee contends that the settlement was \"narrowly drawn in a manner that does not reach this case.\" (Mem. in Opp. at 17). In support, the trustee argues that the waiver only applied to \"direct reviews of orders and not to collateral claims under the APA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But the waiver does not say that; instead, by its terms, it applies to \"[j]udicial review by any court.\" A claim under the APA seeks judicial review of an agency action. There is nothing in the settlement to suggest that the waiver of judicial review was limited solely to direct review, as opposed to collateral review under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, the trustee contends that the waiver was \"unenforceable because it was based on a mistake of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Specifically, he argues that the settlement was the product of a mutual mistake because the parties were proceeding on the incorrect assumption that the SEC had the authority to impose punitive disgorgement, and that no one realized the mistake until the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   ruled to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But even if\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   changed disgorgement law as to civil enforcement proceedings-and the Supreme Court specifically noted it did not-that opinion says nothing about the application of disgorgement in administrative proceedings. Again, there is no question that the statute, then and now, explicitly permits the SEC to require disgorgement in administrative proceedings. The trustee does not contend that the statute is unconstitutional. Rather, and in essence, the trustee is claiming that (1) the SEC misinterpreted the meaning of the term \"disgorgement\" in the statute; (2) by interpreting the statute too broadly, it was acting outside the scope of its statutory authority-that is, acting\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) by doing so, the SEC was acting unconstitutionally, in violation of principles of separation of powers. According to the trustee, that is an argument that \"may not be waived or bargained away.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   That argument fails, at a minimum, at the last step. Even if the SEC's application of its disgorgement authority was\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   , any such error by the agency was clearly waivable. In\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington v.

Both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires. Because the question-whether framed as an incorrect application of agency authority or an assertion of authority not conferred-is always whether the agency has gone beyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of such claims as \"jurisdictional.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Since\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   , multiple courts of appeals have held that a party may waive an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   challenge to agency action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PGS Geophysical AS v.
