Reply to Def.'s Facts \u00b6 10 (asserting that the assessments also \"contain facts\"). Although the defendant initially disclosed some documents in response to the individual plaintiffs' FOIA requests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 12, it withheld in full the assessments prepared in each of the individual plaintiffs' cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Consequently, on March 31, 2015, the plaintiffs filed this action, alleging that the defendant had violated the FOIA by (1) refusing to release \"the first several paragraphs\" of each assessment,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am.

Subsequently, the plaintiffs identified twenty additional class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' April 2017 Report, Ex. 2 (Declaration of David L.

Second, the defendant's representation that it conducted a \"line-by-line examination\" of each of the assessments to determine whether any portions were reasonably segregable, Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 20, is seemingly undermined by what appears to be the defendant's blanket policy not to release any portion of an assessment, irrespective of its contents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Thus, Catholic Charities has presented evidence showing that all assessments contain at least some reasonably segregable material, and consequently, that the defendant's challenged policy or practice of never providing any part of an assessment to a FOIA requester violates the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendant finally argues that \"numerous courts have upheld [fully] withholding[ ] [assessments] in the past,\" Def.'s Reply at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gatore I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354438\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/46/#p52\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   52 ); however, this point does not undermine Catholic Charities' evidence either. Although two decisions in this Court have held that the defendant properly withheld an assessment in its entirety, these decisions did not reach that conclusion based on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review by the court of the assessment at issue, but instead relied solely on the defendant's representations that any factual content in the assessments could not be reasonably segregated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anguimate v.

Therefore, unlike the decisions in these cases, the conclusions in\n   <em>\n    Anguimate\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Abramyan\n   </em>\n   that assessments\n   do not contain reasonably segregable material were based on a less robust examination of the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Catholic Charities has satisfied its burden to identify specific facts \"such that a reasonable [factfinder] could return a verdict for ...

Compl. \u00b6 25. Specifically, the defendant argues that Catholic Charities cannot establish that any such policy exists because \"the record shows that [the d]efendant has a policy of reviewing assessments ... for segregable information.\" Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. at 17. As support, the defendant relies on the same evidence discussed above, namely, representations from Eggleston that its \"policy includes a segregability review and instructions to release segregable information from assessments,\" Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 8, and that, in this case, the defendant \"reviewed all responsive documents pursuant to the [individual plaintiffs'] FOIA requests,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5, in addition to an excerpt from the FOIA Guide generally instructing the defendant's FOIA reviewers to release reasonably segregable material,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s FOIA Guide Notice, Att. (FOIA Processing Guide) at 49.

Summ. J. Opp'n at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court concludes for several reasons that it cannot award summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff's claim that the defendant has a policy or practice of not even attempting to determine if there are reasonably segregable portions of an assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, it is clear to the Court, and the defendant does\n   not dispute,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Summ. J. Mem.; Def.'s Summ. J.

Second, Catholic Charities' evidence of the defendant's alleged policy or practice of not providing any part of an assessment to FOIA requesters gives rise to the reasonable inference that the defendant also has a policy or practice of not even attempting to determine if there are reasonably segregable portions of assessments, given that the former policy or practice would render it unnecessary for the defendant's FOIA reviewers to make segregability determinations as to assessments. In other words, the evidence of the defendant's alleged policy or practice of not providing any part of an assessment to FOIA requesters constitutes circumstantial evidence of the defendant's alleged policy or practice of not even attempting to determine if there are reasonably segregable portions of assessments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucas v.

The cited FOIA Guide excerpt generally instructing FOIA reviewers to \"segregate information that is exempt ... from information that is non-exempt,\" Def.'s FOIA Guide Notice, Att. (FOIA Processing Guide) at 49, does not foreclose the existence of an informal practice of not making segregability determinations when specifically reviewing assessments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    837 F.2d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (instructing that policy-or-practice claims may be based on \"informal [practices], rather than [practices] articulated in ... an official statement of policy\"), which can be reasonably inferred from the Guide's more specific instruction to \"withhold [assessments] in full,\" Def.'s FOIA Guide Notice, Att. (FOIA Processing Guide) at 159, and other evidence demonstrating the existence of a policy or practice of never providing any part of an assessment to FOIA requesters.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that it has disclosed all reasonably segregable portions of the individual plaintiffs' assessments, and therefore,\n   the Court must deny the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the individual plaintiffs' requests for the factual introductory paragraphs of their assessments. The Court will also\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   enter summary judgment for the individual plaintiffs as to these requests and order the defendant to disclose the first several paragraphs of each assessment as indicated in the Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion. Additionally, the Court concludes that Catholic Charities has identified sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the defendant has a policy or practice of never providing any part of an assessment and not even attempting to determine if assessments contain reasonably segregable material. Thus, the Court must deny the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Catholic Charities' policy-or-practice claims, as well. Finally, because the individual plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they are members of the putative class or that they have standing to obtain prospective injunctive or declaratory relief, the Court must deny the individual plaintiffs' request for class certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 24th day of August, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Their Motion for Class Certification (\"Pls.'
