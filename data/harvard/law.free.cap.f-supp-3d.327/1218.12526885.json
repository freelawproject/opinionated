S.B.'s Relevant School-Placement History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the allegations of the First Amended Complaint (FAC), Plaintiff\n   S.B. is a 16-year old student who is eligible for special education due specific health and learning disabilities. She has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder with Mood-Incongruent Psychotic Features, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Major Depressive Disorder with auditory and visual hallucinations, along with a specific learning disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the 2014-2015 school year, S.B. was in the seventh grade and enrolled in the Fresno Unified School District (Fresno Unified). In August 2014, S.B.'s individualized Education Plan (IEP) placed her in a mild/moderate special day class four periods per day and provided a behavior intervention plan that provided 10 minutes per day of behavior intervention services. (Doc. 26-1, Amended Due Process Cmplt. (ADPC) \u00b6\u00b6 4-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2015, S.B. was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for being a danger to herself or others and she remained in a psychiatric hospital until August 5, 2015. (Doc. 26-1, ADPC, \u00b6 13.) After her release from the hospital, she was placed at Phoenix Secondary Academy, within Fresno Unified, during the 2015-2016 school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) S.B's mental health continued to decline. In October 2015, she was again admitted to the hospital on an involuntary psychiatric hold due to suicidal ideation, was admitted to an acute psychiatric facility in November, and after release, was again placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for suicidal ideation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) S.B. returned to school at the beginning of December 2015. By December 16, 2015, S.B. was suspended for two days for disruptive behavior - i.e., yelling profanity at staff and peers, and she was thereafter again placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold as being a danger to herself or others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2016, Fresno Unified IEP team met to change S.B.'s placement and offered a nonpublic school with 10 minutes per day of behavior services, and 30 minutes per week of individual counseling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33.) In early March 2016, S.B. was again placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold as a danger to herself or others; she was discharged a week later, only to be readmitted again on March 29, 2016, on the same basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 5, 2016, Fresno Unified convened a 30-day IEP to review the non-public placement; Fresno Unified again offered a nonpublic school placement with 10 minutes per day of behavior services, and thirty minutes per week of individual counseling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 42.) On April 16, 2016, S.B. was placed in juvenile hall for acts of physical aggression Plaintiffs maintain resulted\n   from her mental health deficits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The juvenile hall school was operated by Fresno County Office of Education which offered an interim IEP to S.B. of 150 minutes of specialized instruction, 10 minutes per day of behavior services, and thirty minutes per week of counseling services (essentially the same IEP as offered by Fresno Unified). (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) In May 2016, Fresno County convened a 30-day IEP team meeting, which resulted in the same IEP offer as before. For the remainder of the school year, S.B. continued to struggle with her behavior, lack of work completion, and mental health issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because S.B. was now under the auspices of the Fresno County Juvenile Probation, that agency determined her ninth-grade placement for the 2016-2017 school year. Fresno Juvenile placed S.B. at Victor Treatment in Santa Rosa, California. (FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) According to Plaintiffs, this change in Local Educational Agency (\"LEA\") was mandated by California Education Code \u00a7 56162 and \u00a7 56156.4. In relevant part, Section 56162 requires that students with exceptional needs placed by a public agency (other than an educational agency) in a children's institution shall be considered residents of the geographical area where the children's institution is located for purposes of special education and related services. Section 56156.4 provides direction as to how and which local agency would provide special education services. As a result of these provisions, Sonoma County Office of Education, not Fresno Unified, was charged with overseeing S.B.'s IEP and educational needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   S.B.'s placement at Victor Treatment did not go well. She received at least ten major behavior reports for leaving the program, self-injurious behavior, assaultive behavior, property destruction, and running away from staff; she had to be restrained and, on at least seven occasions in a two-week period, was hospitalized for being a danger to herself or others. Her placement at Victor Treatment was terminated on September 7, 2016, and because she was ostensibly returned to Fresno, her LEA changed back to Fresno County Office of Education. Because S.B. was only within Sonoma County's jurisdiction for 3 weeks, she was not assessed, no IEP was convened, and S.B.'s parents did not have time to exercise their right to obtain a new assessment or IEP. (FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 3, 2016, Fresno Juvenile placed S.B. at Milhous in Elk Grove, California. As a result, S.B.'s supervising LEA changed to Elk Grove Unified School District. S.B. was hospitalized within two days of her admittance to Milhous, and she remained in a psychiatric hospital until November 7, 2016, when she was again returned to juvenile hall by Fresno Juvenile. Again, her LEA changed from Elk Grove back to Fresno County Office of Education. (FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In early January 2017, Fresno Juvenile transferred oversight of S.B. to Fresno County Department of Social Services (Fresno DSS), as Plaintiffs maintain Fresno Juvenile could not meet S.B.'s needs. (FAC, \u00b6 37.) Fresno DSS placed S.B. in a group home in Kern County, and her supervising LEA changed yet again, this time to Kern County High School District. (FAC, \u00b6 38.) Kern County failed to make any interim placement offer and S.B. was put on an independent study program, but no comprehensive assessment or new IEP was formulated. (FAC, \u00b6 39.) From January 9, 2017, through February 15, 2017, S.B. refused to perform work, left class without permission, exhibited aggression toward staff, engaged in self-injurious behaviors, and attempted inappropriate sexual conduct. S.B.'s parents also believe she\n   was hospitalized during this time as being a danger to herself or others. (FAC, \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Fresno DSS changed S.B.'s placement to Charis Youth Center in Grass Valley, which changed S.B's supervising LEA for the eighth time in less than a year to Nevada Joint Union High School District. (FAC, \u00b6 42.) S.B. was moved again after about 6 weeks to a group home in the Redlands Unified School District. (FAC, \u00b6 44.) S.B. exhibited all the previous behavioral problems including refusal to work, leaving class without permission, aggression toward staff, and self-injurious behaviors including intentionally stepping into oncoming traffic. On April 19, 2017, Redlands Unified suspended S.B. for five days for assaultive behavior and on April 28, 2017, S.B. was discharged from the group home for running away. (FAC, \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fresno DSS placed S.B. in a group home in Fresno under the educational supervision of Fresno Central Unified School District, but she was never enrolled in school. (FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) By May 15, 2017, S.B. was again placed in juvenile hall due to assaultive behavior in the group home, and her LEA changed once again to Fresno County Office of Education. S.B. was returned to the group home in Fresno Central Unified (again changing her LEA from Fresno County Office of Education to Fresno Central Unified), but by May 25, 2017, S.B. was again admitted to a psychiatric hospital as a danger to herself or others. (FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In June 2017, Fresno Juvenile or Fresno DSS (it is unclear which) placed S.B. at Victor Treatment Center in Lodi, changing her LEA to Linden Unified School District. (FAC, \u00b6 56.) In October 2017, this placement was terminated, and Fresno DSS placed S.B. with her mother for 6 days, during which time Fresno Unified was her assigned LEA. On October 9, 2017, S.B. was placed in a group home in Ventura County, but within two days she had run away and was hospitalized as a danger to herself. (FAC, \u00b6 65.) By October 16, 2017, S.B. was given a seven-day termination notice from the Ventura group home, and she was again returned to the care of her mother. As of November 1, 2017, the jurisdiction of the \"dependency court\" was terminated, and S.B. was waiting for placement at Judge Rotenberg, an out-of-state residential treatment program in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Complaint to OAH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In July 18, 2017, S.B. and her parents filed a due process complaint under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) with the California Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), naming as defendants the State Defendants, the Agency Defendants, Fresno Juvenile, Fresno DSS, and the eight LEAs who had responsibility for S.B. over the prior two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On July 19, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amended due process complaint with the OAH, and both the CDE and the State of California filed motions to be dismissed as parties from the administrative proceedings. OAH dismissed CDE and the State of California, determining that the claims against these entities were outside the scope of OAH's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On December 15, 2017, the OAH issued a notice of case dismissal indicating that Plaintiffs' due process complaint against the remaining parties, the LEAs, had been settled through mediation. (Doc. 26-1, p. 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Complaint Before This Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Meanwhile, on November 8, 2017, Plaintiffs filed suit against the parties dismissed from the OAH proceeding, i.e., the State of\n   California and CDE, and named additional Defendants Brown and Torlakson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' FAC sets out six claims for relief. The first claim for relief against CDE and the State is under the IDEA. Plaintiffs maintain California's Education Code requires a student's assigned LEA to be based on geographic placement of the student. This, however, resulted in a constant change of LEA and precluded S.B. from receiving an assessment, an appropriate IEP, and, ultimately, a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In S.B.'s case, in the time it took for the receiving LEA to convene an IEP and offer to assess S.B., S.B. was either sent back to juvenile hall, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, or was otherwise moved by either Fresno Juvenile or Fresno DSS. Because of these residency rules requiring a student's LEA to be assigned based on geographic placement of that student, S.B. was denied the processes necessary to ensure her educational rights. Plaintiffs allege that the State and CDE have an obligation to ensure a FAPE is available to all children, including children who are in the dependency and delinquency system, as well as children with severe mental health deficits. Plaintiffs seek a judicial order requiring the State and CDE to develop policies and procedures to ensure that students within the juvenile justice system have one designated LEA responsible for development of IEPs, not dependent on the geographic location of their placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs' second claim is also under the auspices of the IDEA's requirement that special education students be placed in the least restrictive environment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), as close as possible to a student's home as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.116\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) and California Education Code \u00a7 56342. Moreover, there must be a continuum of placements available to meet the needs of a disabled student under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.115\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and California Education Code \u00a7 56342. Plaintiffs allege that, due to the severity of her mental health needs, S.B. required an educational placement in an appropriate residential treatment center within the state of California in order to receive a FAPE. Plaintiffs allege the State and CDE have failed to ensure that special education students with the most severe mental health needs have access to in-state residential treatment centers. Instead, students are \"shipped out of state far from their homes\" to receive the care they require, which makes it impossible to transition back into their communities when the placement ends. Plaintiffs seek a judicial order requiring the State and CDE to develop policies and procedures to assure residential treatment centers are available in-state for students with severe mental health needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs' third claim for relief is against CDE and the State for violation of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (RA). Plaintiffs allege the State and CDE, by failing to ensure appropriate residential treatment centers are available inside California, deny equal access to education services to those with severe mental health needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs' fourth claim for relief is against the State and CDE for violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Plaintiffs allege the State and CDE's failure to ensure access to residential treatment facilities inside\n   California resulted in S.B. missing numerous instructional hours and led to recurrent hospitalizations. Moreover, S.B.'s emotional lability made it impossible for her to meet and sustain the behavioral requirements of the various institutions where she was placed, which resulted in a plethora of different placements in different geographic locations, each supervised by a different LEA. As a result, no LEA had time to conduct an assessment, revise S.B.'s IEP, and S.B.'s parents did not have time to initiate a request for this type of review. As such, Plaintiffs maintain S.B. was denied access to an educational program within California specifically because of her mental health needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs' fifth claim for relief is against Brown and Torlakson in their official capacities under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs maintain that as S.B's responsible LEA changed with each new placement, it was impossible for S.B. to receive an appropriate education and denied her due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs' sixth claim is against all Agency and State Defendants for declaratory relief. Plaintiffs maintain the residency scheme set forth in California Education Code sections 56156.4 and 56162 result in a disparate impact on students with significant mental health disorders and/or other highly mobile students with disabilities such as S.B., in that they are denied the benefits of one consistent agency responsible for their educational assessments. Plaintiffs seek a determination that these California Education Code sections violate the California Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). A Rule 12(b)(1) motion tests whether a complaint alleges grounds for federal subject matter jurisdiction. A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction will be granted if the complaint on its face fails to allege facts sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savage v. Glendale Union High Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097968\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/1036/\">\n    343 F.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 n.2 (9th Cir. 2003). In considering a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the Court \"is not restricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and testimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792557\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/558/#p560\">\n    850 F.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560 (9th Cir. 1988). Once a party has moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), the opposing party bears the burden of establishing the court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222733\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1115/#p1122\">\n    598 F.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1122 (9th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is a challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations set forth in the complaint. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper where there is either a \"lack of a cognizable legal theory\" or \"the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533720\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/901/696/#p699\">\n    901 F.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699 (9th Cir. 1990). In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court generally accepts as true the allegations in the complaint, construes the pleading in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and resolves all doubts in the pleader's favor.\n   <em>\n    Lazy Y. Ranch LTD v. Behrens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893653\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/580/#p588\">\n    546 F.3d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (9th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must allege \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must allege two distinct elements: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest; and (2) denial of adequate procedural protections.\n   <em>\n    Brewster v. Bd. of Educ. of Lynwood Unified Sch.

(Doc. 25-1, 35:22-36:3.) The Court does not interpret Plaintiffs' complaint to make such an assertion. Plaintiffs allege S.B. has been deprived of her constitutional right to the education that California has entitled her without sufficient due process procedural protections. They allege the procedural safeguards for ensuring a FAPE were rendered useless and unavailable because of the multiple LEA changes S.B. was subjected to resulting from application of the Education Code's residency rules; the only procedure that was available was a due process complaint\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   S.B. had been denied a FAPE. Plaintiffs' theory appears to be that the California Education Code obviated necessary pre-deprivation procedural safeguards (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   notice and some opportunity to participate and be heard regarding S.B.'s educational requirements\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   S.B. was deprived her right to a FAPE). This is a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim for violation of the Constitution's procedural due process guarantee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Agency Defendants argue the FAC is devoid of facts alleging the extensive procedural processes provided by the IDEA were insufficient; specifically, Agency Defendants argue there is no allegation S.B.'s parents ever requested any process such as an IEP meeting or an educational assessment. Agency Defendants note the California Education Code requires completion of assessments when an exceptional needs student is transferred from one district to another within an academic year; because Plaintiffs never requested an evaluation, Plaintiffs cannot show it could not\n   have been accomplished, even in light of the multiple transfers S.B. experienced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   While Agency Defendants point to many types of process available to ensure parental participation in the IEP process, Plaintiffs' allegations plausibly imply the procedural safeguards normally available (educational assessments, IEP meetings, etc.) were rendered useless and constructively unavailable because S.B.'s assigned LEA changed so rapidly; in other words, there was insufficient time to\n   <em>\n    request\n   </em>\n   an educational evaluation or an IEP meeting. Plaintiffs allege S.B. was sometimes transferred to a new LEA before they were even aware of the identity of the previously assigned LEA. (FAC \u00b6 65.) The facts alleged plausibly imply S.B.'s placements were changed with such frequency there was no\n   <em>\n    time\n   </em>\n   to initiate any of the procedural safeguards to ensure a proper FAPE determination, nor any time to complete those processes. (FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 21-68.) Whether Plaintiffs were, in fact, owed constitutional due process protections before a FAPE determination was made (in the form of IEP offers), what type of process was required, and whether Plaintiffs were unable to effectively initiate any of the required procedures are matters to be addressed on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Agency Defendants next argue the claim is deficient because it does not sufficiently allege how Torlakson performed any acts that precluded S.B. from receiving an education and due process. In an official-capacity suit, a defendant's liability is connected to the entity's policy or custom that played a part in the violation of federal law.\n   <em>\n    McRorie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595967\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/780/#p783\">\n    795 F.2d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs contend the California Education Code's residency rule precluded proper educational assessments and parent participation in the IEP process which are important and required procedural safeguards to ensuring that a FAPE is not denied.

Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants (both Agency and State Defendants) argue Plaintiffs were required to exhaust completely their administrative remedies before pursuing the IDEA claims filed with this Court; to accomplish exhaustion, Defendants contend, Plaintiffs were required to complete the administrative process against the LEAs, even after CDE and the State of California were dismissed from the administrative process for lack of OAH jurisdiction. Defendants argue the claims against CDE and the State are fundamentally predicated on whether S.B. was denied a FAPE when her LEA was reassigned based on the location of S.B.'s placement by various public agencies; whether a FAPE required that S.B. receive a residential placement; and, if so, whether that placement must be\n   <em>\n    in-state\n   </em>\n   to provide S.B. with the Least Restrictive Environment under the IDEA. Defendants argue these findings first should be made by education experts in the administrative setting. Because Plaintiffs voluntarily settled their IDEA claims against the LEAs, Defendants argue Plaintiffs' IDEA claims against CDE and the State are not exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   When the OAH agreed and dismissed CDE and the State as parties, Plaintiffs maintain the claims against those entities were exhausted to the extent possible. (Plaintiffs' Oppo., Doc. 31, 9-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Abraham P. v. L.A. Unified Sch.

Cal. Oct. 5, 2017).) Plaintiffs argue any further exhaustion (completion of the administrative process against the LEAs) should be excused because pursing a decision against the individual school districts (as opposed to the settlement that Plaintiffs reached with the LEAs) does not \"make sense.\" Plaintiffs contend they would not be able to enforce findings made by the OAH in a subsequent proceeding against CDE and the State because they were no longer parties to that process. Moreover, the relief Plaintiffs seek against CDE and the State was, as determined by OAH and argued by CDE and the State, outside the OAH's jurisdiction to grant. And, Plaintiffs' note, pursuing the administrative process to a decision against the\n   LEAs before instituting suit against CDE and the State would create other procedural problems. Specifically, if forced to complete administrative proceedings against the LEAs following CDE and the State's dismissal by the OAH, the limitation period to file suit against CDE and the State in this Court would expire and time-bar the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, if Plaintiffs were required to complete exhaustion by obtaining a hearing-officer decision on the remaining claims against the LEAs, Plaintiffs argue they would lose the benefit of settling with the LEAs and receiving an immediate placement for S.B., and would potentially be required to pay their own attorney fees, even if they were ultimately the prevailing party.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D)(i) (attorneys' fees may not be awarded to prevailing parent if relief finally obtained by parent is not more favorable to the parents than a timely offer of settlement). Finally, Plaintiffs note that, in support of their motions to be dismissed from the OAH process, CDE and the State characterized Plaintiffs' claims as systemic issues of statutory compliance. Plaintiffs maintain the Ninth Circuit has not required exhaustion of systemic IDEA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants respond that Plaintiffs' opposition argument ignores the importance of the administrative process as explained in\n   <em>\n    Hoeft v. Tucson Unified School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519858\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1298/#p1303\">\n    967 F.2d 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (9th Cir. 1992). According to Defendants, because Plaintiffs settled the underlying administrative complaint against the LEAs, Plaintiffs did not pursue to decision whether any LEA failed to provide Plaintiff a FAPE, and therefore there is no final determination of what S.B.'s education needs are, if different from what was provided in her operative IEP. Defendants maintain Plaintiffs' claims against CDE and the State are predicated on the \"unsubstantiated presumption\" that S.B. was denied a FAPE, and insist there is a dispute as to what educational program S.B. required to receive a FAPE. Moreover, Defendants argue, to the extent that CDE was responsible for provision of any services to S.B. directly, that would require a finding that the underlying LEAs were not able to provide education and special services to offer S.B. a FAPE. Defendants maintain that without these underlying findings, exhaustion is incomplete and cannot be excused as to any of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

This would include a claim for money damages under RA for emotional distress caused by the denial of FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In many cases, it is fairly clear how a non-IDEA claim, although arising out of injuries that occurred at school, is separate and distinct from the denial of FAPE.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Abraham P. v.

Cal. Oct. 5, 2017) (damages sought for physical abuse at school not related to implementation of child's educational program). For such a claim, it does not matter what specific remedy is sought because the claim cannot be said to be \"seeking relief that is also available under IDEA\" as the injury alleged was not predicated on a denial of FAPE. The injury would have been incurred regardless whether a FAPE had been provided. For those types of claims, exhaustion of IDEA's procedures becomes unnecessary because findings about the provision of FAPE are immaterial and render the educational expertise of an administrative agency unessential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The difficult question - the question\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   left unanswered - is how to apply \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) to non-IDEA claims where the injury is due to a denial of FAPE, but the remedy sought is a form of damages technically unavailable under IDEA. The obvious example is a \u00a7 504 RA claim seeking emotional distress damages stemming primarily from the denial of FAPE. This difficult question must be answered here because, as discussed below, Plaintiffs' RA and ADA claims appear predicated on the denial of FAPE. Plaintiffs argue that characterization is immaterial because, even if predicated on the denial of FAPE, the RA and ADA claims seek money damages for emotional distress that is not available under IDEA and thus do not come within \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )'s exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   One district court very recently has considered non-IDEA, FAPE-based claims seeking monetary damages similar to those presented here.\n   <em>\n    Paul G. v.

As articulated in\n   <em>\n    Paul G.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   's reasoning and examples show \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) encompasses FAPE-based, non-IDEA claims regardless whether the precise remedy sought is technically available under IDEA. And, there are practical reasons why this is the correct interpretation of \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First, if a request for damages unavailable under IDEA exempts a non-IDEA claim from exhaustion under \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ), then most of\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   's analysis is obsolete. This is so because, regardless whether a claim is FAPE-based or not, so long as it seeks a remedy not technically awardable by a hearing officer at the administrative level, it is not subject to \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Second, not only would such a short-cut analysis of \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) ignore much of\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   's interpretative reasoning, it would eviscerate the purpose behind exhaustion of IDEA claims. If FAPE-based claims - the gravamen of which is the denial of FAPE - are exempted from exhaustion merely because they seek damages, district courts would be making FAPE determinations without the benefit of an administrative hearing and decision by an expert in education law, and without an administrative record collecting the relevant documentation and witness testimony conducive to judicial review. Additionally, the agency would be deprived of any opportunity to remedy the denial of FAPE in the first instance. In other words, FAPE-based claims that\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be adjudicated by an administrative hearing officer would be subject to immediate judicial review, which undermines the public policy supporting IDEA's appeals process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, exempting a sect of FAPE-based claims from exhaustion would produce unintended, detrimental results.

Applying these questions to E.F., the Court noted the Frys were not challenging the district's provision of educational opportunities; by providing a one-to-one human aid, E.F.'s parents conceded that all of E.F.'s educational needs were satisfied. Wonder's assistance, however, was not simply about accessing educational services. Wonder assisted E.F. in living independently by helping her with activities such as retrieving dropped items, helping her balance, opening and closing doors, turning on and off lights, helping her take her coat off, and helping her transfer to and from the toilet. Precluding Wonder's assistance, the Court reasoned, was like requiring a student who used a wheelchair to be instead carried by an aid or requiring a blind student to be led around by a teacher instead of permitting that student to use a guide dog or a cane. This type of claim could be pressed at any public facility, not just a school because it did not center on providing appropriate educational services, it centered on accommodating access of a disabled person to a public facility. It could also be brought by a visitor or an employee seeking equal access to the facilities because the accommodation, at its heart, had little to do with the provision of educational services. A further sign that the gravamen of the suit is a denial of FAPE can emerge from the history of the proceedings and whether the plaintiff previously invoked IDEA's formal procedures to handle the dispute. \"A plaintiff's initial choice to pursue that process may suggest that she is indeed seeking relief for the denial of a FAPE - with the shift to judicial proceedings prior to full exhaustion reflecting only strategic calculations about how to maximize the prospects for such a remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Not only is the Court ill-equipped to make this type of inquiry into the details of S.B.'s precise educational needs given her health concerns in the first instance, the fact that the LEAs are not parties to this case is problematic. The witnesses, documents, and educational experts (teachers, school psychologists, etc.) are largely in the employ of the various LEAs. Yet, the LEAs are not obligated by the same initial disclosure rules as parties, which will complicate and lengthen discovery since most of the relevant evidence will be in the possession of the LEAs. And, without an administrative record and decision to which the LEAs would have been parties, the Court will be required to make findings about the provision of educational services by the LEAs in a litigation where they are completely absent.

Agency Defendants argue Plaintiffs' claims are entirely predicated on proving the LEAs failed to provide S.B. a FAPE, which cannot be done without the LEAs' presence in the case. Because Plaintiffs' settled their due process complaint against the LEAs, those parties can never be joined to the case, requiring dismissal of the entire matter. Agency Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   , where the court dismissed a case against CDE based on similar grounds because the LEA was no longer a party to the litigation. Agency Defendants also cite\n   <em>\n    Paiute-Shoshone Indians of Bishop Community of Bishop Colony, Cal. v.

Under 19(a), the court conducts a two-pronged analysis to determine whether a party is required. First, the court is to consider whether complete relief is possible among those already parties to the suit.\n   <em>\n    Makah Indian Tribe v. Verity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536504\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/555/#p558\">\n    910 F.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (9th Cir. 1990). Alternatively, the court decides whether the non-party has a \"legally protected interest in the suit\" that would be impaired or impeded by adjudicating the case without it or an existing party would be subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536504\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/555/#p558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If either of these prongs is answered in the affirmative, then the absent party is \"required\" under Rule 19(a), and that party must be ordered to join. If joinder of that party is not possible, the court then considers whether the four factors under Rule 19(b) indicate the action could proceed among the existing parties or should instead be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Paiute-Shoshone\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that the United States was a required party under Rule 19. Based on the plaintiff's theory of the case, full relief could not be awarded to the plaintiff without the United States (a non-party) conveying title to land it held to the plaintiff. To bind the United States by such an order, the United States was a required party. The court then determined the United States could not be joined as a party based on sovereign immunity and proceeded to analyze whether the suit could nonetheless proceed without the\n   United States under Rule 19(b). The court concluded the third factor under Rule 19(b) weighed in favor of dismissal of the suit because the city would have to defend actions of the United States in conveying title to property. Agency Defendants argue that under 19(b), like in\n   <em>\n    Paiute-Shoshone\n   </em>\n   , the absence of the LEAs in this case precludes any determination that any LEA violated S.B.'s right to a FAPE, and Agency Defendants cannot be required to defend the underlying IDEA claims against the LEAs Plaintiffs allege failed to serve S.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The Court agrees litigation of Plaintiffs' FAPE-based claims is extremely complicated without the presence of the LEAs, as discussed in the exhaustion section above. However, Agency Defendants' Rule 19 argument is incomplete. First, it assumes without analysis that the LEAs are a required party under 19(a). Without a showing the LEAs are required under Rule 19(a), there is no basis to consider whether the LEAs are indispensable under Rule 19(b) such that the litigation cannot proceed without them. Second, Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim against Torlaksen is the only viable claim, as set forth above, and it is not based primarily on denial of a FAPE. There is no need to prove, for purposes of that claim, the LEAs denied Plaintiff a FAPE. The remaining FAPE-based claims must be dismissed for lack of exhaustion, so Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs' claims required proving that the LEAs denied S.B. a FAPE is simply inapplicable. Accordingly, Agency Defendants have not met their burden to show that the LEAs are required parties to this litigation under Rule 19.\n   <em>\n    Makah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536504\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/555/#p558\">\n    910 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   558 ;\n   <em>\n    Biagro W.

Federal Rule of Evidence 201 permits a court to take judicial notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute because it is either generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction or it can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. All the documents the parties seek the court to judicially notice are public records.

Congress could not have intended exhaustion of non-IDEA claims under IDEA's appeals procedures to mean mechanically presenting the claims to the agency only to be dismissed - that would be empty and meaningless, accomplishing nothing exhaustion is meant to achieve. This also means that FAPE-based RA and ADA claims do not need to be pled in a due process complaint directed to the OAH to be exhausted; it is pointless to require a plaintiff to file claims with the OAH over which the entity lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate.
