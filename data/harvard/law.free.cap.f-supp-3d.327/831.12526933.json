The False Claims Act, however, includes a public disclosure bar that prohibits lawsuits brought by relators where the relator's allegations of fraud have already been disclosed to the government. The company contends that the claims of fraud raised in the relator's complaint were publicly disclosed prior to the time the relator filed the complaint. Consequently, the company asks the court to enter summary judgment in its favor and dismiss the action under the public disclosure bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The company's motion, however, presents numerous technical legal issues, several of which have yet to be resolved in this circuit. A number of these issues arise from the fact that in 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Congress amended the public disclosure bar to restrict the material that counts as a public disclosure and broadened the exception to the public disclosure bar. The exception now provides, in broad terms, that a relator may avoid dismissal under the bar if she is an original source. While the Third Circuit has had occasion to address the post amendment disclosure bar, the parties, through the outstanding work of counsel, have raised a number of creative arguments that the Third Circuit has yet to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition to those unresolved legal questions, the motion also presents difficult factual issues. The public disclosure bar analysis involves an intricate comparison of the fraud allegations in this case to the fraud allegations in the prior public disclosures. After performing this comparison, the court must also address the original source exception. In an effort to solidify her status as an original source, the relator has submitted over two thousand pages of documents to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After reviewing the amended public disclosure bar and the applicable case law, the court concludes that the vast majority of the relator's allegations of fraud were contained in valid prior public disclosures. The court also finds, however-after a rigorous examination of the documents the relator provided to the government-that under the Third Circuit's interpretation of the original source exception, the relator qualifies as an original source. Thus, despite the presence of prior public disclosures that advanced substantially the same allegations of fraud as the relator does here, the court denies the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 20, 2015, the relator, Cathleen Forney (\"Relator Forney\"), filed a sealed complaint alleging that the defendant, Medtronic, Inc. (\"Medtronic\"), violated the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\"). Doc. No. 1. Relator Forney named the United States and 29 state governments as plaintiffs in the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1, Doc. No. 1. The United States then filed two motions seeking to extend the seal while it determined whether to intervene in the case. Doc. Nos. 2, 6. The court\n   granted both motions and extended the seal. Doc. Nos. 3, 7. Then, on December 12, 2016, the United States and the 29 plaintiff states filed notices that they declined intervene. Doc. Nos. 8, 9. Accordingly, on December 14, 2016, the court lifted the seal and ordered Relator Forney to serve the complaint on Medtronic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 14, 2016 Order, Doc. No. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Four months later, Relator Forney filed an amended complaint. Doc. No. 17. The court ordered Medtronic to respond to the amended complaint by April 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   April 13, 2017 Order, Doc. No. 29. On April 24, 2017, Medtronic filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in which it asserted,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Relator Forney had failed to plead fraud with sufficient particularity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Medtronic, Inc.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Its Mot. to Dismiss, Doc. No. 30-1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 9(b) (requiring fraud to be pled with particularity). The court found serious problems with the allegations in the amended complaint and, accordingly, granted the motion and dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 19, 2017 Mem. Op., Doc. No. 37; June 19, 2017 Order, Doc. No. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relator Forney then filed a second amended complaint on July 6, 2017. Doc. No. 42. On July 27, 2017, Medtronic moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. Doc. No. 48. On August 14, 2017, notwithstanding the court's lingering concern that the \"relator's theory of support services amounting to illegal remuneration will not ultimately prove to be viable,\" the court denied the second motion to dismiss \"without prejudice to the defendant raising its arguments in a motion for summary judgment.\" Aug. 14, 2017 Order, Doc. No. 52. Accordingly, the court set scheduling deadlines and ordered the parties to complete fact discovery by December 22, 2017. Aug. 14, 2017 Scheduling Order, Doc. No. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the conclusion of fact discovery, Medtronic filed an early motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Medtronic Inc.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Due to Public Disclosure Bar (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), Doc. No. 64. In the motion, Medtronic contends that it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor because of the FCA's public disclosure bar.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the court placed all scheduling deadlines in suspense pending resolution of the motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 29, 2017 Order, Doc. No. 67. Relator Forney filed a response to the motion on December 8, 2017, and Medtronic filed a reply in further support of the motion on December 20, 2017. Doc. Nos. 69, 70. On December 20, 2017, the court heard oral argument on the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court ordered supplemental briefing on April 3, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 3, 2018 Order, Doc. No. 74. Relator Forney filed a supplemental memorandum on April 17, 2018. Doc. No. 75. Medtronic filed a response to the supplemental memorandum on May 1, 2018. Doc. No. 76. The motion for summary judgment is now ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The second amended complaint sets forth the following allegations: Medtronic is a massive international medical device manufacturer that, in the United States alone, \"generate[s] between 8.8 and 9.2 billion dollars per year.\" Second Am. Compl. at 4, Doc. No. 42. Relator Forney worked at Medtronic for 16 years-from 1996 until 2012 when Medtronic terminated her employment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. At the time of her termination, Relator Forney was working as a District Service Manager for the Cardio and Vascular Group, where she reported to the District Manager for the Eastern Pennsylvania District.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relator Forney contends that during her time at Medtronic she observed Medtronic engage in an extensive illegal fraud scheme.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 4. In broad terms, she contends that Medtronic provided free services to people \"who made purchasing decisions about Medtronic devices\" and that these free services were \"intended to persuade health care providers to purchase Medtronic devices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Relator Forney contends that these services constitute illegal remuneration under the FCA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relator Forney references a number of instances where Medtronic allegedly provided services as an incentive to convince health care providers to purchase devices from it. These instances can be grouped into three categories: (1) device checks and device interrogations; (2) implant services; and (3) practice management consulting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 4-19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Relator Forney's Opp. to Medtronic's Mot. for Summ. J. Based on Public Disclosure Bar at 19 (\"Forney's Br.\") (characterizing the second amended complaint as alleging these three theories of fraud), Doc. No. 69-1. Relator Forney is apparently no longer pursuing her implant services theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Forney's Br. at 19 n.3 (\"Relator intends to seek only damages for kickbacks paid in the form of device checks and consulting services. Relator has conferred with the United States, which does not object to Relator ceasing to prosecute the free labor at implant surgeries.\"). Accordingly, the court will address the remaining two theories in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beginning with Relator Forney's device check theory, she contends that after a physician implanted a Medtronic medical device, Medtronic provided \"checks\" or \"interrogations\" of the device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 9-10. Relator Forney offers her own experience and training as an example of these device checks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. Forney was credentialed to perform the following services at one hospital: (1) performing system assessments on Pacemakers through the use of packing system analyzers and programmers, (2) evaluation and reprogramming of Pacemaker devices at bedside, evaluation and reprogramming of devices at bedside, (3) performing system assessments on ICD Systems through the use of system analyzers and programmers, (4) evaluation and reprogramming of ICD devices at bedsides, and (5) evaluation and reprogramming of IC [sic] devices at procedural and surgical suites off-site from hospitals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Relator Forney also contends that, in order to facilitate these free device checks, Medtronic paid \"the necessary costs involved in credentialing\" its Clinical Specialists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. These costs included background checks.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Costs of the background checks range from $60 to $250 each.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Relator Forney contends that this is a cost that the health care provider would have had to bear if Medtronic had not covered it.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Clinical Specialists themselves obviate the need for health care providers to require one additional staff member.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As stated by Relator Forney: \"This free staff person eliminated the need of the hospital to pay to credential a staff member, as well as eliminating the need to hire the necessary staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Turning to Relator Forney's practice management theory, Relator Forney alleges that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Medtronic created an entire structure of 'lean sigma' training that taught Ms. Forney and others how to provide free consulting services as a means to integrate their services into the health care provider's practice management tasks. Medtronic offered free assistance on reimbursement, and free consulting on all sorts of practice management topics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Relator Forney's Opp. to Medtronic's Mot. for Summ. J. Based on Public Disclosure Bar, Ex. 1 at ECF pp. 23-29 (describing the lean sigma training/approach), Doc. No. 69-3. Under the umbrella of the practice management theory, Relator Forney raised two distinct allegations of fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Medtronic trained Clinical Specialists to handle administrative tasks that the health care provider would normally handle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 11-12. For example, Relator Forney drafted a worksheet to track remote monitoring.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   She also alleges she assisted health care providers with data entry: \"Medtronic Clinical Specialists [entered] data [ ] into [ ] hospital databases maintained by St. Luke's Hospital and Lehigh Valley Hospital Muhlenberg.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations to original). Relator Forney contends that \"Medtronic [ ] directed its employees to engage in these clerical data-entry tasks as a means of providing value to the hospitals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (alteration to original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Relator Forney contends that Medtronic provided free reimbursement guidance to health care providers.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Specifically, she alleges that \"Medtronic taught health care providers how to increase profits by maximizing their revenue from government-funded health care programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, Medtronic taught health care providers how to accurately code their reimbursement requests so that the health care providers were able to recover maximum reimbursement from government-sponsored health care programs.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, Relator Forney has alleged that Medtronic engaged in a nationwide scheme to provide free services to health care providers. Relator Forney contends that these free services are illegal kickbacks under the FCA. These free services included device checks and device interrogations provided by Medtronic Representatives. To facilitate these free checks, Medtronic paid to have its representatives credentialed-a cost that the health care provider would typically have paid. And finally, Medtronic also provided free administrative assistance and reimbursement guidance to health care providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

To determine which facts are material the court looks to the substantive law. There are two relevant legal inquires: (1) did any prior public disclosures allege substantially the same fraud alleged by Relator Forney, and if so, (2) did Relator Forney provide information to the government that materially added to these prior public disclosures? The facts that bear on these inquires can be lumped into three categories: (1) what allegations and/or transactions of fraud were disclosed in the prior public disclosures; (2) what allegations and / or transactions of fraud did Relator Forney allege in her second amended complaint; and (3) what information did Relator Forney provide to the government prior to filing this lawsuit. Because the court has already described Relator Forney's allegations in detail, the court will only address the first and third categories here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the first category, Medtronic contends that five federal\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   cases qualify as valid prior public disclosures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   explained in more detail below, the court finds that two of the five potential prior public disclosures-\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   -satisfy the public disclosure standard.

These documents have been provided to the court as\n   Exhibit 17 to Relator Forney's response in opposition to Medtronic's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, Relator Forney claims that she provided documents with bates numbers 1 through 152, 258 through 429, 458 through 784, and 1072 through 2274 to the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Relator Forney's Opp. to Medtronic's Mot. for Summ.

Of the five cases identified by Medtronic, only two-\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   -satisfy the requirements of a public disclosure in section 3730(e)(4)(A).

Specifically, this section requires that \"the Government or its agent\" must have been a \"party\" in the prior case for the prior case to qualify as a public disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A)(i).

To interpret the term \"agent\" the court looks to the text of the statute. The statute states: \"in a Federal criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the Government or its agent is a party....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A)(i). The statute does not include any terms or context indicating agent should be given a meaning other than its ordinary one. The ordinary meaning of agent is \"[s]omeone who is authorized to act for or in the place of another; a representative ....\" Agent, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). An agency relationship\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   arises when one (a principal) manifests assent to another (an agent) that the agent will act on the principal's behalf, subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents\n   to do so.

The statute authorizes the relator to bring the action\n   <em>\n    for the relator\n   </em>\n   and for the United States.

This analysis fits well with the definition of agent outlined above. In the typical agency relationship, an agent is paid a fee for his or her actions on behalf of the principal. The agent would not usually have an interest in the lawsuit, and the principal would \"retain[ ] for himself any net benefit resulting from the work performed.\" Agency, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Unlike the typical agency relationship, here the government does not pay a fee to the relator, and the relator has an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit. Also, rather than the government \"retaining for [itself] any net benefit,\" the net benefit is split between the relator and the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Additionally, in the typical agency relationship the agent \"will act on the principal's behalf,\n   <em>\n    subject to the principal's control.\n   </em>\n   \" Agency, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). But here, in cases where the government declines to intervene and the relator proceeds with the action on the government's behalf, the government\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   control the relator's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (\"If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action.\").\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (\"If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action.\").

This is markedly different from the typical agent to principal relationship where the principal would be able to control the agent's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agency, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Yet, here, Congress has not provided the court with any reason to define agent in a way other than how that word is typically understood. This is strong evidence that a relator is not the government's agent for purposes of section 3730(e)(4)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   These reasons are already sufficient to find that a relator is not the government's agent for purposes of section 3730(e)(4)(A)(i). There is, however, a final additional factor that also supports this determination. In the typical agency relationship, the agent owes the principal various fiduciary duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Basile v. H &amp; R Block, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1367002\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/563/359/\">\n    563 Pa. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162649,1367018,11162539,1367002\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/761/1115/\">\n    761 A.2d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (2000) (\"An agency relationship is a fiduciary one, and the agent is subject to a duty of loyalty to act only for the principal's benefit.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ). For example, in Pennsylvania a principal can bring a lawsuit for breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the principal by its agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions, \u00a7 6.210, Breach of Fiduciary Duty-Elements of the Cause of Action (2015) (\"An agent is required to act with the utmost good faith in carrying out the interests of his or her principal.\"). Thus, if the agent does not act with the \"utmost good faith in carrying out the interests of his or her principal\" he or she is subject to a lawsuit. The court is aware of no case or law indicating that a relator is subject to a lawsuit by the United States if he or she does not pursue the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action with the \"utmost good faith.\" For these reasons, the court determines that a relator is not the government's agent for purposes of the public disclosure bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Applying this determination to the putative public disclosures identified by Medtronic, neither the government nor an agent of the government intervened in\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stokes\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Doe.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stokes\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , Medtronic's best chance of satisfying the \"Government or its agent is a party [to the action]\" requirement was convincing the court that a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   relator is an agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medtronic's Reply Br. at ECF pp. 6-7. Because the court has determined that a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   relator is not the government's agent,\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stokes\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   do not qualify as prior public disclosures. Of the five putative prior public disclosures Medtronic identifies, the government only intervened in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Unfortunately, the court's analysis on the \"government involvement\" requirement is not yet complete. Relator Forney has raised another objection. In\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   , the government only intervened in part. Because of this, Relator Forney contends that the government\n   should only be considered to be a \"party\" to the portion of the lawsuits in which the government\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   intervened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Forney's Br. at 14 (\"[T]he United States intervened in part and thus is a party to those portions of the complaints, which may be able to be viewed as qualifying public disclosures under the amended public disclosure bar.\"). This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The issue here is whether the government becomes a \"party\" to the entire case when it intervenes in part. The answer is yes: When the government intervenes in a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   FCA case, the government becomes a party to the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   case, even if it is only pursuing some of the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Cal. Apr. 20, 2016) (same). For one, section 3730(e)(4)(A)(i) does not distinguish between situations where the government intervenes on all the claims alleged in the relator's complaint and those where the government intervenes only as to certain claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biotronik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201587215\">\n    2016 WL 1587215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (highlighting this aspect of the statute in section 3730(e)(3) ). Thus, the statute appears to set up an \"all or nothing\" situation: either the government was a party in the prior case or it was not. Applying this to the situation at hand, it is difficult to conceptualize how the government could intervene in part, but not be a party to the case. It seems far more likely that the government should be considered a party to the entire action, for purposes of this provision, even if the government has only intervened as to some of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The structure of the statutory provisions governing how and when the government may intervene also support this conclusion.

In short, Relator Forney argues that because neither of these cases involved extensive public litigation (or \"hearings\"), they do not satisfy this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Relator Forney's argument on the meaning of \"civil hearing\" is unavailing. As it relates to this issue, the \"civil hearing\" language was not meaningfully changed in 2010 when Congress amended the statute as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"PPACA\").\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (pre-PPACA version-covering \"disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing ....\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (post-PPACA version-covering disclosures in a \"Federal criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the Government or its agent is a party....\"). Under the pre-PPACA language, the Third Circuit held that a complaint filed in civil litigation satisfies the \"civil hearing\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Thus, both\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   satisfy the \"civil hearing\" requirement and they both qualify as prior public disclosures under the post-PPACA public disclosure bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

This theory was disclosed in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen.\n   </em>\n   As noted above, the relator in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   alleged as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   As part of its efforts to corner the market, [Medtronic] promises both doctors and hospitals that use Medtronic's cardiac rhythm devices that it will provide all follow-up care for those patients.

Consequently, the court will later consider whether Relator Forney is an original source as to this allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Relator Forney also contends that, in order to facilitate these free \"device checks,\" Medtronic had to pay to credential its clinical specialists. According to Relator Forney, Medtronic paid all the costs associated with credentialing, including\n   background checks.

Relator Forney has disclosed two allegations of fraud under this umbrella theory: (1) Medtronic provided free reimbursement guidance; and (2) Medtronic provided free administrative assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Relator Forney's allegation that Medtronic was paying kickbacks in the form of free reimbursement counseling was publicly disclosed in both\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder.\n   </em>\n   Relator Forney contends that \"Medtronic taught health care providers to increase profits by maximizing their revenue from government-funded health care programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   , the relator argued that \"Medtronic [ ] directed sales representatives to educate physician staffs on how to bill Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers, in effect offering unpaid work from Medtronic employees to doctor's offices.\" Def.'s Mot. at Ex.

In that sense, it is always a \"unitary\" concept-regardless of whether it is part of an FCA fraud claim or a common law fraud claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here, however, \"materially\" in section\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) is not being considered as an element of a fraud claim.

As explained above, the panel was not bound to follow\n   <em>\n    Universal Health\n   </em>\n   's definition of material in the context of the original source exception. Second, the First Circuit did not provide a reason why it applied\n   <em>\n    Universal Health\n   </em>\n   to the original source exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winkelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924187\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/201/\">\n    827 F.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That lack of justification is particularly noticeable in light of the fact that the First Circuit did not have to apply\n   <em>\n    Universal Health\n   </em>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 76). The mechanics of the alleged scheme-the \"what\" and the \"how\"-was to offer a comprehensive, soup-to-nuts process of handling\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   post-implant follow-up care, billing, and paperwork for all implanted devices.

Br. at ECF pp. 11-12 (emphasis in original). Medtronic is correct that the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   were broad, sweeping, and general.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , however,-like Rule 9(b) -places an emphasis on the\n   <em>\n    details\n   </em>\n   the relator adds to the factual background possessed by the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n    812 F.3d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This rationale is easy to understand: More detailed information is usually better information than broad, sweeping, general allegations, such as the ones in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen.\n   </em>\n   It is incongruous to think that\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   -with this heavy emphasis on details-could have meant for a single sentence allegation, framed in the broadest, most general terms possible (such as the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   ), to bar a subsequent disclosure containing thousands of pages of details (such as the documents Relator Forney provided to the government in Exhibit 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   That said, not all details satisfy the standard outlined in\n   <em>\n    Moore.\n   </em>\n   To satisfy the standard, the details must significantly add to the background already possessed by the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n    at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, some details do not \"significantly add\" to the essential background information. Whether the details \"significantly add\" is a fact-intensive inquiry that involves weighing the prior public disclosures against the information relayed to the government in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Here, after reviewing the documents Relator Forney provided to the court that confirm and document Medtronic's practice of providing free device checks and interrogations, the court concludes that the information she provided to the government meaningfully adds to the prior public disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17 at 1249-417. The fact that the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   were broad and the information Relator Forney has supplied here is detailed, specific, and helpful, is further support for this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the court finds that Relator Forney is an original source as to her device check allegation of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Turning to Relator Forney's practice management theory, Relator Forney contends that she provided the government with identities of Medtronic employees who worked as lean sigma consultants, \"worksheets created for free by Medtronic,\" \"data collected to provide lean sigma services,\" and examples of consulting given to local health care providers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Forney's Suppl.

Finally, Medtronic claims that Relator Forney takes statements from the workbooks out of context.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF pp. 26-29. Medtronic claims that when viewed in their proper context these statements have little, if anything, to do with Relator Forney's alleged fraudulent scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   These arguments are ultimately unavailing. On the first argument, Medtronic states that there is \"[n]othing in the materials that Relator provided to the Government indicat[ing] that these documents [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the value-based workbooks] were in use at any point after March 2010, which is as far back as the conduct at issue in this case extends.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF p. 24 (alterations to original). But there is also nothing to indicate that they were not in use after March 2010. Moreover, even if Medtronic stopped using them before March 2010, they still provide details on the nature of its selling plan prior to 2010. Relator Forney's description of Medtronic's plan during the time period at issue here matches the service-based plan described in those workbooks.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 9 (\"Medtronic intentionally focused on services that would lower the practice costs incurred by hospitals and health care providers. Indeed, Medtronic trained all its Clinical Specialists to engage in discussions about practice overhead with health care providers.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17 at 1966 (outlining a similar approach). Thus, those workbooks are-at the very least-corroborating evidence that add details to the factual background possessed by the government based on the prior public disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   On the second argument, Medtronic believes that the information in these materials is harmless,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it is not evidence of a fraudulent scheme. Medtronic's Suppl. Br. at ECF pp. 25-26. In other words, Medtronic essentially repeats its argument from its motion(s) to dismiss that Relator Forney's allegations of fraud are not actionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Medtronic, Inc.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Its Mot. to Dismiss at ECF p. 8, Doc. No. 30-1. Unfortunately, courts in this circuit do not address whether\n   the alleged fraud is actionable in a motion based on the public disclosure bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n    812 F.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"At issue on appeal is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether Moore has alleged an actionable fraud.\" (emphasis in original) ). Consequently, this argument has minimal legal significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Medtronic's arguments are nonetheless understandable. Part of what gives Medtronic's motion (and subsequent briefing) force-and what makes the decision on this issue difficult-is that the actions Relator Forney alleges were fraudulent appear somewhat benign. As the court noted when it ruled on Medtronic's second motion to dismiss, \"the court is concerned that the relator's theory of support services amounting to illegal remuneration will not ultimately prove to be viable.\" Aug. 14, 2017 Order, Doc. No. 52. But whether the alleged fraud is actionable is not an appropriate consideration with respect to this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, in its third argument Medtronic contends that Relator Forney has taken statements from the workbook out of context. For example, she alleges that the workbooks told employees to \"tell health care providers about the disadvantages of focusing on price when making decisions about medical devices.\" Forney's Suppl. Br. at 14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Medtronic disagrees with Relator Forney's characterization and contends that the real point of this exercise was to teach Medtronic Representatives that they should not focus solely on price when marketing products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medtronic's Suppl. Br. at ECF p. 28. \"Rather, Medtronic representatives are to use their expertise to recommend the right device for the right situation, which will save customers money over the long term.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Medtronic is partly correct. This exercise in the workbook stresses choosing the right device for the right situation, but it also stresses that Medtronic staff should be telling customers about how \"less expensive products have fewer people to support them.\" Ex. 17 at 1966. And that the customer may \"be unable to get the support it needs from a [different] supplier.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A reasonable implication from this discussion is that Medtronic Representatives should stress how Medtronic will provide free services to the health care provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In short, the workbooks do not appear to be a smoking gun, but they do show that Medtronic had an extensive training plan in place that taught their sales force to emphasize non-price criteria when selling Medtronic products. In this sense then, the workbooks add to the factual background of the fraud by showing the \"how\" of this plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Next, Relator Forney contends she disclosed information on how \"Medtronic provided advice on coding.\" Forney's Suppl. Br. at 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17 at 1-110, 111-133, 270-328, 329-51, 352-406, 1161-235. The court has reviewed these documents and concludes that they provide significant details on how Medtronic implemented this scheme. These documents describe coding procedures Medtronic gave to physicians and hospitals. Most of them are training documents which were ostensibly shown to Medtronic Representatives, and/or hospitals and physicians.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 17 at 1-110. These presentations not only show how Medtronic gave advice, they show \"what\" advice Medtronic gave because they contain the exact coding advice Medtronic Representatives were providing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p300\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Considering the totality of the evidence that Relator Forney has provided regarding her reimbursement guidance and administrative work allegations of fraud, the court is satisfied that she qualifies as an original source. Relator Forney's vast supply of names, places, times, and strategies significantly add to the essential factual\n   background possessed by the government from\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In sum, Medtronic identified two valid prior public disclosures:\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   disclosed substantially the same allegations of fraud that Relator Forney is pursuing here (with the exception of her allegation that Medtronic's credentialing payments constitutes a kickback). Notwithstanding the existence of these public disclosures and their substantial similarity to Relator Forney's allegations, she provided the government with extensive details of Medtronic's alleged fraudulent scheme. These extensive details significantly added to the essential factual background possessed by the government from\n   <em>\n    Onwezen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schroeder.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, she is an original source as to her barred allegations of fraud and these claims survive dismissal under the public disclosure bar. The court will deny the motion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The court will enter a separate order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Relator Forney appears to argue in her opposition brief that these should be considered a single allegation of fraud,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that the entire lean sigma program was a fraudulent kickback.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Forney's Br. at 19. This argument is unsupported by the allegations in the second amended complaint. In the second amended complaint, Relator Forney alleged that each distinct service was an illegal kickback.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Second Am. Compl. at 18 (\"Medtronic continues to provide kickbacks in the form of free surgical support, post-implant device interrogation and analysis, and consulting services, reimbursement services, and various other services of value to healthcare providers, such as data entry and practice management worksheets and the like.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    In 2010, Congress amended the FCA's public disclosure bar.
