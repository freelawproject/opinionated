Relators' Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This is a False Claims Act case brought by three\n   <em>\n    qui\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tam\n   </em>\n   relators. They allege that defendant, a medical supply provider to beneficiaries of California's Medicaid Program (\"Medi-Cal\"), perpetrated a phony invoicing scheme to evade Medi-Cal's \"Upper Billing Limit\" (\"UBL\") regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The regulation limits claims for reimbursement for an item to a 100% markup of supplier's \"net purchase price,\" defined as the item's \"actual cost to the provider ... including any rebates ... known by the provider at the time of billing ... that reduces the item's invoice amount.\" Docket # 121 \u00b6 38-39. In circumvention of this rule, Shield allegedly arranged to pay very high invoice prices to one of its medical supply manufacturers, Coloplast Corp., while also arranging for steep and essentially guaranteed \"back-end\" volume-based rebates on these sales. When calculating a product's \"net purchase price\" and billing Medi-Cal, Shield did not disclose the rebates; it used only the inflated invoice prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Relators' operative complaint covers three Shield/Coloplast supplier agreements: the first was effective June 1, 2008 to September 30, 2010; the second, which relators Herman and Roseff helped negotiate, covered the period from October 1, 2010 through February 15, 2014; and the third, the period from February 16, 2014 through February 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 121 \u00b6\u00b6 157, 158, 163, 167.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relators' original complaint was filed under seal on December 2, 2011. On August 21, 2014, the case was unsealed. Since that time, relators have filed three amended complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket ## 21 (November 20, 2014); 40 (June 1, 2015); 121 (May 20, 2016). The United States and California declined to intervene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 55. On February 5, 2016, Shield moved to dismiss the relators' claims as prohibited under the FCA's first-to-file bar. The government opposed, Docket # 84, and the court therefore denied the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Donath v. Whitestone Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. SACV 07-0995 (C.D. Cal. 2007). In that case,\n   <em>\n    qui\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tam\n   </em>\n   relator Terry Donath on August 23, 2007 filed a complaint alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , that Shield violated the FCA by submitting false claims to Medi-Cal. The\n   <em>\n    modus\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    operandi\n   </em>\n   of that scheme was, in relevant part, identical to the one alleged by relators in this case,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that Shield evaded the Medi-Cal UBL regulation by submitting reimbursement claims that omitted large off-invoice volume rebates from the net purchase price of products it supplied to patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Donath worked for Whitestone Corporation, a medical supply manufacturer, from December 1994 to February 2007. He handled Whitestone's account with Shield from the time he started until December 2000, and his original complaint concerned Shield's dealings with Whitestone and false claims \"starting in or around March 2003 to the present,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   August 2007. Docket # 90-2 at 143, 150. On April 19, 2010, Donath filed an amended complaint which included allegations that, in addition to its arrangement with Whitestone, \"Shield also entered into sham volume rebate agreements with ... most or all of its other suppliers\" including Coloplast. Docket # 302-4 \u00b6 148. It further alleged that Shield's invoice scheme \"continues ... to this day,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   April 19, 2010.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    \u00b6 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shield settled the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation with the United States, California, and the relator in November 2011. Docket # 121-1 at 165. The government entities had intervened in the action in conjunction with the settlement, which pertained to certain \"Covered Conduct\": \"Shield's overbilling the Medi-Cal program by ... violat[ing] the [UBL regulation] during the period from March 2, 2003 to June 30, 2009.\" Shield paid five million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

To that end, the FCA contains several restrictions on the actions a relator may pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The restriction at issue in this case, the government action bar, prohibits any suit \"based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3). Defendant contends that plaintiffs' suit is prohibited under this bar because of the United States' and California's involvement in the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation. To prevail on its motion, Shield must therefore show both that (i) plaintiffs' case is \"based upon\" the same \"allegations or transactions\" involved in\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   (a civil suit); and (ii) the government \"is already a party\" to that now-concluded case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Docket # 302-1 at 12. Relators respond that they \"are not parasites of the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation, even though they readily concede that they mirrored the allegations from the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   complaint in drafting their UBL claims against Shield.\" Docket # 315 at 6. They argue that their case \"does not merely allege different time periods\" from\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   but instead goes further, alleging that \"Shield executed an affirmative settlement of the fraudulent conduct at issue in\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   (covering the period of 2003-2009) and then continued to commit the very same fraudulent scheme ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Prawer\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit analyzed the government action bar and recognized that \"the breadth with which we should read the phrase 'allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit' is not readily apparent from the text of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Prawer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10505922\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/320/#p326\">\n    24 F.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applying these principles, I am persuaded that relators' action is not based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

First and foremost, the present case is not receiving meaningful \"support advantage, or the like\" from the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation. While relators freely admit that\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   involved fraud by the same\n   <em>\n    modus\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    operandi\n   </em>\n   as alleged in this case,\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   primarily concerned Shield's arrangements with Whitestone during the 2003 to 2010 time period. By contrast, this case focuses on Shield's dealings with a different manufacturer (Coloplast) and a largely different period (2010-2016). These disparities are significant and distinguishing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Booker v.

But these general statements do not lead to an inevitable conclusion that relators' case is meaningfully supported by the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation. The crux of relators' case here is that, subsequent to the November 2011\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   settlement, \"Shield has continued to defraud Medi-Cal\" with a different supplier.

There, a prior suit had alleged the defendant \"improperly influenced\" doctors to purchase its products and bill Medicare. The new suit, plaintiff contended, went further by identifying a specific product (called \"INFUSE\") and a specific means of improper influence (falsely telling doctors that off-label use of the product was eligible for Medicare reimbursement). The First Circuit held this was insufficient to avoid the public disclosure bar because the alleged difference was \"just a slightly more detailed version of a prior allegation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778740\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/619/104/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the details \"undoubtedly add[ed] some color,\" the public disclosure bar was nevertheless implicated because \"the allegation ultimately target[ed] the same fraudulent scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778740\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/619/104/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Poteet\n   </em>\n   , relators here do far more than add color to the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   case's allegations or transactions.

While Donath's vague allegations as to Coloplast might have put the government on\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of potential fraud, notice is not the touchstone of the government action bar (or any other FCA prohibition against parasitic claims).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prawer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10505922\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/320/#p326\">\n    24 F.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress has explicitly deemed a \"notice\" regime insufficient to protect the government against false claims (indeed, it was precisely such a regime that Congress sought to abandon in enacting the 1986 amendments ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, I note that the government itself does not view this case as parasitic of the\n   <em>\n    Donath\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 84 (United States objecting to dismissal of action under 3730(e)(4)(A) and stating that provision allows government \"to inform the court that it does not view a particular\n   <em>\n    qui\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tam\n   </em>\n   action as parasitic\"). While the government action bar does not provide the government with veto power over a defendant's motion as is effectively the case in the public disclosure bar context, the United States' perception is nevertheless instructive here because it goes directly to the question of \"useful or proper return to the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berntsen v.

Shield has not shown this case should be dismissed under the government action bar.
