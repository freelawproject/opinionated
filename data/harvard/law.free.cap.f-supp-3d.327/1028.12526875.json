LUDINGTON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On February 15, 2017, Plaintiff Tuscola Wind III, LLC, (\"Tuscola\") filed a complaint naming the Almer Charter Township and that Township's Board of Trustees as Defendants. ECF No. 1. Count One of the Complaint is the \"Claim of Appeal.\" Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 100-124. Tuscola Wind's claims arise out of Defendants' denial of a Special Land Use Permit (\"SLUP\") that would have permitted Tuscola Wind to construct the \"Tuscola III Wind Energy Center\" in Tuscola County, Michigan. Compl. at 6. Oral argument on the claim of appeal was held on October 5, 2017. Approximately one month later, the Court issued an opinion and order affirming the Almer Charter Township's denial of the SLUP application. ECF No. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 26, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining counts of the complaint. ECF No. 55. Specifically, Defendants argue that no violation of procedural due process rights occurred, that no equal protection violation occurred, that Tuscola's Zoning Enabling Act claim is meritless, and that Tuscola's Opening Meetings Act claim should be dismissed. On April 24, 2018, Defendants filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence regarding noise emissions from Caro Motorsports from admission at trial. ECF No. 64. For the following reasons, the motion for summary judgment will be granted in part, the motion in limine will be denied as moot, and Counts Two, Three, and Four will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Count Five will be dismissed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the Court's November 3, 2017, opinion and order, the Court summarized, at length, the procedural and factual history of Tuscola's SLUP application and the Township's consideration of the same. Because those facts bear considerable relevance to the presently disputed issues, large portions of that factual summary will be reproduced here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Tuscola Wind III, LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company, which is indirectly wholly owned by NextEra Energy Resources, LLC. Tuscola Wind SLUP App. at 1, ECF No. 30, Ex. B. Tuscola is attempting to build the \"Tuscola III Wind Energy Center\" in Tuscola County, Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The project, if completed, would include 55 wind turbines in Fairgrove, Almer, and Ellington Townships, and would produce enough energy to supply 50,000 homes with wind energy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In its SLUP application, Tuscola explained that \"[t]he Project facilities are to occupy 15.2 acres of land, and will be serviced by 6.6 miles of access roads, occupying 12.9 acres of land.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Prior to submitting the SLUP application, Tuscola had entered into agreements with 87 landowners (representing 192 parcels of land) for the use of their property for the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Those individuals are described as \"participating landowners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, at the time the SLUP application was submitted, Tuscola had already identified the ideal number of and locations for wind turbines in Almer Township, categorized parcels of land as necessary or unneeded, and secured access to the parcels it believed were required for the proposed project. The present dispute centers on Tuscola's attempt to secure SLUP approval for the 19 wind turbines that Tuscola wishes to build in Almer Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Tuscola has provided an example of one of the \"Short Form Option Agreements\" which it entered into with local landowners in Tuscola Township.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opt. Agreement, ECF No. 62, Ex. 1A. In the Agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the landowner grants Tuscola \"an option to purchase\" certain \"easements in connection with the development, construction, and operation of a wind energy project in Tuscola County, Michigan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. \"The period during which the Option may be exercised shall begin on the date when both Owner and Operator have executed the Agreement, and shall continue for a period of thirty-six (36) months after such date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If and when Tuscola exercises the option (known as the \"Commencement Date\"), Tuscola's rights to the easements vest and continue until thirty-five \"years after the date when the wind power project has achieved the status of a commercially operable wind-powered electrical generation and transmission facility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The easements automatically renew for a subsequent thirty year term unless Tuscola opts out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Almer Township Zoning Ordinance characterizes wind energy systems as special land uses. As such, Tuscola was required to seek a Special Land Use Permit (\"SLUP\") from the Township for the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Almer Zoning Ord. Art. 24, ECF No. 30, Ex. A. Pursuant to Section 2401 of the Zoning Ordinance, the first step in\n   receiving approval for a wind energy system is to submit a SLUP application to the Township's Planning Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2401. Upon receipt of the application, the Planning Commission is required to hold a public hearing within 45 days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the public hearing, the Planning Commission recommends either granting or denying the application to the Township Board and must state its reasons for the decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once the Planning Commission issues its recommendation, the Township Board will render a decision on the SLUP application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section 1522 of the Almer Township Zoning Ordinance provides special requirements for SLUP applications involving a wind energy system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522. Among other things, the applicant must provide an escrow account to cover the Township's costs and expenses associated with the SLUP zoning review and approval process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522(C)(1). Likewise, the applicant must fund and submit environmental and economic impact studies (if requested by the Township).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522(C)(2)-(3). The application must include a site plan which specifies the design characteristics of the turbines, safety features, security measures, and a lighting plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522(C)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Similarly, \"[a]ll efforts shall be made not to affect any resident with any strobe effect or shadow flicker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522(C)(20). The Zoning Ordinance provides the general admonishment that \"[t]he wind energy conversion system shall not be unreasonably injurious to the public health and safety or to the health and safety of occupants of nearby properties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522(C)(7). The zoning ordinance likewise directs that \"[n]oise emissions from the operations of a [Wind Energy Conversion System] shall not exceed forty-five (45) decibels on the DBA scale as measured at the nearest property line of a non-participating property owner or road.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1522(C)(14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 23, 2016, Tuscola submitted its SLUP application to the Almer Township Planning Commission. To assist in its consideration of the application, the Township retained the Spicer Group, Inc., an engineering consulting firm. On October 25, 2016, the Spicer Group sent Tuscola an email requesting clarification and/or additional information regarding several aspects of the application. Spicer Oct. 25 Email, ECF No. 30, Ex. C. The Spicer Group challenged several aspects of the sound emissions report submitted by Tuscola, asked when Tuscola would be submitting an economic impact study, and indicated that Tuscola's proposal to place the power lines above the ground did not conform with the Zoning Ordinance requirement that all electrical connection systems and lines from a wind farm be placed underground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In its response, Tuscola defended its SLUP application, asserting that it had complied with all requirements requested by the Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 8, 2016, the Spicer Group submitted a report to the Planning Commission analyzing Tuscola's SLUP application. Spicer Rep., ECF No. 30, Ex. F. In the report, the Spicer Group concluded that Tuscola had complied with many, indeed most, of the Zoning Ordinance's requirements. But the Spicer Group did identify a number of outstanding issues. Among other recommendations, the Spicer Group suggested that the Planning Commission should require Tuscola to commission or identify an economic impact study for the proposed Almer Township project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The Spicer Group also noted that Tuscola had not provided information confirming that the proposed turbines had a braking device which complied with the\n   Zoning Ordinance. The Spicer Group explained that Tuscola was seeking an exception to certain Zoning Ordinance requirements: first, instead of building an 8-foot fence around the turbines, Tuscola was requesting leave to keep the structures locked at all times; and, second, Tuscola was seeking leave to build aboveground transmission lines. Finally, the Spicer Group indicated that Tuscola's noise emissions report left several questions unanswered, including whether the 45 dBA limit was measured to the closest road, or simply to the closest road adjacent to a non-participating property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 10, 2016, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to discuss the SLUP application. Nov. 10, 2016, Hearing Tr., ECF No. 30, Ex. I. At the hearing, a representative from Tuscola discussed the project. Among other things, the Tuscola representative explained why he believed that 45 dBA 1-hour L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   was the appropriate metric to use in determining the sound emissions produced by the turbines.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-35. First, the representative explained that the 1-hour L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   metric is used by certain international standards and is the metric used by the manufacturer to model probable sound emissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. The representative also explained that the 1-hour L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   metric is more practical because L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   is used in many noise emission standards, regulations, and guidelines (including neighboring townships). More importantly, the 1-hour L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   metric is not \"susceptible to wind gusts or other extraneous non-wind turbine events,\" unlike the L\n   <sub>\n    max\n   </sub>\n   metric.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the rest of the hearing, members of the community expressed their opinions on the proposals. Most speakers communicated objections to various aspects of the application (if not the project as a whole), but some expressed support for the wind energy project. Two sound engineers testified at the hearing. The first engineer, Rick James, is an employee of e-Coustic Solutions and was hired by concerned citizens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107. First, Mr. James opined that Tuscola's noise emissions report likely understated the dBA level at several property lines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108-09. Second, Mr. James challenged Tuscola's assertion that the noise emissions provision in the Zoning Ordinance allowed for an averaged sound level measurement, as opposed to a maximum level: \"[T]he words are very explicit, they say, 'Shall not exceed 45 dBA.' When you read law you can't read into it when the words aren't there. It doesn't say 45 dBA Leq, it does not say 45 dBA average, it says not exceed 45 dBA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109. Ms. Kerrie Standlee, the principal engineer for Acoustics by Design, also testified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130. Ms. Standlee concurred with Mr. James's interpretation of the ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [T]he limit is stated in there that the level shall not exceed 45 dBA. It doesn't give any descriptor, is it supposed to be the Lmax or-and as was mentioned, an L90 or an L10 at 50, an Leq, it doesn't specify. Mr. James is correct in that when something is not specified, you take the normal interpretation, which would be Lmax. I'm with-I'm on the City of Portland Noise Review Board and we have an Lmax standard. It's not specified as the Lmax it's just-like yours it says it shall not exceed this level. And that is an absolute level, not-not an equivalent energy level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ultimately, the Planning Commission concluded that additional information was necessary before the SLUP application could be ruled upon. Accordingly, the public hearing was adjourned. After the hearing, Tuscola sent a number of responses to the Planning Commission which addressed the issues and concerns identified by the Spicer Group and the Planning Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 8, 2016, four new Board members were elected. According to Tuscola, all four new members were \"part of the anti-wind Ellington-Almer Concerned Citizens Group.\" Pl. App. Br. at 6, ECF No. 31. The new Board members took office on November 20, 2016, and held a special meeting on November 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At that special meeting, the Almer Township Board voted to retain Mr. Homier of Foster Swift. Compl. at 23. Tuscola has attached an invoice submitted by Mr. Homier in December 2016 which indicates that he had been discussing Tuscola's SLUP application with one of the new Board members days before they were elected, and that he had drafted moratorium on wind energy SLUP applications on November 18, 2016, after the four new Board members were elected, but before they took office. Foster Swift Invoice, ECF No. 62, Ex. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The new Board approved the \"Wind Energy Conversion Systems Moratorium Ordinance\" at the November 22, 2016, special meeting. Moratorium, ECF No. 30, Ex. M.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Nov. 22, 2016, Meeting Minutes, ECF No. 30, Ex. N. In the moratorium, the Board indicated that applications for \"Wind Energy Conversion Systems may be proliferating\" and so \"[t]he Township Board requires sufficient time for enactment of amendments to its Zoning Ordinance to establish reasonable regulations pertaining to the establishment, placement, construction, enlargement, and/or erection of Wind Energy Conversion System.\" Moratorium at 2. Thus, the Board enacted a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   moratorium, on a temporary basis, on the establishment, placement, construction, enlargement, and/or erection of Wind Energy Conversion Systems within the Township and on the issuance of any and all permits, licenses or approvals for any property subject to the Township's Zoning Ordinance for the establishment or use of Wind Energy Conversion Systems....[T]his Ordinance shall apply to any applications pending before any Township board or commission, including the Township Board, Planning Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 7, 2016, the Planning Commission held a second public hearing. Dec. 7, 2016, Tr., ECF No. 30, Ex. Q. A Tuscola representative opened the hearing by addressing the concerns previously raised by the community and the Planning Commission. In large part, the Tuscola representative summarized the company's November 15, 2016, submission to the Planning Commission. A representative of the Spicer Group was also present. After Tuscola's presentation, members of the Planning Commission began asking questions of both the Tuscola representatives and the Spicer Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The questioning at the second public hearing primarily focused on the ongoing dispute over the proper metric by which to measure wind turbine noise emissions and the adequacy of the economic impact studies provided by Tuscola. Several commissioners were concerned that the economic impact information provided by Tuscola did not include local studies. In response, Tuscola indicated that any study of only Almer Township would be statistically suspect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. There was also discussion regarding whether the zoning ordinance directed that L\n   <sub>\n    max\n   </sub>\n   or L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   be used to measure noise emissions and which of those metrics was best suited to measuring wind turbine noise emissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Eventually, the hearing drew to a close. Members of the Planning Commission deliberated over whether they needed more\n   information from Tuscola regarding the sounds emissions or whether they were prepared to make a determination regarding the proper interpretation of the ordinance. Ultimately, Chairman Braem moved to table consideration of the SLUP application and request further information from Tuscola.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. The Planning Commission discussed the outstanding issues, and then approved the motion to adjourn. The Township's attorney summarized the requested information as follows: \"[Y]ou want to request information from NextEra on property values, noise, sound models based on Lmax and if there is the justification you just referenced regarding the cost estimate on the decommissioning of the individual towers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After the second public hearing, Tuscola, the Spicer Group, and the Planning Commission engaged in correspondence regarding the issues identified at the hearing. Again, discussion focused primarily on the sound emissions metric issue and the economic impact issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On January 4, 2017, the Planning Commission held its third and final public hearing on the SLUP application. Jan. 4, 2017, Hearing Tr., ECF No. 30, Ex. X. At the hearing, Tuscola summarized the documents it had submitted since the last hearing. As before, the discussion centered on the noise emissions issue. Tuscola argued that the zoning ordinance was ambiguous as the metric for measuring sound emissions and asserted that the L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   metric should be adopted. Members of the Planning Commission disagreed, arguing that the zoning ordinance's \"shall not exceed\" language necessarily meant that it imposed an L\n   <sub>\n    max\n   </sub>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After addressing other disputed issues, including whether Tuscola was required to provide Almer Township-specific property value studies, Planning Commission member Daniels moved to recommend denial of the SLUP application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. The Commissioners then discussed their opinions on the application. Chairman Braem asked Commissioner Tussey whether the ordinance should be interpreted as imposing an L\n   <sub>\n    max\n   </sub>\n   standard since neighboring townships had interpreted similar language as creating an L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   standard. Tussey replied: \"I'm not struggling with Lmax because 45dB(A) is a valid metric....And the fact that the ordinance says not to exceed-and I believe even from a legal standpoint we're always to interpret the simplest definition in English. And that our job here isn't to interpret what they meant; it is to enforce what is written.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46. Commissioner Daniels also articulated his rationale for recommending denial of the SLUP application. He asserted that \"[t]he ordinance does not allow for the averaging varying levels of sound. We, as a Planning Commission, are not here to rewrite the ordinance, but to enforce the ordinance as written. And it mandates a maximum sound level of 45 decibels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. Commissioner Daniels also opined that Tuscola had not procured adequate insurance coverage for the turbines and had not made sufficient efforts to minimize shadow flicker for Almer Township residents. Chairman Braem then briefly explained that he was satisfied with the insurance coverage, the economic impact study, and efforts to reduce shadow flicker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ultimately, the Planning Commission voted 3 to 1 to recommend denial of the SLUP application (two members did not vote because of a conflict of interest).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On January 17, 2017, the Almer Township Board held a public meeting to review the Planning Commission's recommendation\n   regarding the SLUP application. Jan. 17, 2017, Tr., ECF No. 30, Ex. DD. After opening the floor to public comments (including comments by a Tuscola representative), the Board discussed the Planning Commission's recommendation to deny the SLUP application. Every Board member to discuss the recommendation on the record was supportive of the Planning Commission's rationale for denial. And most Board members appeared to focus on the noise emissions issue. For example, Board Member Rosenstangel stated that the Planning Commission's recommendation was \"very well put together. And my concern was the 45 decibels shall not exceed. And I think that's what we should stick with is it shall not exceed the 45 decibels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Board Member Graff made a similar statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   I also agree with the shall not exceed. I look at this not any different than a speed limit. If you're going 55 miles an hour, 55 miles an hour is the speed limit that you're supposed to have, you can't average it out. You can't drive from Saginaw to Cass City and go 75 miles an hour, but you have to slow down for all the little towns in between. When the police officer stops you outside of Cass City, you don't say, well, you have to relook at it because, if you average it out, I was only going 55 miles an hour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Likewise, Board Member Tussey (who is the Board's Planning Commission representative) reiterated his reasons for opposing the SLUP application. Ultimately, the Almer Township Board voted 5 to 1 to deny the SLUP application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Board simultaneously issued a Resolution articulating its rationale for denying the SLUP application. Res. Deny. SLUP, ECF No. 30, Ex. FF. In the Resolution, the Board identified five areas in which the SLUP application did not comply with the Zoning Ordinance. First, the Board faulted Tuscola for not providing an adequate economic impact study. Despite being asked to \"provide a property values analysis that was localized to Almer Township,\" Tuscola \"provided property value analyses based on other states, as well as some information concerning\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   property values in Michigan, but still provided no\n   <em>\n    real property\n   </em>\n   value analyses using Michigan data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the Board found that the SLUP application did not comply with the Zoning Ordinance's limit on noise emissions. The Board explained that the ordinance's \"limitation on noise emissions...is clear and unambiguous and requires no further qualifying metric or analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. In response to Tuscola's argument that an L\n   <sub>\n    EQ\n   </sub>\n   standard should be utilized, the Board found that \"using an Leq standard is inconsistent with the plain and unambiguous language of the Zoning Ordinance, which clearly provides that noise from a WECS 'shall not exceed fortyfive (45) decibels.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Board further referenced the opinion of \"acoustician Kerrie G.

The Board acknowledged that Tuscola sought a variance from that requirement from the Planning Commission, but noted that the variance was not approved. And the Board concurred with that decision: \"The Township Board also does not approve this alternative, as the Township Board finds that the proposed alternative of having no fence will not adequately protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Fourth, the Board faulted Tuscola for not providing the turbine safety manual and thus confirming that the turbines are equipped with an adequate braking device: \"The Applicant has withheld documentation...that would identify the braking device's capability, citing the Applicant's nondisclosure agreement with GE.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Fifth, the Board found that Tuscola had not complied with the ordinance's requirement that the electrical lines stemming from the turbines be placed underground. Again, the Board concurred with the Planning Commission's refusal to waive that requirement: \"The Township Board...does not grant the requested waiver because it finds that the proposed aboveground lines would be detrimental to the aesthetics of the Township and will not protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the Board noted that it had previously approved a moratorium on wind energy projects in the Township and thus was precluded from approving the SLUP application even if it had complied with the Zoning Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On January 9, 2017, several days after the Planning Commission recommended denial of the SLUP application, Tuscola requested an interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance's 45 dBA limit by the Zoning Board of Appeals (\"ZBA\"). ZBA Interp. App., ECF No. 30, EX. Z. In the application, Tuscola asked the ZBA to provide expedited review: \"Under Section 2401 of the Ordinance, the Township Board must make a decision on Tuscola Wind III's application within 30 days of the Planning Commission's recommendation; in other words, by February 3, 2017.

In Count Three, Tuscola argues that the Board's denial of its SLUP application violated Tuscola's equal protection rights because the Board treated Tuscola's SLUP application differently than it has treated SLUP applications for other kinds of land uses. In Count Four, Tuscola argues that the moratorium was enacted in violation of the Zoning Enabling Act, M.C.L. \u00a7 125.3202(1), because it was passed by resolution and not via the legislative procedures set forth in the ZEA.

The contractual option agreements which Tuscola cites fall far short of establishing a property interest\n   <em>\n    in the special land-use permit\n   </em>\n   Tuscola seeks. Rather, the plain language of those contracts makes clear that the property rights vest only when Tuscola exercises the option, which will occur only if Tuscola obtains the permit. In other words, the option agreements are entirely derivative of Tuscola's attempts to obtain a special land use permit. Michigan law requires that \"a building permit and some substantial construction must have commenced before property rights can vest,\" but neither occurred here.\n   <em>\n    Seguin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516426\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/584/#p591\">\n    968 F.2d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The option agreements might constitute a contingent property interest, but Tuscola has simply not identified any way in which the Township's discretionary decision to deny the SLUP application deprived it of the property rights specifically created by those agreements. Indeed, it appears that those option agreements still exist and will remain pending until Tuscola obtains a special land use permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   And to the extent Tuscola believes it has a property interest in the \"Township's determination of TWIII's land use rights,\" Pl.

It is always possible for persons aggrieved by government action to allege, and almost always possible to produce evidence, that they were treated differently from others, with regard to everything from zoning to licensing to speeding to tax evaluation. It would become the task of federal courts and juries, then, to inquire into the grounds for differential\n   treatment and to decide whether those grounds were sufficiently reasonable to satisfy equal protection review. This would constitute the federal courts as general-purpose second-guessers of the reasonableness of broad areas of state and local decisionmaking: a role that is both ill-suited to the federal courts and offensive to state and local autonomy in our federal system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

The same is true of SLUP applications generally. The Almer Zoning Ordinance introduces its provisions on special land uses by explaining that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   such special uses are not permitted to be engaged in within the particular zone in which they are listed unless and until the Township Board\n   <em>\n    in its absolute discretion\n   </em>\n   , is satisfied that the following minimal standards are met in addition to those specified for a particular special use:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   1.

As explained above, Tuscola takes issue with the Township's requirement that it submit an economic impact study, pursuant to \u00a7 1522(C)(3) of the zoning ordinance. That requirement is triggered only at the Township's request, and thus is a manifestly discretionary requirement. Similarly, \u00a7 2400 of the zoning ordinance vests the Township Board with \"absolute discretion\" to require a SLUP applicant to demonstrate that the special use will not \"substantially diminish and impair property values within its neighborhood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In other words, the Township is vested with complete discretion regarding whether to require applicants to provide information regarding the economic impact of a special land use. Tuscola argues that \"the only special land use that requires the applicant to provide an economic impact study is a [wind energy conversion system].\" Pl. Resp. Br. at 13. Perhaps that is true in practice, despite the fact that the zoning ordinance vests the Township with authority to ask for such a study for any special land use application. But Tuscola identifies only two examples of previous SLUP petitions in the Township which were approved without the Township requiring a property value or economic impact study: two applications for leave to build a cell tower.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213473\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/1199/#p1210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Three data points are insufficient to establish a statistically significant trend, much less the kind of \"clear standard\" the Supreme Court relied upon in\n   <em>\n    Olech\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The significant discretion entrusted to the Township and the extremely limited number of specifically identified comparable data points highlights the unsuitability of the class-of-one theory in this situation.

The Court is unpersuaded that the Supreme Court intended to raise disputes over the reasonableness of inherently discretionary zoning decisions to constitutional significance.

The first and most obvious difference is the number of large structures to be built. A single cell tower will impact only a small part of the Township, while nineteen wind turbines will have a much larger footprint. Another relevant difference between wind turbines and cell towers is the fact that wind turbines include large moving parts, while cell towers do not. In considering the SLUP application, the Township required extensive documentation regarding \"shadow flicker,\" which is a potential negative only for wind turbines. The Township also expressed concern regarding the potential danger to birds which giant spinning blades might pose. Relatedly, wind turbines produce consistent sound (a fact that produced the primary dispute during the SLUP review process). Tuscola has provided no evidence that cell towers do the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of these differences would be a relevant factor in considering the probable economic impact of a wind energy conversion system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, even setting aside the differences between SLUP applications to construct cell towers and SLUP applications to construct wind turbines, Tuscola has not provided any information regarding when those SLUP applications were approved. Given the election of new board members which precipitated the SLUP denial in this case, it is likely that the cell tower SLUP applications were approved by a different Board.

Tuscola recounts two instances where members of the anti-wind group insulted or threatened members of the public and Tuscola employees during public hearings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. But the identified speakers are not Township officials, and any animus which a public citizen might have against Tuscola is simply irrelevant to this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Tuscola also relies upon several statements by Township Board members. For example, they cite to an email where Board Member Tussey asserted that the $3.1 million which the Township would receive over the life of the proposed wind development project \"[h]ardly makes up for ruining many homes and taking away future economic benefits because no one and no business wants to be next to a turbine or future turbine.\" Oct. 11, 2016, Email, ECF No. 62, Ex. 9. Tuscola also relies upon a Facebook post by Board Member Art Graff where he accused \"the turbine companies\" of withholding information about wind energy and stated that \"[i]f one stands by and watch a crime being committed and does NOTHING about it they are as guilty as the person committing the crime.\" Facebook Post, ECF No. 62, Ex. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   These examples merely demonstrate that members of the Township Board are ideologically opposed to wind energy. That idea is unremarkable. Tuscola itself has repeatedly argued that numerous members of the Board ran for election in 2016 for the express purpose of preventing any wind energy development in the Township. That idea is buttressed by the allegation that those Board Members are associated with an interstate coalition which opposes wind energy. But vehement and heated disputes over the efficacy and wisdom of certain policies are an expected, natural part of the democratic process. Members of the Township Planning Commission and Board have a professional obligation to not only ensure that the requirements of the zoning ordinance are complied with, but to use their best judgment and discretion to protect the Township from harmful developments. Tuscola and the Township disagree over whether the proposed wind energy development would be harmful, but a disagreement over policy is not reflective of unconstitutional animus. Indeed, none of the evidence relied upon by the Township supports the idea that any Township official has animus towards Tuscola which is unrelated to the proposed SLUP application. All of the conflict between the Township and Tuscola can be traced to Tuscola's\n   desire to build a wind energy development and the Township Board's opposition to wind energy.

In Count Four, Tuscola alleges that the Township violated the Zoning Enabling Act when it enacted a moratorium on consideration of all SLUP applications regarding wind energy projects. In its appeal from the Township Board's denial of the SLUP application, Tuscola also challenged the validity of the moratorium. The Court refused to consider the validity of the moratorium:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Although the moratorium on wind energy projects was enacted after Tuscola's SLUP application was submitted (but before it was rejected), the Planning Commission and Township Board proceeded to consider the SLUP application on its merits. At most, the Township Board relied upon the moratorium as an alternative (and secondary) basis for denying the SLUP application. Because the Board's denial of the application was supported by substantial evidence and was not contrary to law, the legitimacy of the moratorium need not be resolved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Nov. 3, 2017, Op. &amp; Order at 32 n.9, ECF No. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   On October 10, 2017, the Township Board extended the moratorium for another six months.

In the absence of an actual SLUP application, Tuscola's concerns over the availability of the moratorium are merely hypothetical. The Township Board could have relied on the moratorium to refuse consideration of Tuscola's\n   prior SLUP application, but chose to review that application on the merits. Tuscola has provided no reason to believe that a second SLUP application would be treated differently.

In 1973, a Florida appeals court ruled that, although members-elect were not specifically included in the statutory language, members-elect should be subject to the open meetings law.\n   <em>\n    Hough v.

The current language of the Rhode Island open meetings law, like that of the pre-1973 Florida law and the current Michigan law, does not specifically address members-elect: \" 'Meeting' means the convening of a public body to discuss and/or act upon a matter over which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power...'Public body' means any department, agency, commission, committee, board, council, bureau, or authority or any\n   subdivision thereof of state or municipal government.\" Gen.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Sutter Bay\n   </em>\n   refused to apply the restrictions of the open meetings law to meetings attended by members-elect in 1992: \"There is a fatal legal flaw in this first prong. When incumbent supervisor Licari met with supervisors-elect Akin and Kroon in December 1992, the [Open Meetings Act] did not apply to supervisors-elect,\n   <em>\n    but only to those who had already assumed office\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20492\">\n    at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

In other words, the court recognized that the legislature's amendment of the law to include members-elect strongly suggested that the law before the amendment-that is, before 1994-did not cover members-elect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In 2001, a Washington appeals court considered whether Washington's open meetings law applied to members-elect.\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that Washington's open meetings law was originally modeled on those of Florida and California. As noted above, the courts in these two states resolved the matter at issue in this case in opposite ways. The\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   court followed the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Sutter Bay\n   </em>\n   : \"Wood contends that applying the OPMA to members-elect is consonant with the legislative purpose. We do not disagree but we concur with the California court that it is 'for the Legislature, not the judiciary, to determine a basic legislative question such as whether [members-elect are] covered.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%201208\">\n    27 P.3d at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Washington court also asserted: \"Although the OPMA defines 'action' broadly, nothing suggests that members-elect have the power to transact a governing body's official business before they are sworn in.

First, the Legislature, not the court, has the prerogative of determining the scope of the OMA.\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%201208\">\n    27 P.3d at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the Legislature is responsible for \" 'determin[ing] a basic legislative question such as whether [members-elect are] covered.' \"). Second, the Michigan Supreme Court has interpreted the OMA narrowly.\n   <em>\n    Herald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.W.2d%20873\">\n    614 N.W.2d at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]y electing not to include individuals in the definition of public body in the OMA, [the Legislature] has exempted [individuals] from its requirements.\"). The Michigan Supreme Court found that the text of the OMA excluded individuals from the definition of \"public body\" because the Legislature did not include references to individuals in the text of the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.W.2d%20873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By analogy, and in keeping with the Michigan Supreme Court's directive to avoid unnecessary judicial construction, members-elect are excluded from the definition of \"public body.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.W.2d%20873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.W.2d%20873\">\n    at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Finally and most importantly, the Legislature expressly limited the OMA to bodies \"empowered...to exercise governmental or proprietary authority or perform a governmental or proprietary function.\" M.C.L. 15.262(a). A \"body\" comprised of members-elect to a Township Board is not empowered to exercise authority, and therefore falls outside the OMA. M.C.L. \u00a7 168.362(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%201208\">\n    27 P.3d at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[N]othing suggests that members-elect have the power to transact a governing body's official business before they are sworn in. Thus, they are not 'members' of a governing body with authority to take 'action.' \"). Thus, the members-elect of the Almer Township Board were not subject to the OMA before being sworn in on November 20, 2016. Because members-elect are not subject to the OMA, the gatherings that included members-elect of the Almer Township Board-which took place after the election on November 8, 2016, but before the newly-elected members' assumption of office on November 20, 2016-were not \"meetings\" for purposes of the OMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Tuscola also argues, very briefly, that \"the Board members continued engaging in concealed deliberations\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they were sworn into office\" because the Board implemented an email policy whereby \"the members would send an email to themselves and blind carbon copy the remaining Board members.\" Pl. Resp. Br. at 24. In support of this assertion, Tuscola cites two exhibits. The first exhibit contains two December 2016 emails from Jim Mantey in which Mr. Mantey articulated the change in procedure. Mantey Emails, ECF No. 62, Ex. 20. The second exhibit contains an December 26, 2016, email from Jim Tussey wherein the entire Almer Board is blind carbon copied. Tussey Email, ECF No. 62, Ex. 21. In the email, Tussey discussed certain outstanding questions regarding Tuscola's SLUP application. None of the email chains which Tuscola identifies involve any replies by other Board members or any indication that a discussion chain resulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Neither party has identified any Michigan authority which discusses whether and how the OMA applies to email communications. To the Court's knowledge, only one such case exists. In\n   <em>\n    Markel v. Mackley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206495941\">\n    2016 WL 6495941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2016 Mich. App. LEXIS 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that emails communications could violate the OMA. In\n   <em>\n    Markel\n   </em>\n   , the defendants argued that the OMA was not violated because the email communications did not involve a quorum of commissioners and because not all recipients of the emails participated in the discussions. The court of appeals rejected both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The court explained that \"it is plain that, even where a quorum of individuals are\n   present at a given nonpublic meeting, that does not necessarily mean that there is a violation of the OMA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, 2016 Mich. App. LEXIS 2004 at *8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ryant v. Cleveland Twp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1083104\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/239/430/\">\n    239 Mich.App. 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=608%20N.W.2d%20101\">\n    608 N.W.2d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 (2000) ). But the\n   <em>\n    Markel\n   </em>\n   Court explained that the OMA simply requires that a \"quorum is present...for the purpose of deliberating.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, 2016 Mich. App. LEXIS 2004 at *10 (citing M.C.L. \u00a7 15.262(b) ). Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Markel\n   </em>\n   Court rejected the idea that the statute requires \"the entire quorum to actively engage in the discussion.\" Rather, the OMA can be violated by simply \"some level of discourse on the issue of public policy that is being presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, 2016 Mich. App. LEXIS 2004 at *11. As the court of appeals explained, imposing a requirement that every member participate in the discussions \"would allow public bodies to forego the requirements of the OMA by merely having certain members of the quorum read the emails but remain silent\" and thus foil the underlying purposes of the OMA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Markel\n   </em>\n   held that \"whether 'a quorum is present for the purpose of deliberating toward a decision' when only some commissioners in the email chain respond to a message is often a question of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In so holding, the court also noted that \"even when a defendant did not affirmatively reply to an email, their tacit agreement was later demonstrated at the public meetings by acting consistently with decisions made in the emails.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5, 2016 Mich. App. LEXIS 2004 at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   When the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Markel\n   </em>\n   is applied to the present facts, it is clear that genuine issues of material fact exist. The attached emails clearly support a finding that members of the Board repeatedly emailed all members via blind carbon copy. Merely emailing all members does not violate the OMA unless there was some level of discourse on an issue of public policy. And neither of the exhibits cited by Tuscola contain discourse between multiple members. But the emails strongly suggest that the procedure was adopted in order to facilitate communication between the Board. And, as the\n   <em>\n    Markel\n   </em>\n   Court recognized, the fact that Board members may have later acted consistently with emails they did not reply to suggests that some level of participation in deliberation occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id. See also id.\n   </em>\n   (\"This is especially true where there was evidence that defendants intended to subvert the OMA, as noted by the trial court, and at least one commissioner was advised against sending emails that included a quorum of the PRC actively deliberating. \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In short, the emails identified by Tuscola do not clearly constitute violations of the OMA. None of the identified email chains involve replies by other commissioners, and no evidence has been presented to suggest that Board members later made decisions at public meetings in reliance on information received by email. But the identified emails do identify a procedure which expressly contemplated communications which could violate the OMA. And, importantly, Tuscola does not bear the burden of proving that an OMA violation occurred at this stage. Rather, in order to justify summary judgment, the Township must show that no violation occurred as a matter of law. Given the Township's threadbare briefing on this issue and the outstanding factual questions, the Township has not met that burden.

Resp. Br. at 13. That is simply wrong. As explained in detail above, the zoning ordinance requires an economic impact study for wind energy SLUP applications only when requested by the Township. In other words, the Township has discretion to require a study. And the Township similarly has \"absolute discretion\" to require other SLUP applicants to provide information which confirms that the special land use will not \"diminish and impair property values within its neighborhood.\" Zoning Ordinance at \u00a7 2400. In other words, the zoning ordinance empowers the Township to require information regarding economic impact for all kinds of SLUP applications, but leaves that decision to the discretion of the Township. Tuscola has provided no basis for its puzzling argument that the zoning ordinance\n    <em>\n     on its face\n    </em>\n    treats wind energy special uses differently from other kinds of special uses, at least when it comes to economic impact data. Rather, Tuscola's only examples of disparate treatment come from the application of the zoning ordinance to specific SLUP applications (i.e., the Township exercised its discretion to require an economic impact study for Tuscola's SLUP application, but not for the cell tower SLUP applications).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Tuscola also faults the Township for rejecting its economic studies because they were not specific to the Township. Tuscola argued in the SLUP application (and now) that an Almer Township specific study was unnecessary. But the Township's decision to require Almer-specific economic impact data was not irrational. As noted above, the zoning ordinance requires the Township Board to inquire into whether the proposed development would impact \"the area affected by the WECS.\" Almer Zoning Ord., \u00a7 1522(C)(3). The same is true of SLUP applications generally.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515639\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/452/#p462\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at \u00a7 2400(2).
