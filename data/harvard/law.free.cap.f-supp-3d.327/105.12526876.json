INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Catherine Woytowicz filed this suit to challenge both the process and outcome of an investigation into her alleged violation of Title IX while she was\n   employed as a part-time professor at The George Washington University (\"University\"). She has brought constitutional claims against the University and several of its employees for violations of her rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, a federal claim under the Ku Klux Klan Act, as well as common law and District of Columbia statutory claims for breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, discrimination, retaliation, and harassment. Defendants have moved to dismiss her complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that the University and its employees cannot be liable to Professor Woytowicz for constitutional violations because the University and its employees are not government actors, that her contract claim is preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\") and has not been properly exhausted, and that her remaining state law claims are insufficiently pleaded to survive Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. For the reasons given below, the Court dismisses Professor Woytowicz's constitutional claims because she has not sufficiently alleged that the University and its employees were government actors or performing a governmental function when they investigated and disciplined her. The Court also dismisses one of her breach of contract claims as preempted by the LMRA and insufficiently exhausted. Finally, finding that the circumstances of this case do not warrant the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction, the Court remands Professor Woytowicz's remaining state law claims to D.C. Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Indeed, many private entities routinely investigate and self-police to ensure that they are in compliance with federal laws, whether they be anti-discrimination laws, government procurement laws, securities laws, or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Yet Professor Woytowicz has not pointed to a single case in which such routine activities have been found to bring those otherwise private entities within the sphere of government action. Accordingly, the Court finds that Professor Woytowicz has failed to sufficiently allege that the University engaged in a traditionally exclusive governmental function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   More often, courts in this Circuit have found that a private entity engages in governmental action when \"there is a sufficiently close nexus between [the government] and the challenged action of [the regulated entity].\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bensenville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456817,3789309\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/457/52/\">\n    457 F.3d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196949\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/991/#p1004\">\n    457 U.S. at 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196949\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/991/#p1004\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peacock v.
