More specifically, section 403 authorizes FEMA to provide assistance for immediate threats, including emergency shelter. \u00a7 5170b(a)(3)(B). Such work is typically executed by local governments or nonprofits through use of congregate shelters. TSA is also intended to provide sheltering\n   assistance for survivors whose homes are either uninhabitable or inaccessible due to disaster-related damage. The goal of the program is to reduce the number of survivors housed in congregate shelters. TSA is a Public Assistance program provided through direct federal assistance. Therefore, FEMA directly implements the sheltering assistance and the program is subject to a cost share with the requesting State or Territory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5170b(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As provided by regulation and FEMA's internal policies, FEMA does not provide financial assistance through the TSA program directly to individuals. Before TSA can be implemented, this form of assistance must be requested by the State or Territory, and the applicable Presidential declaration must include a section 403/502 -Category B (Emergency Protection Measures) and a section 408 designation, making those particular forms of assistance available.

That same day, President Donald J. Trump issued a major disaster declaration for the island. On October 25, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico formally requested that FEMA provide TSA for Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico certified that it was responsible for the non-Federal cost share of all FEMA direct Federal assistance delivered under the Public Assistance program. On October 30, 2017, FEMA approved the request submitted by Governor Rosell\u00f3 for section 403 TSA and provided Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria short-term sheltering that lasted for an initial term of 75 days, beginning on October 31, 2017 and ending on January 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On December 23, 2017, at the request of the Governor, FEMA agreed to extend the TSA program through March 20, 2018, an additional 66 days. On March 8, 2018, again at the request of the Governor, FEMA agreed to further extend the TSA program through May 14, 2018, an additional 55 days. On May 3, 2018, again at the request of the Governor, FEMA agreed to a final extension of the TSA program until June 30, 2018, an additional 47 days. In his letter seeking the request, Governor Rosell\u00f3 stated that he was seeking the extension, in part, so that those receiving assistance could stay in the continental United States in a fixed location long enough for their children to finish the school year before returning to Puerto Rico. Moreover, by June 30, 2018, all of the congregate sheltering in Puerto Rico had closed. As of June 30, 2018, the TSA program had provided support to Puerto Rico for 242 days. This Court has since ordered that the TSA program be extended through August 31, 2018, an additional 62 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At all times throughout the duration of the TSA program, Puerto Rico was informed and acknowledged that the TSA program is intended to provide \"short-term sheltering.\" When FEMA granted the third extension on May 3, 2018, FEMA stated to the Governor and to the public that no further extensions of the program would be granted. FEMA's intended end date for the TSA program aligned with the end of the 100% cost share between FEMA and Puerto Rico, which was extended by the President for 240 days from the disaster declaration and is now a 90% FEMA/10% Puerto Rico share in the costs for certain types of \"emergency work,\" which includes the TSA program. Therefore, effective June 30, 2018, Puerto Rico is responsible for covering 10% of the cost of all emergency work, including the TSA program. Governor Rosell\u00f3 did not request a further extension of the TSA program beyond the June 30, 2018 termination date. Any such extension would have been subject to the new cost-share arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In total, 7,032 TSA eligible applicants checked into participating TSA hotels since the genesis of the program. As of July 5, 2018, 1,006 eligible applicants remained at participating TSA hotels.

Apr. 29, 2014) (since FEMA had discretion to decide whether to award plaintiff funds for the sea wall destroyed by Tropical Storm Irene, she had no reasonable expectation that she would get the benefit, and therefore, there is no protected property interest in the benefits themselves).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs point out that section 403 does not include a termination date for benefits-suggesting that Congress thus intended that once granted, TSA continues until such time as the applicant is transitioned into THA. However, as the\n   <em>\n    Ridgely\n   </em>\n   court stated with respect to an analogous argument regarding continued entitlement to section 408 assistance: \"it is unsurprising that no termination provision can be found in section 408 or the regulations, as such a provision would only be necessary if there were a stream of benefits to terminate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 739. Similarly, given that section 403 and its regulations do not mandate that assistance be provided indefinitely once awarded, or at least until the applicant is transition into the THA program, there is no need for a termination provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I agree with FEMA that Plaintiffs' assertion that they have an entitlement to continued TSA benefits is even more tenuous in this case than in\n   <em>\n    Ridgely,\n   </em>\n   which is a factually similar case. In this case, the Governor of Puerto Rico has not requested that assistance under the TSA program be extended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I find this of importance given\n   how the program is structured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike section 408 benefits, the TSA program is a Public Assistance program, that is, FEMA is providing assistance to Puerto Rico, not the individual Plaintiffs. While the federal government initially pays 100% of the costs associated with the program, as of June 30, 2018, Puerto Rico is required to pay 10% of the costs, while the federal government continues to pay 90%. This amount is set by the President and cannot be altered. Thus, should this Court find that the Plaintiffs are entitled to continued TSA benefits, it would be requiring Puerto Rico to incur monetary obligations which it to date, it has not agreed to take on. While it is not clear to me that this result should play a factor in the analysis of whether Plaintiffs have an entitlement to continued TSA benefits, I agree with FEMA that it at least raises the question of whether the Plaintiffs themselves have a legitimate \"claim\" to such benefits-- particularly in light of the previously cited authority finding that there is no protected property interest in section 408 benefits, which are paid directly to disaster victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons stated above, I find that the Plaintiffs have not established they have a protected interest in receipt of TSA benefits under the Stafford Act and its accompanying regulations. Furthermore, that the Plaintiffs have been deemed eligible for assistance under the TSA program does not create a property interest in\n   <em>\n    continued\n   </em>\n   assistance under that program.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070287\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/727/#p735\">\n    512 F.3d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (given that section 408 and the regulations do not provide entitlement to financial assistance, that plaintiffs were previously found eligible for assistance is of no matter). Additionally, I find the\n   <em>\n    Ridgely\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning persuasive in denying Plaintiffs' assertion that they have a property interest in obtaining section 408 benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Whether Plaintiffs have a Property Interest in continued assistance under the TSA Program as a result of FEMA's Conduct in in administering the Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs' assertion that FEMA's conduct and actions have created an expectation of continued TSA benefits fares no better. More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that FEMA's policies and practices in regards to carrying out the TSA program creates a property interest in their continued receipt of TSA, until such time as they are transitioned into the THA program. Plaintiffs acknowledge that on the record before me, there is insufficient evidence to make a determination on this claim. Plaintiffs, therefore, ask the Court continue the TRO and grant a period of fact finding followed by an evidentiary hearing. I agree\n   with the Plaintiffs that on this record, they have not established a likelihood of success on the merits this issue. On the contrary, the rules and regulations cited by the Defendants establish that FEMA requires certification from the State, Territory or local government whose citizens seek initial or continuing disaster relief. Moreover, those policies and regulations make clear that the disaster relief does not continue indefinitely, but rather is terminated when FEMA, in its discretion, determines that assistance is no longer necessary. It is possible that further discovery will shed light on FEMA's practices and policies sufficient to permit the Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue as to whether such policies and practices create a property interest in continued TSA. However, Plaintiffs have failed to establish on the record as is, or to convince the Court that upon obtaining such further discovery, they are likely to success on the merits of this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I find that the Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they have a protected property interest under sections 403 and 408 of the Stafford Act. For that reason, it is not necessary for me to address their assertion that the notices they have received (to the extent that they have received notice) are inadequate- primarily because the notices do not provide any information regarding their right to appeal, or their right to housing or transitional assistance. For the reasons stated, I find that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their procedural due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Substantive Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Like their procedural due process claim, to state a claim for violation of their substantive due process rights, Plaintiffs must first establish that they have \"a valid property interest in a benefit that was entitled to constitutional protection ....\"\n   <em>\n    Konashenko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201761346\">\n    2014 WL 1761346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v.

Therefore, their substantive due process claim also fails.

More specifically, they allege that Hurricane Harvey and Irma victims received seven extensions of TSA benefits whereas Plaintiffs received only three, which amounted to two months of additional benefits to victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. They also cite to the fact that FEMA had approved over twenty-two times the amount of financial assistance for victims of Hurricane Harvey as it did in the same amount of time for victims of Hurricane Maria. However, Plaintiffs fail to address how the three hurricanes impacted the\n   areas which were affected, what the amount of property damage from the three storms and the overall financial impact on the affected areas. Plaintiffs do acknowledge, but then downplay the fact that there were twice as many people impacted by Hurricane Harvey (7.6 million) than were impacted by Hurricane Maria (3.8 million), and over six times as many people were affected by Hurricane Irma (19.3 million). Moreover, as pointed out by FEMA, every disaster is unique and requires different responses. For example, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit the mainland, while Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, which is an island and is more logistically difficult to reach and assess. FEMA also points out that the damage sustained in each hurricane varied: Hurricane Harvey caused mostly flooding damage while Hurricane Maria caused mostly wind damage. These are only some difference which undermine Plaintiffs' equal protection claim-\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Supplemental Brief\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 56) details many more. Simply put, as the record currently stands, Plaintiffs have failed to make out a viable equal protection claim because they have not established either that they were similarly situated to other hurricane victims, and even if they were, that they were treated differently. Therefore, I finds that they are unable to establish a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to their Equal Protection Clause claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Discrimination Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that as Puerto Ricans, they have been discriminated against under the Stafford Act in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205151\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (barring discrimination based on race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English proficiency, or economic status.) I agree with Defendants that in their initial briefing of this claim, Plaintiffs, at best, make conclusory allegations that discontinuance of the TSA program constitutes discrimination against them based on their race, color, English proficiency, or economic status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their supplemental memorandum, they allege that they have been the victims of disparate treatment. They then assert that based on their allegations set forth in the First Amended Complaint, they have made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of disparate treatment and therefore, the burden shifts to the Defendants to establish, through admissible evidence, that the allegedly unlawful action was taken for a legitimate non-discriminatory reason. If the Defendants do so, they assert that the burden then shifts back to them to show that the Defendants' proffered reasons are pre-textual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In asserting that they have made out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, Plaintiffs cite to the same allegations made in their equal protection claim: that Hurricane Harvey victims' benefits under the TSA program have been extended 7 times to their 3- which amounts to two additional months, and that financial assistance to Hurricane Harvey was approved much more quickly and at a much higher amount. Given the differences in the disasters, including the number of people and the amount of property affected, the type of damage and the logistical differences in the locations where the hurricanes hit, I have grave concerns that the Plaintiffs have made out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, despite the low threshold for doing so. Assuming they have, FEMA has rebutted their claims by providing detailed evidence regarding the scope of damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Rita versus the scope of the damage to Puerto Rico, the difference in the type of damage, the difference in the number of persons affected and the logistical difficulties as the result of Puerto Rico being an island located well off the United States mainland. FEMA has also provided a breakdown of the amount of financial assistance given to Texas (Harvey), Florida (Irma) and Puerto Rico (Maria), which establish that aid to Puerto Rico has been in line with the aid provided to Texas and Florida. Additionally, I do not discount the fact that FEMA terminated the Plaintiffs' TSA, at least in part, because the Governor of Puerto Rico did not seek an extension beyond June 30, 2018. The burden thus falls on the Plaintiffs to establish that the Defendants' reasons are pre-textual. Plaintiffs argue that if I find that the Defendants have met their burden (as I have), they should be allowed to file a supplemental brief for purposes of establishing pretext. While Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to develop their claim going forward, whether they are entitled to an injunction is based on the record before me as it currently stands. Based on that record, I cannot find that they have established a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' APA Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants conduct violates the following provisions of the APA: (1) section 706(2)(B), because FEMA's termination of the TSA program as to them is contrary to law; and (2) section 706(2)(A) because FEMA's termination of the TSA program as to them without any plan to transition them into the THA program is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law.

The Stafford Act's discretionary function exception to governmental liability provides that the United States will not be liable for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [A]ny claim based upon the exercise or performance of or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Federal Government in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205148\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This discretionary funding exception encompasses FEMA's decision to terminate the TSA program as to the Plaintiffs and this Court lacks jurisdiction to address Plaintiffs' APA claims.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Tammany Par., ex rel.

They instead permit discretionary, policy-oriented choices that cannot be basis for the court's subject matter jurisdiction). Therefore, Plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief based on such APA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I have found that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of any of their substantive claims. Under these circumstances, I find that they are unlikely to prevail on their claim for a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    Risk of Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"Only a viable threat of serious harm which cannot be undone authorizes exercise of a court's equitable power to enjoin before the merits are fully determined.\"\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Coal. of Citizens with Disabilities v.

The Plaintiffs are evacuees from a catastrophic natural disaster\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which they have lost most, if not all, of their real and personal property and been forced to locate to areas thousands of miles away. At this point, the Plaintiffs and other potential class members who have not been transitioned into the THA program do not appear to have any place to go once the TSA program ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    Balance of Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The balance of hardships also tips considerably in favor of the Plaintiffs. I agree with the Plaintiffs that they will suffer disproportionate hardship given that to date, they have not been able to secure\n   alternative housing and therefore, may well be rendered homeless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The public interest is a more neutral factor. As the Defendants point out, it is in FEMA's interest to maximize the resources for providing assistance to the public during national disasters. It is also in the public interest that FEMA be allowed to act in accordance with its statutory mandate. At the same time, as pointed out by the Plaintiff, there is a strong public interest in helping to provide for the well-being of its citizens, particularly those who have been victims of natural disasters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Request for Preliminary Injunction is Denied\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   While there are factors that weigh in the Plaintiffs' favor, I have found that they are unlikely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims. Given that likelihood of success on the merits is the touchstone of the preliminary injunction inquiry, their request for injunctive relief is denied. While this is the result that I am compelled to find, it is not necessarily the right result. However, the Court cannot order that Defendants to do that which in a humanitarian and caring world should be done-- it can only order the Defendants to do that which the law requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for A Temporary Restraining Order Or Preliminary Injunction And Declaratory Relief (Docket No. 2) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   as to their request for a preliminary injunction. By its terms, the TRO has been extended until August 31, 2018. While by my Order I am vacating the TRO, Plaintiffs and the other evacuees will need time to make alternative housing arrangements. Therefore, I am ordering that the Defendants and their agents refrain from terminating the program which provides the payment for shelter for the Plaintiffs (including the class) until midnight September 13, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , enabling Plaintiffs and the class to stay until checkout time on September 14, 2018). I strongly urge the parties to work together to find temporary housing, or other assistance to the Plaintiffs and other members of the class prior to that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    In simple terms, the TSA program provides direct funding to hotels and motels, which serve as shelters for individuals and families who are forced to evacuate their damaged or destroyed homes due to a natural disaster.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    On June 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a complaint (Docket No. 1) and simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (Docket No. 2). On July 12, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, as of right (Docket No. 28). By that pleading, named Plaintiffs Alian Asencio, Aracelis Velez Cruz, Denise Nieves, Yaritza De Jesus Lopez, Rosa Rivera, and Angel Lauriano Munoz De Jesus were dropped from the suit while Elizabeth Delgado Santos and Rafael Ocasio Barreto were added. Plaintiffs also asserted new claims for violation of their equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment (Defendants' conduct has denied and continues to deny TSA evacuees from Puerto Rico equal protection under the law)(Count VI) and Discrimination in Disaster Assistance in violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205151\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 5151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%207.3\">\n     44 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Count No. VII). Over the objection of the Defendants, I have determined that for purposes of Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, the First Amended Complaint is the operative document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The evacuees had sought a TRO to prevent termination of their section 403 benefits, which was denied by the court. However, the court strongly advised FEMA to keep the section 403 benefits in place until a final ruling issued on the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. Nonetheless, FEMA terminated all but 113 households and two of the named plaintiffs in that case-for them, FEMA extended assistance under the TSA program for thirty additional days.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    As previously noted, in support of their argument that they have a property interest in section 403 benefits, Plaintiffs cited to the district court's ruling in\n    <em>\n     Acorn\n    </em>\n    granting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs/evacuees. Counsel for the Plaintiffs now acknowledge that the injunction was vacated by the D.C. Circuit. I accept counsels' representation that they were unaware of the D.C. Circuit's opinion, which was unpublished, and did not mean to mislead the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Plaintiffs' counsel represented at the hearing that media reports establish that since this case commenced, the Governor of Puerto Rico has repeatedly stated that he is in favor of the TSA benefits being extended. While I have no reason to doubt counsel's representation, on the record before me, the Governor has not officially requested that the TSA program be continued.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    I agree with Plaintiffs that\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.255\">\n     44 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.255\n    </extracted-citation>\n    does not necessarily require a state or local official to submit a request for continued assistance under section 403. However, FEMA also relies on its internal policy, in particular its Public Assistance and Policy Guide (\"PAPPG\"), in support of its contention that extension of TSA benefits in this case requires a request from the Governor of Puerto Rico. First, FEMA's policy to require an express request for TSA benefits makes sense given that the cost sharing arrangement mandated under section 403 and its regulations, discussed\n    <em>\n     infra.\n    </em>\n    Additionally, Plaintiffs' argument that the PAPPG itself does not require the Governor of Puerto Rico to seek an extension because nowhere in the policy does it require that such a request be made by the \"governor\" is specious. The PAPPG requires that \"State, Territorial, Tribal, and local government Applicants\"\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    submit a request for funding for non-congregate environments (such as hotels).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 66-67. Given that the \"applicant\" is a governmental entity, in this case a Territory, the person making the request must necessarily be the Governor, or someone else with authority to bind it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Plaintiffs' request that the Court extend the TRO while further discovery and an evidentiary hearing is conducted on this issue is based on their reading of the Fifth Circuit's ruling in\n    <em>\n     Ridgely\n    </em>\n    . I agree with the Plaintiffs that the Fifth Circuit recognized that FEMA's policies and procedures could create a property interest in continued benefits under section 408; the court remanded the case for the parties to conduct discovery on that issue and for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing. However, in doing so, the court vacated the lower court's grant of a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, which ordered that FEMA continue rental assistance for victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, because it found that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the merits. Likewise, I find that the Plaintiffs are entitled to further develop this claim, however, given that I do not find that, even accepting their arguments, they have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, the TRO shall not remain in place.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Defendants have cited authority questioning whether \"Puerto Ricans\" are a protected class. For purposes of this Order, I assume that they are a protected class.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In their First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs raise both a disparate treatment and a disparate impact claims. However, in their memorandum, they brief only the disparate treatment claim. Therefore, I find that for purposes of their motion for preliminary injunction, they have waived their disparate impact claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    In their initial briefing of this claim, Plaintiffs simply made a conclusory statement that for the same reasons they should prevail on the equal protection claim, they are likely to succeed this claim. It is not until there supplemental brief filed after the hearing that Plaintiffs flesh out this argument. As pointed out by the Defendants, Plaintiffs have failed to raise a number of legal arguments in their initial briefs-instead, they have routinely chosen to make new arguments and cite new authority in their reply or supplemental briefs. Generally, I do not address matters raised for the first time in supplemental pleadings, however, given the importance of the issues raised by the Plaintiffs, I have done so in this case. Should Plaintiffs appeal this decision, I strongly suggest that they be more diligent in regards to their briefing to the First Circuit, which strictly enforces the rule that arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are deemed waived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    For purposes of this Order, I will accept Plaintiffs assumption that the\n    <em>\n     McDonnell Douglas\n    </em>\n    burden shifting analysis applies to this claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
