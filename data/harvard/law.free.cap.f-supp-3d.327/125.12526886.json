(collectively, \"the Mayors\" or \"Plaintiffs\"). They sued Defendant Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company (\"Great-West\" or \"Defendant\") in April 2016 for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Initially, Defendant responded with counterclaims against Plaintiffs, but dropped them on the eve of trial. At the close of Plaintiffs' case-in-chief, Defendant moved orally for a directed verdict and judgment as a matter of law. The Court took the motion under advisement insofar as it related to damages and otherwise denied the motion. On January 23, 2018, after a nine-day trial, the jury returned an $8 million verdict for Plaintiffs and concluded that Defendant had breached both its contract with Plaintiffs and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Verdict Form, ECF No. 218. Defendant then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law. Def.'s Mot. (\"Mot.\"), ECF No. 224. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, Pls.' Opp'n (\"Opp'n\"), ECF No. 235, and Great-West replied, Def.'s Reply (\"Reply\"), ECF No. 238. The Court held a hearing on May 23, 2018. Upon consideration of the parties' briefing and argument, for the reasons discussed herein, and in accordance with the oral ruling announced in open court on May 23, the Court denies Defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The United States Conference of Mayors (\"USCM\") is \"a non-partisan organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more.\" Am.

In 2012, the Mayors entered into two contracts with Great-West relating to USCM's Retirement Program: (1) a License Agreement between USCM and Great-West, and (2) a Joint Marketing and Training Agreement (\"JMTA\") between USME and Great-West.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16.

On April 6, 2016, the Mayors filed their original complaint. ECF No. 1. On September 30, the Mayors filed an Amended Complaint, alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-38, ECF No. 22. Great-West filed its Answer and Counterclaim on October 17, asserting counterclaims for unjust enrichment, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. ECF No. 26. The Mayors filed their Answer to Great-West's counterclaims on October 28. ECF No. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both parties filed various motions in limine, which the Court resolved before trial. Among these rulings, the Court excluded an anonymous letter detailing allegations of sexual harassment and other forms of misconduct against one of Defendant's employees but permitted the letter to remain available for impeachment and cross-examination purposes. ECF No. 150. Two employees were fired as a result of the investigation that followed receipt of the anonymous letter, and the Court ruled that the internal communication announcing the firings was admissible, as was Defendant's filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") reporting these employees' ethical violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Also relevant here, the parties disputed the significance of certain attachments to their Agreements, which showed profit and reimbursement calculations based on estimated participant enrollment in the insurance program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Exclude Improper &amp; Irrelevant Evidence at 4, ECF No. 103. Defendant argued that these were \"hypothetical examples\" rather than contractual obligations and that Plaintiffs should not be allowed to imply that a failure to achieve those figures constituted a breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court ruled that Plaintiffs could not refer to the attachments as projections but instead must refer to them as \"hypothetical examples.\" ECF No. 151. Defendant also argued-for the first time after months of discovery and pretrial disputes-that the contract language precluded Plaintiffs from seeking lost revenue or profits, among other types of damages.

The Mayors also presented evidence that one of Great-West's Vice Presidents, and the employee responsible for running the Mayors' program, Brent Neese, was not only distracted and submitting false spending reports relating to his work with that program,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr.

Jan. 22, 2018 AM, at 40-41. Both concepts emphasize that if other factors prevented Great-West from performing, it should not be held to account for ensuing damages. The substantial performance instruction also made clear that if the Mayors did not perform or performed sub-optimally, the jury should weigh that in assessing liability. There is no reason to believe the jury did not understand and follow these instructions. Indeed, the jury took extensive notes throughout the trial and, when appropriate, wrote detail-oriented questions to the parties about evidence and testimony just presented.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr.

There was evidence that Great-West had conflicting interests because of its state-based programming, that Great-West's Vice President in charge of the Mayors' program was engaged in unethical behavior and distracted from his work, that Great-West leadership tried to change the structure of the contract to avoid doing the work they had agreed to do because the contract began to seem less profitable to them than other contracts, and that Great-West sent inexperienced personnel on sales calls. Whether or not the Court found this evidence persuasive is not the proper question at this stage.

Thus, the Mayors claimed that these senior executives were aware that \"Nationwide had offered up to $6 million to retain [the program],\" and that Great-West valued the program in September 2012 accordingly.

What's more, the Court instructed the jury that certain evidence could only be used for a limited purpose. Tr. Jan. 22, 2018 AM, at 31-33. These instructions precluded the jury from using Nationwide's offers or payments to the Mayors as the basis for calculating what the Mayors would have received from Great-West but explained this evidence could be relevant to what the parties expected when they entered into the Agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.
