As counsel for Cowels and Mims prepared for the retrial in Superior Court, the Commonwealth ordered a DNA test of a used condom that had been found by police in the vicinity of the murder. This test also yielded the profile of an unidentified male. On counsel's motion, and over the Commonwealth's objection, a Superior Court judge ordered the profile to be uploaded into the Massachusetts State DNA Index System (SDIS), the state component of the national Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) - but no matches were returned. Counsel then sought an order from the Superior Court directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enter the unidentified DNA profile into the National DNA Index System (NDIS) or to perform a \"keyboard search\" in hopes of finding a match. The Superior Court judge refused, citing a lack of jurisdiction to issue the proposed order. The FBI then declined counsel's request to enter the profile into NDIS, after determining that it was ineligible because it did not appear to be attributable to a potential perpetrator. Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit in the federal district court, seeking the same injunctive and declaratory relief that had been denied by the Superior Court. Before this court is a motion by defendants to dismiss the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1994, Congress passed the DNA Identification Act, which authorized the Director of the FBI to establish \"a national identification index of DNA records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012592\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; Compl. \u00b6 25; FBI's Mem. in Supp. of Its Mot. to Dismiss (FBI's Mem.) at 2.

Although seminal fluid was detected, it was not subjected to DNA testing prior to the original murder trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In January of 2017, acting on a request from the Commonwealth, Amy Joy, a \"forensic scientist with the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory,\" tested swabs taken from the condom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; FBI's Mem. at 4.

Quite the opposite. The Act specifies what the index \"shall only include,\" that is, those samples that meet the standards established by the Director of the FBI. As the statute only establishes what may not be included in CODIS (samples that do not meet the Director's standards), the most that can be said is that it defines no more than an entry portal for samples that\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    be eligible for inclusion (that is, those that do meet the Director's standards). Because the Act provides no guidance for samples that must be included, nor imposes any obligation on the Director to include any sample at all, I see \"no basis on which a reviewing court could properly assess\" the Director's discretionary eligibility decision.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    NDIS' structure and purpose further support the conclusion that Congress intended for the gathering of samples under the DNA Information Act to be wholly discretionary. NDIS' mission is to \"identif[y] serial criminals by linking DNA evidence\" from disparate crime scenes. FBI's Mem. at 3. The integrity of the NDIS is of paramount importance in attaining that goal. The Director of the FBI has accordingly been given the sole responsibility of guarding the integrity of the index. If this court were to compel the Director to abandon that mission by entering a condom profile into NDIS that he has determined to be ineligible, the door would be open to further challenges to the Director's authority, leaving NDIS vulnerable to the forced inclusion of contaminated and, possibly, falsely incriminating evidence. It follows that plaintiffs are precluded by Section 701(a)(2) of the APA from seeking either injunctive or declaratory relief in this court for violation of the DNA Information Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Constitutional claims, on the other hand, may be precluded by statute only when the \"intent [of Congress] to do so [is] clear.\"\n    <em>\n     Webster\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n     486 U.S. at 603\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2047\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
