Austin Trout Championship Fight Program\n   </em>\n   , which was telecast nationwide on April 20, 2013. R. 306, G &amp; G SOF \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Castillos obtained access to the fight through their residential DirecTV account, and broadcast the fight at their restaurant, La Pena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. Aaron Lockner, an investigator working on behalf of G &amp; G,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   observed the fight through the window of La Pena, and went into the restaurant to investigate. R. 320, G &amp; G Resp. Castillo SOF \u00b6 46. Lockner wrote an affidavit stating that he saw the fight being displayed on three TVs in La Pena around 10:30 p.m. on April 20. G &amp; G SOF Exh. 9, Lockner Aff. The Castillos did not order the fight from G &amp; G, and did not obtain a commercial license to broadcast it. G &amp; G SOF \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Castillos admit that they showed the fight at their restaurant, and that they never purchased a commercial license from G &amp; G. R. 324, Castillo Resp. G &amp; G SOF \u00b6 12; R. 297, Castillo SOF \u00b6 42. But the Castillos maintain that they were entrapped into showing the fight by Aaron Lockner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Castillo SOF \u00b6 42. According to the Castillos, on the night of the fight, an unknown customer-who the Castillos now believe to be Lockner-asked Jaime Castillo to change the channel to Showtime to put on the fight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Castillos were able to show the fight because (they maintain), DirecTV had mistakenly installed residential programming at La Pena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. (The fight was broadcast to residential customers at no charge on April 20, so the Castillos presumably were not prompted to pay for the programming when they put on the fight at Lockner's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Castillo SOF \u00b6\u00b6 44, 46.) The Castillos further assert that G &amp; G encourages investigators like Lockner to engage in dishonest behavior by paying them only if they provide signed affidavits attesting to acts of piracy, by not double-checking the investigators' assertions in their affidavits, and by failing to verify other evidence provided by the investigators, such as photos and videos.

G &amp; G's Commercial Distribution Rights\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A threshold dispute is whether G &amp; G actually owns the commercial distribution rights to the Alvarez/Trout boxing match. G &amp; G asserts that it purchased the rights from Showtime, and backs up this assertion with testimony from G &amp; G's president Nicholas Gagliardi. G &amp; G SOF \u00b6 7; G &amp; G SOF Exh 4, Gagliardi Dep. 21:5-23:1; R. 308, Gagliardi Aff. \u00b6 3. The Castillos, on the other hand, argue that G &amp; G's proof is insufficient to prove that G &amp; G owns the commercial rights to the fight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Castillo SOF \u00b6\u00b6 12-20; R. 296, Castillo Summ. J. Br. at 4. The Castillos do not provide any\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   to back up their suspicion that G &amp; G does not own the rights to the fight, choosing to point only to oddities and inconsistencies in Gagliardi's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ordinarily, this kind of speculation about the truthfulness of the other side's testimony would not be enough to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Duperrault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247879\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/703/#p707\">\n    367 F.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"Inferences that are supported by only speculation or conjecture will not defeat a summary judgment motion.\"). In this case, however, there is some reason to be skeptical about Gagliardi's testimony. Gagliardi states that he negotiated purchase of the rights via email with someone named Jock McLean, who was then a vice president for sports and event programming at Showtime Networks, Inc. Gagliardi Aff. \u00b6 3. Gagliardi testifies that it was the usual practice to not have a written contract. Castillo SOF Exh. 7, Gagliardi Dep. 22:2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But Gagliardi was also unable to produce the emails that supposedly memorialized the agreement, or any other documentation to confirm that the sale actually took place.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   23:18-24:3. Gagliardi did explain the missing emails by testifying that\n   his computer files got corrupted and the email was lost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gagliardi also testified that he tried to reach out to McLean, his contact at Showtime, and got no response.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   93:15-94:5. To be sure, none of this is a smoking gun. It could very well be true that Gagliardi's emails were indeed lost, and that McLean no longer works at Showtime or just refused to respond (though a subpoena would have required a response). Still, it is odd that G &amp; G would have\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   documentation of its supposed rights to the programming. It is also strange that Gagliardi's emails were apparently stored only as files on one computer and could not be obtained from the provider of the email service. But, on the other hand, the Castillos provided no actual evidence to cast doubt on Gagliardi's testimony, even though they could presumably have backed up their theories by (as noted earlier) subpoenaing records from Showtime, for example. Even an\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of Showtime records would have been probative to rebut Gagliardi's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the end of the day, this is a close enough question to preclude summary judgment right now. Taken in the light most favorable to the\n   <em>\n    Castillos\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable jury could find, on these facts, that there is enough circumstantial evidence to disbelieve Gagliardi's testimony on ownership. This is an example of a case where the\n   <em>\n    gaps\n   </em>\n   in a movant's summary-judgment presentation cast enough doubt on an asserted fact that the non-movant can reasonably point to the absence of evidence as enough to raise a genuine issue. Having said that, a prompt motion from either side might be granted for very limited and targeted discovery on Showtime, even at this late date, to ascertain the truth of the ownership issue. And, in any event, at the pretrial order stage, the parties should consider whether a special interrogatory would be helpful on this issue (the Court has no firm thoughts on this as of yet). Also, depending on how the evidence plays out at trial, the Court might consider a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a). But, at this point, G &amp; G cannot prevail on its summary judgment motion because it has not established that a reasonable factfinder\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   find that G &amp; G owns the rights to the Alvarez/Trout fight. Conversely, the Castillos also cannot prevail on this issue right now, because a jury could reasonably believe Gagliardi's testimony that he purchased the rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In this case, there are no facts suggesting that the Castillos \"took\" or \"seized\" programming on its way to its intended destination. All parties seem to agree that La Pena was the intended endpoint of the DirecTV service at issue, and G &amp; G does not argue that improper use of residential programming in a commercial establishment could be considered \"interception.\" Indeed, G &amp; G relies on the Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. v.

The Castillos have offered evidence that their alleged violation of the statute was actually\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   by the purported rights-holder's agent. The Castillos testified that Jaime only turned on the fight because Aaron Lockner-who at the time was investigating potential violations on G &amp; G's behalf-asked them to turn it on. Castillo SOF \u00b6 42. According to Jaime, Lockner even directed Jaime to the channel where the fight could be found.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1269275\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/253/900/#p915\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Assuming that this version of events is true (which the Court must do in deciding G &amp; G's summary judgment motion), and assuming that Lockner was acting within the scope of his agency, there was no violation of Section 605.

In this case, the Castillos maintain that Lockner, G &amp; G's agent, asked Jaime Castillo to turn on the program, implicitly granting him permission to do so. This permission means that the Castillos became \"entitled\" to receive and show the boxing match when Lockner asked them to turn it on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20605\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Sentence 3. This result makes sense: it would be bizarre if G &amp; G's agents could effectively cause violations of Section 605 and then collect from their unwitting victims. A reasonable factfinder could decide that this is exactly what happened to the Castillos, so G &amp; G's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That said, the Castillos are not entitled to summary judgment either. The crucial fact dispute about whether or not Lockner asked Jaime to turn on the program could go either way: a reasonable jury could find that Lockner is credible, and that the boxing match was already playing when he arrived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the match was already playing when Lockner walked in, then the Castillos are liable under Section 605 (so long as G &amp; G owned the commercial distribution rights). In addition to this factual dispute, there are also some fact questions about Lockner's relationship with G &amp; G, and whether he was acting within the scope of his agency when he (allegedly) asked the Castillos to turn on the Alvarez/Trout fight. All of these disputed fact issues prevent the Court from granting summary judgment to the Castillos on the Section 605 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Individual Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   If there is liability under Section 605, the Castillos will be individually liable for the violation.

Willfulness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Disputed factual issues also prevent summary judgment on the issue of the Castillos' willfulness.

The Castillos moved for summary judgment on\n   this issue, arguing that there are no facts on the record to support a willfulness finding. Castillo Summ. J. Br. at 9. That is incorrect. There are a number of disputed fact issues that go to willfulness. To give a few examples, the parties dispute whether the Castillos turned on the fight on their own initiative, whether the Castillos deliberately obtained residential DirecTV service for their commercial establishment, and whether the Castillos have shown other boxing matches at La Pena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 318, G &amp; G Add.

Counterclaim \u00b6 2. According to the Castillos, the scheme works as follows: Riley enlists hundreds of investigators (called \"auditors\") to search for violations of G &amp; G's television licensing rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Riley does not interview these investigators or verify their credentials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.

The investigators are provided with form affidavits to complete, and encouraged to provide photos and videos of violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.

According to the Castillos, the investigators frequently lie or exaggerate in their affidavits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.

G &amp; G and Riley also allegedly make threats and misleading statements over the telephone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.

Jaime did not know what Lockner was talking about, and asked Lockner what channel he wanted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Lockner gave Jaime a channel number, and the fight appeared on the screen without any kind of pay screen or special notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.

ICFA prohibits \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices ... in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" 815 ILCS 505/2.

For G &amp; G and Riley's actions to fall within the purview of ICFA, G &amp; G and Riley would have had to engage in deceptive acts or unfair practices \"in the conduct of\" the \"advertising, offering for sale, sale, or distribution\" of G &amp; G's property, 815 ILCS 505/1(f). The Castillos allege that G &amp; G, Riley, and their agents engaged in all manner of shady practices in their attempts to extract settlements from unlicensed exhibitors of G &amp; G properties.

ICFA does not prohibit\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   deceptive acts or unfair practices that are in some nebulous way connected to trade or commerce.

But the complaint does not identify any materially false statements, misrepresentations, or concealments made in furtherance of the alleged fraudulent scheme. Although the Castillos characterize the four letters sent by Riley as \"misleading,\" that characterization is simply incorrect. The letters are actually very straightforward and do not contain any false or even misleading statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Am. Counterclaim Exhs. 1-2. The first letter identifies the boxing match at issue and states that Riley and G &amp; G \"are informed and believe\" that the program was exhibited at Jaime Castillo's establishment. Third Am. Counterclaim Exh. 1. This is true, as even the Castillos admit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Am. Counterclaim. \u00b6 25. The rest of the letter merely states that unauthorized broadcast of the fight would be unlawful (also true), and encourages Jaime to settle. Third Am. Counterclaim Exh. 1. The second letter has even less in the way of factual assertions, and again urges Jaime to settle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507486\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/884/#p890\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the last two letters state that G &amp; G and Riley intend to file a lawsuit unless Jaime agrees to settle.

Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 36-45. But, as with the letters, none of Dadayan's words or actions rise to the level of materially false or misleading statements or omissions. Indeed, many of the Castillos' allegations boil down to complaints that Dadayan did not guard their interests carefully enough-something that she had no obligation to do. The Castillos allege, for example, that Dadayan\n   did not ask Jaime whether he understood English or whether he would like an interpreter; that she did not advise the Castillos to seek counsel; that she did not perform factual investigation that might have partially exculpated the Castillos; and that she did not advise them of statutory provisions that might have been favorable to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-44. None of this is actionable. Dadayan had no obligation whatsoever to give the Castillos legal advice or investigate their potential defenses, and her failure to help them is nowhere close to being a false statement or misleading omission that would support a claim of fraud. Similarly, she had no obligation to investigate Jaime's level of English ability or to advise him that he should contact an interpreter. The Castillos do not allege that Dadayan took advantage of Jaime's limited English abilities in order to deceive him, so Dadayan's supposed shortcomings in providing language assistance are not fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As for the statements that Dadayan allegedly made to the Castillos-that she \"knew [Jaime] was guilty\" and that he should settle for $20,000,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 45-these are just legal opinions or negotiation positions, not the kind of false representations that an opposing party would take as fact and rely on to her detriment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Weimert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254013\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/351/#p355\">\n    819 F.3d at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that deception about a party's negotiating positions cannot give rise to a wire fraud conviction);\n   <em>\n    Sosa v.

The Counterclaim only implies that Lockner prepared an affidavit, which was submitted to Riley. But the letters sent by Riley to Jaime Castillo do not refer to the allegedly false statements in the affidavit. Nor does the complaint eventually filed by G &amp; G repeat any of the false claims made by Lockner. In fact, there are\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   allegations that Lockner's false statements were used in any way to pressure the Castillos to settle. The counterclaim does not give any explanation of how Lockner's affidavit was used by G &amp; G and Riley (if it was used at all). So, although Lockner allegedly made false statements to Riley, there are no allegations that anyone used Lockner's affidavit to make any false statements or representations in an attempt to defraud the Castillos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because the Castillos have not alleged any false or misleading representations or omissions made in connection with the alleged scheme to defraud, they have not alleged any RICO predicate acts of mail or wire fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The RICO claim must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b. RICO Enterprise\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although it is unnecessary to address G &amp; G and Riley's other arguments in light of the fact that the Castillos have failed to allege predicate acts of racketeering activity, one argument made by G &amp; G and Riley merits a quick discussion. G &amp; G and Riley assert that the Castillos failed to allege a RICO enterprise because the enterprise they describe has no purpose other than committing RICO predicate acts. G &amp; G and Riley suggest that the Court should ignore all allegations of predicate acts when determining whether a RICO enterprise exists, and look only at what allegations remain when the predicate acts are taken out. G &amp; G Mot. Dismiss Br. at 18; Riley Mot. Diss. Br. at 11-12. That is not the correct test. A RICO enterprise needs only three features: \"a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyle v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653895\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/938/#p946\">\n    556 U.S. 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653895\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/938/#p946\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653895\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/938/#p946\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). There is no requirement that the Court \"zero out\" the alleged RICO predicate acts when deciding whether these three structural features have been alleged. In other words,\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   does not hold that an enterprise must have a\n   <em>\n    lawful\n   </em>\n   purpose separate from the purpose of committing crimes. To the extent\n   that some case law appears to hold otherwise, that law is not consistent with\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this case, the Castillos have done enough to allege a RICO association-in-fact enterprise. The association made up of G &amp; G, Riley, and their agents has a purpose (extorting settlements), relationships among the associates (agency and independent contractor relationships), and longevity (the association lasted at least long enough to attempt to run the scheme on the Castillos). That is all that is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Because the Castillos have not stated a valid claim of violation of Section 1962(c), their Section 1962(d) conspiracy claim fails as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund v.

The RICO conspiracy claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Riley's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Castillos' counterclaims against Riley are dismissed for the reasons stated above. For the sake of completeness, however, it is worth discussing a couple of Riley's arguments. First, Riley argues that it was not timely named as a counter-defendant. Riley points out that back in December 2015, the magistrate judge assigned to the case set March 1, 2016 as the deadline to name additional parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 75 (12/02/15 Minute Entry). Riley was not added as a party until after this deadline. Riley's argument (as best as the Court can make out) seems to be that the only proper way to amend the complaint to add Riley as a counter-defendant would have been to appeal from the magistrate judge's December 2015 order setting the deadline to add defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Riley Br. at 3-5. But this argument does not work. Riley's argument implies that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   way to change a magistrate judge's scheduling order is to appeal the order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, which requires a party to object to a magistrate judge's nondispositive orders within 14 days. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). Under Riley's rule, any party who sought to change a deadline for good cause more than two weeks after the entry of a magistrate judge's order would be forever out of luck-a plainly absurd result. What's more, Rule 16 explicitly allows courts to amend their own scheduling orders for good cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Alioto v. Town of Lisbon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754615\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/715/#p719\">\n    651 F.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (7th Cir. 2011). That is what happened in this case. In April 2016 (after the magistrate judge's deadline to add additional defendants), the Castillos asked to amend their Second Amended Counterclaim in order to add additional defendants based on information learned in recent depositions. R. 165, Motion to Amend/Correct Briefing Schedule \u00b6 6; R. 169 (4/27/16 Minute Entry). After an oral hearing, the previously assigned District Judge granted leave to amend to add Riley as a counter-defendant. R. 169 (4/27/16 Minute Entry). The addition of Riley as a counter-defendant was proper; the Castillos did all they were required to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Riley's second argument is that naming the Law Offices of Thomas P. Riley as a counter-defendant deprives G &amp; G of its\n   counsel of choice. Riley Br. at 7-8. This argument is even more puzzling than Riley's Rule 72 argument. Riley never represented G &amp; G in this case, and Riley does not explain how its status as G &amp; G's co-defendant in this case would prevent it from representing G &amp; G in any other case. Nor has Riley cited any authority to explain why such a conflict (if any existed) would be grounds for dismissing potentially meritorious claims against Riley. In short, neither of Riley's additional arguments holds water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons stated above, summary judgment is granted to the Castillos on the Section 553 claim, but the summary judgment motions are otherwise denied. The motions to dismiss are granted in full. The dismissal is with prejudice. The Castillos have already had three opportunities to amend their counterclaim, and more chances will not be given in light of those three chances and the fact that this case is over four years old. The Law Offices of Thomas P. Riley is thus out of the case now (at least as a party; it is possible that Thomas Riley and his associates could be called as witnesses at trial). In order to give G &amp; G and the Castillos enough time to review this Opinion and reconsider settlement positions, the status hearing of June 21, 2018 is reset to July 9, 2018 at 10:15 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    For the sake of simplicity, the Court will refer to Jaime Castillo, Maria Castillo, and El Bajio Enterprises collectively as \"the Castillos.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Citations to the record are noted as \"R.\" followed by the docket number and the page or paragraph number.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Abbreviations to the parties' Local Rule 56.1 Statements are as follows: \"Castillo SOF\" for the Castillos' Statement of Facts [R. 297], \"G &amp; G SOF\" for G &amp; G's Statement of Facts in support of its own motion for summary judgement [R. 306]; \"Castillo Resp.

That motion drew the Court's attention to an order in another case,\n    <em>\n     G &amp; G Closed-Circuit Events, LLC v. Medel's Icehouse, et al.\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 4:15-cv-01042 (S.D. Tex. June 7, 2016). The order granted summary judgment to the defendant on the grounds that G &amp; G had not established its rights to the broadcast. R. 337 Exh. 1 at 6. Attached to the motion was an affidavit by Gagliardi attesting that G &amp; G owned the rights to the April 20 Trout/Alvarez fight. R. 337 Exh. 2. This affidavit was submitted during summary judgment briefing in the\n    <em>\n     Medel's Icehouse\n    </em>\n    case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In response, G &amp; G pointed out that the opinion that the Castillos submitted as supplemental authority was subsequently vacated. R. 339 at 2-3. G &amp; G also asked for leave to file under seal a copy of a check made out to Showtime Networks, Inc., with the memorandum \"April 20, 2013.\" R. 340; R. 341; R. 344. The motion to file a sealed version of the check is granted, but a public version redacting financial-account numbers and the amount of the check must be filed by June 28, 2018. But none of this makes a difference to the outcomes on summary judgment (so the defense motion to file a reply, R. 344, is denied). First, the (apparently vacated) order in\n    <em>\n     Medel's Icehouse\n    </em>\n    is of very limited persuasive value because it is not clear that the evidentiary record in that case is the same as the record here. The\n    <em>\n     Medel's Icehouse\n    </em>\n    order did not discuss any testimony by Gagliardi that substantiated the claims in the affidavit, whereas Gagliardi's testimony is part of the record in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Nor does the new evidence submitted by G &amp; G in response to the Castillos' motion change the result. Even if the Court were to consider this late-filed evidence (which was inexplicably not included in G &amp; G's summary judgment filings), there would still be a genuine issue of material fact as to G &amp; G's ownership of the rights. It is true that the check tends to support Gagliardi's story that G &amp; G purchased the rights to the Alvarez/Trout fight from Showtime. But, contrary to G &amp; G's assertions, the check does not \"alone refute any argument\" that there was no contract between G &amp; G and Showtime for the fight.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 339 at 5. The check does contain the memorandum \"April 20, 2013,\" but it does not state outright that the payment was for the fight at issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 340. Presumably Gagliardi or another G &amp; G representative would have to testify that the check was indeed payment for the Alvarez/Trout fight rather than for some other event that took place on April 20. And, as discussed already, Gagliardi's story is odd enough that a jury could reasonably doubt his credibility. So, even considering the check, there are enough unresolved questions about the transaction between G &amp; G and Showtime to prevent summary judgment on the issue of G &amp; G's right to broadcast the fight.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Both G &amp; G and the Castillos ask the Court to believe their version of events and disbelieve the other side's, but that kind of factual finding is prohibited at the summary judgment stage. It does not matter at this stage that Lockner has been charged with a felony or that he is not a licensed investigator,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Castillo SOF \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; these facts go only to Lockner's credibility.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Omnicare,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079437\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/697/#p704\">\n     629 F.3d at 704\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that credibility determinations are the province of the jury).

Berkowitz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1797044\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/927/1376/#p1384\">\n     927 F.2d 1376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1384 (\"[P]erfunctory and undeveloped arguments, and arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority, are waived.\"). Nor do the Castillos argue that any of the actions described in their counterclaim constitute bribery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The Minute Entry actually says \"3/1/15,\" but this must have been a typo, because the order was issued in December 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
