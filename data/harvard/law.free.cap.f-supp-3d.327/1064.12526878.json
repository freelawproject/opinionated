McKesson argues it has an unusually close relationship with the government due to monitoring and oversight of the PPV Contract by a Contracting Officer. Like MIS, McKesson performs a function that the VA would otherwise have to do itself (and in fact did do prior to instituting the PPV program).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   McKesson cites sections I-1(a), (f)-(i), I-9, and I-18(i) of the PPV Contract for the proposition that the \"contract is heavily regulated, monitored, and supervised\" and states that it \"cannot act (i.e. distribute) without the direction of the VA.\" (1:18-OP-45695 Doc # : 29 at 13) These sections specifically require McKesson to \"maintain an adequate supply and distribute all drug/pharmaceutical ... items and other contracted items,\" \"provide [all items ordered] to the ordering facilities in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PPV contract,\" and \"[u]pon request ... coordinate large and bulk orders [of pharmaceuticals].\" (1:18-OP-45695 Doc # : 29-3 at 13) (hereafter cited as \"PPV Contract\") These sections describe how McKesson is required to perform actions that the VA used to have to do itself, but do not on their face demonstrate the level of supervision and involvement the FAA had over MIS's actions in\n   <em>\n    Bennett.\n   </em>\n   For this, McKesson cites section I-18(i), which provides that \"[t]he Government will witness products received at the loading docks (or specified delivery location) and sign delivery receipt documents before the PPV driver departs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40) This falls short of the level of supervision the FAA had over MIS in\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   , however, there are factual differences between the contractual obligations of MIS in\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   and those of McKesson here. In the present cases, McKesson does not need to fill pharmaceutical orders under the close scrutiny of the VA contracting officer because the PPV Contract provides recourse in the event the government is not satisfied with an order. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72) Additionally, although not based on McKesson's actions under the PPV Contract, there is evidence that McKesson's actions are heavily monitored and regulated. In January, 2017, the government imposed a $150 million fine on McKesson for, among other things, failing to \"design and implement an effective system to detect and report 'suspicious orders' for controlled substances\" in violation of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.

The implication of this provision is that ARS was solely responsible for determining how to execute the contract in the absence of written directions. In addition, the contract contemplates that ARS would be \"responsible for errors and omissions committed by it,\" except to the extent that FEMA caused or contributed to ARS's liability.

In\n   <em>\n    Brokaw\n   </em>\n   , the action at issue pursuant to the contract was the transportation of the equipment. The military wanted its equipment moved from point A to point B, and provided the defendant a lot of discretion on how to do that. Here, the action at issue pursuant to the contract is not the transportation of the drugs, but the filling of specific orders received from its government customers. In that regard, McKesson, as discussed below, did not have the discretion, under the contract, to unilaterally refuse to fill orders based on its concerns about potential diversion, nor could it ship pharmaceuticals that were not actually ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Custer\n   </em>\n   , like the other cases discussed, is distinguishable due to the amount of discretion given to the defendants in that case.\n   <em>\n    Custer\n   </em>\n   involved a suit for liability over the release of hazardous substances at three sites.\n   <em>\n    Custer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205033931\">\n    2009 WL 5033931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.

The court stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants argue that the government contracts required them to dispose of wastes in a fashion required by the government.

The defendants in\n   <em>\n    Custer\n   </em>\n   had discretion regarding how they disposed of the PCBs, or at least were not directed to be careless. Here again, McKesson's discretion, with respect to their performance\n   under the PPV Contract, is limited. When the government submits an order under the contract, McKesson is obligated to fill the order. Further, as discussed above, McKesson has only limited ability to refuse, and even when they refuse to fill an order, that decision is ultimately at the discretion of the federal contracting officer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PPV Contract at 80)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Gragg\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. In\n   <em>\n    Gragg\n   </em>\n   the court decided to remand the case to state court because, in the court's opinion, the defendant had failed to \"put forward sufficient evidence even to raise an inference of a colorable federal defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Gragg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204110389\">\n    2009 WL 4110389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Despite this, Lac Courte Oreilles cites a passage that again illustrates an important distinction in the level of discretion Foster Wheeler had in designing its warnings in\n   <em>\n    Gragg\n   </em>\n   , versus the discretion McKesson has in refusing to fill orders here. Lac Courte Oreilles identifies that the court in\n   <em>\n    Gragg\n   </em>\n   found that \"even assuming ... the [United States Navy] exercised the final control over the content of the warnings that accompanied the equipment supplied to it by Foster Wheeler, this does not negative the possibility that Foster Wheeler had responsibility for designing the warnings, in whole or in part.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204110389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This presumed degree of control exercised by Foster Wheeler was evidence cited by the court to reject Federal Officer Removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The PPV Contract Required McKesson to Distribute Opioids Pursuant to Its Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Tribes argue that McKesson could not have been acting under the direction of a federal officer because McKesson was in breach of its contractual obligations not to divert opioids. This argument is faulty for two reasons. First, it rests upon the conclusion that McKesson was in fact allowing the diversion of opioids in violation of the PPV Contract, which is merely an allegation and remains unproven until trial. Second, it confuses the analyses of the \"acting under\" and \"causal nexus\" prongs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Tribes argue that the PPV Contract did not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   McKesson to engage in opioid diversion, and in fact specifically forbade it. This is of course, true. The government did not direct McKesson to engage in opioid diversion. The government did, however, direct McKesson to distribute pharmaceuticals pursuant to the PPV Contract. The Tribes allege that McKesson filled suspicious orders in violation of the PPV Contract's express mandates to comply with state and federal laws. According to the Tribes, if the PPV Contract forms the basis for McKesson's argument that it was acting under the direction of a federal officer, and McKesson was in violation of that contract, then McKesson could not have been acting under the direction of a federal officer. This argument relies, however, on the conclusion that McKesson was engaged in opioid diversion in breach of the PPV Contract. The \"acting under\" prong, however, is not concerned with the specific actions actually taken by McKesson, but rather asks whether McKesson was directed by a federal officer, pursuant to a legal obligation, to perform a task that otherwise the government would be required to do. In other word, the \"acting under\" prong merely examines the relationship between the defendant and the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Tribes' assertions that McKesson's actions allowed opioid diversion to occur in breach of the PPV Contract implicates the \"causal nexus\" prong. Diversion of opioids either occurred or did not occur as a direct result of McKesson's obligation to fill orders under the PPV Contract. The \"causal nexus\" prong, analyzed further below, examines McKesson's actions taken pursuant to the PPV Contract. The analysis examines whether there is a connection between\n   those actions and the opioid diversion that forms the basis of Cherokee complaint. The Tribes' assertions that McKesson filled orders that it knew or should have known would be diverted highlights the connection between McKesson's actions (filling and distributing opioid orders) and the Tribes' claims (diversion). This is a \"causal nexus\" argument.

The Tribes also argue that McKesson's distribution to the VA and IHS (i.e. the distribution that occurred pursuant to the PPV Contract) are not at issue because they did not specifically allege that any of the diverted opioids came from tribal healthcare facilities. However, the Tribes' claims put\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   prescription opioids at issue and allege that diversion can occur at\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   point in the supply chain, including those opioids supplied pursuant to the PPV contract. The issue here is whether McKesson's drug distribution was performed pursuant to a federal contract, and in this case it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The causal nexus relationship required for federal officer removal depends on whether the actions of the defendant under the direction of a federal officer are causally linked to the claims the plaintiff is making. Here, the Tribes are claiming that McKesson engaged in opioid diversion, and further assert that opioid diversion occurs \"when distributors fill suspicious orders of opioids from retailers or prescribers.\" (1:18-OP-45695 Doc # : 2-1 at 9-10),\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (1:18-OP-45932 Doc # : 1-1 at 40) Thus, there is a causal nexus between McKesson's action under the direction of a federal officer (filling orders pursuant to the PPV contract) and Cherokee's claim of opioid diversion (that McKesson knew or should have known that the orders were suspicious and should not have filled them).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   McKesson should only be estopped from making its nexus argument if the \"issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). The test for tribal court jurisdiction requires a consensual relationship between the tribe and the tribal court defendant, and then asks whether the litigation arose from that relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montana v.

The test for causal nexus under the Federal Officer Removal Statute on the other hand requires the actions performed under direction of a federal officer be causally linked to the plaintiff's claims. The precise issue of whether there is a causal link between McKesson and either Tribes' asserted claims (i.e. the issue of federal subject matter jurisdiction under the Federal Officer Removal Statute) is different from whether or not there was a consensual relationship between McKesson and the Cherokee Nation, and whether Cherokee's suit against McKesson arose from that relationship (i.e. the issue of tribal court jurisdiction over non-tribal parties). McKesson should not be estopped from arguing that there is a causal nexus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Regarding the third \"warning\" prong of\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   , McKesson can plausibly argue that it was aware of no greater danger than the government was already aware of. Therefore, McKesson's distributions to the federal government pursuant to the PPV Contract are sufficient to demonstrate that the government contractor defense is plausible. Because the \"colorable federal defenses\" prong is a low bar, McKesson's arguments that it is asserting colorable federal defenses for the purpose of federal officer removal are well taken. McKesson has asserted at least one colorable federal defenses sufficient to meet the third prong of the federal officer removal analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Policy Implications of Denying the Tribes' Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Cherokee argues that if the Court were to deny its motion to remand, that it would set a precedent that would allow McKesson to use the Federal Officer Removal Statute to remove cases brought by the States in state court to federal court despite this Court's previous statements that it does not have jurisdiction over State Attorneys General who bring state based claims in state court. However, to date McKesson has not removed or attempted to remove any cases brought by a State Attorney General on behalf of his or her State on the basis of the Federal Officer Removal Statute. Furthermore, while McKesson initially removed the case brought by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, McKesson subsequently consented to the remand of that case back to state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court recognizes that this is a close case and construes McKesson's removal arguments very narrowly as applicable only to the specific facts of these two cases. The Court is persuaded by the Supreme Court's mandate to give the Federal\n   Officer Removal Statute a liberal interpretation and also swayed by the fact that all of the other Native American Tribe cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the Opioid Crisis MDL, or were filed directly in federal court. As of August 31, 2018, there are 51 Indian Tribe lawsuits consolidated in the MDL, and besides Cherokee and Lac Courte Oreilles, no other tribes have filed remand motions, and if they did, the tribe subsequently withdrew its motion. The Court believes this is in part due to recognition on the part of the tribes that it is in their individual and collective best interest to be part of the MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly, the Motions to Remand filed by plaintiffs Cherokee Nation and Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (1:18-OP-45695 Doc # : 12; 1:18-OP-45932 Doc # : 15) are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On July 26, 2018 McKesson filed a Motion for an Order Directing the Clerk of the Court to Stay Execution of Any Remand Order for 14 Days Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(a). Because the Court has denied Cherokee's Remand Motion for the preceding reasons, McKesson's Motion to Stay Execution of Any Remand Order is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On August 9, 2018 Cherokee filed a Motion for Oral Argument on its Motion for Remand. The Court has discretion regarding whether to grant oral arguments, and in this case the Court feels that the parties' positions were adequately briefed and that no oral argument will be necessary for the Court to make a determination. Therefore, Cherokees' Motion for Oral Argument is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Tribes also move for an award of costs and fees.
