Approximately an hour before executing the warrant, KVET officers had supervised a \"controlled buy\" of illegal narcotics from Defendant Amarion McElrath on the 637 Florence property; KVET officers had also supervised another controlled buy on the 637 Florence property approximately a day before from an undescribed individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   While other KVET officers sought the warrant from a state court judicial officer, KVET officers planned the raid and held a pre-raid briefing. At the briefing, officers were informed that McElrath would likely be on site and that there was an existing warrant for his arrest. The search warrant, itself, did not mention McElrath and authorized a search of \"[t]he premises commonly referred to as 637 Florence Street...[and] any grounds, rooms, closets,\n   <strong>\n    persons\n   </strong>\n   , cell phones, vehicles, storage spaces and/or appurtenant structures in control of 637 Florence Street.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   KVET officers executed the warrant on 637 Florence around 9:30 p.m. on February 1, 2018. KVET arrived at the residence from the west with a tactical minivan, militarized SWAT vehicle, and regular police cars, and from the southeast a second tactical minivan to cover the east and back doors of the residence. In total, KVET arrived with approximately 19 heavily armed and armored officers and a K-9. Sergeant Schemenauer was driving the minivan coming from the west. Driving up to 637 Florence, Schemenauer reported over the radio that there was a vehicle backed into the driveway neighboring 637 Florence and two males either walking east toward the vehicle or speaking to the driver. When KVET stopped in front of the driveway and 637 Florence, the vehicle in the driveway-a red Dodge Magnum-fled\n   the scene and Schemenauer focused on the vehicle as it rammed his van in the getaway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meanwhile, the two males continued to walk east-away from the KVET officers-past the neighboring house, 635 Florence, and into a vacant lot east of 635 Florence. Officer Boutell, who was carrying a drawn firearm, followed the two men and repeatedly gave the verbal commands, \"Stop! Police!\" and \"Get down on the ground!\" One of the males, Smith, in Boutell's words, \"obeyed [his] commands\" and lay down in the snow. The other, later discovered to be McElrath, continued east a few more steps before also lying down. The two men were walking and not running or jogging, and Boutell considered the two men to be \"in compliance\" with his orders to stop. At that time, Boutell did not recognize McElrath as a person who was sought on any warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based upon the testimony of Officers Boutell and Cake, the Court finds as a matter of fact that Boutell did not stop McElrath in order to preserve the premises of the search or evidence found during the lawful search, or to protect anyone. Boutell was very clear in saying that the usual reason for detaining someone during a search was that \"they're possibly involved in a crime-crime is afoot.\" And, \"Oftentime, officers may detain somebody without arresting them that-they may be involved in a crime.\" And, when asked, \"So it's to help you solve a crime rather than to preserve the premises. Is that correct?\" Boutell answered: \"For this, yes, detaining that individual. I did, sir. Well, I ultimately did not detain him. That would be Investigator Cake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Cake arrived on the scene in the second minivan, southeast of 637 Florence on Woodbury, the neighboring road, and at the southern end of the vacant lot into which the males had walked. Cake saw Boutell standing over one of the males, so Cake went north along 635 Florence to assist Boutell. Officer Khillah saw one of the males, McElrath, throw two objects in the vacant lot and alerted some of his fellow officers. Boutell and Cake did not hear Khillah and were unaware, until later, that McElrath had thrown the objects. Khillah-apparently some time after the conclusion of the search of 637 Florence-found the thrown objects: a liquor bottle and a 9mm Sig Sauer handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Cake arrived to assist Boutell, the two males were complying and lying face down on the snowy ground. Boutell was with the first male, and Cake approached the second- McElrath. Cake handcuffed McElrath behind his back and then asked McElrath for his name. McElrath properly identified himself. It did not click with Cake that McElrath was the individual mentioned in the pre-raid briefing. Cake detained McElrath purely because he trusted his fellow officers-Cake did not see the men before they lay down, and Cake believed Boutell would not have detained the two males unless they had fled the scene of 637 Florence. Cake asked McElrath if he had anything illegal on him. McElrath answered affirmatively, but he did not identify the illegal item(s). In response to Cake, McElrath denied having a gun. Cake repeatedly asked McElrath for permission to search him. McElrath repeatedly declined, saying \"not if I'm not under arrest.\" Cake told McElrath that he was being \"detained\" as part of a search warrant. Cake brought McElrath back to his feet and, with McElrath still in handcuffs, brought McElrath closer to 637 Florence and the KVET vehicles. Cake told McElrath that the search warrant allowed KVET to search people associated with 637 Florence, and only then did McElrath give permission for a search of his person. Cake found a piece of foil, which police associated with narcotics, and a gun magazine on McElrath. Sometime\n   after searching McElrath, Cake learned from other officers that McElrath was the individual identified in the pre-raid briefing. Khillah also found the gun in the vacant lot and matched it with the magazine found on McElrath. Police arrested McElrath and brought him back to the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety, where they found 3-4 grams of crack cocaine on McElrath. McElrath made incriminating statements. Inside the 637 Florence residence, the 19 KVET officers did not find any drugs-only a woman and children and their personal effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The burden is on McElrath to first show that the search and seizure were warrantless-in this case, outside the bounds of the search warrant for the 637 Florence residence-and if he does so, McElrath will have made a prima facie showing of illegality. The burden then shifts to the government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the search and seizure were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

When the 19 police officers arrived, McElrath was on the driveway of 635 Florence and continued to walk away on the 635 Florence property and the vacant lot. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   does not apply, and McElrath does not fall within the ambit of the search\n   warrant. At the time Boutell and Cake detained McElrath, they lacked probable cause to seize and detain McElrath: neither Cake nor Boutell was aware McElrath threw an object; neither had seen McElrath do anything illegal; neither was aware that the walking person was McElrath. In addition, when Cake did learn that he had McElrath, Cake did not know there was an arrest warrant for McElrath. As stated by Justice Scalia, preventing flight is not a special governmental interest. The question is what Cake and Boutell knew at the time of the stop; Khillah's discovery of the gun occurred later, and those circumstances were unknown to Cake and Boutell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2) Boutell's and Cake's Stop and Search of Smith and McElrath was a seizure prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"An individual is seized when an officer 'by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained [his] liberty.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
