The Decedent's surviving child - S.T., a minor by and through his\n   <em>\n    guardian ad litem\n   </em>\n   Jessica Niblett, (\"Plaintiff\") - brings claims individually and as successor in interest to his father's estate. Plaintiff brings the instant civil rights action against the City of Ceres (\"Ceres\"), police officers Justin Canatsy (\"Canatsy\") and Jesus Salinas (\"Salinas\") (\"officer Defendants\"), and unknown law enforcement officers (\"Doe Defendants\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), alleging that the use of deadly force violated the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as alleging several California state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants moved for summary judgment on all causes of action on June 28, 2018.

The only testimony concerning the events that led to Thompson's death came from the two police officers involved in the incident, officers Canatsy and Salinas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 5, 2016, officers Canatsy and Salinas arrived at an apartment complex located at 2601 Don Pedro Road in Ceres, California sometime after 9 p.m. UF 3, 7. The apartment complex layout was rectangular with apartments on the north and south side, and a parking lot in the central area between the apartments. Ex. C; UF 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The south side apartments ran parallel to Don Pedro Road.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The entrance into the parking lot of the complex was at the southwest corner at the intersection of Don Pedro Road and El Camino Avenue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The officers parked their patrol vehicles on Don Pedro, a short distance away from the entrance of the apartment complex. UF 9. Canatsy had information that a wanted parolee-at-large, David Manchaca, might be at the apartment complex and he discussed this with Salinas before they decided to go to the subject location to look for and arrest Manchaca. UF 3-5. Manchaca was reportedly armed and dangerous, around 6 feet tall with a medium build. UF 6. Both officers personally knew that the apartment complex was known as a location for drug dealing and sales. UF 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some point after arriving, the officers covered their badges with black latex gloves. PUF 86. According to the officers' testimony, the officers did so for officer safety reasons, to prevent light from reflecting off their badges while they were waiting for Manchaca. Ex. A, Deposition of Justin Canatsy (\"Canatsy Dep.\") 30:21-31:12;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ex. B, Deposition of Jesus Salinas (\"Salinas Dep.\") 17:1-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PUF 86. After arriving, the officers spent a few minutes looking around the complex. Canatsy called his informant who had indicated that Manchaca was at the subject location, but he did not answer. Canatsy Dep. 34:18-35:2, 40:7-41:1. While the officers were standing in front of the apartment complex on the west side near El Camino Avenue, Canatsy observed a man, later identified as Thompson, walk out of the entrance way of the complex. Canatsy Dep. 40:7-41:10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers both believed that Thompson could possibly be Manchaca. UF 14-15. Salinas testified that he had never seen Manchaca so it is not clear if he would have been able to recognize him. Salinas Dep. 19:21-20:3. However, the lighting conditions at the apartment complex were dark, particularly at the entrance. UF 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Canatsy first saw Thompson, all Canatsy could see was that he was wearing dark clothing and \"just blended in with the dark.\" PUF 93. All Canatsy knew was that \"he was a male and that was pretty much it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Undisputed Facts Regarding The Shooting Of Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thompson was shot twice while running away from the officers in the parking lot of the 2601 Don Pedro apartment complex somewhere between the entrance on the southwest side, and the northeast side of the parking lot near where his body was found. UF 32, 42, 61-64; PUF 86, 105, 119, 122, 124-126. The officers were about 8 yards away from Decedent when they shot Decedent. PUF 98. The officers fired three volleys of shots during the encounter. UF 29-49. Canatsy testified he shot between 2-4 rounds and Salinas testified he shot between 5-6 rounds. PUF 98. Approximately 20 shell casings were found at the site of the shooting. PUF 127. According to the dispatch recording, approximately 14 seconds elapsed between the time that the officers reported to dispatch that they had \"one running\" from them and then reporting \"shots fired\". ECF No. 27-8, Ex. H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Canatsy believes he reported \"shots fired\" after the third volley. Canatsy Dep. 80:8-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At no point during the series of events did Thompson shoot at the officers or verbally threaten them. PUF 100; Canatsy Dep. 72:18-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Salinas Dep. 38:25-40:25. Neither officer gave any warning before shooting the Decedent in any of the three volleys of shots. PUF 99, 110. In none of the volleys was there a pause between the shots. Canatsy Dep. 71:11-13; Salinas Dep. 30:21-22. Both the officers had cover during the second and third volley of shots. Canatsy Dep. 73:6-14; Salinas Dep. 31:15-21. No gun was found on Decedent, but a butane hand torch was found near Decedent's body. PUF 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Baik, the Sheriff's coroner, conducted the post-mortem examination of Thompson and recovered two bullets from Thompson's body. UF 59, 62. It is undisputed that Thompson was shot in the back. PUF 122, 124, 125. Both bullet trajectories go from right to left, back to front and slightly upward. PUF 122. Further, based on Dr. Baik's deposition testimony, the parties agree that based on the upward slant of the bullet trajectories, Thompson was likely in a bent position, running away when he was shot. UF 126; ECF No. 39 at 4 (Dr. Baik concluded \"that Thompson was bending over when the bullets struck him in the back as he ran.\"). While Dr. Baik was not able to conclude the sequence of the two bullets, he did determine that the trajectory of one of the bullets left Thompson \"no chance\" of survival because it struck Thompson's heart and lung and that the other bullet was fatal without immediate surgery. UF 61, 65-66; PUF 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The autopsy indicated that Thompson had methamphetamine in his blood at the time of the incident. UF 69.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Account Of The Shooting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After initially walking out of the entry way of the parking lot, Thompson turned around and walked back in to the apartment complex and the officers began to follow him. UF 13, 17-18. The officers testified that when they first observed Thompson near the entrance of the parking lot, Canatsy gave him the command \"hey, police, come here\" to which Decedent replied \"what's up guys.\" UF 17, PUF 94. Thompson turned and walked back into the apartment complex even after they identified themselves as police officers. UF 13, 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both officers testified that Thompson walked away from them with his hands near his waistband or pocket while looking back towards the officers. UF 17-18. According to the officers, Thompson then suddenly turned and faced the officers but continued to back away from them deeper\n   into the parking lot with his hands either inside his pockets or inside his waistband. UF 19-23. Plaintiff disputes what the officers were able to see as to where Thompson's hands were, citing the fact that both officers had stated how dark the lighting was near and in the complex.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thompson then started to run away from the officers and Salinas radioed dispatch that Thompson was running from them. UF 24. Then Thompson stopped and turned about to face Canatsy and drew an object from his pocket or waistband, which both officers believed resembled a black handgun, and pointed the object in the direction of the officers. UF 25-28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers then drew their firearms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the officers there were three volleys of shots and approximately 7-10 rounds were fired between the two of them in the space between of the southwestern entrance of the parking lot to the northeastern end of the apartment complex. UF 29-49; PUF 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     First Volley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The officers testified that they first fired because they believed Thompson was pointing a black gun-like object at them while running away from them in a northeastern direction and then turning to face them at a 45-degree angle. UF 29-32; Canatsy Dep. 50:15-52:12. Neither officer had the opportunity to warn Thompson before firing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following this volley, apparently Thompson then continued to flee northeast further into the parking lot. UF 32; Canatsy Dep. 57:24-58:4. Canatsy was not sure if any of the shots from the first volley struck Thompson. UF 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Second Volley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The officers then advanced further into the parking lot, pursuing Thompson, and took cover behind some of the vehicles parked on opposite sides of the parking lot. UF 33-35; Canatsy Dep. 61:4-16. As Thompson was fleeing northeast, he continued to turn his upper body at a 45-degree angle towards Salinas and pointed the same black gun-like object at him and both officers fired a second volley toward Thompson. UF 38-40. The second volley was fired while Thompson continued running away and was bent over at the waist. UF 42. Canatsy observed that Thompson had fallen on the ground after the second volley and before the third volley. UF 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Third Volley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both officers had taken cover by the time they fired the third volley of shots. Canatsy Dep. 69:7-19, 73:6-74:5; Salinas Dep. 35:10-22; 38:2-13. Canatsy knew that Salinas was behind cover at the time he shot his third volley. PUF 117. According to the officers' testimony, as Thompson was on the ground, Salinas observed him search the ground with his right hand and then he sat up and pointed the object at Salinas again. UF 47; Canatsy Dep. 72:11-15; Salinas Dep. 40:1-14. Salinas fired in response as did Canatsy, who also perceived the threat to Salinas. UF 47-48. After Thompson laid back down, the officers stopped shooting. Canatsy Dep. 72:11-15; Salinas Dep. 40:1-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the shooting, the object the officers testified that they believed was a handgun was identified as a butane hand torch.

Moreover,\n   both officers testified that it was dark at the entrance of the apartment building and therefore it is unclear to what extent they could have recognized Manchaca or anyone for that matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the first\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor (the severity of the crime at issue) weighs in Decedent's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The third Graham factor, whether the subject was actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight, is less clearly in Decedent's favor. While Decedent was running away from the officers when he was shot, it is not clear whether Plaintiff was aware Canatsy and Salinas were police officers. The officers testified that they identified themselves as police officers but were otherwise not clear about what they said to Decedent besides \"hey, come here\" before the chase and shooting ensued. Additionally, Plaintiff points to the fact that the officers' testified that Plaintiff may have responded by stating \"what's up guys\" indicating he did not know they were police officers. The brief amount of time that elapsed between when the officers confronted Thompson face-to-face and when he began running, coupled with the poor lighting and the fact that the officers may have had their badges covered weigh in favor of the possibility that Thompson may not have known he was being pursued by police. Even if Thompson was aware that he was being pursued by officers and was running from them, the Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p9\">\n    471 U.S. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p9\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (use of deadly force to prevent escape of robbery suspect was unreasonable). Here, Thompson was not a suspected felon making the case stronger for the unreasonableness of using deadly force to stop his escape. \"Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, the issue here rests almost entirely on the second, and most important,\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor - whether the Decedent posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers sufficient to justify the use of deadly force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mattos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848041\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/433/#p441\">\n    661 F.3d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the second\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor is the most important). Defendants argue that Canatsy and Salinas drew their weapons when they saw Thompson, while facing them, point an object, which they perceived to be a hand gun, in the officers' direction before beginning to run from the officers. This prompted officer Defendants' first volley of shots. According to the officers, they continued to pursue Thompson as he ran northeast in the parking lot, still turning his body at a 45-degree angle toward Salinas and pointing the object towards him. Salinas believed that Thompson was shooting at him and both officers perceived a threat and fired a second volley of shots. At this point, the officers testified that Thompson fell to the ground and was lying on his left-side or his back and reaching around with his right hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Apparently fearful that\n   Thompson was reaching for his gun while on the ground, Salinas and Canatsy fired a third volley. Both officers had cover at the time they shot the second and third volleys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff counters that there is significant evidence that Decedent did not pose a threat at the time they fired at him. Plaintiff states that forensic evidence indicates that Decedent was running away from the officers and not presenting a threat to the officers at the time they shot at him. It is undisputed that Decedent was shot in the back twice while hunched over and running away. Additionally, Thompson was unarmed at the time he was killed. However, Defendants argue this is not the entire picture because Decedent was turned at a 45-degree angle, looking over his left shoulder and pointing a gun-like object with his right hand in the direction of the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This critical dispute - whether the Decedent actually was turned and pointing an object at the officers or whether he was only running away hunched over - is sufficient to deny summary judgment.
