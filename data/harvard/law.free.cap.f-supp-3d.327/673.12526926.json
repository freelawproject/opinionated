Following dismissal of the majority of Kortright's contract and tort claims, Kortright now moves to amend to add an additional breach of contract claim based on new information allegedly unearthed at the eleventh hour during discovery. Kortright also moves to strike Investcorp's jury demand based on jury waiver provisions contained in the applicable contracts between the parties. Finally, each side moves for sanctions against the other. For the reasons that follow, Kortright's motion to amend is denied, Kortright's motion to strike Investcorp's jury demand is granted, and both motions for sanctions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are more fully detailed in the Opinion &amp; Order granting in part and denying in part Investcorp's motion to dismiss, familiarity with which is presumed.\n   <em>\n    Kortright Capital Partners LP v.

Nonetheless, a brief recapitulation of the relevant background is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2013, Kortright and Investcorp entered into a Project Agreement, under which Investcorp promised to invest $50 million of proprietary capital\n   and $40 million of its clients' capital in Kortright funds and market those funds to new investors in exchange for certain economic benefits it would receive as a seed investor. In January 2015, Plaintiffs began discussions with Man Group plc (\"Man Group\")-an asset management company and competitor of Investcorp's-about moving the Kortright funds into Man Group's organization or having Taylor and Popplewell join Man Group as employees while winding down the Kortright fund. In April 2016, Investcorp expressed its preference for moving the Kortright funds into Man Group (as opposed to winding down the funds) and proposed that it leave its clients' investment with Kortright while withdrawing its proprietary investment. Kortright sent Investcorp an email summarizing the contours of this discussion; namely, that Kortright's funds would be moved to Man Group, that Investcorp would maintain a certain level of investment for six quarters to maintain revenue sharing benefits, and that Investcorp would immediately redeem its proprietary investment while leaving its clients' capital invested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Contemplating Investcorp's participation, Kortright and Man Group entered into the Man Transaction Agreement on June 16, 2016, the closing of which was expressly conditioned on Kortright maintaining a certain quantum of Investcorp capital. At the same time, Kortright and Investcorp entered into a Termination Agreement, which ended their relationship under the Project Agreement. Kortright and Investcorp also entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement (\"RSA\"), under which Investcorp would continue to share revenue, but which included a termination provision triggered if Investcorp redeemed capital exceeding a certain amount. In relevant part, \u00a7 5.2 of the RSA also provided that \"[t]his Agreement is conditional on the occurrence\" of the closing of the Man Transaction and that if the Man Transaction did not close \"by September 30, 2016, this Agreement shall not come into effect and shall be null and void ....\" (Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend the Complaint and for Sanctions, ECF No. 67 (\"Motion to Amend\"), Ex. 1 (\"Proposed Amended Complaint\"), Ex. 2 (\"RSA\") \u00a7 5.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 17, 2016, Kortright informed its investors by letter of the Man Transaction and sought their consent to transfer their investments to Man Group. The letter also indicated that Investcorp planned to continue its partnership with Kortright. Investcorp returned its consent forms as an investor of Kortright's. But shortly thereafter, Investcorp revoked its consent, claiming that it was required to obtain its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   clients' consent, and because they did not consent, Investcorp was required to redeem its clients' investment. Consequently, because a closing condition for the Man Transaction was not satisfied, Man Group was relieved of its obligation to close the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kortright brought various claims for negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and promissory estoppel. Following Investcorp's motion to dismiss, this Court pruned Kortright's claims, leaving only the negligent misrepresentation claims arising from Investcorp's April 2016 promises to leave its clients' capital invested in Kortright while omitting the need for client consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After fact discovery closed, Kortright filed a pre-motion letter seeking leave to file the instant motions. In particular, Kortright seeks to amend its complaint to add a claim for breach of the RSA based on information unearthed near the close of fact discovery-namely, that Investcorp's stated rationale for revoking its consent\n   (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , because Investcorp needed but could not obtain its clients' consent) was fabricated. According to Kortright, Investcorp did not need its clients' consent at all, and its executives ultimately made the decision to redeem its clients' capital. In essence, Kortright claims that it did not originally assert a claim for a breach of the RSA because it believed-erroneously-that the failure of a condition precedent in the RSA (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the closing of the Man Transaction) was caused by Investcorp's client and not Investcorp itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Amend\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure exhorts courts to \"freely give leave when justice so requires,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), it is well-settled that a court has discretion to deny leave to amend even under this liberal standard if, for example, the amendment would be futile, if the movant acted with undue delay, bad faith, or a dilatory motive, or if granting leave would result in prejudice to the opposing party.\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

The thrust of Investcorp's position is that \u00a7 5.2 means precisely what it says, and because the Man Transaction did not close before September 30, 2016, the RSA never came into effect such that it could form the foundation of a breach of contract claim. Indeed, irrespective of the competing interpretations proffered by the parties, the plain language of \u00a7 5.2 unambiguously conditions the effectiveness and validity of the RSA on the Man Transaction closing before September 30, 2016-the non-occurrence of which neither party disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seiden Assocs., Inc. v.

Kortright consistently maintains that the RSA obliges Investcorp to maintain its clients' capital\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   the closing of the Man Transaction-it is the alleged breach of this contractual promise that underpins its putative claim for breach of the RSA. But if \u00a7 5.2 operated as a condition precedent to performance, then Investcorp's performance (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its obligation to leave client capital invested through closing) would only arise if the Man Transaction closed, which itself would\n   only occur if Investcorp left its clients' capital invested until the Man Transaction closed.

This Court disagrees. Kortright points out that the RSA's introductory and concluding clauses contain language by the parties \"intending to be legally bound,\" and that \u00a7 5.7 of the RSA provides that it \"shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and legal representatives.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA at 1, 13 ; RSA \u00a7 5.7.) But such language does not necessarily reveal an intent to be bound\n   <em>\n    unconditionally\n   </em>\n   -rather, considered as a whole, the RSA conditions its effectiveness and binding nature on the occurrence of the condition specified in \u00a7 5.2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gessin Elec.

First, while Kortright infers from extrinsic evidence that Investcorp intended the RSA to be a valid and binding contract at the time of execution, courts do not consider parol evidence\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   extrinsic evidence of the parties' intentions where-as here-the relevant contractual provision is unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JA Apparel Corp. v.

Likewise, Kortright's attempts to inject ambiguity into whether \u00a7 5.2 creates a condition precedent to formation or a condition precedent to performance contravene judicial reluctance to consider extrinsic evidence \"to create an ambiguity in a written agreement which is complete and clear and unambiguous on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Reiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061726\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/195/\">\n    738 N.Y.S.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061726\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/195/\">\n    764 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   961 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kass v.

Second, Kortright posits that interpreting \u00a7 5.2 to be a condition precedent to formation is not commercially reasonable because no party would receive the benefit of the bargain if Investcorp withdrew its clients' capital before closing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Homeward Res., Inc. v.

But the fact is that the non-occurrence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   condition precedent to formation can be said to deprive the contracting parties of the benefit of their bargain. Standing alone, this rationale cannot override the plain and unambiguous language to which the parties agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Applicability of the Prevention Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Regardless of whether \u00a7 5.2 is a condition precedent to performance or formation, Kortright also urges application of the prevention rule, under which a party generally may not take advantage of the non-occurrence of a condition precedent if it has frustrated or prevented the occurrence of the condition.\n   <em>\n    Kooleraire Serv. &amp; Installation Corp. v.

Thus, applying the rule to the paradigm in which a party seeks to avoid performing under an existing contract by preventing the occurrence of a condition precedent to its performance is logical and accords with the intent of the contracting parties. To the contrary, an implied contractual obligation not to frustrate the occurrence of a condition precedent to contract formation would either be at odds with the intent of the parties if it arises before the contract even comes into existence, or moot if it arises after the contract has been formed. Accordingly, this Court declines to apply the prevention rule to excuse the non-occurrence of \u00a7 5.2. Because this Court concludes that \u00a7 5.2 creates a condition precedent to the validity and enforceability of the RSA that did not occur, Kortright's motion to amend is denied as futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Strike Investcorp's Jury Demand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Kortright also seeks to strike the jury demand asserted in Investcorp's answer on the basis that it is barred by the jury waiver provisions in the relevant agreements that Kortright and Investcorp signed. Resolving this motion requires an analysis of whether the jury waiver provisions are enforceable, and if so, whether the remaining claims in this case fall within the ambit of the jury waiver clauses. Before addressing the merits of the motion, however, this Court discusses the applicable law. Because the enforceability of a jury waiver provision-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the right to a jury trial has been waived-is a procedural issue, a federal court sitting in diversity generally applies federal law in determining whether the right has been waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch &amp; Co v.

Kortright argues that this claim falls within the broad scope of the jury waiver provisions, relying on cases that interpret jury trial waivers of claims \"relating to\" a contract as encompassing related tort claims arising from the parties' contractual relationship. Investcorp counters that the negligent misrepresentation claim does not strictly relate to the day-to-day operation and management of the Kortright fund and that a negligent misrepresentation claim arising out of discussions had in April 2016 regarding a prospective business transaction with a third party could not have been contemplated by the parties when negotiating the 2013 Project Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   While mindful of its obligation to construe jury waiver provisions narrowly, this Court finds Investcorp's interpretation to be overly restrictive and belied by the plain language of the provisions.

While Kortright contends that Investcorp has made repeated representations that turned out to be false, it presents little evidence-much less clear and convincing evidence-from which this Court may infer that Investcorp or its counsel knowingly made those misrepresentations as part of a scheme to tamper with the fair adjudication of this action. Nor has Kortright made a clear and particularized showing of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCune v. Rugged Entm't, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201189390\">\n    2010 WL 1189390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2010) (\"[T]he bad faith standard is not easily satisfied and sanctions are warranted only in extreme cases.\"). It has not, for example, come forth with \"clear\n   and convincing evidence that [Investcorp's] conduct was not merely negligent but was undertaken with\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Indeed, Investcorp's counsel's July 2017 disclosure that none of Investcorp's clients were involved with its decision to redeem client capital-months before Kortright claims it unearthed the truth-undercuts an inference of bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Peter M. Wade in Support of Defendant Investcorp's Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions to Amend the Complaint and to Strike Investcorp's Demand for Trial by Jury, ECF No. 72, Ex. F.) Thus, in this Court's view and based on the record presented, sanctions against Investcorp are unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Investcorp's Request for Sanctions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Not to be outdone, Investcorp counters in its opposition brief that if sanctions should be imposed on anyone, it should be Kortright for its \"many frivolous and deceitful arguments ... in support of\" baseless claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions to Amend the Complaint and to Strike Investcorp's Demand for Trial by Jury, ECF No. 71, at *18.) While somewhat cryptic, Investcorp appears to premise its request on Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, Rule 11 requires that a sanctions motion \"be made separately from any other motion and ... describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b).\" Fed. R. Civ.

In particular, courts in this Circuit have rejected requests for Rule 11 sanctions made in opposition briefs as procedurally defective.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Bridge Const.

On the whole, Kortright advanced colorable arguments relating to the validity and effectiveness of the RSA. That they were ultimately unsuccessful does not render them objectively unreasonable or clearly frivolous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   Investcorp's request for sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Kortright's motion to amend is denied, and its motion to strike Investcorp's jury demand is granted. Kortright and Investcorp's requests for sanctions are denied.
