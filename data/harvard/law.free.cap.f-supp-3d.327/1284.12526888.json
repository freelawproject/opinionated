Cynthia Bashant, United States District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns an alleged practice in which U.S Customs and Border Protection\n   (\"CBP\") officials at ports of entry (\"POE\") along the U.S.-Mexico border deny asylum seekers access to the U.S. asylum process. The Defendants in this case are Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Kevin K. McAleenan, Acting Commissioner of CBP; and Defendant Todd C. Owen, the Executive Assistant Commissioner of the Office of Field Operations for CBP. Each Defendant has a role in the direction and oversight of CBP and each is sued in his or her official capacity. Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 135.) Plaintiffs oppose (ECF No. 143) and Defendants have replied in support (ECF No. 145). For the reasons herein, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Synopsis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plaintiffs are six individuals, Plaintiffs Abigail Doe, Beatrice Doe, Carolina Doe, Dinora Doe, Ingrid Doe, and Jose Doe (collectively, the \"Individual Plaintiffs\"), and organizational Plaintiff Al Otro Lado, Inc. (\"Al Otro Lado\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They allege that CBP officials have \"systematically violated U.S. law and binding international human rights law by refusing to allow individuals...who present themselves at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border and assert their intention to apply for asylum or a fear of returning to their home countries-to seek protection in the United States.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-6, 37.) Plaintiffs allege that \"[b]y refusing to follow the law, Defendants are engaged in an officially sanctioned policy or practice[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs point to several reports from non-governmental organizations working in the U.S.-Mexico border region and Al Otro Lado's firsthand account, which describe instances in which CBP officials denied asylum seekers who presented themselves at POEs along the border access to the U.S. asylum process between December 2015 and June 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 96-103.) Plaintiffs allege that CBP officials have carried out this practice through misrepresentations, threats and intimidation, verbal and physical abuse, and coercion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-103.) For example, CBP officials are alleged to turn away asylum seekers by falsely informing them that the U.S. is no longer providing asylum, that President Trump signed a new law ending asylum, that a law providing asylum to Central Americans ended, that Mexican citizens are not eligible for asylum, and that the U.S. is no longer accepting mothers with children for asylum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) CBP officials are alleged to intimidate asylum seekers by threatening to take away their children if they do not renounce a claim for asylum and to deport the asylum seekers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) CBP officials are also alleged to force asylum seekers to sign forms in English, without translation, in which the asylum seekers recant their fears of persecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) CBP officials are further alleged to instruct the asylum seekers to recant their fears of persecution while being recorded on video. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) The Court briefly sets forth the Individual Plaintiffs' and Al Otro Lado's experiences of these alleged practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Individual Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs Abigail Doe (\"A.D.\"), Beatrice Doe (\"B.D.\"), and Carolina Doe (\"C.D.\") are natives and citizens of Mexico, each of whom fled with their families to Tijuana, Mexico, where they attempted to access the U.S. asylum process. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) Plaintiff A.D. sought to flee Mexico in May 2017 after her husband disappeared at the hands of a Mexican drug cartel. A cartel member threatened her with death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 39-40.) She alleges that CBP officials at the San Ysidro POE coerced her into signing a form which falsely stated that she did not have a fear of returning to Mexico and withdrew her application for admission to the U.S., and forced her and her children to return to Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.) Plaintiff B.D. sought to flee Mexico in May 2017 with her nephew and three children after the Zetas, a Mexican drug cartel in southern Mexico, targeted her nephew, and after she suffered severe domestic violence from her husband. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 46-47.) She presented herself at the Otay Mesa POE and twice at the San Ysidro POE, where CBP officials coerced her into signing a form in which she stated that she and her children have no fear of returning to Mexico and withdrew her application for admission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-54.) Plaintiff C.D. sought to flee Mexico in May 2017 with her three children after a drug cartel kidnapped and dismembered her brother-in-law and subsequently targeted her family with death and severe harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 55-56.) She alleges that CBP officials coerced her into recanting her fear on video and into signing a form withdrawing her application for admission to the U.S. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs Dinora Doe (\"D.D.\"), Ingrid Doe (\"I.D.\"), and Jose Doe (\"J.D.\") are natives and citizens of Honduras. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) Plaintiff D.D. alleges that MS-13 gang members threatened to kill her and her 17-year old daughter if they did not leave their home, and subsequently repeatedly raped her and her daughter over a three-day period. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 61-62.) D.D and her daughter fled to Mexico where MS-13 gang members threatened them again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) On three occasions in August 2016, D.D. and her daughter sought asylum in the United States at the Otay Mesa POE, but CBP officials told her that \"there was no asylum in the United States,\" including specifically \"for Central Americans,\" and that she \"would be handed over to Mexican authorities and deported to Honduras.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-69.) Plaintiff I.D. alleges that 18th Street gang members in Honduras murdered her mother and three siblings and that the gang threatened her with death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 71.) She also alleges that her partner in Honduras severely abused her and her three children for several years, and regularly raped her, including in front of her children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 72.) In June 2017, I.D. and her children fled to Tijuana and sought asylum at the Otay Mesa and the San Ysidro POEs, where CBP officers told them that they could not seek asylum in the U.S. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-77.) Plaintiff J.D. alleges that 18th Street gang members murdered several of his family members in Honduras. He further alleges that gang members attacked him and threatened to kidnap and harm his two daughters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 78- 79.) J.D. fled Honduras in June 2017 and sought asylum at the Laredo, Texas POE, but CBP officers told him he could not get asylum in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80- 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the time the Complaint was filed, the Individual Plaintiffs alleged that they \"would like to present themselves again to\n   seek asylum, but based on their experience and the experience of others with CBP's practice at POEs, [they] understand that they would likely be turned away again[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 53, 59, 68, 76, 81.) They also allege that they are not alone. Rather, CBP officials are alleged to have a \"prevalent and persistent\" illegal practice since summer 2016 of denying other asylum seekers who present themselves at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border access to the U.S. asylum system. Accordingly, the Individual Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of individuals with similar claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 131-138 (class allegations).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Al Otro Lado\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Al Otro Lado is a non-profit California legal services organization established in 2014, which provides services to indigent deportees, migrants, refugees, and their families. (Compl. \u00b6 12; Decl. of Erika Pinheiro, ECF No. 90-1 (\"Pinheiro Decl.\") \u00b6 2.) Al Otro Lado's mission is to coordinate and to provide screening and legal representation for individuals in asylum and other immigration proceedings, seek redress for civil rights violations, and provide assistance with other legal and social services. (Compl. \u00b6 12; Pinheiro Decl. \u00b6 2.) Since December 2015, its representatives have accompanied asylum seekers to the San Ysidro POE and witnessed the alleged conduct of CBP officials. (Compl. \u00b6 101.) In response to the alleged practices of CBP officials, Al Otro Lado has diverted significant time and resources from its L.A. operations and several of its non-refugee programs to send representatives to Tijuana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16-17; Pinheiro Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7.) Al Otro Lado has altered its previous \"large-scale, mass-advisal legal clinics\" in Tijuana that provided a general overview on asylum laws and procedures to provide individualized assistance and direct representation of asylum seekers, which has required Al Otro Lado to recruit and train more attorneys. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Pinheiro Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) Al Otro Lado expends significant time and resources to provide individual screenings and in-depth trainings to educate asylum seekers about CBP's conduct and challenge the alleged practices.

Its core mission is,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to coordinate and provide screening, advocacy, and legal representation for individuals in asylum and other immigration proceedings. (Compl. \u00b6 12.) As a result of CBP officers' conduct at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border since 2016, Al Otro Lado alleges that it has diverted significant time and resources from its L.A. operations and its non-refugee programs to send representatives to Tijuana to provide individualized assistance and coordination of legal and social services, including individual screenings and in-depth trainings to educate asylum seekers about CBP's alleged conduct of denying the most basic form of access to the asylum process.

The Individual Plaintiffs' Other Claims for Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the Individual Plaintiffs, Defendants' mootness challenge is narrow.

But the Individual Plaintiffs request other forms of relief, including: (1) \"relief prohibiting Defendants\" and their agents \"from engaging in the unlawful policies, practices, acts and/or omissions...at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border\" and (2) \"relief requiring Defendants to implement procedures to provide effective oversight and accountability in the inspection and processing of individuals who present themselves at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border and indicate an intention to apply for asylum or assert a fear of persecution in their home countries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.)

The \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" mootness exception has a particular application in the class action context when the defendant's actions after the filing of the complaint moot the proposed class representative's individual claims. Courts are sensitive to a defendant's tactics of \"picking off lead plaintiffs\" so as \"to avoid a class action,\" even when a proposed class representative's \"claims are not 'inherently transitory as a result of being time sensitive.\"\n   <em>\n    Pitts\n   </em>\n   , 653 F.3d at 1091 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Weiss v.

(ECF No. 135-1 at 9; ECF No. 145 at 4.) However, Plaintiffs seek only declaratory and injunctive relief. The fact that Defendants have provided one form of the injunctive relief solely to the \"class representatives\" (ECF No. 67-3 Ex. B) after the filing of this case is no less a potential \"buy-off\" strategy that effectively renders transitory the claims they seek to assert on behalf of a putative class. The government could simply render moot any class action Section 706(1) claims concerning the conduct at issue in this case by affording relief to any individual plaintiffs who seek to challenge such conduct as soon as the case is filed and long before a court could reasonably be expected to rule on a motion for class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haro v.

(ECF No. 67-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-7.)

Defendants, however, suggest that such claims are not cognizable insofar as they concern a putative class of other asylum seekers who have experienced the alleged pattern of denials.

This assertion is supported by the Complaint, which does not facially plead independent Section 706(1) claims for Defendants' alleged practice of denying asylum seekers who present themselves at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border access to the asylum process. Instead of raising an independent pattern or practice claim, the Section 706(1) claims incorporate the practice allegations as part of Plaintiffs' request for relief from \"Defendants' repeated and pervasive failure to act.\" (Compl. \u00b6 157.)

Central to this argument is Defendants' contention that \"Plaintiffs have not alleged that all CBP officers at [POEs] always deny asylum seekers access to the asylum process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) Like Defendants' misguided attack on the Individual Plaintiffs' Article III standing based on the parties' agreement about what the INA requires, Defendants' targeting of the pattern allegations as \"too speculative\" to establish a \"live case or controversy\" misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants readily concede that the Complaint identifies incidents in which asylum seekers who presented themselves at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border have been denied access to the asylum process. (ECF No. 135-1 at 24.) Even in the absence of Defendants' concession, the Complaint incorporates numerous reports from non-governmental organizations operating in the U.S.-Mexico border region, which document hundreds of examples of asylum seekers who CBP officials denied access to the U.S. asylum process. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 96-102.) While Defendants may seek to minimize those allegations by selectively casting doubt on the reliability of those portions of the reports that reflect negatively on CBP and by characterizing the reports as showing only \"an alleged 1.6% denial rate,\" (ECF No. 135-1 at 14), the volume of denials is irrelevant to whether the Complaint concretely alleges that other individuals have been subjected to the same alleged failures to act by CBP officials. The Complaint plainly alleges such failures, which the Court is required to take as true at this stage. Because the Individual Plaintiffs have standing in their own right to seek Section 706(1) relief to compel the Defendants to inspect and process them for admission, they may request that relief for a putative class of others asylum seekers who have allegedly experienced the same failures to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Shea v.

As the Court has discussed, all Plaintiffs argue that they only press Section 706(1) claims to compel agency action unlawfully withheld. (ECF No. 143 at 19.) The Court will therefore consider these Plaintiffs' coercion allegations within the Section 706(1) framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiffs A.D., B.D., and C.D. each allege that on of one of the occasions they sought asylum, CBP officials coerced them to into signing documents which stated that they lacked a fear of persecution. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 50-51, 56-58.) A.D. and C.D. further allege that CBP officials forced them to recant their fears in video recorded statements.

They further refer to their allegations regarding CBP's alleged coercion of certain Individual Plaintiffs in discussing their Section 706(1) claims. (ECF No. 143 at 20.)

The Complaint Fails to State a Section 706(2) Claim Regarding Defendants' Alleged Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Complaint alleges that CBP officials have systematically prevented asylum seekers arriving at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border from accessing the U.S. asylum process since summer 2016. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, 37.) Plaintiffs allege that this conduct has been documented \"in hundreds of cases\" at POEs along the border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) The bulk of Defendants' motion to dismiss concerns whether Plaintiffs have stated a Section 706(2) claim regarding an alleged \"policy\" of the Defendants to deny asylum seekers who present themselves at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border access to the asylum process. (ECF No. 135-1 at 11-20.) Defendants argue that \"[w]hile the Complaint does not expressly seek judicial review of a final agency action, it alleges that CBP has adopted an 'officially sanctioned policy'[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 154).) Defendants contend that \"to the extent the Court construes those references as a request for judicial review of an alleged unlawful policy under the APA\" pursuant to Section 706(2), the Court should dismiss that request because: (1) Plaintiffs fail to identify an agency action and, even if Plaintiffs have done so, (2) the Complaints fails to show a final agency action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that \"Defendants' critique is misplaced\" because \"the review of 'final agency action'...under [ ] \u00a7 706(2) is distinct from the analysis for APA claims to compel agency action under \u00a7 706(1), and Plaintiffs brought the latter APA claim.\" (ECF No. 143 at 19.) Normally, the Court would construe Plaintiffs' response as a concession that they do not press a Section 706(2) claim and would not address the issue further. However, two points convince the Court that further analysis warranted. For one, the Complaint expressly invokes Section 706(2) as a basis for judicial review of Defendants' alleged conduct. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 151-164.) Plaintiffs' requested injunctive relief in turn includes \"prohibiting Defendants...from engaging in the unlawful policies...described herein at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.) Therefore, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the Complaint appears to include a Section 706(2) claim.

Plaintiffs rely on those allegations to defend the existence of an alleged policy and argue that they \"have pled sufficient facts to show a widespread pattern or practice of denial of access to the asylum process[.]\" (ECF No. 143 at 21.) The Court, however, is not convinced that the Complaint's disparate \"examples\"-in Plaintiffs' words-of conduct by CBP officials supports the inference that there is an overarching policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearl River Union Free Sch.

As an initial matter, while the Complaint contains allegations about the tactics employed by various CBP officials (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-103), there are no allegations connecting any of that conduct with an unwritten policy created by the Defendants. In fact, Plaintiffs do not even allege that the Defendants were involved in the development of any policy in this case.\n   <em>\n    Aracely, R\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526041\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/110/#p137\">\n    319 F.Supp.3d at 123-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203243977\">\n    2018 WL 3243977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The Complaint's pattern allegations also fail to show a categorical unwritten policy of the type Plaintiffs suggest. Even accepting the Complaint's references to documented instances of asylum seekers at POEs along the U.S.-Mexico border who were denied\n   access to the asylum process, the Complaint expressly incorporates reports which show that many more asylum seekers were not denied access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the Complaint cites a 2017 report from Human Rights First, which reports at least 125 occasions between December 2016 and March 2017 in which applicants for admission were denied access. (Compl. \u00b6 38 n.27.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, the report also states that \"CBP agents referred some 8,000 asylum seekers at [POEs]\" along the U.S-Mexico border to credible fear interviews during the same period.\n   <em>\n    See Crossing the Line\n   </em>\n   , at 1.

However, the Complaint does not incorporate any particular portion of the testimony of John Wagner, Deputy Executive Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Field Operations of CBP, and thus it is not clear that this information is properly reviewable at the motion to dismiss stage. Even if it were, the Court does not find the testimony sufficient to show the existence of the unwritten policy Plaintiffs allege. Insofar as CBP is \"working with Mexico to develop methods to control the flow of migrants entering U.S. [POEs] at any given time\" (ECF No. 135-1 at 16), that information does not show the consummation of an agency decision-making process, let alone one that applies to asylum seekers in the manner Plaintiffs allege. As for the \"contingency plans\" for a future \"surge of migrants,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), it is unclear how a such a plan has any application in this case because the Complaint does not allege that any Plaintiff was turned away by CBP officials as part of a policy concerning migrant \"surges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In the absence of allegations showing a final agency order, rule, regulation, policy, or plan to deny asylum seekers who present themselves at POEs along the U.S-Mexico border-or allegations from which the Court could infer that one exists-the Complaint fails to plead that Defendants have a policy this Court can \"hold unlawful and set aside.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).
