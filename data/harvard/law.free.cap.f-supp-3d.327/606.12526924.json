PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 5, 2018, a nine-person jury found Defendants liable on Plaintiffs' trademark infringement, copyright infringement, and breach of contract claims and awarded Plaintiffs $34.2 million in statutory damages. In the wake of that verdict, the parties filed a plethora of motions. Defendants move for: (1) renewed judgment as a matter of law, (2) a new trial, (3) remittitur, and (4) a stay of enforcement\n   of any judgment pending appeal. Plaintiffs move for: (1) entry of a partial final judgment, (2) prejudgment interest, (3) a permanent injunction, (4) disposition of infringing materials, and (5) attorneys' fees and costs. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motions are denied. Plaintiffs' motion for partial final judgment is denied as moot. Plaintiffs' motion for prejudgment interest is denied. Plaintiffs' motions for a permanent injunction, disposition of infringing materials, and attorneys' fees and costs are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The April 2018 verdict was the d\u00e9nouement of a decade of litigation between the parties. Plaintiffs are a consortium of textbook publishers: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Cengage Learning, Pearson Education, and McGraw-Hill Global Education. Defendants are used book sellers owned and operated by Philip Smyres. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 765:3-767:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2007, Plaintiffs sued Defendants for copyright infringement and trademark infringement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint, No. 13-cv-816 (\"BDB I\"), ECF No. 263 (\"BDB I SAC\"), \u00b6 3.) The parties settled that action with an agreement that Defendants would cease importing and selling counterfeit books. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX127 (\"Settlement Agreement\").) In 2011, Plaintiffs discovered that Defendants were selling counterfeit books once again. (BDB I SAC, \u00b6 4.) This time, settlement negotiations failed, and Defendants filed a preemptive federal action against Plaintiffs in the Southern District of Ohio seeking a declaration that Defendants were not violating Plaintiffs' rights under the Copyright Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books, LLC v. Cengage Learning, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-1165 (S.D. Ohio) (the \"Ohio Action\"). Plaintiffs responded by filing the first action in this proceeding (\"\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books I\n   </em>\n   \"), asserting trademark infringement, copyright infringement, breach of the Settlement Agreement, and related claims. In 2013, the Ohio Action was transferred to this Court, and the parties stipulated to dismiss it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, No. 13-cv-6413, ECF No. 89.) In 2016, Plaintiffs filed\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books II\n   </em>\n   , which identified additional works that Plaintiffs claimed Defendants infringed during the pendency of\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books I\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, No. 16-cv-7123 (\"BDB II\"), ECF No. 30.) This Court consolidated both cases for trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, BDB II, ECF No. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scorched-earth litigation ensued, including numerous discovery motions, followed by appeals of determinations made by the Magistrate Judge, and multiple motions for summary judgment (followed by motions for reconsideration). As the trial date loomed, the parties filed nearly twenty motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   and five\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions. The docket sheet for each case approaches 500 entries. And on the eve of trial, Plaintiffs discovered that Defendants had concealed certain business entities and profit distributions, prompting further litigation over sanctions and adverse inference instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Trial began on March 19, 2018 and spanned three weeks. The parties presented hundreds of textbooks to the jury. Plaintiffs argued that this was \"a case about a bookseller swarming in counterfeits ... who was caught, sued, and settled, [but] ignored the settlement and ignored the law.\" (Trial Tr. 40:11:14.) They averred that Defendants \"knowingly purchased counterfeits from known counterfeit suppliers,\" \"failed to maintain the kinds of records that would allow anybody to track ... what they did,\" and \"destroy[ed] evidence when they thought that it might be useful.\" (Trial Tr. 40:16-24.) Plaintiffs offered evidence that Smyres knew or should have known that he was\n   importing and selling counterfeits, but continued to do so with reckless abandon. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 891:23-892:2.) Plaintiffs' financial expert testified that from 2012 to 2016, Defendants earned more than $53 million in profits and generated $783 million in revenue, and that from 2008 to 2016 Smyres personally received over $47 million. (Trial Tr. 1948:16-1950:19, 1975:23-1976:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants countered that their companies used robust procedures and training to detect counterfeit books, but, like all booksellers, were unable to stop counterfeits from slipping through the cracks. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 3021:8-3022:25.) Defendants also argued that Plaintiffs failed to prove that some or all counterfeits at issue originated from the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the end of Plaintiffs' case-in-chief, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law. (Trial Tr. 2079:2-2084:5.) This Court reserved decision. (Trial Tr. 2088:18.) During its charge, this Court gave adverse inference instructions concerning the scope of Defendants' business and profits, and their failure to maintain records. (Trial Tr. 3123:6-3124:3.) The jury found that Defendants' infringement was willful and chose to award Plaintiffs the maximum statutory damages of $2 million for each of their 10 trademark claims, as well as $100,000 for each of their 142 copyright claims. The jury also determined that Defendants breached the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Judgment as a Matter of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, within 28 days of a verdict, a party \"may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59.\" Fed.

The movant must demonstrate that \"the evidence, drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving party and giving deference to all credibility determinations of the jury, is insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find in [the opposing party's] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Lavin-McEleney v.

This contention undergirded an earlier summary judgment motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Partial Summ. J. by Defs., BDB I, ECF No. 266; Report &amp; Recommendation, BDB I, ECF No. 308.) This Court declined to adopt that portion of a Report and Recommendation that had concluded that Plaintiffs failed to show distribution for certain works.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Book Dog Books, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2011468565\">\n    2016 WL 11468565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2016). Noting that copyright infringement can be proven by circumstantial evidence, this Court held that \"a reasonable jury could find that Book Dog's purchases from suppliers accused of dealing in counterfeit textbooks, failure to keep accurate records, and destruction\n   of potentially infringing textbooks-combined with the counterfeit exemplars uncovered by the Publishers-support the inference that Book Dog sold the counterfeit textbooks.\"\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2011468565\">\n    2016 WL 11468565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants now resurrect that argument, contending that no reasonable jury could find sufficient evidence of distribution for 116 works. But \"direct proof of actual dissemination is not required under the Copyright Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3866563\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/579/1210/#p1225\">\n    579 F.Supp.2d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1225 (D. Minn. 2008) (emphasis omitted). Indeed, in a case where there was no \"direct proof\" that the defendant had infringed, the Second Circuit determined that there was \"a significant amount of circumstantial evidence that support[ed] the district court's ... finding of liability,\" including defendant's (1) failure to keep adequate records, (2) failure \"to adequately check the authenticity of the goods it purchased,\" (3) failure \"to adequately inquire\" about the authenticity and sources of the goods purchased, and (4) return of merchandise after being sued.\n   <em>\n    Fendi Adele, S.R.L. v. Ashley Reed Trading, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144113\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/507/26/\">\n    507 F. App'x 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Aside from direct evidence of distribution, the circumstantial evidence against Defendants was legion and harmonizes with the indicia of liability described in\n   <em>\n    Fendi\n   </em>\n   . Defendants admitted they sold at least some of the works. (Trial Tr. 3044:3-22.) The jury saw \"counterfeit exemplars,\" or counterfeit works returned to Plaintiffs from Defendants' customers or found in Defendants' warehouses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 315:11-13.) Plaintiffs presented emails in which Smyres and his staff recognized that they might have been buying counterfeits and had counterfeits in their inventory. (Trial Tr. 334:10-17, 2371:8-17.) Defendants continued to purchase from sources that they knew sold counterfeits. (Trial Tr. 823:17-824:23, 827:23-828:1.) And they acknowledged that their procedures for checking counterfeits were ineffective. (Trial Tr. 935:12-20, 1205:20-25, 1391:5-1395:12.) The jury also heard that other textbook distributors believed Defendants had sold them counterfeits and were \"risky suppliers.\" (Trial Tr. 1913:2-16, 1932:3-12, 1943:21-1944:4, 2051:1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, the jury learned that Defendants kept inadequate records. (Trial Tr. 315:17-24, 2229:3-10.) Photographs of Defendants bulldozing counterfeit books for \"fear of a lawsuit\" were received in evidence. (Trial Tr. 917:23-924:2.) And this Court instructed the jury that they could \"consider defendants' document destruction practices and their failure to retain records regarding those books in determining whether defendants infringed plaintiffs' trademarks and copyrights.\" (Trial Tr. 3123:12-15.) Topping everything off, the jury was permitted to \"infer that the evidence that defendants failed to provide would have been unfavorable to defendants.\" (Trial Tr. 3123:24-3124:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants acknowledge that infringement can be established through circumstantial evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr., BDB II, ECF No. 485 (\"Hr'g Tr.\") 11:24). But they contend that Plaintiffs did not present a sufficient quantum. In making this argument, Defendants separate the 116 works they challenge into four categories: (1) works found in Defendants' quarantine, (2) works for which Plaintiffs had no counterfeit exemplar, (3) works found in other book distributors' inventories, and (4) works for which Plaintiffs had evidence from multiple sources. Defendants' overly cramped analysis does not give proper weight to the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Defendants contend that the works found only in their quarantine cannot support an inference that Defendants also sold those works. But Plaintiffs' Roadmap summarized that Defendants purchased\n   more of those works than were held in quarantine. And the jury heard that Defendants inadequately checked books before selling them. Therefore, a reasonable jury could have inferred that other copies of that title had slipped through the cracks and been sold. Combined with the circumstantial evidence described above, the jury could have determined that it was more likely than not that a counterfeit copy in Defendants' inventory meant that Defendants also sold a copy of that work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Defendants challenge the five works for which Plaintiffs did not present a counterfeit copy. However, the jury heard that Defendants had purchased copies of those works from Best Books World, a known counterfeiter, returned some of them after determining that they were counterfeit, keeping the rest, and that none were found in Defendants' inventory. This could support an inference that Defendants sold the copies they did not return. Indeed, when Smyres sent some copies back to Best Books World, he wrote \"I cannot trust that any of the[ ] [books] are authentic.\" (PX18; Trial Tr. 831:23-832:2.) Although Smyres doubted that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of these copies were authentic, Defendants only shipped\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   back. The jury could have logically concluded that Defendants sold the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Third, some of the works that Plaintiffs offered were found in the inventories of other book distributors. Defendants argue that those works could have come from other sources. But deposition testimony revealed that those distributors considered Defendants to be one of the most prevalent suppliers of counterfeit books and had ceased doing business with Defendants based on their history of infringement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 1913:2-16, 1932:3-12, 1943:21-1944:4, 2051:1-3.) And Plaintiffs' Roadmap summarized that Defendants sourced these works from known counterfeiters like Best Books World, the Blackerbys, and Morena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Last, Defendants challenge works for which a copy was found both in Defendants' quarantine and a distributor's inventory. But the evidence is even stronger for this category. As Plaintiffs aptly characterized it, the jury was presented with \"counterfeit copies swarming around Defendants-in their possession, their upstream supplier's possession, and their downstream customers' possession.\" (Mem. of Law in Opp. to Defs.' Post-Trial Mots., BDB II, ECF No. 443, at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Considering the high burden on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, Defendants fail to demonstrate that the verdict amounts to \"sheer surmise and conjecture.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosas v. Balter Sales Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203199253\">\n    2018 WL 3199253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2018) (citation omitted). The jury was permitted to make inferences based on the totality of the evidence. Their inferences were within reason and established by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, no copyright registration was necessary for Work 18 because Plaintiffs only pursued a trademark claim with respect to that title. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX1, at 3.) Second, Plaintiffs submitted copyright registrations for Works 66, 134, and 143, each listing a Plaintiff as the copyright claimant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5, at 185 &amp; 188-90; PX4, at 6; PX3, at 130-31.) Finally, Plaintiffs offered evidence of ownership for Works 34 and 86 by submitting copyright registrations for prior editions of those titles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5, at 44, 56.) Later textbook editions are derivatives of the original edition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, copyright registrations for the earlier editions constitute sufficient evidence of ownership. \"[S]o long as a copyright owner has registered the underlying work ... she need not independently register the derivative work to sue based on its unauthorized preparation or reproduction.\"\n   <em>\n    Pearson Educ., Inc. v.

May 16, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to the seven remaining Works (29, 55, 71, 81, 84, 135, and 147), five of those titles are owned by Cengage and two by Pearson. In each instance, while the copyright registrations submitted in evidence identified someone other than Cengage or Pearson as the copyright holder, trial testimony established that the person or entity listed was either the textbook's author or a publishing company acquired by Cengage or Pearson. Plaintiffs maintained that Cengage or Pearson were granted exclusive licenses for these works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although Plaintiffs did not submit documentation, Cengage representative Jessica Stitt testified that Cengage owns or holds the exclusive license for every Cengage title. (Trial Tr. 1323:11-16, 1327:19-1328:3.) Pearson representative Richard Essig did the same for the Pearson titles. (Trial Tr. 1619:22-1620:2.) Stitt and Essig explained that when an author is listed as the copyright holder, the author signs \"a written agreement that [the publishing company] has the exclusive rights to market and distribute that particular title.\" (Trial Tr. 1620:24-1621:5, 1324:16-19.) Similarly, Stitt and Essig explained that when Pearson and Cengage acquire publishing companies, they acquire that company's copyrights as a matter of corporate practice. (Trial Tr. 1325:17-1326:18, 1621:8-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants never challenged this testimony, nor did they ask any questions regarding Plaintiffs' ownership of these works. No contradictory evidence of ownership presented.

The Settlement Agreement consists of mutual promises and forbearances to resolve a prior lawsuit between the parties. (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 1.) It specifically provided for damages in the event of a breach, which included a \"liab[ility] to pay the reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred by the non-breaching party.\" (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 17(a).) \"A claim for breach of a contract including a promise to pay is qualitatively different from a suit to vindicate a right included in the Copyright Act and is not subject to preemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Forest Park Pictures\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894373\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/424/#p429\">\n    683 F.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the Settlement Agreement barred Defendants from assisting other infringers, regardless of whether Defendants knew they were aiding and abetting infringement. (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 5.) That clause confers a broader right than the Copyright Act. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim is distinct from their rights under the Copyright Act and is not preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Importation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to introduce evidence of importation of counterfeit books. They argue that PX1423, a PIERS report compiling bills of lading for cargo vessels entering United States ports, and showing textbooks imported by SRockPaper Imports, was the only evidence of importation. Defendants contend the PIERS report only showed imports of textbooks from Thailand but did not indicate that those books were counterfeit. Finally, they contend that SRockPaper Imports's data cannot be linked to Defendants because that entity was not named in the lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   However, while not a defendant in these actions, SRockPaper Imports is owned by Smyres and within the constellation of companies he controls. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 1172:12-1173:8.) And Defendants' effort to discredit the PIERS report ignores other evidence in the record. For instance, Smyres conceded that his companies paid \"Best Books World shipping costs to ship ... books from Thailand to the United States.\" (Trial Tr. 791:6-13.) And the jury heard from Plaintiffs' representative that Defendants had been importing hundreds of thousands of textbooks from Thailand, the undisputed source of many counterfeits, \"for years and right up through 2017.\" (Trial Tr. 1643:23-1644:1.) One of Defendants' employees testified to receiving shipments of 50,000 books from foreign sources per year. (Trial Tr. 2309:18-2310:24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX154.) And Smyres stationed Defendants' employees in Thailand in order to purchase books. (Trial Tr. 854:1-9.) The jury reasonably concluded that counterfeit textbooks were commingled with the hundreds of thousands of textbooks, many from counterfeit sources, that Defendants purchased and imported each year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But even if the jury found the evidence of importation insufficient, the verdict would not need to be set aside. The verdict form did not require the jury to specify which right they determined Defendants had infringed under the Copyright Act and the Settlement Agreement. This Court instructed the jury that \"[t]he right to distribute a copyright is violated by someone other than the copyright holder importing, selling, renting, or otherwise transferring ownership of an unauthorized copy.\" (Trial Tr. 3111:11-14.) Similarly, the Settlement Agreement required Defendants to \"cease all sales and importation into the United States of any pirated editions of the publishers textbooks, and to not assist any other individual or entity to sell or import\n   pirated editions ... into the United States.\" (Trial Tr. 3111:11-14, 3115:3-7 (citation omitted).) Accordingly, the overwhelming evidence of Defendants' sales and/or rentals of counterfeit books was sufficient to sustain the jury's liability determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Duplicate Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants allege that Plaintiffs were awarded double recovery under the Lanham and Copyright Acts.

Although other courts have concluded that Plaintiffs impermissibly sought both trademark and copyright damages for the same work, Plaintiffs did not do so here. Rather, Plaintiffs sought trademark damages for one set of works and copyright damages for another non-overlapping set. The jury was instructed to consider Plaintiffs' trademark and copyright claims separately and to \"only make one award of statutory damages for [each] title.\" (Trial Tr. 3122:19-20.) The verdict sheet differentiated between the works for which Plaintiffs sought trademark damages and the works for which Plaintiffs sought copyright damages. During a charge conference, Defendants conceded that Plaintiffs were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking duplicate recovery, stating \"they are not asking for it.... They have not requested it, therefore the jury may not award it.... [I]t's perfectly clear that they are not requesting it.\" (Trial Tr. 2468:24-2469:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Acknowledging that Plaintiffs avoided the double recovery conundrum, Defendants also raise a novel argument that even if Plaintiffs cabined their claims to trademark damages for some works and copyright damages for others, this nevertheless results in a double recovery. Specifically, they assert that because the Lanham Act provides for damages \"per type of goods ... sold,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), statutory trademark damages provides an award to Plaintiffs for each and every work bearing that mark, including those works for which Plaintiffs sought only copyright damages. But no court has embraced such a theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants offer no authority forcing a plaintiff to choose between a trademark claim and a copyright claim when the claims are brought for separate works and no single work is the predicate for both trademark and copyright claims. This Court repeatedly instructed the jury to consider Plaintiffs' trademark and copyright claims separately. And Defendants offer nothing to suggest that the jury disregarded those instructions. Indeed, Defendants suggested a verdict sheet structuring Plaintiffs' trademark and copyright claims in the manner that they now challenge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Proposed Verdict Form, BDB II, ECF No. 379-3 (delineating the works for which Plaintiffs sought trademark damages and copyright damages).) That verdict sheet, similar to the one this Court adopted, made clear that Plaintiffs' were seeking trademark damages on 19 works and that those works were to be considered separately from the\n   142 works that were the subject of Plaintiffs' copyright claims. (Verdict at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Willfulness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants contend that no reasonable jury could find willfulness. They stress that they never knowingly distributed counterfeits and that they had procedures in place to protect against the sale of counterfeits. \"To prove 'willfulness' under the Copyright Act, the plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant was actually aware of the infringing activity, or (2) that the defendant's actions were the result of 'reckless disregard' or 'willful blindness' to, the copyright holder's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Island Software &amp; Computer Serv., Inc. v.

Mere days after entering into the Settlement Agreement, Smyres agreed to purchase books from Best Books World, a known counterfeiter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 823:17-824:23, 827:23-828:1.) Moreover, after learning that another textbook supplier sold counterfeits to Defendants, Smyres increased his purchases from that source. (Trial Tr. 891:23-892:3, PX181.) Despite settling copyright infringement claims in 2007, Defendants thereafter delayed implementing formal anti-counterfeiting procedures for years. (Trial Tr. 935:12-20, 1205:20-25.) And even after implementing basic procedures, Defendants failed to ascertain where their suppliers sourced their books. (Trial Tr. 2391:10-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the jury learned that Defendants violated the Settlement Agreement by failing to disclose the true sources of their textbooks. (Trial Tr. 1861:4-19.) By 2011, Defendants were aware that they continued to source from counterfeit suppliers and that they had counterfeit books within their inventory. (Trial Tr. 927:24-934:12.) And the jury saw graphic evidence of Defendants' destruction of counterfeit books-the bulldozing of counterfeit textbooks at a municipal landfill-because they feared a lawsuit. (Trial Tr. 2920:19-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In short, the evidence of Defendants' reckless disregard of potential infringement was overwhelming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fendi Adele, S.R.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144113\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/507/26/\">\n    507 F.

Thus, before the jury was empaneled, the cease-and-desist letters were precluded. However, prior to jury selection, Plaintiffs alerted this Court that Defendants planned to contrast the number of works at issue in this lawsuit (161) with the total number of works Defendants sold over a nine year period (1,081,000). This Court warned Defendants' counsel that such a comparison would misleadingly suggest that Defendants did not sell any other counterfeit textbooks, and cautioned that such an argument would \"open the door to the plaintiff examining defendant and offering evidence on the fact that the defendant is continuing to sell counterfeit books.\" (Trial Tr. 26:17-20.) Nevertheless, Defendants' counsel failed to heed the Court's warning and during opening statement contrasted the 161 works at issue with the \"more than one million titles that defendants sold between 2008 and 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 86:9-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After opening statements, Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of this Court's\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   ruling precluding cease-and-desist letters. In a ruling that could have hardly come as a surprise, this Court concluded that Defendants \"opened the door\" to Plaintiffs \"offer[ing] evidence that [they] continue[ ] to find counterfeits in defendants' inventory.\" (Trial Tr. 146:6-18.) Accordingly, this Court determined \"the plaintiffs are [now] entitled to rebut and counter the argument that the defendants are getting better every day at what they are doing in detecting counterfeits and stopping counterfeits.\" (Trial Tr. 149:18-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On cross examination, Plaintiffs confronted Smyres with the cease-and-desist letters. (Trial Tr. 1026:10-1031:6.) In an effort to avoid confusion and prejudice, this Court issued a preemptive limiting instruction to the jury prior to any offer of the letters in evidence. Specifically, this Court instructed the jury that the letters were \"only offered for the purpose of showing that the defendants were on notice that the plaintiff publishers here believed that there were other counterfeits. These counterfeits are not involved in the titles that are at issue in these consolidated cases.\" (Trial Tr. 1025:25-1026:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Cease-and-desist letters are not hearsay when offered to show bad faith and willful infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gucci Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577914\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/858/250/#p253\">\n    858 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   254 n.21. Here, Plaintiffs never provided any evidence that the cease-and-desist letters referred to works definitively determined to be counterfeit.

This undercut Defendants' argument that the jury should contrast the 161 works at issue with the 1,081,000 titles that Defendants sold, as well as their argument that Defendants now take all reasonable efforts to protect against the sale of counterfeit books.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, because Plaintiffs never attempted to initiate compromise negotiations through the cease-and-desist letters, Rule 408 is inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atronic Int'l, GmbH v.

Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Vacation Rental Partners, LLC v.

Defendants sought to use those spreadsheets to show that other textbook distributors occasionally sell counterfeit books. At the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   stage, this Court held that this evidence was relevant on the question of \"whether Defendants took sufficient precautions to detect counterfeits.\" (Memorandum &amp; Order, BDB II, ECF No. 285.) Despite that ruling in their favor, Defendants failed to lay a proper foundation for the admission of those spreadsheets, and then had no witness who could testify about their meaning and significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To lay a foundation, Defendants first resorted to Federal Rule of Evidence 1006. On March 5, 2018, this Court determined that Defendants' proposed Rule 1006 summaries of the Chegg and MBS spreadsheets were deficient. (Memorandum &amp; Order, BDB II, ECF No. 370 (\" Rule 1006 Op.\").) The Chegg summary misleadingly listed percentages of counterfeits found in various textbook distributors' inventory without revealing that different inspection criteria had been used for each distributor. ( Rule 1006 Op., at *2-3.) As for the MBS summary, this Court found that it was impermissibly based on defense counsel's own interpretation of the underlying spreadsheet. ( Rule 1006 Op., at *5-7.) Accordingly, this Court ruled that a witness from MBS would be needed to interpret the spreadsheet if Defendants sought to use it at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants' attempts to secure the appearance of an MBS representative at trial took many avenues, including an aborted order to show cause, a telephonic conference with MBS, and various letter motions, creating a diversionary sideshow. Ultimately, this Court permitted Defendants to introduce the spreadsheets as Chegg and MBS business records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX341, DX371.) However, Defendants called no witness to explain them. This was a problem of Defendants' own making because they previously obtained permission to depose an MBS representative, but then elected not to proceed with the deposition. Instead, they bargained with MBS's counsel for a Rule 902(11) certification that this\n   Court ultimately determined was improper. Then, at trial, Defendants sought to use their financial expert as a human calculator to run various computations on the spreadsheet. (Trial Tr. 2570:5-2577:25.) This Court struck that testimony because the witness had no affiliation with MBS or knowledge of the textbook distribution business. (Trial Tr. 2577:8-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Near the end of trial, Defendants offered excerpts of a deposition of a Chegg representative concerning the Chegg spreadsheet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 2675:10-14.) While this Court permitted counsel to read that testimony to the jury, it warned Defendants not to \"make any percentage argument to the jury\" based on the spreadsheets. (Trial Tr. 2675:11-13.) This Court relied on the Second Circuit's holding \"that in the absence of explanatory testimony by a witness [a] jury would be unable to understand [a] document[ ] without representations by counsel or speculation, either of which would be improper.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gupta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180771\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/111/#p138\">\n    747 F.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 138 (2d Cir. 2014). Once again, Defendants' counsel ignored this Court's ruling and did precisely what they were told they could not do. (Trial Tr. 3021:17-3022:20.) Accordingly, this Court gave a curative instruction to the jury to disregard that fragment of Defendants' closing that referred to percentages from the spreadsheets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 3096:8-10.) In any event, the jury heard testimony and argument from Defendants that their infringement was modest and that other textbook distributors also sold counterfeit works. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 231:22-232:1, 370:5-13, 1438:15-24, 3019:14-19, 3021:8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Roadmap\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In another argument reminiscent of Groundhog Day, Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' Roadmap. Plaintiffs' Roadmap (PX13) was a 272-page Rule 1006 summary exhibit condensing Plaintiffs' evidence of infringement for the 161 works at issue. For months prior to trial, Defendants challenged every aspect of the Roadmap. Finally, this Court ordered Defendants to specify each objection that they intended to interpose to its admissibility. On January 30, 2018, in response to that order, Defendants catalogued a staggering 772 objections. After a laborious review, this Court overruled nearly all of them. (Memorandum &amp; Order, BDB II, ECF No. 371.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants now reassert the same objections and arguments. First, they contend that the Roadmap was created by Plaintiffs' attorneys. But \"[s]ummary evidence can be properly introduced through the testimony of a witness who supervised its preparation.\" (Memorandum &amp; Order, BDB II, ECF No. 285, at *7 (citing\n   <em>\n    UPS Store, Inc. v. Hagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203309721\">\n    2017 WL 3309721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2017).) Plaintiffs' witness John Garry testified that he oversaw the creation of Plaintiffs' Roadmap. (Trial Tr. 309:16-310:14.) This is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fahnbulleh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308185,4280890\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/470/\">\n    752 F.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (allowing witness to introduce summary where he \"supervised others who prepared\" it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that the Roadmap did not accurately summarize the underlying evidence. Defendants cherry-pick a mistake that they now say they discovered in preparing their post-trial motions. But a single error does not render an entire document inadmissible. \"The inaccuracy of a summary under Rule 1006... goes to the weight, rather than the admissibility, of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    BD\n    <em>\n     ex rel.\n    </em>\n    Doe v. DeBuono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"167460\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/193/117/#p130\">\n    193 F.R.D. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). More fundamentally, it is too late to raise an argument that Defendants failed to assert at trial or in the 772 objections lodged before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At trial, Defendants highlighted other errors in the Roadmap. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 459:15-18.) The jury was free to consider those errors in determining how much\n   weight, if any, to give to the Roadmap. Defense counsel argued vigorously to the jury that the Roadmap was inaccurate and unworthy of belief. (Trial Tr. 3039:12-3040:10.) In its charge, this Court instructed the jury that it \"heard the parties challenge the accuracy of\" Plaintiffs' Roadmap and \"must decide how much weight, if any, [to] give to [it].\" (Trial Tr. 3107:6-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the Roadmap's underlying evidence was inadmissible because Plaintiffs' witness Richard Essig did not recall a single spreadsheet referenced in the Roadmap. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 1708:14-18.) However, on redirect, Essig was shown the cover email for that spreadsheet which refreshed his recollection and enabled him to recall what the spreadsheet described. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 1711:18-1712:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Verdict Sheet and Charge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants challenge the verdict sheet and certain elements of this Court's charge. Originally, the parties offered this Court radically different proposals for the verdict sheet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Letter, BDB II, ECF No. 379, Exs. 2 &amp; 3.) Plaintiffs requested a 4-page verdict sheet that required the jury to state whether Defendants had infringed any of Plaintiffs' trademarks and/or copyrights, and if so, how many. Defendants asked for a 24-page verdict sheet listing every work at issue and requiring the jury to separately check off each trademark and copyright claim and specify the amount of damages awarded for each claim. After extensive discussions with counsel, this Court prepared a 6-page verdict sheet that afforded three options: (1) a determination that Defendants were liable for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Plaintiffs' claims, (2) a determination that Defendants were liable for\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of Plaintiffs' claims, or (3) a determination that Defendants were liable for\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of Plaintiffs' claims. If the jury determined that Defendants infringed some of Plaintiffs' claims, they were instructed to specify which works Defendants infringed on an accompanying 10-page spreadsheet. In a parallel vein, the verdict sheet afforded the option to choose the same amount of damages for each work infringed or to differentiate the damages awarded for each work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants contend that the verdict sheet encouraged the jury to make globalized determinations rather than individualized assessments. But this Court instructed the jury to make individual determinations on a work-by-work basis. (Trial Tr. 3108:14-15, 3110:19-20.) All indications are that the jury followed this instruction. In fact, even though the jury found that Defendants infringed all of Plaintiffs' trademarks and copyrights, they nevertheless completed the accompanying spreadsheets, checking off every single work that they determined had been willfully infringed and assigning a dollar amount of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The verdict sheet was a reasonable compromise between the parties' competing proposals and, with this Court's instructions, reasonably assured that the jury applied the law to the facts. Defendants also challenge this Court's determination that the jury need not perform an arithmetic calculation to tally the statutory damages awarded. Defendants' proposal did nothing more than invite computational errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TeeVee Toons, Inc. v. MP3.Com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083830\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/148/276/#p279\">\n    148 F.Supp.2d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (ordering new trial based on jury's errors in calculating verdict).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants challenge this Court's rejection of their request to charge the jury that statutory damages must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Such an instruction is wrong as a matter of law. The purpose of statutory damages is to allow a plaintiff to seek damages where it is unable to prove actual damages. Requiring a plaintiff to prove\n   statutory damages is at odds with the \"wide judicial discretion\" and \"necessary flexibility to do justice\" that statutory damages are meant to provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.W. Woolworth Co. v.

But the existence of a valid and enforceable contract was already the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Book Dog Books, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201216583\">\n    2016 WL 1216583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2016). At trial, Plaintiffs needed only to prove that Defendants' breached the Settlement Agreement. To instruct the jury regarding validity would have raised the specter of a jury decision inconsistent with this Court's prior holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, Defendants challenge the adverse inference instructions. As explained in this Court's April 2016 Memorandum and Order, a permissive adverse inference regarding Defendants' destruction of evidence was appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum &amp; Order, BDB I, ECF No. 353, at *6-7.) And after reviewing Plaintiffs' motions for sanctions, this Court explained its decision regarding the adverse inference instruction on Defendants' discovery misconduct. (Trial Tr. 2811:1-2814:19.) Just days before trial, through an anonymous source, Plaintiffs learned of entities and profit distribution agreements that Defendants concealed throughout discovery. (Trial Tr. 2812:2-13, 2814:9-14.) This Court tempered Plaintiffs' proposed mandatory adverse inference instruction with a permissive instruction that the jury may make an adverse inference based on discovery misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Remittitur\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendants move for remittitur, contending that the jury award was untethered to Defendants' profits and Plaintiffs' losses and was inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirsch v.

Indeed, given both the evidence presented to the jury that Defendant continued to distribute copies of infringing textbooks even after discovering that infringement had occurred, as well as the evidence indicating that Defendant is a repeat infringer, the jury's determination as to the amount of statutory damages for willful infringement was not erroneous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Psihoyos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205506121\">\n    2012 WL 5506121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

Considering Defendants' lengthy history of infringement, the jury could have determined that only a large award would effectively promote deterrence, especially given the evidence that Defendants continued to infringe even days before trial. The jury could have concluded that the award was necessary for general deterrence after learning how prevalent counterfeits are in the textbook market. It also could have focused on the \"conduct and attitude of the parties\" and compared it with this Court's instructions indicating that Defendants destroyed evidence and failed to comply with discovery orders. \"Applying these factors is necessarily a subjective and fact-intensive exercise.\"\n   <em>\n    Beastie Boys v.

(Trial Tr. 769:21-771:5, PX 1135.) Although Smyres does not own Matasa Agila Holdings (\"Matasa\"), the evidence shows that Matasa conducts back-end operations for Defendants' rental business, works out of Defendants' warehouse, has no employees of its own, and is managed by Defendants on a day-to-day basis. (Trial Tr. 782:9-785:25.) Therefore, enjoining all twenty-five entities is warranted and would provide the clarification necessary to ensure compliance and enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Defendants also dispute that provision in the proposed injunction preventing them from making assignments or transfers or forming new entities or associations outside of the ordinary course of business with the purpose or effect of circumventing their payment obligations. Defendants argue that enjoining transfers \"with the effect of\" reducing their ability to pay is vague and threatens to block legitimate transactions. This objection is unpersuasive. The proposed language of the injunction makes clear that this provision applies only to transfers\n   <em>\n    outside of the ordinary course of business\n   </em>\n   . Reasonable businesspeople understand what is and what is not in the ordinary course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On the other hand, certain elements of Plaintiffs' proposed relief push the envelope too far.

Plaintiffs request that going forward, Defendants be required to send Plaintiffs suspected counterfeit books they receive and notify Plaintiffs of the source of those books, the source's contact information, and Defendants' purchase price. When pressed at oral argument whether Defendants' return of counterfeits to suppliers would constitute an illegal distribution under the Copyright Act, Plaintiffs acknowledged that it was an unresolved question. (Hr'g Tr. 54:3-9.) While Plaintiffs contend that this provision would help interdict the sale of counterfeits, it has the effect of enlisting Defendants in Plaintiffs' efforts to determine if\n   <em>\n    other entities\n   </em>\n   are selling counterfeit textbooks. Because Plaintiffs have not shown how this provision would restrain Defendants' illegal conduct, nor provided authorities for such relief, this Court declines to include such a provision in the permanent injunction. However, Defendants will be required to purge all counterfeits currently in their inventory, which is standard relief under the Copyright Act and Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiffs also ask that Defendants be required to provide a sworn declaration of compliance with this Court's injunction within 90-120 days from its issuance, and annually for ten years thereafter. Defendants object to providing compliance reports for ten years. Courts commonly require a certificate of compliance with an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triangl Grp. Ltd. v.

Defendants provoked this lawsuit by filing the Ohio Action despite the clear language in the Settlement Agreement that all further litigation would be handled \"in the federal or state courts located in the state of New York.\" (PX127 \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books II\n   </em>\n   , Defendants pled 52 affirmative defenses, many of which were previously stricken in\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books I\n   </em>\n   . Then, in their proposed jury instructions, Defendants requested separate instructions on six affirmative defenses: statute of limitations/laches, innocent infringement, excessive statutory damages, lack of standing, preemption, and bankruptcy discharge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint and Independent Proposed Jury Instructions, BDB II, ECF No. 379-1.) However, none of those affirmative defenses were proper. Defendants presented\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence that Plaintiffs learned of their claims more than three years before filing\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books II\n   </em>\n   . Standing was an element of Plaintiffs' case-in-chief, and innocent infringement was an element of damages. Further, \"excessive statutory damages,\" \"preemption,\" and \"preclusion\" are all matters of law for the court, not the jury. This Court denied all six requests to charge affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   This was another frolic that Defendants foisted on the Court and Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In closing argument, Defendants' counsel acknowledged that Defendants sold at least some of the works at issue. Fourteen titles bore Defendants' stickers, leading counsel to concede \"it is more likely than not ... that we distributed these books.\" (Trial Tr. 3044:18-20.) Defendants reiterated this concession at argument on the post-trial motions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 68:24-69:2 (\"There are a number of works in this case they bought directly from the defendants. There are a number of books in this case that bear our stickers. There are books for which they have evidence.\"). But at trial, Defendants attempted to advance the untenable position that Plaintiffs could not prove these particular works were actually counterfeit. They argued that Plaintiffs' representatives-employees whose duties are to identify counterfeit works-could not differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate copies of their own textbooks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 3046:1-8.) The failure to remove claims that could not be disputed from the jury's consideration was emblematic of the \"give no quarter\" approach taken by Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    We Shall Overcome Found. v.

While there were many abuses, the paradigm of Defendants' scorched-earth approach was their willful concealment of business entities and profit distribution agreements, which required this Court to issue an adverse inference instruction. Even then, this Court afforded Defendants the opportunity to avoid such an instruction by reopening discovery so that Defendants could come clean on their financial machinations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 272.) But they doubled down on their obstructive tactics. During trial, this Court explained why an adverse inference instruction was necessary. (Trial Tr. 2810:20-2814:19.) Through an anonymous source, Plaintiffs learned weeks before trial that Defendants had violated the Court's Orders to reveal \"any entity\" through which they conduct their businesses, to \"produce their financials 'in as accessible and clear a form as possible,' \" and to reveal \" 'all distributions or other payments ... by any of the defendants to any other individual and/or entities that received distributions or payment from profits.' \" (Trial Tr. 2811:9-25 (citation omitted).) Defendants did not disclose the existence of Matasa, the rental arm for Book Dog Books, or certain equity participation agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Aside from Defendants' discovery evasions, this Court has described Defendants' incomprehensible decision to plead 52 affirmative defenses in\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books II\n   </em>\n   knowing that many had been stricken in\n   <em>\n    Book Dog Books I\n   </em>\n   . This profligate pleading led to rebriefing at the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   stage.

As Defendants point out, when Plaintiffs' time entries are distilled, counsel, who are highly experienced in copyright infringement and trademark infringement actions, expended 272 hours preparing jury instructions. In another vein, this Court cannot fathom how attorneys could spend 467 hours preparing deposition designations when there were nowhere near that number of hours of deposition in the case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glunt Decl. Exs. 4 &amp; 5.) This excessive expenditure of time does not square with counsel's expertise. In response, Plaintiffs contend that the totals identified by Defendants are misleading because their block-billings include tasks other than creating jury instructions and deposition designations.

Plaintiffs did not submit any contemporaneous time records for their accounting expert. Undoubtedly, significant professional time was needed to cut through the Gordian knot of Defendants' tangled financial relationships. And Defendants' concealment of certain financial transactions assuredly complicated Plaintiffs' expert's analysis. But Defendants paid their accounting expert only a fraction of $225,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Glunt Decl., Ex. 21.)

Plaintiffs' counsel are awarded $4,137,081.70 in attorneys' fees and $694,096.29 in costs. This Court will issue a final judgment in the aggregate amount of $39,031,177.99 concurrent with this Opinion &amp; Order.
