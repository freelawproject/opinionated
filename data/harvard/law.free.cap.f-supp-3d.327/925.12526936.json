BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the interests of judicial economy, the Court provides a general overview of the case here but summarizes the specific background relevant to the issues raised by the parties' motions in the analysis. This matter arises from the conclusion of Plaintiff E. Ray Raynor's (\"Plaintiff\") employment with Defendant in 2016. Defendant provides security services to clients, including risk consulting and investigations, systems integration, security software and technology, and security professionals. Defendant employed Plaintiff from July 16, 2001 until August 26, 2016. After a five day trial, the jury found in Defendant's favor on Plaintiff's claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\") and for wrongful discrimination on account of his age in violation of North Carolina public policy. (Doc. No. 74). The jury found in Plaintiff's favor on Plaintiff's claim to entitlement to a bonus and pay for vacation time, paid time off, and/or extended leave under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (\"NCWHA\"). The jury awarded Plaintiff $6,434.80 for his bonus and $14,974.96 for his vacation time, paid time off, and/or extended leave. The jury did not find Plaintiff entitled to severance pay under the NCWHA. The jury found Defendant liable for punitive damages and awarded $64,347.52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Doc. No. 80-1 at 3). Second, Defendant submits that insufficient evidence supports the jury's award of vacation time. (Doc. No. 80-1 at 11-12). Third, Defendant reasons the award of punitive damages fails because \"Plaintiff failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence, or even any evidence, the existence of fraud, malice, or willful or wanton conduct, and did not prove by the greater weight of the evidence that any such actions were related to any injury sustained by Plaintiff or that G4S's officers, directors, or managers participated in or condoned such actions.\" (Doc.

As summarized by Plaintiff, evidence of G4S's policy and practice of paying yearly bonuses to its employees was presented through exhibits and testimony from Plaintiff and other employees of Defendant. Plaintiff routinely received annual bonuses prior to 2014. No formalities for obtaining these bonuses applied. Plaintiff presented a written policy for the 2014 bonus and testimony that employees within his Region received a bonus for 2014. Plaintiff testified to his qualifications for a bonus. Defendant through the testimony of Malcolm Burchett disputed Plaintiff's qualifications yet admitted a bonus committee-not Burchett-decides an employee's entitlement to a bonus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Vacation Pay\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Section 95-25.12 of NCWHA provides that \"the employer shall give all vacation time off or payment in lieu of time off in accordance with the company policy or practice\" and requires \"notif[ication] in accordance with G.S. 95-25.13 of any policy or practice which requires or results in loss or forfeiture of vacation time or pay\" to effectuate \"loss or forfeiture.\" In this case, Defendant's written policy for paid time off for overhead personnel established that a 10-20 year employee received 224 hours (28 days) of paid time off (\"PTO\") on the anniversary of their employment. Defendant had employed Plaintiff for over ten years and considered July 16 Plaintiff's anniversary of employment. When employed as a Manager of Field Support for the Mid-Atlantic Region, Plaintiff was an overhead employee. Upon Burchett's removal of Plaintiff from this position and reassignment to the Bank of America Corporate Center as Site Manager, Burchett represented to Plaintiff that his salary and benefits would be maintained. Thus, despite his reassignment, Plaintiff continued to receive his same salary and benefits on account of Burchett.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    An email from G4S's Human Resources Director Kim Cross dated July 12, 2016 stated that Plaintiff was currently assigned to the overhead benefits program, which usually includes overhead PTO. As a result, Cross had determined that Plaintiff had four hours of PTO as of July 10, 2016 and would have a total of 224 hours if terminated after July 16, 2016. The leave usage detail generated and produced by G4S lists the number -4.00 as the PTO balance. However, the sum of the PTO recorded in the leave usage detail, which ranges from September 28, 2015 to February 26, 2016, totals 204 hours. As an overhead employee receives 224 hours annually, the use of only 204 hours of PTO would result in a leave balance of 20 hours. Defendant also administratively terminated Plaintiff after his July 16, 2016 employment anniversary. Both before and after administratively terminating Plaintiff on August 26, 2016, Defendant denied Plaintiff use of his PTO and refused to pay him for any remaining PTO.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Punitive Damages\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    To succeed on his claim for punitive damages, Plaintiff had to prove that Defendant is liable for compensatory damages and \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that fraud, malice, or willful or wanton conduct \"was present and was related to the injury for which compensatory damages were awarded[.]\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a), (b). Here, the parties stipulated to, and evidence admitted supported, that Defendant's Senior Director of Administration for the Mid-Atlantic Region, Tifani Grusky informed Plaintiff on July 11, 2016 that he had no PTO. Yet, Grusky received an email from G4S's Human Resources Director Kym Cross dated July 12, 2016, stating that Plaintiff was assigned to the overhead benefits program which usually includes overhead PTO. Cross had determined that Plaintiff had four hours of PTO as of July 10, 2016 and would have a total of 224 hours if he was terminated after his anniversary of employment on July 16, 2016. Also, the leave usage detail admitted into evidence reflects that Plaintiff had only used 204 hours of his PTO, when the policy for the overhead benefit program provides that employees of 10-20 years are entitled to an allotment of 224 hours of PTO on their anniversary date. As stipulated by the parties and as testified by Burchett, Plaintiff, and others, Burchett made adjustments so Plaintiff's salary and benefits remained unchanged when his regional overhead position was eliminated and he was assigned to a position as Site Manager at the Bank of America Corporate Center. The parties further stipulated that Burchett continued to employ Plaintiff at the same rate of pay after his removal from the Bank of America site. Nevertheless, in July, Defendant denied Plaintiff his requested PTO. Yet, several days later and four days after his July 16, 2016 anniversary, Defendant had presented to Plaintiff a severance agreement reflecting $123.75 in pay for unused PTO. This amount was equivalent to four hours of PTO for Plaintiff. After Plaintiff turned down the severance agreement, Defendant did not pay Plaintiff for any vacation pay, paid time off, or extended leave balance, at any time despite the aforementioned evidence and Plaintiff's suit against Defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Defendant's Alternative Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Defendant seeks an alteration or amendment to the judgment because \"[t]he awards of bonus pay, punitive damages, and vacation pay, as well as the admission of Plaintiff's Exhibit 79 into evidence are manifest injustices[.]\" (Doc. No. 80-1 at 14). Defendant's arguments as to bonus pay, punitive damages, and vacation pay are mere reassertions of its arguments for judgment as a matter of law in its\n    favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pac.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 80-1). Merely disagreeing with the jury's verdict, which the Court has allowed by denying Defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law, does not support a Rule 59(e) motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hutchinson v.

Therefore, based on the evidence summarized previously, the Court cannot find a manifest injustice as to the jury's verdict in favor of Plaintiff on bonus pay, vacation pay, and punitive damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Additionally, the admission of Exhibit 79 was proper. Rule 1006 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that \"[t]he proponent may use a summary, chart, or calculation to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in court.\" Here, Plaintiff had admitted into evidence Defendant's policy of vacation time, paid time off, and extended leave bank, Defendant's payroll register for Plaintiff, and Defendant's leave usage detail for Plaintiff, all of which are admissible and voluminous writings, that substantiate the calculations set forth in Exhibit 79. Defendant's assertion for the exclusion of Exhibit 79 pursuant to Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is made for the first time in Defendant's motion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Not only is this objection untimely and, therefore, waived, but the Court cannot find undue prejudice. Defendant had access to all underlying documents supporting the calculations in the exhibits and Plaintiff's counsel on direct examination of Plaintiff walked through each of the calculations. Defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine Plaintiff and to rebut the evidence in the exhibit through testimony of witnesses it called on direct. Thus, the Court denies Defendant's request to alter or amend the judgment. There was no manifest injustice or clear error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Defendant's Alternative Motion for a New Trial\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    As Defendant's previous motions fail, the Court considers Defendant's request for a new trial. Defendant avers it was unduly prejudice by the Court excluding the testimony and expert report of Dr. Sara Boyd and extending additional time to Plaintiff. (Doc. No. 80-1 at 16-18). The Court disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Defendant merely alleges prejudice from the exclusion of Dr. Boyd's testimony and report without citing or explaining how the Court erred or how any prejudice was a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, the Court cannot find any prejudice or manifest injustice from the exclusion. The Court fully explained its holding in its Order on Plaintiff's Motion in Limine as to the report and testimony of Dr. Sara Boyd (Doc. No. 76), which is incorporated herein.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Defendant contends an extension of time granted to Plaintiff after his allotted 7.5 hours\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    expired amounted to undue prejudice against Defendant because Defendant took measures to stay within the 7.5 hour requirement. Defendant only complains that it may have spent more time on cross-examination and may have called Plaintiff during its case in chief. Yet, Defendant did not use all of the allotted 7.5 hours of time or request more time. The extension given to Plaintiff did not prevent Defendant from\n    additional questioning of Plaintiff on direct or cross; of its 7.5 hours, Defendant had substantial time remaining after presenting its closing arguments. Therefore, on this record, the Court finds no prejudice, and even if there was prejudice, it was not undue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     E. Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Although Plaintiff generally moved for judgment as a matter of law at trial on matters he had previously raised, Plaintiff declined to move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) at trial on the grounds now asserted in Plaintiff's motion under Rule 50(b). (Doc. No. 81). Plaintiff has never before this motion contended he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his claim for breach of contract or severance pay under the NCWHA. Therefore, Plaintiff's arguments addressed herein are clearly waived, and Plaintiff's motion for judgment as a matter of law denied.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     F.

Plaintiff seeks a new trial on the claim of breach of contract and of violation of the NCWHA as to severance pay but does not substantiate his request. (Doc. Nos. 82, 82-1). The Court cannot find the verdict on these claims against the clear weight of evidence, based on false evidence, or a miscarriage of justice.

Here, Plaintiff testified that he signed and emailed the document entitled \"Bonus Performance Contract-2014\" to his manager Michael Burchett, but Burchett could not recall receiving it or signing it. The jury weighed this conflicting testimony concerning Plaintiff's acceptance and found in favor of Defendant. The jury also found in favor of Defendant after weighing evidence that Defendant routinely discharged employees without severance pay. Those who received severance pay were also distinguishable from Plaintiff and received severance pay after execution of a severance agreement. In light of the record and Plaintiff's burden of proof, the Court declines to grant a new trial under Rule 59(e) on these claims and turns to Plaintiff's remaining assignments of error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     1.

(Summary Judgment Hearing Tr. 45:17-19, Doc. No. 66). During calendar call on January 2, 2018, the Court imposed its time limits-a chess clock of 15 hours. The Court explained that this meant Plaintiff had 7.5 hours and Defendant had 7.5 hours. Time would run during opening, closing, direct examination, and cross examination but would not run during jury selection or objections. The Court also informed the parties that their case was the third case set for trial out of five calendared for that month, with an expected trial date of January 17, 2018. Plaintiff did not object to the imposition of chess clock or the amount of time. Plaintiff gave the Court no reason to believe the Court's decision inappropriate. None of Plaintiff's filings or statements indicated or substantiated that his case required more than 7.5 hours.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff also did not\n    object to Defendant receiving the same amount of time to present its case. At trial, even with only a few hours remaining of his allotted time, Plaintiff conceded his ability to call all his remaining witnesses in the remaining time. It was only after the Court called a recess to inform Plaintiff that his time was about to expire that Plaintiff complained of prejudice. Such timing is telling; Plaintiff's own actions created any purported predicament. As the record shows, Plaintiff used the pre-set time allocated to him as he saw fit and appropriate. Some may have allocated their time differently, but by setting a time limit, this Court deferred to counsel's judgment as to their allocation of their time.

Without evidence in the trial record of Defendant's revenue and net worth, the exclusion of\n    the category on \"the defendant's ability to pay punitive damages, as evidenced by revenue or net worth\" is not a prejudicial error.

(Doc. No. 82). Plaintiff does not put forward evidence to support his representations of discovery abuses, misrepresented documents, and/or frivolous and malicious defenses but cites his previous filings before the Court. Plaintiff's reliance on his previously filings is clearly insufficient to meet his burden of proof, and Plaintiff neglected to show or explain how Defendant's alleged misconduct prevented Plaintiff from fully and fairly presenting his claim. The Court addressed the alleged discovery abuses made in Plaintiff's filings prior to trial. Specifically, Plaintiff, after discovery closed, moved for a second mediation, additional discovery, and sanctions. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 11,\n    22, 27, 28). This Court heard Plaintiff on his complaints at a telephone conference on November 14, 2017. In response to Plaintiff's complaints, the Court stayed briefing of the summary judgment and promptly addressed them. The Court issued four orders. On November 15, 2017, the Court extended discovery to allow Plaintiff to depose six individuals that were untimely identified by Defendant, ordered all defendants to attend a second mediation, and ordered Defendant to produce its privilege log and all documents listed in the privilege log for in camera review. (Doc. No. 34). After in camera review, the Court ordered the production of two documents identified on the privilege log in a redacted form (Doc. No. 35) and ordered further certification or production by Defendant to comply with their discovery obligations (Doc. No. 37). Finally, the Court recognized the insufficiency of the testimony of Defendant's 30(b)(6) designee and ordered Defendant to make a sufficiently informed designee available to testify for one hour. (Doc. No. 39). The Court also granted Plaintiff's request to amend his complaint to add claims under the ADEA based on the newly produced documents pursuant to the Court's order. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 35, 43; Text-Only Order granting Doc. No. 43, Dec. 18, 2017). As Plaintiff did not move for reconsideration of the Court's summary judgment order in light of the new evidence,\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    move for a continuance of the trial to complete the permitted discovery, or move for additional discovery, the Court orders would appear to have cured any alleged misconduct prior to trial. In addition to the references to the filings, Plaintiff, at best, alleges the trial record evidences Tifani Grusky falsified her affidavit. However, Plaintiff has not put forward evidence or affidavits to substantiate this claim, and the trial record does not support an accusation of falsification. Grusky's failure to recall her method for calculating a figure in her affidavit does not, on its own, amount to evidence of falsification of an affidavit. Thus, Plaintiff plainly fails to carry his burden of proving misconduct by clear and convincing evidence and of demonstrating that such misconduct prevented him from fully and fairly presenting his claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Inadvertence, Surprise, or Excusable Neglect\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Plaintiff also moves for relief from judgment under Rule 60 for Plaintiff's inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect for failing to present all the witnesses and exhibits he had listed on his pretrial filings within the time limits imposed. (Doc. No. 82 at 5). Plaintiff does not elaborate or address the proprietary of such relief for this conduct under Rule 60 in his brief or cite any authority. As the Court has already determined that this occurrence or conduct does not amount to a miscarriage of justice, justifying a new trial under Rule 59(a), the Court sees no reason to address this matter further under Rule 60 when\n    Plaintiff declines to substantiate his request.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    Moore's Federal Practice-Civil \u00a7 60.41 n. 16 (Matthew Bender 3d Ed.)

As previously summarized, evidence supports the jury's finding. However, Defendant's defenses to these claims were not unwarranted in fact or law. Defendant's written policy on vacation pay, the uncertainty surrounding Plaintiff's employee classification after his removal from the Site Manager position in Charlotte, and the non-provision of labor for Defendant from the end of May to Plaintiff's anniversary date in July provided legitimate grounds for contesting the claims underlying the punitive damages award and the request for punitive damages itself.

After the magistrate judge considered the matters and Plaintiff objected to the magistrate judge's determination, this Court heard Plaintiff on his complaints at a telephone conference on November 14, 2017 and orally ruled on several of the matters. As a result of Plaintiff's objection and the telephone conference, the Court memorialized its oral ruling and addressed the remaining matters in three other orders. All four orders modified the magistrate judge's order by granting in part and denying in part Plaintiff's objections. The Court acknowledged Defendant had failed to timely disclose or supplement as required by Rule 26(a) and (e), to produce non-privileged documents as requested under Rule 34, and to designate a prepared deponent able to answer questions as Defendant's designee under Rule 30(b)(6). (Doc. Nos. 34, 35, 37, 39). The Court then compelled production, designation of an informed designee, and production of the untimely identified witnesses for depositions. (Doc.

(Doc. No. 94 at 3-4). Although these filings provide additional information, they do not substantiate Plaintiff's request for fees for 113.60 hours of counsel time and 38.90 hours of paralegal time. The breakdown only has a general category of discovery/sanctions and the time entries consistently cover time spent on the multiple matters, including the summary judgment motions. As raised by Defendant, by employing block entries, counsel generally has not provided the Court reliable information from which the Court can determine what time was reasonably expended and or on what it was expended.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Olson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475056,11369743\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1415/\">\n     884 F.2d 1415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1428 (D.C.

Also, the general category of discovery/sanction is broader than the $49,330.00 in billable fees sought under Rule 37 by Plaintiff. Thus, neither the Court nor opposing counsel have the ability to determine how Plaintiff calculated the total of $49,330.00. Further, counsel's attestation admits that the $49,330.00 is for efforts \"necessitated by\" or \"necessarily incurred.\" (Doc. No. 83-1 at 3). Such efforts as described by counsel are broader than the expenses \"incurred in making the motion\" under Rule 37(a)(5) and the expenses \"caused by the failure\" to disclose a witness under Rule 37(c)(1)(A).

Although clearly meritorious, nothing briefed by Plaintiff in the motion is particularly novel or difficult and the sought fees are disproportionate relative to the amount in controversy and results obtained. Accordingly, the Court cannot award the fees as requested by Plaintiff and concludes a 30% reduction of the requested 113.60 hours is necessary. The Court finds this reduction avoids compensating Plaintiff for efforts not \"incurred in making the motion\" under Rule 37(a)(5) or\n    \"caused by the failure\" to disclose a witness under Rule 37(c)(1)(A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Further reduction of the fee to account for time allocated to seeking sanctions is not appropriate in this case.

R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)(C). Rule 37(c)(1)(A), thus, allows Plaintiff to now seek reasonable expenses for Defendant's failure, which would include the costs of the motion. Thus, the time spent working on the motion as a whole, to compel and for sanctions, is reasonably compensable under Rule 37(a)(5) and (c)(1)(A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Based on its experience and its familiarity with this case, the Court also finds counsel's hourly rate of $400 reasonable.

The Court addresses herein a few matters where such a mistake has occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    First, the summary judgment order (Doc. No. 48) must be corrected to clarify the adjudication of claims against Chuck Brock, Donald S. Zeccardi, Malcolm C. Burchett, Tifani Grusky, and Michael Nail (collectively, the Individual Defendants) and their termination as parties. (Summary Judgment Hearing Tr. 41:18-22, Doc. No. 66). At the hearing on G4S and the Individual Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 27), the Court orally ruled in the Individual Defendants favor on their summary judgment motion, resolving all claims against them and terminating them from this action (Summary Judgment Hearing Tr. 41:18-22, Doc. No. 66). At the time of filing of the written summary judgment order, the Court had granted Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Complaint, which ambiguously used the term Defendants. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 48 at 28 n.9). However, the Court struck the initial amended complaint because as filed, it was without the consent of Defendant or the permission of the Court. (Doc. Nos. 53, 63). Plaintiff filed its third amended complaint (Doc. No. 64), which clearly established that the new cause of action only complained of acts by the remaining Defendant G4S. Therefore, the Court clarifies its intent and the record to reflect that Individual Defendants were terminated from this action when the Court granted summary judgment in their favor on all remaining claims asserted against them. Thus, the Court strikes footnote 9 from the written summary judgment order filed on December 21, 2017 (Doc. No. 48) and directs the Clerk of Court to appropriately reflect the termination and judgment of the Individual Defendants on the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Second, the Court must consider amendments to the judgment to reflect prejudgment and post judgment interest.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    The NCWHA entitles Plaintiff, as the prevailing party on claims under the Act, to \"interest at the legal rate set forth in G.S. 24-1 from the date each amount [awarded by the jury] first came due.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2095-25.22\">\n     N.C.
