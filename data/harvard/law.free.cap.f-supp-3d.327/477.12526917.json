RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Generally, liberally construed, Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint alleges as follows. (Dkt. No. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   D.B. was a sixteen-year-old eleventh-grade student at Thousand Islands High School in the District before he died on March 3, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For years before his death, other students would verbally harass, threaten and bully D.B., and be physically violent towards him, due to his disability, his failure to conform to gender stereotypes, his family's perceived economic status, the way he dressed, the music he listened to, and the hobbies he enjoyed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The harassment and bullying intensified over the years, particularly by a group of repeat offenders, who had been allowed, through the school administration's passive approach and inaction, to engage in constant bullying without effective discipline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) More specifically, on several occasions, other students harassed, bullied, and/or physically assaulted D.B. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite repeated notice by D.B. and his family to Defendants about the harassment and the effect that it had on D.B., Defendants did very little, if anything, and were ineffective at ensuring D.B. was educated without fearing for his safety and emotional well-being. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants failed to follow their own established procedures for handling and investigating complaints and for disciplining students involved in harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The repeated bullying\n   and harassment, accompanied by anti-gay and gender-related slurs, caused D.B. to commit suicide on March 3, 2014, in his bedroom, with a shotgun. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Generally, based on these factual allegations, the Second Amended Complaint asserts the following seven claims: (1) a claim of disability discrimination pursuant to \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act against the District and the Board (\"Count One\"); (2) a claim of disability discrimination pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") against the District and the Board (\"Count Two\"); (3) a claim of disability discrimination pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution against the District, the Board, and Joseph Gilfus (\"Count Three\"); (4) a claim of sex discrimination for failing to conform to gender stereotypes pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution against the District, the Board, and Joseph Gilfus (\"Count Four\"); (5) a claim of sex discrimination for failing to conform to gender stereotypes pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq., against the District and the Board (\"Count Five\"); (6) a claim of negligent supervision against the District and the Board (\"Count Six\"); and (7) a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress against Defendants (\"Count Seven\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As relief, Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Statement of Undisputed Material Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts were asserted and supported by Defendants in their Rule 7.1 Statement and not successfully denied by Plaintiff in a Rule 7.1 Response that both\n   <em>\n    matched\n   </em>\n   the paragraphs of Defendants' Rule 7.1 Statement and\n   <em>\n    specifically cited\n   </em>\n   the record where the factual issue arises, as required by Local Rule 7.1(c) of the Local Rules of Practice for this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 179, Attach. 19 [Defs.' Rule 7.1 Statement]\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 7 [Plf.'s Rule 7.1 Response].)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1. D.B. was a minor student of the District from 2002 until March 3, 2014, and a member of the class slated to graduate in June, 2015. D.B. committed suicide at home in his bedroom on March 3, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   2. D.B. played modified football at the District in ninth grade for one season, and varsity football for a period during his junior year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   3. Amy Briggs is the mother of D.B. and the administratrix of his estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   4. The District is a public Central School District located in Jefferson County, New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   5. The Board is the board of education of the District.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   6. Defendant House was the superintendent of schools for the District from July 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   7. Defendant Warneck served on the Board from 1987 to June 30, 2016 (except for a period from 2002 through 2005), and most recently was the President of the Board from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   8. Defendant Gilfus is the principal of the District's high school and has held that position since February, 2004.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    D.B.'s Statements of the Issues that Caused His Emotional Distress and Suicide\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   9. The New York State Police recovered texts sent by D.B. on his cell phone over a period of several\n   months leading up to his suicide. Defendants further engaged forensic consultants to recover the same texts from the cell phone so that the texts could be viewed in a conversation-by-conversation format.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   10. The names \"I'm cool,\" \"randy.swag,\" and \"3157830068,\" which are listed as senders or recipients of various texts and messages, were all account names or aliases of D.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   11. D.B. also underwent therapy at various points in his life, including for a period from November, 2009 through August, 2011 with Dr. Rebecca Laufer, a psychologist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   12. Those therapy sessions covered the period from the middle of D.B.'s seventh-grade year through just before the beginning of his ninth-grade year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   13. Dr. Laufer testified that there is nothing omitted from her notes, that she felt was important to an understanding of her work with D.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   14. During his therapy with Dr. Laufer, D.B. made many comments, including statements on multiple occasions that his mother and/or his parents were responsible for his problems, and that he hated his mother and wished she was dead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   15. Dr. Laufer concluded that D.B. \"despises\" his mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   16. In fact, during the therapy, Dr. Laufer's notes indicate that \"[a]t one point he stated the problem is his parents and the solution would be to kill himself.... He [D.B.] denied a plan or intent and there appeared to be a reactionary tone in his expression of this statement, which he likely knew would deeply upset his mother. This concern was explored and he did not appear at risk.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   17. D.B. similarly told various of his fellow students over the years that he hated his mother and/or his parents, that he hated his home life, and that he would rather be dead than live at home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   18. In fact, D.B. claimed to Defendant Joseph Gilfus that he had suffered physical abuse at the hands of his parents, which led to Defendant Gilfus reporting D.B.'s account to Child Protective Services, which\n   investigated the claim (including interviewing D.B.'s parents at the family home). D.B. never recanted this account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    D.B.'s Use of Antigay Slurs and Comments\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   19. D.B. habitually used \"gay\" and other slurs such as \"faggot\" and \"queer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   20. In fact, in the texts recovered from D.B.'s phone, during the period from December 19, 2013, to March 3, 2014, he used antigay slurs nearly seventy times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   21. On February 27, 2014, the username \"I'm cool\" also stated his belief that homosexuals were \"all fucked up and should be cooked like the Jews were\" and that homosexuals' \"minds r fucked up and they need to be burned in a [sic] oven.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   22. In fact, upon learning that an individual with whom \"I'm cool\" was exchanging texts was homosexual, on February 27, 2014, the username \"I'm cool\" stated, \"Go kill urself,\" \"Get smoked by a fuckin bus,\" and \"So go put a slug thro [sic] ur face and save mankind,\" adding, \"It's Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   23. When asked, \"Did you just say [god] fucked up?\" \"I'm cool\" responded, \"He did when he made gays.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    D.B.'s Urging of Other People to Commit Suicide\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   24. D.B. also told people he did not like, or with whom he was engaging in an argument, to kill themselves. For example, in the three-month period from December 23, 2013, to February 27, 2014, he told at least twenty individuals by text to kill themselves: \"Go kill urself,\" \"I told my friend to kill himself,\" \"K bye now, remember to hold ur deal and kill urself, see you in hell,\" \"Fucking kill urself,\" \"Tell her to kill herself, she flipped on me for sayin [sic] that to her,\" \"Quite bein [sic] a baby and sayin [sic] oh I'm planning on it, grow some balls and jump off a fucking building,\" and \"Ok I know what, fuck u, fuck ur gay ass friends, go fucking dip and crash fords together and try to kill urself, whatever u do, plz succeed and killing urself and all ur gay little friends.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    D.B.'s History of Involvement with the Police and Treatment for Mental Illness\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   25. In first and second grades, D.B. received medical and counseling services from Guardino Elementary School Based Health Clinic (also known as \"Viking Care Clinic\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   26. D.B. received therapeutic counseling from Dr. Douglas Ort from May through September, 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   27.

D.B. also received psychotherapy and other forms of counseling with Dr. John Savino, Dr. Jason Wise, Dr. Raymond Sleszynski, and Dr. Stephen Fitzgerald during various periods between 2010 and 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   29. On or about April 4, 2010, D.B.'s mother and her husband called the police when D.B. refused to get out of the family vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   30. On or about September 12, 2010, D.B.'s mother and/or her husband called the police when D.B. responded to a request to pick up his room by screaming and throwing things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   31. In or about January, 2011, D.B.'s mother and/or her husband called the police with regard to undescribed conduct of D.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   32. In or about February, 2011, D.B.'s mother and/or her husband called the police with regard to undescribed conduct of D.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   33. On or about March 16, 2011, D.B.'s mother called the police when D.B. threw a box of crackers across the room and then pulled a telephone (or its cord) from the wall in an attempt to prevent her from calling the police. D.B. was charged with criminal mischief and received probation through August 1, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   34. On or about May 20, 2011, D.B.'s mother and/or her husband called the police when D.B. became angry and slammed the door to the family home so hard it damaged the door jamb and the lock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   35. On or about August 8, 2011, D.B.'s mother called the police when D.B. had a \"tantrum\" and threw books because D.B.'s mother was unavailable to supervise him using a gun while hunting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   36. In or about January, 2012, D.B.'s mother and/or her husband called the police with regard to undescribed conduct of D.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   37. D.B. was hospitalized at BryLin Hospital for mental health issues from January 27, 2012, through February 4, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   38. D.B. underwent psychotherapy with Dr. Raymond Sleszynski from approximately February 20, 2012, through June 27, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   39. D.B. also received psychological, therapeutic and counseling services at some time between 2008 and March, 2013 from the Children's Home of Jefferson County and Transitional Living Services Waiver Program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   40. An assessment performed by the Children's Home of Jefferson County included information provided by D.B.'s mother and her husband describing D.B.'s serious misconduct, his issues at home, his hatred for his mother and accusations that his parents abused him, and other matters. It made no\n   reference to bullying or harassment at the District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    D.B.'s Propensities for Violence and Lying, and His Distorted Perception of Events\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   41. D.B.'s mother admitted that D.B. \"exaggerates the extent of things over time,\" and \"likes to have control and also play the victim.\" D.B.'s mother has also acknowledged that D.B. lied about incidents that occurred within the home. Dr. Laufer noted, \"It often appears he tries to manipulate events so that he can try to make his parents look bad.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   42. D.B.'s mother contends that D.B.'s report to Defendant Gilfus of physical abuse by his father, which led to a Child Protective Services investigation, was not truthful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   43. D.B.'s psychopharmacologist, Dr. Savino, stated his opinion that D.B. had \"moved his thinking and actions into a totally out of control system,\" that D.B. was \"absolutely convinced that all types of terrible things are perpetrated on him and that he does not do anything serious or threatening,\" and that D.B. \"literally cannot think in a straight manner and he simply has everything distorted to the point where he truly believes that some of these horrible issues are happening to him ... [and] has a hard time seeing that he instigates them; and ... that the consequences are not nearly to the level that he sees them at.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   44. Dr. Savino also found that D.B.'s \"distorting borders on the paranoid and the delusional.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   45. Dr. Sleszynski reached the same conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   46. According to Dr. Laufer's records, D.B. was diagnosed with Mood Disorder NOS, ADHD, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    The District's Policies, Training Programs, Seminars, Presentations, and Prevention Efforts Respecting Bullying, Discrimination, and Harassment Prior to D.B.'s Death\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   47. Students entering the high school receive a student agenda/handbook that includes an age-appropriate summary of the Code of Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   48. In order to graduate, each student within the District must undergo education regarding civic values, cultural/social differences, and developing tolerance and respect for others, as well as how diversity in American social institutions, traditions, and values has contributed to a unique national heritage. This instruction is primarily provided in English, Social Studies, and Health classes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   49. Every year, the guidance counselors every year conduct a program in the elementary schools stressing tolerance and mutual respect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   50. The various schools in the District each have a \"Building Planning Team\" that performs various services, including regular surveys on topics including bullying and harassment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   51. The Building Planning Team survey results are used to generate \"Building Action Plans\" on an annual basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   52. Each year the middle school guidance counselors put on a \"Bullying Prevention Program\" for the students in sixth grade.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   53. Beginning on or about 2008, the District introduced Rachel's Challenge, an anti-bullying and anti-violence program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   54. Activities relating to Rachel's Challenge and posters concerning its message continued through the following years, including at least through the 2011-2012 school year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   55. The elementary schools of the District require students to participate in Developmental Guidance classes that focus on bullying, conflict resolution, empathy, personal safety, and safety in general.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   56. The elementary schools also implement lessons from \"The Great Body Shop\" curriculum that include bullying and empathy topics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   57. During the 2011-2012 school year, the New York State Police conducted a workshop in the middle school concerning bullying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   58. In 2010 and 2013, Jared Campbell conducted an assembly at the middle school and high school that included anti-bullying messages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   59. Defendant Warneck took a course on the requirements of the Dignity for All Students Act (\"DASA\") at the Fulton-Hamilton-Montgomery BOCES, and also watched a one-hour state-produced webinar on the topic, in 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   60.

Parties' Briefing on Defendants' Motion to Strike Deposition Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   Generally, in support of their motion to strike the deposition testimony of Defendants Joseph Gilfus and John Warneck, Defendants assert the following three arguments: (1) it was improper for Plaintiff's counsel to examine the deponents regarding documents not placed before them while implicitly misrepresenting the nature of the documents; (2) Plaintiff's counsel engaged in other improper questioning throughout the depositions of Defendants Gilfus and Warneck, for example (a) Plaintiff's counsel persisted in questioning the deponents concerning documents and matters that the witnesses already testified they did not have any knowledge of, (b) Plaintiff's counsel asked palpably improper questions primarily circling around when Defendant Gilfus \"began\" complying with particular directions that Defendant Gilfus maintained he had always complied with, (c) Plaintiff's counsel engaged in argumentative exchanges and self-serving comments injecting his own opinions in the record rather than asking questions, (d) Plaintiff's counsel interrupted Defendant Gilfus and refused to allow him to complete his answers, and (e) Plaintiff's counsel took the position that Defendants' counsel could not advise his client not to answer a question if the sole source of his information was Defendants' counsel; and (3) the severity and frequency of Plaintiff's counsel's objectionable conduct during the depositions makes individual rulings by the Court impractical and requires striking the deposition transcripts in their entirety. (Dkt. No. 177, Attach. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   Generally, in response to Defendants' motion to strike, Plaintiff asserts the following four arguments: (1) Defendants cite no authority for their contention that allegedly abusive deposition tactics justify striking the entirety of a witness's deposition testimony; (2) the only document at issue in the Gilfus deposition was the Code of Conduct, which speaks for itself; (3) there are other, less drastic, remedies available to the Court than striking because (a) Defendants are able to move to strike any answer to any allegedly improper question at trial, (b) on a motion for summary judgment Defendants may submit an affidavit that does not contradict but may complete the record, and (c) Defendants' counsel was free to ask follow-up questions to place answers in context at the deposition; and (4) Plaintiff's counsel is allowed to try and impeach a witness at a deposition and thus Plaintiff's counsel's argumentative questions provide no basis to strike the Gilfus deposition. (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   Generally, in their reply, Defendants assert the following two arguments: (1) the remedies of moving against individual responses and providing an affidavit clarifying responses are inadequate to protect Defendants from the results of the improper questioning because Plaintiff's counsel's improper conduct pervaded the seven hour-long depositions; (2) Plaintiff's counsel's argumentative questions are not immunized\n   by re-labeling them as \"impeachment.\" (Dkt.

Defendants' Memorandum of Law-in-Chief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   Generally, in support of their motion to for summary judgment, Defendants assert eight arguments. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 179, Attach. 20 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot show that Defendants had actual notice that discriminatory harassment occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Defendants argue that Counts One, Two, Three, Four, and Five (the \"Federal Claims\") must be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to Counts Three and Four against the District and the Board, Defendants argue that there is no admissible evidence that the Board, Warneck, or House, received actual notice of any harassment of D.B. prior to his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to Counts Three and Four against Gilfus, Defendants argue that there is no admissible evidence that Gilfus had actual knowledge of any bias-related harassment of D.B. prior to his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to Counts One, Two, and Five against the District and the Board, Defendants argue that there is no admissible evidence that an individual with authority to take remedial measures had actual knowledge of bias-related harassment of D.B. prior to his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Federal Claims should be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that, in the alternative, the Federal Claims also fail because Plaintiff cannot establish that any bullying, harassment, or discrimination was motivated by gender-stereotyping or disability bias. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that the qualities and habits attributed to D.B. by Plaintiff conform to male stereotypes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Defendants argue that there is no evidence that the students who used slurs such as \"gay,\" \"queer,\" and \"faggot\" in relation to D.B. actually believed that D.B. was homosexual or acted in a way that contrasted with stereotypical male behavior and the use of those words alone is not enough to show gender-based discrimination or harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that there is no admissible evidence establishing that any incident involving D.B. was motivated by his alleged disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that in the alternative, the Federal Claims also fail because the alleged gender stereotyping and disability-related conduct was not sufficiently severe, pervasive, and offensive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that simple teasing and verbal insults do not rise to the level of actionable harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that the incidents here were generally teasing and epithets and those physical in nature were of reasonably low severity, except for the acts of D.B. himself or the fight that he participated in arranging. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is barred from relying on anti-gay slurs to establish a hostile educational environment because D.B. himself participated in the environment of such slurs, indicating that he did not find such an environment subjectively offensive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   Fourth, Defendants argue that, in the alternative, the Federal Claims also fail because Plaintiff cannot show deliberate indifference by Defendants because the District took substantial and meaningful steps to prevent and deter bullying before D.B.'s death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants point to curricular programs, assemblies, presentations, policies, and a Code of Conduct to argue that it is implausible for Plaintiff to suggest that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to disability or gender stereotype-related harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, with regard to the incidents involving D.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   that came to the District's attention, Defendants argue that the responses were not \"clearly unreasonable,\" but were usually completely effective at stopping future incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   Fifth, the individual defendants (Gilfus, Warneck, and House) are protected from liability as a matter of law by the doctrine of qualified immunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that, to the best of the District's knowledge, any issues between D.B. and other students were addressed and ended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Defendants argue that it was clearly reasonable for individual defendants to believe that his actions did not violate D.B.'s rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   Sixth, Defendants argue that Counts Six and Seven (the \"State Claims\") fail because Plaintiff did not timely file a notice of claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that Plaintiff first served a notice of claim on or about May 8, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Defendants argue that, to the extent Plaintiff's State Claims are based on conduct that occurred prior to 90 days before May 8, 2014, they should be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   Seventh, Defendants argue that, in the alternative, Count Seven fails as a matter of law because Plaintiff does not establish that Defendants directly caused the emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiff alleges that Defendants were negligent leading to students bulling or harassing D.B., and only indirectly caused his emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   Eighth, Defendants argue that, in the alternative, because the Federal Claims are all subject to dismissal, the Court should not assume pendant jurisdiction over any surviving State Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   Generally, in response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff asserts two arguments. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 9 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   First, Plaintiff argues that the jury may find in Plaintiff's favor under the gender-stereotyping harassment claims (Counts Four and Five) pursuant to Federal Law for three reasons: (1) the jury may find that D.B. was harassed and bullied because of his perceived sexual orientation and that the harassment was severe and pervasive, because (a) there is sufficient evidence that students routinely questioned D.B.'s sexuality calling him \"faggot,\" \"gay boy,\" and \"gay,\" and the Court should not attempt to make a fact-sensitive determination as to the intentions of those slurs, (b) the jury may find that even gender-neutral attacks against D.B. constituted attacks on his perceived sexual orientation and failure to conform with gender stereotypes (c) it is up to the jury to determine what harassment is actionable and if the harassment is severe, pervasive, objectively offensive, and discriminatory in effect, (d) the fact that D.B. used similarly offensive slurs in his text message exchanges does not mean that the jury must find that he welcomed the harassment, and (e) the jury could find that D.B. was deprived of a disparately hostile educational environment relative to his peers; (2) the jury may find that Defendant Gilfus knew D.B. was subjected to anti-gay bullying on a regular basis because (a) D.B. was bullied for several years and the District was well-aware of this harassment, (b) the jury may also find that the sexual orientation harassment was sufficiently widespread throughout the school that educational officials knew or should have known that D.B. was targeted for this reason, and (c) the jury may find that Gilfus knew about the severe and pervasive harassment and was deliberately indifferent to it; and (3) the jury may find that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to the harassment/bullying because, while some discipline was imposed in a few cases, many reported cases of harassment when unaddressed and undocumented\n   by Gilfus and the discipline that was imposed was not effective in deterring further acts of bullying and harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that the jury may find in favor of Plaintiff's State Claims for the following four reasons: (1) Plaintiff timely filed a Notice of Claim and, in any event, New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\"CPLR\") \u00a7 208 provides for tolling of the statute of limitations where the person entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy at the time the cause of action accrues; (2) Plaintiff may prevail on the negligent supervision claim because (a) negligent supervision claims involving student bullying are not analyzed under the deliberate indifference standard (given that, instead, schools are under a duty to adequately supervise students in their care and will be held liable for foreseeable injuries proximately related to the absence of adequate supervision), (b) the adequacy of supervision and proximate cause are issues of fact for the jury, and (c) the evidence in support of the federal deliberate indifference claims necessarily support the negligent supervision claim except that the negligent supervision claim does not require that D.B. was bullied or harassed because of his perceived sexual orientation; (3) Plaintiff may prevail on the negligent-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim because the injuries to D.B. were foreseeable and it is the jury's duty to determine whether Defendants' negligence caused Plaintiff's injuries; and (4) to the extent the Court dismisses the Federal Claims, this Court should still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the State Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   Generally, in their reply, Defendants assert six arguments. (Dkt. No. 194 [Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-455\">\n   First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot rely on hearsay from D.B. and has failed to present any admissible evidence to support essential allegations and elements of its claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not satisfy its burden by relying on testimony that was on its face hearsay and simply asserting that it was hearsay within an exception without specifying the exception. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot prevail on its Federal Claims for three reasons: (1) Plaintiff failed to point to any evidence that Defendants House and Warneck had actual knowledge that D.B. was experiencing gender or disability based harassment and Plaintiff failed to point to any evidence that any District policymaker had such knowledge; (2) there is no admissible evidence of actual knowledge of severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment based on gender stereotyping or disability bias, (2) Plaintiff's alternative arguments relating to actual knowledge are without merit because (a) the admissible evidence of alleged incidents does not create a genuine issue as to whether Defendants knew of them, and (b) Plaintiff relies on hearsay including but not limited to reports allegedly made by D.B. and anonymous surveys of students which are inadmissible and fail to depict the kind of open and notorious harassment that would lead to a reasonable inference that Defendants were aware of it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot rely on bare terms like \"gay\" and \"faggot\" to establish that gender stereotyping was the motive for alleged harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   Fourth, Defendants argue that they were not deliberately indifferent to known bias-related harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, Defendants argue that in, relying on hearsay, Plaintiff argues that D.B.'s classmates witnessed individuals engage in hostile, retaliatory acts or comments towards D.B. after\n   Defendants took steps to separate D.B. and the other involved student(s). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is not claiming that Defendants did not respond at all, but instead arguing that Defendants should have taken other measures that D.B.'s mother would have preferred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   Fifth, Defendants argue that qualified immunity applies even where a right is \"clearly established\" if the official acts under an objectively reasonable belief that he has not violated that right. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   Sixth, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not met Defendants' arguments regarding its State Claims for three reasons: (1) Plaintiff did not address Defendants arguments regarding the period for serving a notice of claim but instead focused on the tolling of the statute of limitations which was not an issue raised by Defendants; (2) Plaintiff has not addressed Defendants' argument that Count Seven fails for lack of direct causation of injury; and (3) in the alternative, if the Court dismisses the Federal Claims, it should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the State Claims.

To the extent Count Four is not subsumed by Count Five, for the reasons discussed herein, Count Four still is dismissed because there is insufficient evidence to establish a claim of gender-based discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   As set forth above in Part I.B. of this Decision and Order and after considering Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Facts in Dispute (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 8), Plaintiff does not present any admissible evidence that (1) Defendants Gilfus, Warneck, House, and/or any other \"appropriate person\" with authority to enact remedial measures, had actual knowledge that the gender discrimination harassment occurred and/or (2) the alleged acts of students were motivated by sex or gender discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 189; Dkt. No. 179, Attach. 33, at 160-163.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   Arguably, Plaintiff identified three incidents in which employees of the District had knowledge that D.B. was bullied or harassed, taking place under an operation of the District. Furthermore, there is admissible evidence that the incidents involved some indicia of sex or gender stereotyping or disability bias.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a\n   teacher, a bus driver, and a studyhall monitor are not the same as Defendants Gilfus, House, Warneck or other individual within the District with authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf. As set forth above in Part I.B.\u00b6 69 of this Decision and Order, it is undisputed that teachers, bus drivers, and studyhall monitors do not possess such authority. While Plaintiff cites to surveys conducted in the District to support its claims, these surveys are unsworn, unsigned, anonymous hearsay and thus are inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   Moreover, there were two (possibly three) instances identified by M.M.2, in which M.M.2 witnessed harassment of D.B., and thereafter D.B. went to the office, where M.M.2 could see D.B. speaking to Defendant Gilfus but could not hear what D.B. was saying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first instance was the S.S. Punch Incident; however, there is no indication that this incident involved any discriminatory motive based on gender stereotyping or disability bias. (Part I.B.\u00b6 308 of this Decision and Order). The second instance was the D.W. Slurs Incident regarding which M.M.2 testified that she heard D.W. call D.B. a \"faggot\" multiple times in the hallways and that on one or two occasions D.B. went to the office and M.M.2 could see D.B. speaking to Defendant Gilfus but could not hear what D.B. was saying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   The Court does not find that such equivocal and incomplete statements by M.M.2 regarding D.B.'s possible report are enough to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial regarding whether Defendants had actual notice of gender stereotyping harassment of D.B. The Court finds this especially in light of Defendant Gilfus' testimony that, \"[p]rior to D.B.'s death, no-one, including D.B. himself, ever stated to me that any District student had used an antigay slur or a slur suggesting gender stereotyping or disability discrimination with respect to D.B., except on one occasion in connection with the January 2013 A.M.

Slurs Incident is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendants had actual notice of gender stereotyping harassment of D.B., the Court would still find that Plaintiff's failed to establish the harassment was so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be rationally found to have deprived D.B. of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sauerhaft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201576467\">\n    2009 WL 1576467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (holding that, while \"the three e-mails sent to [a student] were objectively offensive, they do not constitute harassment so severe and pervasive that a jury could find that the standard for establishing Title IX liability is met here\"),\n   <em>\n    aff'd,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.S. v.

It is clear that D.B.'s mother was on notice of the alleged harm D.B. was suffering due to the bullying. (Dkt. No. 179, Attach. 24, at 99;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 27.) In fact, D.B.'s mother testified that she told Defendant Gilfus after the January 2013 A.M. Bus Incident that she was concerned D.B. would \"end up either killing himself or it would be the next Columbine.\" (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 24, at 99.) However, Plaintiff waited until May 8, 2014, to file a Notice of Claim, which was within the requisite ninety days after D.B.'s death. (Dkt. No. 19, Attach. 2; Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 7, at \u00b6 388.) Plaintiff argues that, because the statute of limitations was tolled pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 208, due to D.B.'s infancy, so too was the deadline to file a notice of claim pursuant to New York Education Law \u00a7 3813 and General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e. The Court need not, and does not, reach this thorny issue because the Court declines to exercise pendant jurisdiction in this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-501\">\n   For these reasons, Counts Six and Seven are dismissed pursuant to Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Further, as set forth above in Part I.B. of this Decision and Order, the Court disregarded any of Plaintiff's arguments, unsupported denials, denials based on lack of knowledge, and non-responsive factual assertions in response\n   to Defendants' Statement of Material Facts. In addition, the Court deemed admitted facts not expressly denied and supported by accurate record citations. The Court also deemed Plaintiff's \"Counter Rule 7.1 Statement of Material Facts\" (Dkt.

The Court finds that these messages are either not admissible or not material to deciding Defendants' motions. As an initial matter, there is no evidence before the Court that Defendants had actual knowledge of these messages prior to D.B.'s death. In addition, the Court does not interpret Defendants' motion as arguing that Plaintiff lacks damages or the ability to prove that its damages are caused by Defendants. Instead, Defendants' arguments center around whether there is admissible evidence that Defendants or other members of the District with authority to address alleged discrimination and institute corrective measures had actual knowledge of bullying or harassment of D.B. on the basis of a protected characteristic. Moreover, without D.B.'s testimony, a trier of fact is unable to confirm whether D.B. sent the messages in question. Merely because a message is transmitted by a certain phone number or username is not necessarily evidence that a particular person sent that message. This is particularly true in a high school setting where not all students may have a mobile phone and students may borrow or periodically use another's phone for various reasons. For all of these reasons, the Court finds that the messages on D.B.'s phone before his death regarding stressors in his life are not material for purposes of this motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-512\">\n    Plaintiff's denial of the ability to confirm this assertion of fact is insufficient to create an issue of fact and the Court will deem it an admission.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     F.D.I.C. v.

However, Plaintiff still failed to establish an issue of fact as to Defendant Gilfus' knowledge. First, Plaintiff directed the Court to its statement of additional material facts in dispute (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 8, at \u00b6\u00b6 135, 141), wherein it cited the testimony of A.B. A.B. testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-526\">\n    Q: Did you ever hear anybody call D a retard?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-527\">\n    A: Yeah.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-528\">\n    Q: Who?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-529\">\n    A: I don't know.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-530\">\n    Q: How often did that happen?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-531\">\n    A: I heard it one time in our Earth Science class. Sometimes we would be behind on Earth Science labs and the teacher had told D, you have to get these labs done. You should stay after class or after school, which I would do as well and I heard somebody just plainly say retard, that's it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-532\">\n    Q: To your knowledge did the teacher hear that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-533\">\n    A: Said, hey, cut it out.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-534\">\n    (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 22, at 11.) Whether a teacher was aware of such statements is not the same as Defendant Gilfus having actual knowledge of the incident. Plaintiff's statement of additional material facts in dispute also identified the testimony of M.M.2, wherein M.M.2 testified that she witnessed two middle school students push D.B. into a snow bank stating, \"That's where you belong.\" (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 8, at \u00b6 141.) Such a report by M.M.2 to Gilfus would not have put Defendant Gilfus on actual notice that D.B. was being harassed or bullied on the basis of any protected characteristic, or that D.B. had been called an antigay slur, a slur relating to gender stereotyping, or a slur relating to disability bias. Second, Plaintiff cited to two incidents from the deposition testimony of M.M.2. (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 7, at \u00b6 92.) With regard to the first incident described by M.M.2, M.M.2 testified that she reported to teacher Mrs. Flick that D.B. would be late to class because he was in the office reporting someone saying harsh words to him. (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 56, at 62.) Again, Mrs. Flick is not the same as Defendant Gilfus. In addition, reporting that \"someone\" said \"harsh words\" alone would not have put anyone on actual notice that D.B. was being harassed or bullied on the basis of any protected characteristic, or that D.B. had been called an antigay slur, a slur relating to gender stereotyping, or a slur relating to disability bias. With regard to the second incident described by M.M.2, M.M.2 testified that she heard D.B. tell Defendant Gilfus that he wanted to talk to Defendant Gilfus because there were kids calling him names. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 66.) Again, this is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant Gilfus had actual notice that D.B. was being harassed or bullied on the basis of any protected characteristic, or that D.B. had been called an antigay slur, a slur relating to gender stereotyping, or a slur relating to disability bias. This is particularly true in light of other allegations Plaintiff made that are not actionable, e.g., referring to D.B. as \"welfare\" (Dkt. No. 28, at \u00b6 5), teasing D.B. for his phone and comparing phones (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 114), and the rumor that D.B. was having sex with animals (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 130).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-535\">\n    Plaintiff disputed this fact and directed the Court to its statement of additional material facts in dispute (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 8, at \u00b6 144), wherein it cited the testimony of Defendant House. Plaintiff cited to page 65 of Defendant House's deposition testimony, which was omitted from the excerpts from Defendant House's deposition submitted by Plaintiff (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 13) and Defendants (Dkt. No. 179, Attach. 44). In addition, Plaintiff's argument appears to be an attack on Defendant House's credibility, which as discussed above in footnote 12 of this Decision and Order, is insufficient to establish an issue of fact for trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-536\">\n    As set forth above in footnote 2 of this Decision and Order, where a non-movant neither admits nor disputes a fact, the response is deemed an admission. In addition, Plaintiff's answer is non-responsive and does not identify any citation in the record to Defendant Warneck's knowledge of D.B.'s existence prior to his death, that D.B. was being harassed or bullied on the basis of any protected characteristic, or that D.B. had been called an antigay slur or a slur relating to gender stereotyping or disability bias.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-537\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that S.S. was a student known to bully D.B. or had bullied D.B.

Plaintiff attempts to hide behind D.B.'s mother's deposition testimony and argues that, based on her testimony, it is unclear whether she personally heard D.B. tell Defendant Gilfus about T.M.'s comment or whether D.B. later told her that he told Defendant Gilfus about T.M.'s comment. (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 7, at \u00b6 106.) The Court finds that it is most plausible that D.B.'s mother heard from D.B. that D.B. reported to Defendant Gilfus that T.M. told D.B. to \"go back to your doctor.\" Otherwise, D.B.'s mother would have testified that D.B. told her and Defendant Gilfus about T.M.'s comment, which is not how D.B.'s mother testified. However, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff for purposes of this motion for summary judgment, and assuming that D.B.'s mother did in fact hear D.B. tell Defendant Gilfus about the incident with T.M., the Court still finds that the statement of T.M. to D.B. and D.B.'s recitation of it to either to his mother or Defendant Gilfus is at least one layer of inadmissible hearsay. Further, Defendant Gilfus testified that he had no knowledge of the incident between T.M. and D.B. (Dkt.

In addition, the Court is entitled to consider affidavits or declarations on a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).

It is undisputed that, of those sources listed above, B.H. is the individual who was present for the January 2013 A.M. Bus Incident, thus the other sources all constitute inadmissible hearsay.

Taking M.M.2's testimony as true, the Court finds that the statement still does not establish that Defendant Gilfus had actual knowledge that students were calling D.B. a \"psycho\" and saying that he needed to see a shrink or go back to his doctor. Plaintiff also cites to Defendant Gilfus' Annual Professional Performance Review, which states that Defendant Gilfus needed to \"maintain formal and informal records on students, parents and staff. The district does not want to be in another situation like the Briggs looking for notes that were sent to the school but not kept.\" (Dkt. No. 189, Attach. 43, at 10.) However, as explained by the affidavit of Defendant House, the statement in Defendant Gilfus' Annual Professional Performance Review regarding \"the need to keep a log of complaints received from parents or students regarding issues other than student discipline ... originated with Plaintiff's claim that although [D.B.'s mother] made complaints to Mr. Gilfus about student disciplinary issues involving D.B., there were no records in his student file concerning the same. I recognized that records pertaining to parent or student complaints about student discipline would be in 'SchoolTool' software used by the District, so I expressly limited the log requirement to issues 'other than student disciplinary issues.'
