FITZWATER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this removed action seeking recovery for a claim for lost rental income and soft costs under a builder's risk insurance policy, defendant Hanover Insurance Company (\"Hanover\") moves for summary judgment on all claims. Plaintiff Hall Arts Center Office, LLC (\"Hall Arts\"), a company engaged primarily in the business of commercial real estate, cross-moves for summary judgment. Hanover and Hall Arts both move to exclude expert witness testimony. For the reasons that follow, the court grants in part and denies in part Hanover's motion for summary judgment, denies Hall Arts's cross-motion for summary judgment, and denies Hanover's and Hall Arts's motions to exclude expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This lawsuit arises from a dispute over Policy No. IHD-9935566, a builder's risk insurance policy (the \"Policy\"), issued to Hall Arts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy covers the construction of an 18-story office building and adjoining retail space at 2323 Ross Avenue in Dallas (the \"KPMG Plaza\"). Hall Arts owns KPMG Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Turner Construction (\"Turner\") was the general contractor for the KPMG Plaza construction. The contract between Hall Arts and Turner set two progress milestones for the project: (1) a topping-out and dry-in date\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of November 1, 2014, and (2) a substantial completion date\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of April 1, 2015. Turner commenced construction on August 1, 2013. Over one year later, on October 13, 2014 rainwater leaked through openings in the temporary roof and damaged one of the high-voltage bus ducts (\"Bus Duct B\") (the \"Weather Event\"). Bus Duct B was intended to deliver electricity to mechanical equipment on various floors of the property. Bus Duct B was repaired and energized by November 25, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The relevant tenant of KPMG Plaza in this case is KPMG. KPMG's lease provides\n   that it will lease about 150,000 square feet of the building, spanning from the third through seventh floors to part of the eighth floor. KPMG was originally scheduled to commence its tenant fit-out, or the process of preparing the interior space for KPMG's occupancy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on December 22, 2014, and, prior to the Weather Event, voluntarily delayed its tenant fit-out to January 1, 2015. KPMG did not actually commence the tenant fit-out process until January 14, 2015. On January 20, 2015 the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department (\"DFRD\") halted the fit-out, requiring Hall Arts to complete certain fire alarm and life safety items before resuming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   DFRD, Hall Arts, and Turner agreed to a revised list of required items on January 30, 2015. KPMG commenced its actual occupancy of KPMG Plaza, and paying rent to Hall Arts, on July 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Section 3.1 of the KPMG lease specifies when KPMG is to begin paying rent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Rent will accrue beginning on the date ('Commencement Date') which is the earlier to occur of: (i) the commencement of occupancy of the Premises by Tenant for the normal conduct of business; or (ii) the date that is nine (9) months following ['Construction Move-In Period'] the Delivery Date (but in no event prior to (1) Substantial Completion...of Landlord's Premises Work ..., (2) Substantial Completion of Landlord's Building Work ..., and (3) receipt of Certificates of Occupancy for the Core and Shell with respect to the Premises[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   D. 3/30/\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Ohio%20App.%20232\">\n    18 App. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hanover and Turner met on June 11, 2015 to \"finalize the builder's risk claim.\" During the meeting, Turner mentioned the possibility that Hall Arts could have a delay claim for soft costs and loss of rental income stemming from the Weather Event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hall Arts submitted a second claim for soft costs and loss of rental income on November 10, 2015. Hall Arts attached an interim expert report by Navigant Consulting, Inc. (\"Navigant Consulting\"), which calculated Hall Arts's damages. The claim included lost rental income from tenants, including KPMG and other tenants,\n   as well as soft costs, including interest on construction loans and realty taxes. At that time, Turner estimated that the Weather Event resulted in 54 days of lost rental income from KPMG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Hanover acknowledged receipt of the claim on November 16, 2015, and, on December 3, 2015 emailed Hall Arts stating that no determination could be made at the time and that Hall Arts would be informed if further documentation was needed. Two weeks later, Hanover requested additional documentation, including the original schedules for June, July, October, November, and December 2014, along with the biweekly schedule meeting minutes for July, September, and October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 30, 2015 Hall Arts sent Hanover the construction schedules for June, July, August, and December 2014, and meeting minutes for the months of July, September, and October 2014. Hanover wrote back on January 15, 2016 that the supplied information was insufficient to permit Hanover to review the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 7, 2016 Hall Arts responded with additional information, including an October schedule update that was conducted in November 2014. Hall Arts also proposed a meeting between the parties and consultants to finalize the claim. Hanover stated that it would review the materials and advise on the next course of action. On March 30, 2016 Hall Arts sent a follow up email, again suggesting a meeting between the parties and their consultants. Hanover responded that it would deliver a report soon and would discuss a meeting later, if warranted. The report, produced by Hanover's consultant, Michael S. Eddings of PT &amp; C LWG Forensic Consulting Services, concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The Loss of Business Income Claim for this project could not be accurately evaluated because of the lack of information supporting the claim. To properly evaluate the claim, original construction schedules for the months of August 2014 through December 2014 were needed. Original Master Construction Schedules for June, July, and August of 2014 were received. Schedule Updates for November 2014 and Revised Master Construction Schedule for December 2014 were received, Request for the missing Original Master Construction Schedules for the months of September, October, and November, and December of 2014 were requested via e-mail on February 10, 2016 (Attachment E, E-mail request prepared by Eric Clontz). The requested Original Master Construction Schedules were not received and therefore, the Loss of Business Income Claim cannot be accurately evaluated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174. Hall Arts's insurance coverage counsel wrote back via email that Hall Arts had given substantial information to Hanover, which should have allowed Hanover to investigate how the Weather Event impacted the construction schedule. Hall Arts again proposed an in-person meeting to resolve issues regarding the soft loss claim. A different consultant to Hanover, Constantine \"Gus\" Cois (\"Cois\"), a Senior\n   Project Manager for DBI Construction Consultants, LLC (\"DBI\"), sent notice to Hall Arts of various inconsistencies in Hall Arts's documentation. The notice also requested further documentation and stated that a supplemental request might be necessary. Hanover requested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , meeting minutes that Hall Arts had not yet provided and all updated schedules from October 2014 through project completion. Hall Arts responded in a letter on August 3, 2016, clarifying its position that lost rental income should be calculated based on the tenant fit-out date and not any other completion date (e.g., substantial completion of the building). Hall Arts also attached the requested additional documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Hall Arts and Hanover met on August 16, 2016 to discuss the delay claim. While the parties came to no conclusions at the meeting, Hall Arts understood Hanover to state that it would provide Hall Arts with a coverage determination by the end of August. On August 30, 2016, following review of Hall Arts's documentation, Cois, acting on behalf of Hanover, sent Hall Arts another request for documentation. As of the time of this lawsuit, Hanover has not yet made a determination on Hall Arts's delay coverage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Hall Arts brought this lawsuit in state court to enforce the delay in completion coverage part and Hanover's duty under Texas law to investigate and respond to its policyholder's request for coverage. In its state-court petition, Hall Arts alleges claims for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of Chapter 541 and Chapter 542 of the Texas Insurance Code. Hanover removed the case to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As part of the pretrial discovery process, Hall Arts disclosed an expert report from Bryan T. Byrd (\"Byrd\"), President of Synergen Consulting International, LP, Hall Arts's retained expert. Byrd's report focuses on delay of the tenant fit-out date resulting from the Weather Event's delay of completion of permanent parts of KPMG Plaza that were critical to commencing KPMG's fit-out. Byrd opined that the Weather Event resulted in 48 days of lost rental income from KPMG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hall Arts also submitted a report by Kevin O'Toole (\"O'Toole\"), a Managing Director with Navigant Consulting. O'Toole's report relied on Byrd's finding of a 48-day delay to estimate that Hall Arts's lost rental income and soft costs totaled $[redacted] as result of the delay caused by the Weather Event. This amount included $[redacted] of lost KPMG rental income and $[redacted] in additional soft costs. The soft costs amount covers $[redacted] of insurance premiums that Hall Arts paid to extend coverage under the Policy from March 8, 2015 to June 15, 2015, as well as a holdover penalty of $[redacted] paid by KPMG and reimbursed by Hall Arts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hanover submitted an expert report by Cois, which focused instead on the substantial completion date and completion of top-out/dry-in dates set forth in the Turner construction contract. Based on these contractual milestones, Cois concluded that no delay resulted from the Weather Event because the top-out/dry-in date was not delayed and the substantial completion of KPMG Plaza as a whole, including the\n   restaurant, retail space, and art walk, was delayed as a result of other events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hanover now moves for summary judgment on all of Hall Arts's claims, and it moves to exclude Hall Arts's expert witness testimony to be offered through Byrd and O'Toole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hall Arts cross-moves for summary judgment on all of its claims, and it moves to exclude the opinions and proposed testimony of Hanover's expert, Cois. All motions are opposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Hanover moves for summary judgment on claims for which Hall Arts will have the burden of proof at trial. Because Hall Arts will have the burden of proof, Hanover's burden at the summary judgment stage is to point the court to the absence of evidence of any essential element of Hall Arts's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

App. 2002, pet. denied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court focuses solely on the third element: whether Hanover breached the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Hall Arts moves for summary judgment on its claim that Hanover breached the Policy by requesting documents not required by the Policy as a precondition of coverage and by changing the scope of documents it requested. Hanover responds that no language of the Policy bars it from requesting the construction schedules or additional documentation of the progress of the project. The court agrees with Hanover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Policy specifies that, when making a coverage determination, Hanover considers certain items, such as \"the probable experience during the time of 'delay' had no loss occurred\" as well as \"pertinent sources of information and reports including...reports on feasibility and status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. Hall Arts offers no reason why the documentation that Hanover requested does not qualify either as \"reports on feasibility and status\" or as related to \"the probable experience during the time of 'delay' had no loss occurred.\" Nor does Hall Arts point to any language in the Policy that precluded Hanover, as it proceeded through its investigation, from changing the scope of information required to make a coverage determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, the court denies Hall Arts's motion for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim based on Hanover's request for documents not required by the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court turns next to Hall Arts's claim that Hanover breached the Policy by failing to cover Hall Arts's lost rental income and soft costs. In determining whether Hanover failed to pay a valid delay coverage claim, the court first assesses whether Hall Arts has shown that the Weather Event resulted in a qualifying delay period under the Policy. The court focuses specifically on how a delay period under the Policy can be measured. Hall Arts maintains that it can establish a delay period by showing delay to tenant fit-out of the KPMG-leased space. Hanover posits that the Policy only covers delays to construction milestones for the entire KPMG Plaza, as set forth in the contract between Hall Arts and Turner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   If delay to the tenant fit-out of the KPMG-leased space qualifies as a delay period under the Policy, the court then determines whether a reasonable jury could find that the Weather Event resulted in lost rental income and soft costs to Hall Arts. When considering lost rental income, the court looks to whether the Weather Event delayed the date KPMG began paying rent, per the terms of the KPMG lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Hanover maintains that Hall Arts cannot show that Hanover breached the delay coverage provision because Hall Arts cannot establish the requisite \"delay period\" during which it could recover soft costs and rental income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Policy defines \"delay period\" as \"the period of time the completion of the construction, erection, or fabrication of a covered 'building or structure' is 'delayed' as a result of direct physical loss or damage caused by a covered peril to property covered under the Builders' Risk Coverage form to which this coverage part is attached.\" P. 3/30/\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Ohio%20App.%2049\">\n    18 App. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hanover posits that the covered \"building or structure\" is the entire KPMG Plaza, as defined by the jobsite description in the delay coverage schedule. Hanover contends that Hall Arts has not presented evidence that the delay coverage provision applies to the Weather Event because the overall construction of KPMG plaza was not delayed. Hall Arts responds that the delay to KPMG's tenant fit-out of the KPMG-leased space qualifies as a \"delay period\" because several items, including Bus Duct B and the fire protection and life-safety equipment in the building, qualify under the Policy as the covered \"building or structure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court disagrees with Hanover's characterization of the delay coverage provision. The Policy does not define a covered \"building or structure\" with reference to the jobsite description. Instead, the Policy defines \"Buildings or Structures\" in the definition section to mean: \"a. buildings; b. structures; c. materials and supplies that will become a permanent part of the buildings or the structures; and d. foundations, excavations, grading, filling, attachments, permanent fencing, and other permanent fixtures.\" P. 3/30/\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Ohio%20App.%2044\">\n    18 App. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the materials and supplies that would become a permanent part of the office building at KPMG Plaza fall under subsection c of the Policy's definition of \"Buildings or Structures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court is not persuaded by the two cases that Hanover cites for the proposition that builder's risk coverage provisions do not cover delays to the construction of components of the overall project.

That provision limited coverage to \"[delays] in completion of the project described in the Declarations portion of this Policy,\" which was the entire condominium complex and not individual condominium units.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.

Pa. Nov. 24, 2010), the court similarly relied on the text of the insurance policy, which covered soft costs during the period of delay in completion of the \"project.\" The \"project\" was defined as the total construction of the existing structure at 1103-13 Locust Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the seven floors being added.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204812990\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These cases are distinguishable from the instant case, which involves a delay coverage provision that does not explicitly define coverage with reference to the overall project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nor is the court persuaded by Hanover's textual argument that the term \"and,\" which is found following subsection c in the Policy definition of \"building or structure,\" is conjunctive and therefore requires Hall Arts to establish delay to a \"building or structure,\" i.e., the entire KPMG Plaza, as opposed to items that represent but one component of a building or structure. Texas courts have accepted both conjunctive and disjunctive constructions of the term \"and.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trammell Crow Residential Co. v. Am. Prot. Ins.

In the instant case, interpreting the term \"and\" as conjunctive in the definitional section would create an ambiguity. Such a reading would be incongruous with the delay coverage provision's reference to \"a covered building\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   structure.\" P. 3/30/\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Ohio%20App.%2044\">\n    18 App. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, under the delay coverage provision, there would be coverage for delay in constructing, erecting, or fabricating a building\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   structure. But under the definition of \"Buildings or Structures,\" an insured would not be covered unless the structure were both a building and a structure. P. 3/30/\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Ohio%20App.%2044\">\n    18 App. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concludes that reading \"and\" in the definitional provision as disjunctive is more consistent with the Policy as a whole. Hall Arts's evidence of delay to the construction of \"materials and supplies that will become a permanent part of the buildings or the structures\" of KPMG Plaza is sufficient to avoid dismissal of its breach of contract claim at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the court declines to dismiss Hall Arts's breach of contract claim on the basis that the delay coverage provision does not apply to the Weather Event because the Weather Event did not delay construction of the overall KPMG Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Hanover also maintains that the court should dismiss the breach of contract claim because Hall Arts has not presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that a loss in rental income resulted from a delay to construction of the office building at KPMG Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Policy covers \"actual loss of rental income incurred during the delay period\" that \"arises out of a delay to a building or structure at a jobsite described on the Delay in Completion Schedule.\" P. 3/30/\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Ohio%20App.%2051\">\n    18 App. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The central question, then, is whether the Weather Event delayed the date that rent from KPMG was scheduled to begin accruing. The KPMG lease specifies that rent will accrue beginning on the date that is the earlier of: (i) KPMG's commencement of occupancy for the normal conduct of business; or (ii) nine months following the delivery date, so long as the date is not earlier than the date of substantial completion of landlord's premises work or substantial completion of landlord's building work. In analyzing whether the lost rental income provision applies, the court examines whether the Weather Event resulted in delays to construction of the KPMG-leased space and whether such delays ultimately delayed the delivery date or the commencement of KPMG's occupancy of the space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, the court concludes that there is a material factual dispute regarding whether delay to the commencement of occupancy of the premises by KPMG for the normal conduct of business resulted from the Weather Event. The parties disagree about the date on which KPMG could actually have occupied its office space, but for the Weather Event. [redacted]. Hanover, relying on the KPMG lease, maintains that the earliest KPMG could actually have occupied the building was July 1, 2015. Hanover points to the latest date of completion\n   of the Landlord's Building Work, set by the lease as June 30, 2015, as evidence that KPMG could not occupy the building before July 1, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the KPMG lease, the parties dispute whether, but for the Weather Event, rent would have begun accruing on June 1, 2015 or July 1, 2015. The date rent begins accruing, per the KPMG lease, is the\n   <em>\n    earlier\n   </em>\n   of KPMG's actual occupancy of the building or the date nine months after the delivery date (at the latest, July 1, 2015). The date KPMG's actual occupancy was scheduled to start, but for the Weather Event, is central to determining whether actual rental income was lost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the parties also present conflicting evidence regarding the extent of delay resulting from other factors unrelated to the Weather Event. It is undisputed that the electrical storm occurred on October 13, 2014; that KPMG's tenant improvements were originally scheduled to begin on December 22, 2014; and that KPMG later postponed commencement of tenant fit-out until January 1, 2015. Hanover points to DFRD's shutdown of tenant fit-out for several weeks in January. It is undisputed that KPMG began the layout of its tenant space on January 14, 2015, and that DFRD halted the tenant buildout on January 20, 2015. Turner then resumed tenant buildout on January 30, 2015, a few weeks after agreeing with DFRD regarding certain required safety items. Hanover presents evidence of delay by DFRD from January 14, 2015 to February 17, 2015 that contributed to delay in the tenant fit-out process and the date when KPMG could occupy the office building. Hall Arts adduces its own evidence that the requirements imposed by DFRD did not ultimately differ from what the Project originally contemplated and thus did not result in delay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that delays caused by DFRD constitute an order by a civil authority, which would not qualify as a \"covered peril\" under the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The extent\n   of DFRD's delays to KPMG's occupancy is thus dispositive to the question of Hanover's liability under the delay coverage provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [redacted]\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Given the significant number of disputed material facts, the court is unable to make a determination on whether and to what extent the Weather Event caused Hall Arts to lose rental income from KPMG. It is thus unable to determine whether Hanover breached the Policy by failing to cover Hall Arts's lost rental income claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Hanover also maintains that Hall Arts has not shown that Hanover breached the Policy because Hall Arts has not presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the Weather Event resulted in soft costs. Hall Arts posits that the 48-day delay to KPMG's occupancy arising from the Weather Event required Hall Arts to extend its insurance policy to cover the additional construction. Hall Arts also seeks to claim a one-month holdover penalty it reimbursed as a result of KPMG's being unable to move into KPMG Plaza according to schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court denies Hanover's motion for summary judgment on this basis for the same reasons set out\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 IV(A)(3). Given the number of genuine issues of material facts, the court is unable to make a determination at the summary judgment stage on whether and to what extent the Weather Event delayed Hall Arts's occupancy of KPMG Plaza. It is thus unable to determine whether Hanover is liable for the holdover penalty and the 48 additional days of insurance premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly the court denies Hanover's motion for summary judgment and Hall Arts's cross-motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court turns next to Hall Arts's claim that Hanover breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by delaying payment on Hall Arts's delay claim for over 28 months and by conducting an investigation designed to defeat a finding of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"Under Texas law, there is a duty on the part of the insurer to deal fairly and in good faith with an insured in the processing of claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham v.

O'Toole was initially engaged by Hall Arts to prepare its first party claim for loss of rental income, additional soft costs, and general administrative costs. O'Toole's expert report relied on Byrd's conclusion that a 48-day delay in KPMG's lease resulted from the Weather Event. O'Toole estimated, based on KPMG's lease and the rent rolls, that KPMG was obligated by the lease to pay Hall Arts $[redacted] per day in rent. O'Toole concluded that the total loss of net rental income resulting from the Weather Event was $[redacted]. O'Toole also concluded that the 48-day delay in the commencement date of KPGM's lease led Hall Arts to incur $[redacted] in soft costs, which included $[redacted] in extended insurance premiums and $[redacted] of a holdover penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Hanover does not dispute that Byrd and O'Toole are both qualified to testify regarding forensic accounting and construction schedule analysis. Hanover maintains instead that Byrd and O'Toole's opinions are not relevant. It posits that the Policy assesses delay in completion coverage based on the delayed completion of the project rather than on the tenant's build out schedule. Hanover contends that both Byrd's report and O'Toole's report are irrelevant because they analyze the Weather Event's effect on the tenant build out schedule and delays to tenant occupancy rather than the overall completion date, which is the relevant date for establishing a delay period under the Policy.

O'Toole first considered the terms of the KPMG Lease, which provide that KPMG was to lease 176,016 square feet spanning the eighth\n   through fifteenth floor of the office building at $[redacted] per square foot, and 6,096 square feet on the ninth floor at $[redacted] per square foot. O'Toole estimated that the saved operating expenses, including those associated with elevator operations, cleaning, HVAC systems, management fees, maintenance, payroll, and courtesy patrol, for the days KPMG Plaza did not operate at full capacity, totaled $[redacted] per day. He then multiplied this number by the 48-day delay and the proportion of the total square footage leased by KPMG (57.66%). He deducted this amount from the total lost rental revenue to reach $[redacted], the total loss of net rental income. O'Toole also explains that he attributed the holdover penalty resulting from KPMG's extension of its stay in its previously leased space to the 48-day delay measured by Byrd because this holdup delayed KPMG's date of actual occupancy of KPMG Plaza. O'Toole also estimated that Hall Arts incurred an additional $[redacted] per day in additional insurance premiums, which arose out of Hall Arts's extension of the builders' risk insurance policy to cover the additional time needed to complete tenant fit-out of the KPMG-leased space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   [Redacted]. But Hanover offers no evidence supporting its argument and does not appear to challenge Hall Arts's methodology for calculating lost rental income. Regarding the holdover penalty and insurance premiums, Hanover merely posits that O'Toole did not consider other factors that led Hall Arts to incur such costs; Hanover does not show why O'Toole's finding of causation is so unreliable as to merit exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Curlee v.

In his expert report, Byrd avers that he relied upon all records and documentation made available during the course of litigation up until the time his expert report was submitted. Byrd also testified in his deposition that he considered facts such as the two other HVAC chiller leaks and DFRD's interference with tenant fit-out but simply came to the conclusion that such factors did not impact the critical path to completion of tenant fit-out.

The court has concluded that the Weather Event's delay of the construction of the KPMG-leased space and the associated structures and materials qualifies as a delay period under the Policy. To be admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , Cois's testimony must be relevant to the alleged delay to the construction of the KPMG-leased space and resulting loss of rental income and incurred soft costs.

And the report posits that the building was turned over on October 21, 2014 to allow KPMG to begin tenant fit-out work. The court thus concludes that Cois's testimony could assist the trier of fact in determining a fact in issue: whether the Weather Event delayed either the delivery date\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   or KPMG's occupancy, leading Hall Arts to incur lost rental income and soft costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Accordingly, the court holds that Cois's testimony should not be excluded on relevance grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Hall Arts maintains that Cois's opinions are unreliable because they are not based on sufficient facts or data and because Cois did not employ a recognized methodology in forming his opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In preparing his report, Cois reviewed construction documents and communications produced during the course of litigation. Cois did not review the Policy and the definition of delay period.

KPMG was not scheduled to start its tenant fit-out until January 1, 2015, however, so only 48 days for the 58-day difference was attributable to the Weather Event.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    A holdover penalty is a fee that a tenant who overstays the lease must pay to the landlord in order to extend occupation of the space temporarily.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Hanover has filed objections in which it challenges some of the evidence included with Hall Arts's response to Hanover's motion for summary judgment.

To the extent the court has relied on evidence to which Hanover objects, the objections have been considered on the merits and are overruled.

This language does not foreclose the possibility that Hall Arts's actual occupancy was scheduled to begin June 1, 2015, because substantial completion of landlord's building work could occur before that date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Hanover acknowledges, and Hall Arts does not dispute, that (ii) contemplates a July 1, 2015 date. Neither party addresses whether the Property was actually delivered by October 1, 2014. It appears, based on the rental income provision of the lease, that if delivery occurred in compliance with the terms of the lease, then KPMG's actual occupancy on July 27, 2015 dictates, at the latest, a July 1, 2015 commencement date (the earlier of the two dates in the rental income provision). And if rent would have begun accruing on July 1, 2015 at the latest, then actual occupancy on July 27, 2015 would not have delayed the date rent began accruing because it would still begin accruing by July 1, 2015, which is the earlier of the dates set by (i) and (ii). If rent would have begun accruing on June 1, 2015, however, then KPMG's commencement of actual occupancy on July 27, 2015 would have delayed the date rent began accruing to July 1, 2015 at the latest. In this case, however, KPMG began paying rent on the date of its actual occupancy-July 27, 2015-which, according to KPMG's lease, suggests that the date of actual occupancy occurred prior to the delivery date plus nine months. The court thus cannot determine at the summary judgment stage the Weather Event's role in delaying rental income.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Byrd testified that Turner did not contemplate the five requirements imposed by DFRD, but stated that those five requirements were revised on January 30, 2015 to cover only the items originally scheduled to be completed before tenant fit-out began-tie-in of the fire protection and life safety systems on the critical path to commencing tenant fit-out.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Although Hall Arts states that Hanover fails to show that the shutdown by DFRD is an excluded \"order by civil authority,\" it presents no supporting argument for this proposition and focuses instead on an argument that DFRD did not actually cause any delay to KPMG's occupancy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Because the court holds that there at least exists a genuine factual dispute regarding DFRD's role in the delay, the court does not reach Hanover's argument that Turner also contributed to the delay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The court gives the words of the actual loss of rental income provision their plain meaning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Evanston Ins.
