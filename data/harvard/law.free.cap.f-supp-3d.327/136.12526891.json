A majority of the judges who have addressed the issue have held that the plaintiff must separately exhaust each subsequent discrete act of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273417\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/193/#p201\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   201 ;\n   <em>\n    Mount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338194\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/36/74/#p81\">\n    36 F.Supp.3d at 84-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A minority, however, have held that a plaintiff need not separately exhaust subsequent acts of retaliation that are \"like or reasonably related to\" the acts of retaliation described in the EEO charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273417\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/193/#p201\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   201-02 ;\n   <em>\n    Mount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338194\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/36/74/#p81\">\n    36 F.Supp.3d at 85-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this second approach, the analysis \"centers on whether the allegations that were specifically put before the agency and the new allegations the plaintiff seeks to litigate constitute the same cause of action and are factually similar such that they would be discovered during the agency's investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338194\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/36/74/#p81\">\n    36 F.Supp.3d at 85-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court need not choose between these two approaches, because Redding's claims of retaliation (except those concerning the Division Chief's comments in June and August 2013) fail under either. Under the first, more demanding approach, it is clear that Redding did not exhaust these claims because she never raised them with the agency's EEO office. And she fares no better under the second approach, because, as set forth below, the subsequent acts of retaliation are not \"like or reasonably related\" to the claims that Redding did raise in the EEO charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, Redding has not exhausted her allegation that, in October 2016, DIA determined she was not eligible for promotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Her EEO charge claimed that DIA failed to promote her based on her race and age, and that the Division Chief's comments in 2013 amounted to retaliation. Def.'s SoMF \u00b6 3. Redding's operative complaint in this Court alleges that she was reassigned to a new position in April 2014; that she was reassigned yet again in November 2014, at which time her title was changed from \"Branch Chief\" to \"Supervisor\"; and that since December 2014, she \"has shared duties and workspace with co-workers\" who have a lower paygrade. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-55. The qualitative differences between these later acts of retaliation and the acts alleged in the EEO charge (Redding's nonpromotion and the Division Chief's comments) preclude a finding that they were like or reasonably related to one another, under the test as applied in this\n   Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273417\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/193/#p201\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding \"disparaging statements\" were not like or reasonably related to \"pay-discrimination\" alleged in EEO charge);\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

DIA's investigation could not have been reasonably expected to uncover them, because of the temporal distance between them and the allegations in her EEO charge that were actually investigated. DIA dismissed the sole retaliation claim in her EEO charge, which was based on the Division Chief's comments in June and August 2013, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SoMF \u00b6 4.

But the EEOC administrative judge denied her motion, and had at least two valid grounds for doing so.

Ex. 7, at 2. Thus, Redding was required to return to the agency EEO office to exhaust them. Second, as the administrative judge noted, Redding's motion was untimely: she waited until December 2015 to seek leave to amend, even though the conduct at issue began in December 2014 and she had been represented by counsel throughout.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Burkes v.
