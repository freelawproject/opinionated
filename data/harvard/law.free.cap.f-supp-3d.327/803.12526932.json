Plaintiffs Rosemont Taxicab Co., Inc. (\"Rosemont\") and Germantown Cab Company (\"GCC\") filed this lawsuit alleging that the PPA's practice violates their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and parallel provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution (Counts I and II). They also seek declaratory relief that a Pennsylvania statute and the PPA implementing regulations permitting warrantless seizures of taxicabs are unconstitutional \"as applied\" (Count III). Finally, GCC alleges state law claims for conversion (Count IV), trespass to chattels (Count V), and fraud (Count VI). Presently pending are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment based on a stipulation of facts (\"Stip.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the\n   PPA's warrantless seizure of Plaintiffs' vehicles is prima facie unconstitutional, and the absence of pre-deprivation procedures denied Plaintiffs due process of law. We also conclude that Defendants have failed to meet their summary judgment burden to show they are entitled to their proffered affirmative defenses on Plaintiffs' constitutional claims. Finally, we conclude that, while Plaintiffs have demonstrated that there are no genuine issues of material fact and they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their constitutional claims, GCC cannot demonstrate the elements of its state law claims as a matter of law. Accordingly, with limited exceptions to be discussed later, we grant Plaintiffs' Motion on liability issues on Counts I, II, and III and deny Defendants' Motion on those Counts; we grant Defendants' Motion for summary judgment with regard to Counts IV, V, and VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Both companies generate revenue by leasing taxicabs to drivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) GCC's CPC provides for limited or \"partial\" operating rights within Philadelphia; it does not authorize \"city wide\" rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)

Section 5714 did not require the PPA to impound vehicles when violations were discovered; neither did it require the PPA to obtain a warrant before impounding a vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) At that time, the PPA interpreted and applied Section 5714 as authorizing it to impound without a warrant any non-medallion vehicle found to be providing \"hail service\" in Philadelphia without legal authority to do so, including licensed taxicabs operating under valid CPCs issued by the PUC, such as those operated by Plaintiffs.

(Stip. \u00b6 22.) The PPA has not impounded any taxicab vehicle operating under a valid CPC issued by either the PPA or the PUC merely for operating outside of its territorial rights.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)

An \"unauthorized taxicab\" is defined as \"[a] vehicle without a current and valid TLD inspection sticker....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Like the Current Impoundment Statute, the Current Impoundment Regulations also do not require the PPA to obtain a warrant before impounding a vehicle for an impoundable offense.

The PUC requires that Plaintiffs' vehicles comply with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\"PennDOT\") Vehicle and Equipment Inspection standards. (Stip. \u00b6 44.) None of Plaintiffs' vehicles at issue in this Litigation had been placed out of service by the PUC at the time of their impoundment by the PPA.

On July 30, 2014, just two days before being impounded by the PPA, the PUC inspected GCC taxicab G91 for safety and the vehicle passed the inspection. (Pl. Ex. I (GCC's 2014 Annual Inspection Report).) The PUC also safety inspected and passed G35 on that date, approximately five weeks before that vehicle was impounded by the PPA for lacking a safety inspection sticker.

(Stip. \u00b6 39.) On that date, the PPA stopped and cited G91 for allegedly providing illegal service by picking up a \"hail fare\" in Philadelphia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 45.) An additional citation was also issued to the driver of G91 for operating without a valid driver certificate. (D.App. Tab 24 (N.T. Aug. 7, 2014 Impoundment Hrg.) at 6-7.) The PPA immediately seized G91 because it lacked a valid PPA inspection sticker, even though it had been inspected two days earlier by the PUC. (Stip. \u00b6 46; Pl. Ex. I.) The PPA did not have a warrant for this seizure and did not provide GCC with pre-deprivation notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to seizing the vehicle. (Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) On August 6, 2014, GCC requested a post-deprivation hearing, and an impoundment hearing was held the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.)

(Stip. \u00b6 94.) At Schmid's instruction, Marshall did not to identify himself to GCC as a PPA Enforcement Officer and did not wear any clothing that would indicate that he was a PPA employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95-97.)

(Stip. \u00b6 100.) However, Marshall had no intention of ever driving G61 as a taxicab-for-hire during his shift and did not engage in any business as a taxicab driver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-02.) Instead, Marshall drove G61 to the PPA's garage at 2415 South Swanson Street in Philadelphia, where the car was inspected by a PPA mechanic.

The inspection revealed multiple problems, including a non-functional airbag, a leaking break line and pinion gear, and a hole in the trunk. (D.App. Tab 29; Marshall Dep. at 348-75.) No one from GCC was notified about, or present during, the PPA's inspection of G61. (Stip. \u00b6 105.) Marshall timely returned the taxicab to GCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.) When he returned the vehicle, he represented to GCC that the PPA stopped him at 30th Street Station to inspect the vehicle. (Stip. \u00b6 107.) The PPA did not issue any citations to GCC relating to any aspect of Marshall's activities or the inspection of G61. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) GCC was not aware of the Marshall undercover operation prior to conducting discovery in other\n   litigation with the PPA pending before this Court.

Because the Commonwealth Court's decision rejecting Plaintiffs' challenge to the impoundment of their taxicabs is a final judgment, Defendants assert that the claims raised here are precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We find that claims preclusion does not apply to bar Plaintiffs' constitutional claims because there is no identity of the cause of action. The PPA hearing officer and the state courts that heard GCC's appeals were focused upon\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs'\n   </strong>\n   conduct in operating its taxicabs without PPA inspection stickers, while the constitutional claims GCC and Rosemont raise here focus on\n   <strong>\n    Defendants'\n   </strong>\n   conduct in conducting warrantless seizures of taxicabs found to lack inspection stickers. Moreover, this is clearly not an attempt at seriatim litigation of nearly identical claims. Whether or not GCC attempted to raise an affirmative defense in the State Court Impoundment Action, it could not have received the type of relief it and Rosemont seek here, namely an injunction and money damages arising from the unconstitutional seizure. Thus, the \"same\" constitutional claims could not have been raised in the State Court Impoundment Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, there is no identity between the elements needed to be proved in that action and the elements Plaintiffs must prove to establish warrantless seizure and due process claims. The only element at issue in the enforcement action-whether the taxicab lacked a required inspection sticker-is immaterial to whether the PPA had a constitutional obligation to obtain a warrant to seize the taxicab. Conversely, if Plaintiffs had succeeded in having their citations dismissed on constitutional grounds, Defendants would not be barred from denying that civil rights violations occurred since the elements of a Section 1983 claim would not have been thereby established. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no identity in the \"operative facts\" undergirding the Plaintiffs' liability on the citations and their constitutional warrantless seizure claims sufficient to make those admissions preclusive to the constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Fourth, while there is no assertion that any impounded vehicle was involved in a crime, each was by definition in violation of a regulation enacted to promote public safety. Fifth, by choosing to engage in a heavily regulated public utility, owners are aware of, and at least implicitly consent to, the fact that taxicab vehicles are subject to regulatory inspections without warrant, which may result in impoundments. Defendants argue that this consideration is particularly compelling here since the record shows that GCC opposed the Current Impoundment Regulations before they were adopted, yet continued to operate taxicab vehicles in Philadelphia without current inspection stickers even after the PPA conducted the first impoundment on August 1, 2014.

They cite impoundment hearing testimony from a PPA enforcement officer conceding that taxicab G91 was impounded as part of an \"investigation\" of the taxicab's lack of an inspection sticker in violation of the Regulations. (D.App. Tab 24, N.T. Aug. 7, 2014 at 5:14-7:2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) They also contend that there was no legitimate public safety issue to justify the impoundment of Plaintiffs' taxicabs without a warrant since it is undisputed that they (1) are annually safety-inspected and certified by the PUC, (2) were not involved in accidents, (3) were not impeding the flow of traffic, and (4) were not illegally parked. Rather, Plaintiffs contend, their cabs, which are deemed completely safe to operate in outside of Philadelphia by virtue of their PUC inspection, were deemed unsafe and impounded solely because they were operating in Philadelphia without a PPA inspection sticker. They argue that this makes the seizures unreasonable since there could be \"no legitimate threat to public safety\" from a vehicle that had been safety inspected. (Pls. Opp. Mem. at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have failed to meet their summary judgment burden on the community caretaking affirmative defense to show there was a non-law enforcement basis for the impoundments since the record establishes that (1) Defendants never required Plaintiffs to remedy the supposed threat to public safety, i.e., obtain a PPA inspection sticker, before releasing the taxicab from impoundment to be put back into service, and (2) the express purpose of the impoundment statute is to secure the owner's attendance at the enforcement hearing and its payment of all fines.

Code \u00a7 1003.32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That designation, they assert, would preclude the taxicab from operating in Philadelphia while not unconstitutionally depriving the owner of its property and the right to lawfully operate the taxicab\n   outside of the city. They stress that, in applying the\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   factors, it is undisputed that (1) the taxicabs are not implicated in a crime, and (2) the owners never consented to the impoundment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With the exception of the seizures of G91 and R34 discussed below, we find as a matter of law that Defendants have not established that they are entitled to rely on the community caretaking function affirmative defense to excuse the warrant requirement for the seizures in this record. First, as Defendants concede, there is no case law recognizing that taxicab regulatory authorities can reasonably rely on the community caretaking function exception to engage in warrantless seizures merely because taxicab owners operate in a regulated industry. We hold that an entity's mere participation in the highly regulated taxicab industry cannot support Defendants' authority to engage in the warrantless seizures of taxicabs for a community caretaking purpose as a matter of law. The level of a property owner's expectation of privacy while engaging in a regulated activity is a separate question from whether there actually exists a community caretaking purpose upon which the warrant requirement may be excused. Since the exception is based on law enforcement's duty to ensure the safety of the public, Defendants must show as a matter of law that its seizing taxicabs was reasonably related to such a duty. We conclude that, with the exception of G91 and R34, they have failed to do so on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, while Defendants argue that operating an uninspected taxicab implicates the safety of the riding public, given the parties' stipulated facts no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the Plaintiffs' taxicabs were impounded because they were unsafe. Rather, they were impounded because they lacked PPA inspection stickers while allegedly engaged in hail service in the City or otherwise operating outside their permissible geographic areas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 62-63, 68-69, 75-76, 81-82, 87-90.) Other than for G91 and R34, there is also no assertion that the seized taxicabs were implicated in a crime, located in a dangerous area, illegally parked, involved in a traffic accident or impeded traffic, or could not be driven out of the City (because of mechanical or safety issues or because it lacked a licensed driver). Rather, the record demonstrates that each was impounded to guarantee the appearance of its owner at an enforcement hearing and as surety that any assessment would be paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Current Impoundment Statute authorizes the PPA to impound a vehicle \"utilized to provide call or demand service in cities of the first class\" that \"are in violation of regulations of the authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205714\">\n    53 Pa.

But taxicabs \"shall be returned\" to their owners \"[u]pon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Vehicles impounded under the Current Impoundment Statute and Current Impoundment Regulations are not subject to forfeiture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 27 &amp; 36.) Seizing a taxicab solely as surety for the payment of fines that possibly may be assessed for a violation of the Defendants' regulations does not create a safety-based purpose for the seizure. The purpose is to guarantee payment, and it is undisputed that Defendants used warrantless seizures for this purpose since Plaintiffs' taxicabs were released upon payment and with no requirement that they be safety inspected\n   before being released and put back into service. For this reason, we find the seizures were not reasonably related to a community caretaking function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The two exceptions noted above refers to the seizures of G91 and R34. The record establishes that the operators of these vehicle were deemed ineligible at the time of the seizure to drive them out of the PPA's jurisdiction. Because Plaintiffs do not assert that another driver was available, these vehicles were properly subject to a community caretaking function seizure since they lacked an eligible driver, even though it is undisputed that the citation issued to the operator of R34 for having a suspended license was later withdrawn. Thus, we conclude that the warrantless seizures of G91 and R34 did not violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. We therefore grant partial summary judgment to Defendants to the extent that GCC's claims are based on the seizure of G91 and Rosemont's claims are based on the seizure of R34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSOF at \u00b6 1 (\"None of Plaintiffs' vehicles at issue in this Litigation were placed out of service by the [PUC] at the time of their impoundment by the PPA.\") (citing Gabbay Decl. \u00b6 8, Gabbay-Karsenty Decl. \u00b6 8);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (asserting that impounded taxicabs had passed PUC safety inspections).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Second, Defendants did not require Plaintiffs to submit to safety inspections before releasing the vehicles; they only required that Plaintiffs pay their fines. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67, 73-74, 85-86.) These two facts eliminate any reliance on exigent circumstances based on safety concerns. Third, the Current Impoundment Statute does not require the PPA to impound any vehicle and does not permit forfeiture. (Stip. \u00b6 26.) Thus there can be no exigent circumstances based on the owner absconding with the property. Fourth, as noted by Plaintiffs, there is evidence that an alternative to impoundment existed at the time: designating the\n   vehicle as \"out of service\" to permit the taxicab to taken out of the City or to its designated geographic area in the City, where it could legally continue to operate by virtue of its PUC-issued CPC. This eliminates the possibility that exigent circumstances required impoundment to prevent the taxicab from continuing to troll for hail fares in prohibited areas. Finally, there is no evidence that any threat to public safety was \"imminent\" in a way that is analogous to other situations where the exigent circumstances exception has been accepted. Because the vehicle is returned to its owner whether or not it is \"safe,\" we find that the exigent circumstances exception cannot apply as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrell v.

Affording Defendants the deference due to take prompt action to insure public safety, we find that the lack of pre-deprivation notice and hearing in this case denied Plaintiffs due process as a matter of law and post-deprivation process is insufficient to cure the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The\n    <em>\n     Zinermon\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To determine whether pre- or post-deprivation notice and hearings are required, we examine (1) the necessity of quick governmental action and the (2) potential length or severity of the deprivation and likelihood of serious loss. The summary judgment record fails to support a conclusion that pre-deprivation process was not possible. Defendants maintain that a necessity for quick governmental action sufficient to justify warrantless impoundments existed because the lack of a PPA inspection created a safety risk. It is undisputed\n   that Plaintiffs' taxicabs are inspected by the PUC and lawfully operate in all areas outside of the PPA's jurisdiction, as well as within the PPA's jurisdiction under defined circumstances. Thus, Defendants cannot show as a matter of law on this record that warrantless impoundments for lack of a PPA safety inspection are justified by any necessity for quick governmental action. For us to accept the necessity of quick action, we must accept that a taxicab can be \"safe\" one moment and \"unsafe\" moments later depending solely upon where in the Commonwealth it is operated. This is not a reasonable basis upon which to justify a warrantless emergency seizure. Defendants have also not shown that seizing the taxicabs as surety for the payment of fines requires quick governmental action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   While Defendants point to evidence that the potential length or severity of the deprivation and likelihood of serious loss is diminished by the requirement that a hearing be held within two days of an owner's request, they have failed to come forward with \"competent evidence allowing the official to reasonably believe that an emergency does in fact exist ....\"\n   <em>\n    Elsmere Park Club, L.P.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, conversely, met their burden under Rule 56(e) to show that there is no \"emergency\" since their taxicabs can be legally operated outside of the PPA's jurisdiction. They have also shown that the majority of their operating territory is outside the jurisdiction of the PPA. Thus, unlike a taxicab with a PPA-issued medallion that may not be operated\n   <strong>\n    anywhere\n   </strong>\n   within the PPA's jurisdiction if it lacks an inspection sticker, Plaintiffs' taxicabs may still legally generate revenue even if not inspected by the PPA. Since the parties have also stipulated that vehicles impounded under the Current Impoundment Statute and Current Impoundment Regulations are not subject to forfeiture even if fines are not paid (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 36), Plaintiffs have demonstrated as a matter of law that the impoundment of taxicabs creates an immediate deprivation. Because there is no basis for failing to provide pre-deprivation notice and hearing, the\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   factors support a conclusion that post-deprivation process is not adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors also support the conclusion that post-deprivation process is inadequate. First, Plaintiffs have shown the majority of their taxicab service is provided outside of the PPA's jurisdiction, and it is not seriously disputed that their private interest in continuing to operate their taxicabs is affected by the PPA's warrantless seizures. Second, the PPA's asserted governmental safety interest in keeping uninspected vehicles from operating is rejected for the reasons already discussed and the PPA fails to make any argument that providing pre-deprivation procedures would be overly burdensome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden on both prongs of the third\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor. They have shown (1) through the evidence of the impact on their non-PPA jurisdiction taxicab and paratransit services that there is a risk of an erroneous deprivation arising from the lack of pre-deprivation procedures; and (2) the probable value of substitute procedural safeguards, for example placing an out-of-service designation on an allegedly offending taxicab to permit it to be taken out of the PPA's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Plaintiffs were entitled to pre-deprivation process before the PPA could seize their taxicabs, and the lack of pre-deprivation process under these circumstances is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants Schmid and Marshall argue they are entitled to summary judgment on GCC's state law claims for conversion, trespass and fraud arising from Defendant Marshall's obtaining a GCC cab for two reasons: (1) GCC voluntarily consented to leasing the cab to Marshall as part of its ordinary business activity and thereby consented to his use of the taxicab; and (2) GCC suffered no damages from Marshall's taking the cab to the PPA's inspection facility rather than using it to provide taxicab service since GCC received the daily lease rate it ordinarily charged for the use of the vehicle, and it was timely returned to GCC at the end of the day's lease period.

GCC suffered no actual conversion or trespass since it received its expected fee for the term that it leased the vehicle to Marshall, and Marshall timely returned the vehicle at the end of the lease term. GCC's argument that a conversion occurred relies on its assertion that it had a legal right to be present at an inspection of its taxicab and Defendants intentionally chose to ignore that right. (Pls. Mem. at 39 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201017.41\">\n    52 Pa. Code \u00a7 1017.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) Since this cannot rise as a matter of law to a defendant's \"asserting a right\" to the taxicab \"which is adverse to the owner,\" we conclude that this argument is meritless. The alleged violation of GCC's right to be present at an inspection does not establish a trespass or that its property was converted where it is undisputed that GCC received the expected lease payment and the chattel was timely returned. Plaintiff's only other argument on trespass is that Defendants interfered with GCC's possessory interest in the taxicab. Again, since GCC obtained its expected lease payment and the property was timely returned, it did not as a matter of law suffer any interference with a possessory interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(Def. Mem. at 51.) GCC responds that Marshall misrepresented his intent to become a taxicab driver with knowledge of that falsity to gain control of the vehicle. It argues that it relied on that misrepresentation in giving him the vehicle, which was returned to it with an \"out-of-service\" sticker based on the inspection done outside its presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We conclude that GCC has failed to meet its heightened summary judgment burden on the fraud claim. Although Marshall returned the taxicab to GCC with an out-of-service sticker, which he falsely told GCC resulted in his being stopped near 30th Street Station by the PPA for an inspection, it is undisputed that the PPA did not issue any citations to GCC relating to any aspect of Marshall's activities or the inspection of the taxicab. Because GCC received the full lease payment and was not cited for any deficiencies allegedly found during the inspection, it has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that it suffered an injury that was proximately caused by its reliance on Marshall's misrepresentation that he intended to use the taxicab as a driver or that he was subject to an on-the-street inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on GCC's state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' state law claims for conversion, trespass and fraud is granted. Since Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages is limited to those claims (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 241, 248, 257), summary judgment is entered in Defendants favor on punitive damages as well. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment on liability on Count I, alleging a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is granted except as to GCC's claims based on the seizure of G91 and Rosemont's claims based on the seizure of R34. All other warrantless seizures of Plaintiffs' taxicabs were per se unreasonable with no applicable exception to the warrant requirement and were therefore unconstitutional. With the same two exceptions, we also grant summary judgment against Defendants on liability on Count II, which alleges a violation of Plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 1, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, since no post-deprivation process was sufficient to excuse the lack of a warrant. Plaintiffs are also entitled to the declaratory and injunctive relief they seek in Count III, namely\n   that the Current Impoundment Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205714\">\n    53 Pa.

The PPA does not regulate paratransit services. (Schmid Dep. at 424:21-425:10.) The PPA released the vehicle on the same day it was seized, rescinded any citations in connection with the incident, and agreed to reimburse any related towing fees. (Stip. \u00b6 93.) Although the citations were rescinded, Defendants nonetheless assert here that the driver could produce no log to corroborate her claim that she was providing paratransit service, the Enforcement Officer observed an unauthorized meter in the vehicle, and the vehicle had a broken side mirror and inoperable driver side window. (D.App. Tab 22; Schmid Dep. at 360-67.)

(D.App. Tab 24 at 41, 45-46.) The summary judgment record further shows that, following the close of testimony, counsel argued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    They cannot impound a vehicle because it violates the Constitution, first of all, and, secondly, because they don't have the statutory authority to do so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    The other issue that underlies all this is that just because a statute authorizes an impoundment of vehicles doesn't mean that a [sic] claims can't be made against it.
