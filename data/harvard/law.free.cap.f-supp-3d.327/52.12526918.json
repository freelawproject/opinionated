After leaving the scene of the accident, Jackson was pulled over by the police. What happened next is disputed. According to the officers, Jackson resisted arrest and they used reasonable force in restraining him. According to Jackson, the officers maliciously beat him even though he tried to comply with their orders. He subsequently underwent neck surgery, and claims to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jackson has sued the District of Columbia (the \"District\") and seven individual police officers: John Merzig, Matthew Fogle, Kanika Bolton, Carol Smith, Antoine Braithwaite, Lorelei Hillgren, and Michael Harrison. He brings claims for violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendants have moved for partial judgment on the pleadings and partial summary judgment on Jackson's Fifth Amendment claim against all Defendants; on all claims against Defendants Bolton, Smith, Braithwaite, Hillgren and Harrison; and on Jackson's claim against the District for municipal liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ECF No. 35. For the reasons explained below, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part. The Court will dismiss the Fifth Amendment claim in its entirety. It will also grant summary judgment for Harrison on all claims, for Smith and Bolton on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and for the District on the municipal-liability claim. The motion will otherwise be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Jackson engaged an expert witness on police practices, former Charlottesville, Virginia, police chief Timothy J. Longo, Sr., who was asked to provide opinions on two subjects: (1) \"whether the District had a custom, practice, or policy, of excessive force that was conscious[ly] and deliberately enforced[,] and whether such a de facto policy or custom or practice was [the] moving force behind Mr. Jackson's injures;\" and (2) \"whether the District of Columbia and [its police department] had a custom, practice or policy of deliberately and consciously failing to investigate uses of force[,] and whether those practices, customs or policies were the moving force behind Mr. Jackson's injuries.\" Defs.'

This policy, he concluded, \"was the moving force behind Mr. Jackson's injuries.\" Longo Supp. Rep. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The background for Longo's analysis is a 2001 Memorandum of Agreement (\"MOA\") that the District entered into with the Department of Justice.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Ex. 2 (Longo Dep.) at 53:10-54:7, 58:20-59:11; Longo Supp. Rep. at 10-11. In particular, on the day the monitorship ended in June 2008, the police department issued a policy announcement by means of a \"teletype.\" Pl.'s Ex. 14 (teletype dated June 13, 2008). The teletype changed the department's policy for investigating officers' use of \"hand controls\" and \"resisted handcuffing\" where those practices did not result in injury or a complaint of pain or injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056089\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/297/136/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In those cases, a \"Use of Force Incident Report\" and follow-up investigative reports would no longer be automatically required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056089\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/297/136/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the relevant watch commander would determine whether to complete a Use of Force Incident Report; if not, the watch commander would simply note the incident in his daily report.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056089\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/297/136/#p139\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District justified these changes on the basis that investigations into minor uses of force were not turning up constitutional violations or other misconduct, and that the time spent on these investigations kept supervisors \"off the streets,\" where they could be actively supervising their subordinates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Longo Supp. Rep. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Jackson also points to two later police-department teletypes, both issued in July 2014. On July 3, 2014, the department issued a teletype listing the use-of-force incidents that the department's internal-affairs division was required to investigate. Pl.'s Ex. 15 (teletype dated July 3, 2014). Under the teletype, internal affairs was not required to investigate all incidents in which officers used force, but only certain categories of incidents, including \"serious\" uses of force that resulted in \"admission to a hospital,\" \"broken bones,\" \"loss of consciousness,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   or risk of death or serious bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Another teletype, dated July 29, 2014, restricted the circumstances requiring completion of a Use of Force Incident Report. Pl.'s Ex. 16 (teletype dated July 29, 2014). It provided that no such reports would be required for \"contact controls,\" \"unresisted handcuffing,\" \"resisted handcuffing,\" or \"solo or team takedowns,\" \"unless there has been a resulting injury or complaint of pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, officers were no longer required to notify their watch commanders of \"contact controls or resisted handcuffing in which there was no report of injury or pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Longo criticized these changes because uses of force like tactical takedowns always involve a \"foreseeable risk someone's going to get hurt,\" and opined that it is important to document those incidents so that the District can \"go back and make sure that those type of force decisions are being made appropriately.\" Defs.' Ex. 2 (Longo Dep.) at 54:13-18. In Longo's opinion, \"when you adopt a policy that lessens your ability to adequately investigate things like force, that's a de facto policy that you've adopted that could lead to a foreseeable risk of harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:2-7. Longo also opined that \"it was generally accepted practice to at least document and do some form of investigation with respect to [tactical takedowns].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:18-20. However, his opinion was not that \"every tactical takedown should go to [internal affairs].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Notwithstanding these criticisms, Longo concluded that the District's written \"policies and procedures ... pertaining to the use of force and how such force is reported and investigated ... are consistent with generally accepted policing practices.\" Longo Supp. Rep. at 9. He further concluded, however, that after the MOA ended the District permitted \"a de facto policy, or wide spread custom, or practice that impeded the rigorous, thorough, and timely investigation of use of force incidents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. He based this conclusion to a significant degree on his review of several administrative case files provided by Jackson's counsel, six of which involved use of force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. He identified several deficiencies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Only one of the case files included audio-recorded statements, which Longo believes are required by best practices in internal police investigations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 In each case file \"investigated by district personnel,\" the involved officers received \"reverse\n   <em>\n    Garrity\n   </em>\n   \" warnings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Longo's view, the \"blanket use ... of the\n   <em>\n    Garrity\n   </em>\n   admonishment\" where it is not required unduly delays internal police investigations. Longo Supp. Rep. at 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 In one case in which Sergeant Harrison was accused of kicking a suspect, the case file was \"void of any statements from the involved officers or any potential witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The matter was referred to the U.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Attorney's Office, which declined to prosecute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Another case involved an accusation of excessive force against Officer Smith and other officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In that case, the \"only real investigation\" consisted of phone interviews with two of the involved officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, Longo noted, the 2016 Bromwich report reviewed 32 use-of-force investigations and concluded that four of those cases (12.5%) should have been, but were not, investigated by internal affairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; Pl.'s Ex. 13 (2016 Bromwich report) at 42. The Bromwich Group also identified other deficiencies, including a general failure to engage in \"tactical analysis\" or make \"recommendations for remediation.\" Longo Supp. Rep. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Longo also heavily criticized the investigation into the use of force against Jackson, which he described as \"woefully deficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. In his view, internal affairs should have investigated the matter because Jackson was hospitalized. Defs.' Ex. 2 (Longo Dep.) at 63:17-22; Longo Supp. Rep. at 11. On this point, the District's Rule 30(b)(6) witness seemed to agree with Longo, testifying that any use of force that results in hospitalization or a broken bone \"is an obvious [internal affairs] case.\" Pl.'s Ex. 17 (Power Dep.) at 73:5-11. Longo also concluded that Harrison failed to properly \"canvass\" the crime scene for additional witnesses, although police records indicated that a canvass did in fact occur. Longo Supp. Rep. at 12 &amp; n.55. Harrison at least attempted to interview all the non-police witnesses known to have been on the scene of the arrest: he spoke to Jackson, Jones (who claimed to have slept through the encounter), and Jones's female companion (who declined to give a statement).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. But Longo faults Harrison for failing to tape-record the statements he received and to create a \"step by step\" chronology of his investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. And while a police lieutenant did ultimately write an investigative report on the incident, Longo concluded that this investigation was inadequate because it was completed two months after the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on these examples and the post-MOA policy changes, Longo concluded that the District had a de facto policy of tolerating inadequate use-of-force investigations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. He further opined that this de facto policy was the \"moving force\" behind Jackson's injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Defs.' Ex. 2 (Longo Dep.) at 45:11-20. He acknowledged that this conclusion might seem counterintuitive, given that Jackson's case was in fact investigated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Longo Supp. Rep. at 11. He nonetheless opined that deficiencies in the District's investigative practices \"allow[ ] for the grave possibility that misconduct will take place with impunity\" and \"that officers will use force that exceeds policy, knowing that they will have sufficient time in which to formulate an account that will either justify or mitigate their actions, and further knowing that whatever account is offered[,] they may in all likelihood go unchallenged and not be subject to greater security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Jackson further testified that, although blinded by pepper spray, he could identify the officers based on touch and the sound of their voices. He could, in his telling, feel the \"presence\" of a female officer among those beating him and, based on the height of the officer, identified her as Hillgren from among the three female officers on the scene (Bolton, Smith and Hillgren). Pl.'s Ex. 1 (Jackson Dep.) at 162:13-163:2.

Jackson's own testimony states that Bolton and Smith did not themselves use excessive force against him. Nonetheless, he claims in his briefing that other evidence (including Smith's testimony) establishes that these two officers did, in fact, participate in the use of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 10. In any event, Jackson argues, they should be subject to bystander liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The Court concludes that the record, viewed as a whole, creates genuine issues of material fact regarding Bolton's and Smith's liability for the asserted use of excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As noted, Jackson's own testimony is relatively favorable to Bolton and Smith. Jackson testified that Bolton had not used any force against him; his claim against her is that \"[s]he didn't stop the assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162:5-7;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 161:9-162:12.

In fact, Smith seems to have helped Jackson. In Jackson's telling, when Bolton and Smith arrived to find Merzig and Fogle mistreating him, Smith tried to intervene, asking, \"Hey, what are you guys doing to him?\" Pl.'s Ex. 1 (Jackson Dep.) at 43:15-19. \"At that point, everything stopped.

Specifically, both Smith's testimony and Bolton's written report say that they assisted in the \"tactical takedown.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Smith Dep.) at 39:11-18; Pl.'s Ex. 4 (Bolton report) at 3 (explaining that \"collectively we utilized a team takedown\").

Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Smith Dep.) at 40:7-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is a close question whether Bolton and Smith's involvement in the takedown, on its own, would be enough to raise a genuine\n   issue of material fact about their use of excessive force. In this Circuit and elsewhere, courts have generally upheld the use of \"takedowns\" or \"leg sweeps\" as a lawful police maneuver to subdue suspects who are resisting arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huntley v.

This suggests a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the takedown amounted to excessive force.

However, Defendants have not argued that these convictions have preclusive effect in establishing that Jackson was resisting arrest. Nor have they introduced into the record any information about the findings of fact underlying the convictions. Thus, on the record before the Court, it is unclear whether the convictions conclusively establish that Jackson was resisting the officers at the time the takedown occurred; it is possible, for instance, that those convictions are based on Jackson's conduct during his initial interaction with Merzig and Fogle, and that he became compliant later in the encounter, before the officers took him to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Regardless of whether Smith and Bolton personally used an unlawful degree of force against Jackson, the evidence more clearly raises a genuine issue of material fact about whether Smith and Bolton may be subject to \"bystander liability\" for the use of force that, in Jackson's account, occurred after they arrived on the scene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts of appeals outside this Circuit have authorized liability for \"police officers who have a realistic opportunity to step forward and prevent a fellow officer from violating a plaintiff's rights through the use of excessive force but fail to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Viewing the record in this case as a whole, the Court concludes that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Bolton's and Smith's conduct satisfies this test. In Jackson's account, the other officers punched and kicked him repeatedly even as he lay on the ground with his hands pinned beneath his body, after Smith and Bolton had arrived on the scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 1 (Jackson Dep.) at 47:19-48:1, 50:16-51:2.

Unlike on the \u00a7 1983 claim, Jackson can hold Bolton and Smith liable on this claim only to the extent they personally exercised force against him. To hold one defendant liable for a battery committed by another, the plaintiff must show some basis for vicarious liability under the common law, such as aiding and abetting or conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rawlings v.

Common law theories of vicarious liability are not identical to \"bystander liability\" under \u00a7 1983. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ingram v. Shipman-Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267637\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/124/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2017), the court found a genuine existence of material fact going to three defendants' potential bystander liability under \u00a7 1983, but granted summary judgment for those three defendants on the issue of aiding-and-abetting liability under the common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267637\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/124/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267637\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/124/\">\n    at 147-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Jackson has not pleaded any theory of common law vicarious liability for the individual defendants in his complaint, or argued for one in his briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-45; Pl.'s Opp'n at 11-13. Therefore, the Court must consider whether Bolton's and Smith's individual actions constituted excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As already explained, the record shows that Bolton and Smith personally used only two forms of force against Jackson: the handcuffing and the tactical takedown. Handcuffing a suspect during a lawful arrest, without more, is not excessive force.\n   <em>\n    Garay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227692\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/943/1/#p21\">\n    943 F.Supp.2d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question is therefore whether the tactical takedown constituted excessive force under District of Columbia law. As discussed above, District of Columbia law tends to follow federal law on the issue of excessive force, and several Fourth Amendment cases dealing with \"leg sweeps\" and tactical takedowns have found them to be excessive where the plaintiff was not actively resisting arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   p. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The case of\n   <em>\n    Kotsch v.

As discussed above, in Jackson's account, he persistently attempted to cooperate with the officers, who nonetheless greeted him with violence. He also claims that, during the takedown, he was \"slammed face-forward down towards the ground.\" Pl.'s Ex. 1 (Jackson Dep.) at 50:14-15. It is not the Court's role on this motion to judge Jackson's credibility. Based on Jackson's testimony, a reasonable jury could conclude that the takedown went beyond what any officer could reasonably believe was necessary and thus was not privileged.

Jackson's evidence on this point is fatally flawed. The Court assumes that Longo is right and that the District has deviated from best practices regarding use-of-force investigations since the MOA, both through its written policies and through its practices. But it is not enough to show simply that the District fell short of best practices or failed to optimally reduce the risk of constitutional violations. Jackson must show that the District, by tolerating defective use-of-force investigations, effectively turned a blind eye to an obvious risk that those practices would result in officers' use of excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In cases involving an alleged failure to train or supervise employees, there are two ways to prove up deliberate indifference. The more common way is to show a \"pattern of similar constitutional violations\" that have gone unaddressed.\n   <em>\n    Connick v.

Notwithstanding its disagreement with some of the District's practices, the 2016 Bromwich report concluded that the police department's staff \"remains committed to limiting and managing use of force-and to fair and constitutional policing.\" Pl.'s Ex. 13 at i. Longo himself concluded that the District's written policies regarding use-of-force investigations are adequate. Longo Supp. Rep. at 9. This evidence-on which Jackson himself relies-hardly shows that the District is indifferent to excessive force. It in fact establishes the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Longo tries to paint a dire picture of the District's practices based on a handful of investigations he believes were conducted improperly. But these instances are \"too scattered and lacking in detail to build a case\" of deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    Carter v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610443,1596163\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/116/\">\n    795 F.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 (D.C.

In Jackson's case, an investigation was in fact performed and a written report completed, albeit imperfectly in Longo's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Longo Supp. Rep. at 7, 11. In one of the other instances Longo cites, the U.S. Attorney's Office reviewed the matter and declined to prosecute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. It is hard to see how the District could have been \"indifferent\" to matters it in fact investigated in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Jackson also seeks to draw an inference of deliberate indifference from the fact the District relaxed its policies regarding use-of-force investigations just after the MOA ended. Pl.'s Opp'n at 21-22. He argues that this shows a desire to return to the District's earlier, \"systematically flawed\" practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. The undisputed evidence, however, shows that the District made these changes in order to concentrate its resources on more serious instances in which officers use force and on routine police work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 2 (Longo Dep.) at 53:18-54:4; Longo Supp. Rep. at 10-11. Neither Longo's report nor any other evidence suggests that this justification was pretextual. Longo describes this a \"conscious and deliberate\" decision-which it was, but only in the sense that the District consciously refused to maintain policies it thought unnecessary to prevent instances of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Longo Supp. Rep. at 17. And that was entirely permissible: police departments must weigh what resources to put into investigating their own officers, knowing that those same resources could instead be put\n   to use in fulfilling their primary mission of preventing crime in society at large. The Constitution does not require a perfect balance between these two objectives; municipalities can violate it only when they overlook\n   <em>\n    obvious\n   </em>\n   deficiencies in their practices. That simply is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Jackson has also failed to meet the causation requirement for municipal liability. \"A deliberately indifferent policy or custom is 'deemed to be the moving force of a constitutional injury if the conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.' \"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

This requirement is similar to proximate cause, in that it requires both factual causation (that the particular violation at issue would not have occurred but for the alleged policy) and foreseeability (that the violation was a foreseeable result of the policy).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 102-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Jackson complains that the District, after the MOA ended, improperly restricted the circumstances requiring specialized use-of-force reports and investigation by either internal affairs or a specialized investigative team.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 17-18. But the District's policies\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   require those measures in\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   case. The police department required an internal-affairs investigation whenever the suspect suffered a broken bone or was hospitalized for his injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 15 (teletype of July 3, 2014) at 3; Pl.'s Ex. 17 (Power Dep.) at 73:7-11. It also required a use-of-force report where a takedown resulted in \"injury or complaint of pain.\" Pl.'s Ex. 16 (teletype of July 29, 2014). Because Jackson broke his nose and required surgery and hospitalization for his injured neck, the District's policies required the very procedures Jackson claims were necessary. These policies were followed to some extent in his case. Bolton completed a \"Use of Force Incident Report.\" Pl.'s Ex. 4. And an investigation was performed, if imperfectly and not by internal affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Longo Supp. Rep. at 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even assuming that the District's policies could foreseeably have caused\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   instances of excessive force-namely, instances that do not result in a serious injury-Jackson has not shown these policies were a substantial factor in causing more serious injuries like the ones he suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Longo opined that the causation requirement is satisfied on the following theory: the District tolerated \"rudimentary\" investigations into uses of force, which meant that officers knew that they could get away with using excessive force, which led to the beating that Jackson claims he suffered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Longo Supp. Rep. at 17-18.

Therefore, the Court cannot conclude on the record before it that the pepper spray deprived Smith of a reasonable opportunity to stop the alleged battery of Jackson.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    There is also a suggestion in the record, not fully fleshed out, that an internal-affairs detective was contacted on the morning of May 5, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Ex. 2 (Longo Dep.) at 65:16-20.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Only one of the case files that Longo discusses involved an officer who participated in Jackson's arrest. In it, a suspect was allegedly \"thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and his back-pack cut and removed from his shoulders\" by Smith and two other officers. Longo Supp. Rep. at 15. But there is no indication that the suspect sustained any injuries (much less serious injuries like the ones Jackson suffered).\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    There is also no indication whether that incident occurred before or after Jackson's arrest,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , which is obviously a critical question going to causation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
