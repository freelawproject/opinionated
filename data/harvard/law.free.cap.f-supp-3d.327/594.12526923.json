However, as discussed above, it is plain that Officer Monti had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff because there was an outstanding warrant for the plaintiff's arrest. Therefore, the plaintiff can only overcome a claim of qualified immunity if it was clearly established at the time of the arrest that the plaintiff had a right to be free from a First Amendment retaliatory arrest even where there was probable cause for the arrest. The Supreme Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Reichle v.

Therefore, an arresting officer is protected by qualified immunity from a lawsuit challenging an arrest as retaliatory where the arrest was supported by probable cause, as this arrest plainly was. Accordingly, because Officer Monti did not violate a clearly established right of the plaintiff when he arrested the plaintiff, Officer Monti is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the claim for retaliatory arrest in alleged violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The plaintiff also brings claims against the City of New York.

However, having found the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims against Officer Monti fail as a matter of law, there can be no\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability with respect to those claims because there is no underlying constitutional violation. Thus, the City is entitled to summary judgment with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims brought pursuant to the alleged\n   Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   With respect to the First Amendment claim, the plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that his arrest was the result of a City policy, and any additional discovery into the claim would be futile. While\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   discovery was stayed, the plaintiff was free to pursue all discovery relating to the circumstances of his arrest by Officer Monti. He deposed Officer Monti and the plaintiff's deposition was taken. The plaintiff was free to depose anyone at the precinct or otherwise who spoke with Officer Monti in connection with the arrest. Discovery with respect to all claims against Officer Monti was completed and nowhere in such discovery is there any evidence to support the claim that Officer Monti's arrest of the plaintiff was made pursuant to a city policy to chill the First Amendment rights of the plaintiff or vendors. Officer Monti did not testify that he was directed by any City official to arrest the plaintiff for retaliatory reasons or that he was trained on any policy that targeted street vendors. Thus, there is no evidence that this particular arrest was made pursuant to any city policy. The plaintiff has therefore failed to demonstrate that any city policy was the \"moving force\" behind the arrest.\n   <em>\n    McKay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324249\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/499/#p513\">\n    32 F.Supp.3d at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    Lozman\n   </em>\n   counsels a different result. But in\n   <em>\n    Lozman\n   </em>\n   , the city policy was undeniably the moving force behind the arrest. In that case, the city councilmembers \"formed an official plan to intimidate\" the plaintiff and the councilmembers, at a town hall meeting in which the plaintiff was speaking to the council, directed the arresting officer to make the arrest of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Lozman\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1949. The plaintiff has pointed to no evidence that Officer Monti was directed to arrest the plaintiff pursuant to any city policy of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Lozman\n   </em>\n   is therefore plainly distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that Officer Monti's actions were the result of any city policy of retaliation against vendors or the plaintiff and thus the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim fails.
