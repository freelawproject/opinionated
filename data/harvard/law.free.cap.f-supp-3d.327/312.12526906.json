INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jamil Roman (\"Defendant\") filed a motion to suppress the fruits of separate searches of his person, business, and residence. Following a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, this court granted Defendant's motion as to the search of his business due to material misrepresentations and omissions in the affidavit supporting the warrant (which affidavit also supported the warrant to search Defendant's residence, among others).\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2018). Thereafter, the parties presented additional evidence and arguments regarding the searches of Defendant's person and residence. The court now resolves these remaining issues. For the following reasons, the court will deny Defendant's motion as to the search of his person but will grant the motion as to the search of his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The events at issue here arose out of a separate investigation targeting CS, who eventually became a confidential informant for the government. CS, after being pulled over by law enforcement, informed agents that he possessed, at his business, three kilograms of cocaine obtained from Defendant on behalf of Javier Gonzalez, the head of a drug-trafficking organization. Shortly thereafter, CS provided a detailed statement transcribed by Robert Alberti (an officer with the DEA Task Force), in which CS stated that \"Javier had [Defendant] drop the kilos off to me around 712 Boston Road,\" Springfield, Massachusetts, CS's business address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After approximately two months of investigation into Gonzalez and Defendant (including the recording of their meetings with CS), DEA Special Agent Scott Smith, assisted by Alberti and DEA Special Agent John McGrath, drafted a search warrant affidavit. The affidavit supported six search warrant applications targeting three individuals. As relevant here, one application sought a warrant to search Defendant's business, TWC Auto Body, located at 56 Jackson Street, Holyoke, Massachusetts; another sought a warrant to search Defendant's residence, located at 21 Walsh Street, Chicopee, Massachusetts. Importantly, the affidavit differed from CS's transcribed statement by alleging that the cocaine transaction between Defendant and CS occurred at Defendant's business (TWC Auto Body) in Holyoke, rather than at CS's business in Springfield.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 21, 2015, United States Magistrate Judge Kenneth Neiman authorized the warrants. On March 25, 2015, the warrants to search Defendant's business and residence were executed. Prior to the execution of the warrant to search TWC Auto Body, FBI Agent Mark Karangekis searched and arrested Defendant at his Holyoke business. The facts surrounding this encounter are described in Section III.A. below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 10, 2017, Defendant filed his motion to suppress. Defendant challenged his warrantless search and arrest as well as the existence of probable cause for the warrants to search TWC Auto Body and the residence. In addition, Defendant sought a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing related to the discrepancy between the affidavit and CS's transcribed statement regarding the location of the cocaine transaction. The court held a hearing on Defendant's motion on September 27, 2017, at which it decided to resolve the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   issue before addressing Defendant's other arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 10, 2017, the court concluded that Defendant met his burden to obtain a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing based not only on the discrepancy regarding the cocaine transaction, but also due to the importance of that allegation in establishing a sufficient connection between criminal activity and TWC Auto Body.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204517963\">\n    2017 WL 4517963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. Oct. 10, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court then held the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing-at which Alberti, Smith, and McGrath testified-on multiple days spread out between November of 2017 and January of 2018. On April 18, 2018, the court granted Defendant's motion to suppress as to the search of his business, finding material misrepresentations and omissions in the affidavit, which were made with reckless disregard for the truth, and without which a finding of probable cause would not have been made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, the court found CS's transcribed statement to be accurate,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the cocaine transaction between Defendant and CS occurred at CS's business in Springfield, and the affidavit's contrary assertion to be false.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also found the affidavit's further allegation that CS \"relayed\" he \"would obtain kilogram quantities of cocaine\" at TWC Auto Body was false, as there was essentially no evidence to support this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Among other errors in the affidavit and investigation as a whole, the court additionally found insufficient support \"for the proposition that Defendant was an established drug dealer, despite the affidavit's conclusory allegation that '[a]gents are aware that [Defendant is] a known cocaine trafficker from Holyoke, MA.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the ruling on the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   issue, the court held another evidentiary hearing and the parties submitted supplemental briefing on the remaining suppression issues: the warrantless search of Defendant's person and the search of the residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court addresses these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III. SEARCH OF DEFENDANT'S PERSON AT TWC AUTO BODY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant seeks to suppress the fruits of the search of his person. It is undisputed that neither this search nor Defendant's arrest were authorized by a warrant and that both occurred prior to the full search of TWC Auto Body. Moreover, while the search of TWC Auto Body\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   authorized by a warrant, that warrant has been \"voided and the fruits of the search excluded\" as a result of the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p156\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p156\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p156\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) ). Thus, it would appear that to the extent the search warrant provided a lawful basis for law enforcement's presence at the business at the time of Defendant's arrest, this justification is no longer valid in the aftermath of the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling. The court, however, need not resolve this question because the government also contends that TWC Auto Body was open to the public at the time (or at least reasonably appeared to be), providing an alternative lawful basis for law enforcement's presence. The government further argues that probable cause existed to arrest Defendant and he was properly searched incident to his arrest. The court agrees with the government and will therefore deny this portion of Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 25, 2014, four days after the issuance of the search warrants, DEA and FBI agents prepared to execute those warrants. FBI Task Force Officer Mark Karangekis conducted surveillance on Javier Gonzalez and eventually stopped the tractor trailer he was driving and arrested him. Karangekis was then instructed to go to TWC Auto Body in Holyoke to secure the business in preparation for the search warrant execution at that address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant, meanwhile, closed and locked TWC Auto Body at 4:55 p.m., five minutes earlier than the regular 5:00 p.m. closing time posted on the door. However, one of Defendant's customers-Ismael Florez, who needed to drop off a check for parts-called and stated that he was working until 5:30 p.m. that day, so Defendant waited for him. When Flores arrived, Defendant unlocked the door and let him inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Karangekis arrived on the scene sometime thereafter, as it was beginning to get dark outside. He opened a door and entered a garage bay to the north of TWC Auto Body in the same building and spoke with individuals who stated they were subleasing that bay from Defendant. Karangekis\n   then proceeded a few bays down to a closed door, the entrance to TWC Auto Body. Upon entering this door, Karangekis did not notice any signs restricting access and, as Defendant had left the door unlocked, he believed it was open to the public. He walked only a couple of feet inside, into a common area of the business, where he saw Defendant meeting with Florez behind a partially partitioned office area. Karangekis asked Defendant to come speak with him, and the two stepped outside, where Karangekis confirmed Defendant's identity, pat frisked him, and found a firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Karangekis told Defendant that they had a warrant, which was en route, to search the business. After about ten minutes with Defendant outside, Karangekis called McGrath, who instructed him to arrest Defendant because law enforcement had probable cause to believe he had engaged in drug trafficking. Agents then placed Defendant in handcuffs and searched his person, finding, among other items, two cell phones and $3,000 in cash. Shortly thereafter, agents searched TWC Auto Body pursuant to the warrant which was invalidated as a result of the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before delving into the crux of the matter, the court first makes some preliminary observations in order to properly frame the legal issues for its analysis. The Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\" and provides that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Despite this language, the Supreme Court has held that a warrant is not necessarily required \"to make a valid arrest for a felony.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Just as it would have been reasonable for a prospective customer to enter TWC Auto Body at the time in search of needed car repair services, it was reasonable under the circumstances for Karangekis to do so for law enforcement purposes.

In addition to a lawful basis for his initial intrusion onto TWC Auto Body, Karangekis also needed to possess probable cause to arrest Defendant. The court finds that he did.

SEARCH OF DEFENDANT'S RESIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also seeks to suppress the fruits of the search of his residence at 21 Walsh Street, Chicopee. As mentioned, this search, like the search of TWC Auto Body addressed in the court's\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling, was authorized by a warrant that was supported by the same affidavit drafted by Smith. This raises a question as to what affect, if any, the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling has on the present inquiry. In addition, the government has filed a limited motion for reconsideration as to certain factual findings made by the court in the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling, to the extent those findings are relevant to the search of Defendant's residence. After wading through these issues, the court finds that the affidavit fails to establish probable cause to search the residence and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Relevance of\n    <em>\n     Franks\n    </em>\n    Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The government argues that the findings from the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling should not be considered in evaluating probable cause to search the residence because each search was authorized by a separate warrant and the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing was limited to questions relating to TWC Auto Body. The government also seeks, in the event the court considers those findings relevant, reconsideration of the finding that the affidavit's allegation that CS \"relayed\" he \"would obtain kilogram quantities of cocaine\" at TWC Auto Body was false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, the government asserts that a subsidiary factual finding-\"no witnesses\n   testified CS ever stated he had received cocaine at TWC Auto Body,\"\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   436 -was erroneous, because the court overlooked Smith's testimony that CS did tell him \"he would go to TWC and obtain kilograms from [Defendant],\" (Dkt. No. 146, Tr. of Ev. Hr'g November 8, 2017, at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, as to the assertion that the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   findings should be disregarded, the court does not agree. As mentioned, the court opted to proceed in a piecemeal fashion-resolving the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   inquiry before addressing the search of the residence-precisely because the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling \"necessarily affect[s]\" the four-corners analysis as to whether the affidavit established probable cause to search the residence.\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204517963\">\n    2017 WL 4517963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 n.1. Because the government used the same affidavit in support of both search warrants, the alterations to that affidavit required by the court's findings of reckless falsehoods carry over to the present inquiry. Thus, the fact that different warrants authorized the two searches is beside the point, as the same factual allegations in the affidavit (some of which were found by the court to be false or incomplete) form the basis for the authorization of both warrants. In addition, the searches of the business and residence resulted from the same investigation, and Defendant has challenged those searches in the same motion. As Defendant argues, these issues are inextricably intertwined. Moreover, as a practical matter, the court does not believe it could or should blind itself to its previous findings made in the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099340\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/614/#p622\">\n    249 F.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622-24 (7th Cir. 2001) (holding the district court clearly erred based on evidence presented at a separate suppression hearing for a co-defendant revealing false testimony, and rejecting \"the government's invitation to consider the officer's credibility regarding the preparation of the [search warrant] affidavit in isolation, divorced from a consideration of their lack of credibility in connection with\" the false testimony revealed in the separate hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, as to the motion for reconsideration, that motion will be denied. As the government itself acknowledges, the disputed finding regarding CS stating that he \"would obtain kilogram quantities of cocaine\" at TWC Auto Body is not particularly relevant to the search of the residence, because the present inquiry is focused on the connection between criminal activity and Defendant's residence, not his business. On the other hand, this allegation-if not stricken from the affidavit- arguably supports the inference that Defendant was an established or long-time drug dealer, a factor (discussed below) which potentially does bear on whether evidence of criminal activity is likely to be found at the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In any event, the court is not persuaded that it should alter its ultimate finding based on the evidence cited by the government. The government is correct that Smith did testify, contrary to the court's findings, that CS stated \"he would go to TWC and obtain kilograms from [Defendant].\" (Dkt. No. 146 at 56.) However, as the court noted in its\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling and the government does not dispute, \"[n]o DEA reports indicate that CS made [this] statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525306\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/427/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, Smith's testimony that CS stated \"he would go to TWC and obtain kilograms from [Defendant],\" (Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 131-1.) The affidavit alleged the following information particular to Defendant. After law enforcement seized the three kilograms of cocaine from CS, he agreed to cooperate and stated that he obtained the drugs from Defendant \"on behalf of Gonzalez.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) CS explained that Defendant \"is a close criminal associate of Gonzalez and oversees distribution of the narcotics for\" him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16(a).) CS recorded a handful of conversations with Gonzalez and Defendant, during which CS told them the three kilograms had been stolen during a robbery and they discussed the quality of certain hidden compartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, 18, 20, 28, 36.) During one meeting, \"while discussing [CS's] safety during drug transactions, [Defendant] showed [CS] a firearm ... in his possession.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) During another meeting, Defendant \"relayed that the trapped vehicles were currently in the garage of Cano Used Tires, which is immediately adjacent to and accessible from JGL Truck Sales,\" Gonzalez's business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Defendant also indicated at this meeting that he may \"shut down for a while and cool off.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And at another meeting, Defendant indicated that he did not then have any supply\n   of drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The following information has been altered or removed from the affidavit as a result of the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ruling. As submitted, the affidavit stated CS obtained the kilograms of cocaine later seized by law enforcement at TWC Auto Body. However, in light of the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, the reformed affidavit now asserts that this transaction occurred at CS's business address in Springfield. That same sentence in the affidavit also originally asserted that CS \"would obtain kilogram quantities of cocaine\" at TWC Auto Body, and another paragraph stated CS was \"a known cocaine trafficker.\" Both of these statements, as discussed in the preceding section, have been removed from the reformed affidavit for lack of evidentiary support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"A warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a crime has been committed-the 'commission' element, and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place searched-the so-called 'nexus' element.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
