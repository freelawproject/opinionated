However, the case for deference is particularly limited where no such guidance exists. Apparently, DOJ has not yet promulgated regulations related to website accessibility under the ADA. In fact, the DOJ listed the only overture it made towards enacting said rules - the ANPRM - as inactive after seven years without movement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,\n   <em>\n    Inactive RINs: 2017 Agenda Update, supra.\n   </em>\n   As a result, it appears unlikely that the agency will make itself heard in the near future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The inactive status of the ANPRM also contradicts the Defendant's suggestion that the Plaintiff made a prior application to the DOJ.

The Court disagrees. The lack of specific regulations do not excuse non-compliance with the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Title III mandates that places of public accommodation cannot discriminate on the basis of disability by denying equal access to the goods, services, and benefits offered to the public.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Therefore, text of the statute, at a minimum, provided the Defendant notice of its general obligation to ensure equal access, including the potential requirement to provide reasonable accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Defendant does not argue that Title III itself infringes on its due process rights. Nor does the Defendant claim that websites fall entirely out of reach of Title III. Rather, the Defendant appears to believe that it lacks sufficient notice on\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      how\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   to comply with Title III due to the absence of DOJ regulations designating a specific website accessibility standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   However, this argument fails because the statutory mandate of Title III provides the Defendant ample notice of its duty not to discriminate.

In the ANPRM, it confirmed its position that \"ADA applies to Web sites of private entities that meet the definition of 'public accommodations,' \" ANPRM at 43464, explaining that: \"the statute's broad and expansive nondiscrimination mandate reaches goods and services provided by covered entities on Web sites over the Internet,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43463.

In raising this argument, the Defendant appears to take issue with the ADA itself. As Judge Weinstein explained when rejecting a similar argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The defendant's principal complaint appears to be that it wants there to be black-and-white rules for ADA compliance, and here, there may be shades of gray. But the anti-discrimination provisions the defendant is accused of violating are not simple checklists of clear-cut rules-they are standards that are meant to be applied contextually and flexibly.
