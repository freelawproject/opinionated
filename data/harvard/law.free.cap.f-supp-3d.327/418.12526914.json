Conn. 2017) (\" Conversion Ruling\"), familiarity with which is assumed, the Court granted in part Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint, and converted that motion to dismiss in part into motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Those conversions resulted in three motions for summary judgment, which this Ruling resolves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the pertinent times, Plaintiffs Harasz and Wirth resided in the Town of Glastonbury, Connecticut, and took in foster children for adoption under the supervision of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (\"DCF\"). In November 2011, at the initiation of DCF, Harasz and Wirth were arrested by Glastonbury police officers on several charges of misconduct with respect to certain adopted children in their care. Harasz and Wirth were charged with sexual assault, cruelty to persons, and risk of injury to a minor. A state court bench trial resulted in the acquittal of Wirth on all charges against him. The State subsequently dropped all charges against Harasz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed a civil rights action in Connecticut Superior Court, which was removed to this Court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction. The defendants were Joette Katz, the DCF Commissioner; Elizabeth Ferreira, a DCF social worker; the Town of Glastonbury; and James Kennedy and William Trantalis, Glastonbury police officers. The individual defendants were involved, in one way or another, with the charging, arrests, or state proceedings against Harasz or Wirth. Plaintiffs alleged federal constitutional and state constitutional and law claims against various individual defendants. Specifically, Plaintiffs asserted claims for failure to train and supervise DCF employees; false arrest; malicious prosecution; and fabrication of evidence. The operative pleading is an Amended Complaint [Doc. 33].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Conversion Ruling dismissed all of Plaintiffs' claims against Katz and Trantalis. As for Ferreira, the only claims against her were for fabrication of evidence. The Court converted Defendants' motion to dismiss those claims against Ferreira into a motion for summary judgment. As for Kennedy, the only claims against him (and against Glastonbury for indemnification) were for fabrication of evidence and malicious prosecution. The Court converted Defendants' motion to dismiss those claims into a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Those conversions led to the summary judgment motions this Ruling resolves. Defendant Ferreira moves for summary judgment [Doc. 48] with respect to the counts in the Amended Complaint naming her as a defendant. Plaintiffs Harasz and Wirth move for partial summary judgment on liability [Doc. 51] against Defendant Kennedy. Defendants Kennedy and Town of Glastonbury move for summary judgment [Doc. 52] with respect to the counts in the Amended Complaint naming them as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   These uncontested facts are drawn from the Parties' various statements of fact, filed in the format prescribed by Local Rule 56(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 48, 52-2, 59-1, 71, 73, 75-1, 76-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the pertinent times, Plaintiffs were citizens of the United States and the\n   State of Connecticut. They resided together in the Town of Glastonbury, Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Elizabeth Ferreira was employed as a social worker by the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (\"DCF\"), assigned to its Manchester, Connecticut office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Town of Glastonbury, Connecticut is a municipality which operates, directs and controls the Glastonbury Police Department. Defendant James Kennedy is a Glastonbury police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   All claims against named Defendants Joette Katz and William Trantalis were dismissed by prior Ruling [Doc. 46] of this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267800\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/461/\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs advised DCF that they were willing to take in foster children for adoption, providing that none had past sex abuse issues. Over the years, DCF was responsive to Plaintiffs' offer. Prior to 2011, Harasz and Wirth adopted nine children, who were born during the years 1990 though 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The events underlying Plaintiffs' remaining claims, which survived the prior motion to dismiss and lie at the heart of the present summary judgment motions, relate to disclosures allegedly made by their youngest child, a boy born August 2006 and adopted by Plaintiffs in April 2007, identified throughout as \"Doe # 9.\" Doe # 9 suffers from learning disabilities and developmental delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Doe # 9 and four of his siblings were in DCF's care and custody as of February 8, 2011, pursuant to an order of temporary custody. The siblings were removed from Plaintiffs' care following disclosures of abuse made by an older sibling, Doe # 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant Ferreira was assigned to Doe # 9's case as a treatment social worker on or about February 28, 2011. In early June 2011, Doe # 9 began receiving therapy from Dr. Carol Kagel, a psychologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 3, 2011, Doe # 9 attended his ninth therapy session with Dr. Kagel. Dr. Kagel reported that, during the August 3 session, Doe # 9 made a spontaneous disclosure of sexual abuse by Plaintiff Harasz. On or about August 9, 2011, Dr. Kagel, a mandated reporter, made a report of suspected child abuse to the DCF telephone hotline. On August 9, 2011, Defendant Kennedy received a call from DCF, alerting him to Dr. Kagel's report of Doe # 9's disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a result of Dr. Kagel's report, Defendant Kennedy arranged for a forensic interview of Doe # 9. On August 11, 2011, Doe # 9 was interviewed at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, in Hartford, Connecticut (\"the forensic interview\"). The forensic interview was conducted by Ann Glaser, a diagnostic interviewer on the staff of the St. Francis Children's Center, and was video-recorded. Defendants Ferreira and Kennedy observed the forensic interview from behind a one-way mirror in an adjoining room. Glaser wore an earpiece during the interview, through which the observers could communicate with her. Ferreira and Kennedy were also equipped with devices which enabled them to hear what was being said in the interview room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the forensic interview on August 11, and according to the reports of Defendant Ferreira, on Friday, August 12, 2011, Doe # 9 made a disclosure of sexual abuse to his foster parent, Lisa K. That same day, Defendant Ferreira supervised Doe # 9 during a sibling visit at DCF's Manchester office. Ferreira reports that Doe # 9 made a disclosure of sexual abuse to Ferreira during that sibling visit. Defendant Ferreira reported these additional disclosures to Defendant Kennedy on August 16, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 1, 2011, Defendant Kennedy signed a five-page, 16-numbered-paragraph sworn affidavit captioned \"Application\n   for Arrest Warrant\" and addressed to \"A Judge of the Superior Court.\" Under the caption on the application reading \"Name and Residence of Accused,\" the name of Plaintiff George F. Harasz and his Glastonbury address are typed in. Kennedy's affidavit supporting the arrest warrant application describes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the content of the August 11 forensic interview, as well as Doe # 9's disclosures to Kagel, Defendant Ferreira, and Lisa K. Defendant Kennedy consulted the videotape of the forensic interview in drafting his affidavit. The affidavit concluded that there was probable cause to believe that Plaintiff Harasz had violated Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53a-70 and \u00a7 53a-73 (sexual assault).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 22, 2011, Judge Taylor of the Connecticut Superior Court, sitting in Manchester, signed the arrest affidavit, thereby converting that document into a warrant for Plaintiff Harasz's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 30, 2011, Harasz and Wirth were arrested by the State of Connecticut authorities on charges of misconduct with respect to some of the adopted children in their care. Specifically, the Plaintiffs were charged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , with sexual assault, cruelty to persons, and risk of injury to a minor. Plaintiffs denied all charges. In September 2014, following a bench trial before a state court judge, Wirth was found not guilty of all charges against him. In October 2014, Harasz moved successfully for the dismissal of all charges against him. Plaintiffs' state court exonerations on these charges led directly to the federal constitutional and state law claims they allege in the present action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Therefore, to defeat Defendants' motions for summary judgment on this claim, Plaintiffs need only establish a material issue of disputed fact as to whether either Defendant actually fabricated evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the discussion that follows, the fabrication claims against Kennedy and Ferreira are considered separately. Kennedy's case has generated cross-motions: Kennedy moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim against him for fabrication of evidence; Plaintiffs cross-move for partial summary judgment on liability on that claim against Kennedy. Ferreira moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for fabrication against her. Plaintiffs oppose that motion, but do not cross-move against Ferreira for summary disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. As to Defendant Kennedy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to Defendant Kennedy, much of the Amended Complaint's claim for fabrication of evidence relies on his alleged falsification of the arrest affidavit. Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that Kennedy misstated or misrepresented statements made by Doe # 9 at the August 11, 2011 forensic interview, which Kennedy observed: \"Plaintiffs' claim is that the statements Kennedy made in his arrest affidavit in regard to the forensic interview were fabricated in that they were affirmative falsehoods in which he deliberately mischaracterized what Doe # 9 said, combined with misleading statements and omissions.\" Pl.

The tape [of Doe # 9's forensic interview] is available.... Kennedy's affidavit is in the record....Whether the contents of the affidavit accurately recite the substance of the interview, or materially misrepresent those contents, is a question forming the stuff of summary disposition by a trial judge or fact finding by a trial jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267800\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/461/\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 496-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As explained in that Ruling, while these two key pieces of evidence were both technically available to the Court, consideration of the tape of Doe # 9's forensic interview was inappropriate on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The case has now reached the summary disposition stage, where the tape, as well as the affidavit, may be considered. In addition, the Court has received a certified transcription\n   of the August 11, 2011 forensic interview, filed under seal [Doc. 50]. The transcript does not substitute for the viewing of the tape; it cannot convey the \"physical setting and actions\" accompanying the words of the interviewer and interviewee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267800\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/461/\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 497-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the transcript, whose accuracy is uncontested, is a useful common ground of understanding, from which this opinion will quote at will, considering it an accurate representation of the\n   <em>\n    words\n   </em>\n   , if not the complete context, of the August 11 interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In their Opposition Brief to the Glastonbury Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 62] and the supporting Rule 56(a)(2) Statement [Doc. 73], Plaintiffs make repeated attack upon the third-party sources upon whom Defendant Kennedy reportedly relied for portions of the arrest affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. R. 56 (a)(2) Stmt. \u00b6 3 (\"Doe # 9 was forced to attend inappropriate 'therapy' sessions with Dr. Kagel ...

Factual disputes as to \"actual fabrication or falsification of evidence\" are material; factual disputes as to whether Defendant Kennedy merely \"omitt[ed] potentially helpful information,\" such as \"interviews with important witnesses and potentially exculpatory video evidence,\" are not material, because such omissions, standing alone, do not state a claim for fabrication of evidence\n   <em>\n    by Kennedy.

But I preface that analysis by quoting \u00b6 8 of the affidavit in its entirety. While the affidavit describes other incidents at other times and in different places, \u00b6 8 is the place where Kennedy undertakes to describe the substance of what transpired during the interview. \u00b6 8 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   THAT the affiant observed the forensic interview of the victim through a one way glass mirror. The victim was asked who he lives with and he said, \"Daddy\" and \"Dad.\" The victim said that \"Daddy\" is \"Daddy Harasz.\" The victim identifies his penis as his \"Weiner.\" The victim complains of a headache when he starts\n   to talk about what \"Daddy\" does to him. The victim says that he gets in trouble and has to sit on the steps. The victim then pointed to his \"Weiner\" and he said that [name of a sibling, Doe # 5, redacted] made him touch his \"Weiner.\" The victim said that \"Daddy grabbed his weiner\" and the victim yelled, \"stop it daddy\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Notice should also be taken of \u00b6 14 of Kennedy's affidavit, which recounts a number of incidents leading Kennedy to the conclusion that \"the victim in this case remained consistent in what he discloses,\" and says about the forensic interview: \"During the forensic interview on 08/11/11, the victim stated again, 'Daddy grabbed his weiner, then the victim yelled 'Stop it Daddy.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In order to evaluate Plaintiffs' claim that Kennedy fabricated evidence against Harasz, the Court must carefully compare the video tape and typed transcript of the Doe # 9's forensic interview. on the one hand, with what Kennedy said about that interview in the arrest affidavit submitted to Judge Taylor, on the other hand. That necessity arises from Plaintiffs' principal contention: the affidavit repeatedly falsely portrayed what was said or done during the interview, each time to Harasz's disadvantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs contend on this motion that \u00b6 8 of the affidavit, and its reprise in \u00b6 14, contain a number of instances of fabrication of evidence by Kennedy.

Br. [Doc. 60] at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The interview transcript at page 8 documents the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ADULT: Okay. Okay. Now, back to this part, this part that's circled and you didn't give me a name for it. Can you give me a name for that, what you use for that part of your body? Or do you want choices again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   CHILD: I want choices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ADULT: Okay. Some people call that a penis, some people call that a wiener, some people call that a pee-pee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   CHILD: (Laughing) A wiener?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   ADULT: Yeah.

The verb \"Identify\" is capable of several applications or meanings. The interviewer presented to Doe # 9 three nouns to apply to a body part, and the child chose \"weiner,\" a word that apparently amused the child because he prefaced his choice by laughing. That is the exchange recited by the transcript and visible on the tape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   No fabrication of evidence by Kennedy is discernible in his description of it in his affidavit. Just as a statute (or a legal opinion) will be careful to define critical terms, Kennedy's affidavit accurately defines, for the reviewing judge, the terms Doe # 9 used in the forensic interview. For the purposes of Doe # 9's statements that follow, \"Daddy\" means Plaintiff Harasz, and \"weiner\" means penis. On this particular point, Defendant Kennedy has neither fabricated nor falsified any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Headache\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The issue here arises out of references to\n   <em>\n    headaches\n   </em>\n   in the arrest affidavit written by Kennedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In \u00b6 8 of his affidavit, where Kennedy undertakes to describe the August 11 forensic interview, it is said: \"The victim complains of a headache when he starts to talk about what 'Daddy' does to him.\" \u00b6 13 of the affidavit says: \"The victim complains of a headache just prior to disclosing things about 'Daddy.' \" \u00b6 14 says: \"The victim consistently would complain of a headache just prior to him disclosing a new piece of information.\" Judging by the affidavit's phrasing, the references in \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 13 relate to utterances made during the forensic interview. The reference in \u00b6 14 to headache complaints appears to relate to occasions other than the forensic interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On these summary judgment motions, Plaintiffs \"deny the references to headaches have to do with Daddy as they are deliberately mischaracterized and taken out of context.\" Pl. R. 56 (a)(2) Stmt. \u00b6 7. Plaintiffs' main brief [Doc. 51-1 at 4] argues that the quoted sentence from \u00b6 8 of the Kennedy affidavit \"is false and misleading. From the video it is clear that the 'headache' was engendered by the interviewer.\" Similarly, the brief criticizes the quoted sentence from \u00b6 14 as \"again false and misleading, as there was no observable link between headaches and Harasz from viewing the video. Again, the headaches are logically induced from the conduct of the interview.\" Plaintiffs' supplemental brief [Doc. 60 at 4] returns to \u00b6 8 of the affidavit, and says of it: \"Kennedy claimed the victim complains of a headache when he starts to talk about what 'Daddy' does to him. This is misleading and not accurate, as Kennedy attempted to tie headaches into sexual abuse when in fact Doe # 9 referenced headaches in several contexts. Doe # 9's first reference to a 'headache' is about dad's headache, not his own.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In point of fact, there were three occasions during the forensic interview when the interviewer asked Doe # 9 questions about physical abuse and/or Plaintiff Harasz and Doe # 9 responded with references to headaches:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   ADULT [social worker Ann Glaser]: Okay.

In addition to the criticisms previously noted, Plaintiffs contend in their Rule 56(a)(2) statement that Kennedy's characterization in his affidavit of these exchanges during the interview are \"mischaracterized and taken out of context,\" an accusation Plaintiffs expand upon by saying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Omitted is that Doe # 9 has been barraged with questions for nearly an hour and has asked the interview to stop the questioning numerous times, starting shortly after the session began. When the video is seen as a whole, it can clearly be seen that the headaches were from the barrage of questions thrown at 4-year-old Doe # 9 by the interviewer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Pl. R. 56 (a)(2) Stmt. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Plaintiffs' argument is that the references in Kennedy's affidavit to \"headaches\" constitute deliberate fabrication of evidence by Kennedy for the purpose of influencing Judge Taylor to issue a warrant to arrest George Harasz. A rational jury could not make that finding on the basis of the \"headache\" references. \"Information may be 'false' if material omissions render an otherwise true statement false.\"\n   <em>\n    Morse v. Fusto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355967\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/538/#p548\">\n    804 F.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548 (2d Cir. 2015). Defendant Kennedy's characterization of Doe # 9's headache complaints does not contain such\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   omissions. Omitting the fact that Doe # 9 had asked for the interview to be stopped does not render Defendant Kennedy's characterization of Doe # 9's headache complaints false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The sections of the transcript quoted immediately\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   are the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   references Doe # 9 makes to his own experience of \"headache\" in the entire forensic interview. Having reviewed the tape, I find Plaintiffs' explanation for Doe # 9's complaints plausible enough - it may well be that the four-year-old Doe # 9's complaints of headache were inspired by his subjective experience of the interview\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   as tiresome, rather than any reaction to the\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   of the questions. But that does not negate the factual basis for Defendant Kennedy's affidavit, which is derived from words actually spoken during the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Sitting on the stairs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Kennedy's arrest affidavit states at \u00b6 8: \"The victim said that he gets in trouble and has to sit on the steps.\" That is the only reference in the affidavit to Doe\n   # 9 being made to sit on the steps or the stairs. Plaintiffs do not contend on this motion that Doe # 9 said\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   during the forensic interview about sitting on the steps; rather, Plaintiffs' criticism is that the affidavit's account was incomplete. Plaintiffs argue that the affidavit's reference to sitting on the steps \"was deliberately mischaracterized as Doe # 9 clearly stated that his SISTER made him sit on the stairs and did not make any reference to Daddy Harasz and sitting on the stairs.\" Pl. R. 56 (a)(2) Stmt. \u00b6 7. Plaintiffs' reply brief [Doc. 60] at 5 says of the statement in the arrest warrant: \"This is misleading as Kennedy omits that his sister, not daddy, made him sit on the stairs and nowhere is there any link to Harasz and the stairs and any sexual abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiffs' account of this aspect of the interview is corroborated by the interview tape and transcript. Doe # 9 uttered only one explicit reference to being made to sit on the stairs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   ADULT: Okay. What does being a bad boy mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   CHILD: Getting in trouble and sitting on the stairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   ADULT: Okay. Who makes you sit on the stairs when you get in trouble?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   CHILD: My sister.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Tr. 22:12-16. Plaintiffs' reply brief at 5-6 quotes a further exchange, when the interviewer returned to the subject of sitting on the stairs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   ADULT: You know what, C[redacted], you told me that your daddy makes you sit on the stairs and hits you on the butt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   CHILD: Um-hum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   ADULT: Sends you to time out. What else does daddy do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   CHILD: I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Tr. 36: 7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiffs' briefs correctly observe that in the first quoted exchange, Doe # 9 said his sister (not his \"daddy\") made him sit on the stairs. That being the case, one does not know what to make of the interviewer's framing the follow-up question in the second exchange with the words \"you told me that your daddy makes you sit on the stairs.\" If the interviewer's objective was to elicit a particular response from Doe # 9, the effort was unsuccessful; the child's response is non-committal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   However, the reference Kennedy makes in his affidavit to what Doe # 9 said during the forensic interview about sitting on the stairs does not, by itself or in combination with other utterances, demonstrate fabrication of evidence by Kennedy for the illicit purpose of influencing Judge Taylor to issue an arrest warrant for Harasz.

Interviewer Glaser thereupon terminated the interview, the developmentally disabled four-year-old child having clearly reached the end of his tether. Glaser parted from Doe # 9 by assuring him that he could come back and talk more with her, or talk to \"Liz\" (Ferreira, his case worker) or Dr. Kagel, those being people Doe # 9 \"can talk to if you remember things or if you're feeling scared or if you need any help .\" Tr. 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   It is necessary, at this stage of the analysis, to pay careful attention to the use Kennedy made of\n   <em>\n    quotation marks\n   </em>\n   when he undertook to describe in his September 1, 2011 arrest affidavit what transpired during the August 11 forensic interview. The account Kennedy gave of the interview appears in \u00b6 8 of the affidavit. The interview video tape, with an elapsed time of 59 minutes 24 seconds, reveals that Doe # 9 was a difficult subject who taxed the patience and skill of the trained interviewer. \u00b6 8 of Kennedy's affidavit ascribes a number of utterances to Doe # 9. Only two of them, both appearing in the last sentence of \u00b6 8, are placed within quotation marks:. That sentence reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    The victim said that \"Daddy grabbed his weiner\" and the victim yelled, \"stop it daddy.\"\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The other utterances the affidavit ascribes to Doe # 9 take the form of substantive paraphrases without being placed in quotation marks,\n   <em>\n    viz\n   </em>\n   , \"The victim complains of a headache when he starts to talk about what 'Daddy' does to him. The victim said that he gets in trouble and has to sit on the steps.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In support of their accusation that Kennedy fabricated evidence, Plaintiffs stress that of the several utterances \u00b6 8 of the affidavit ascribes to Doe # 9, the only two utterances placed in quotation marks are those appearing in the last sentence: \"Daddy grabbed his weiner\" and \"stop it daddy.\" If these quotation marks are intended to convey exact words the child uttered at the precise moment, the interview transcript does not support that interpretation. While Doe # 9 replied in the affirmative when the interviewer inquired whether \"Your daddy grabbed your weiner,\" at no time did Doe # 9\n   <em>\n    say\n   </em>\n   verbatim: \"Daddy grabbed his [my] weiner.\" And while according to the transcript Doe # 9\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   say \"stop it Daddy,\" it was in the quite different context of the child describing how Harasz spanked him when he was bad. The transcript does not reveal Doe# 9 uttering the verbatim phrase \"stop it daddy\" following his affirmative response to the interviewer's inquiry into whether Plaintiff Harasz grabbed Doe # 9's penis. When asked by the interviewer \"[w]hen Daddy grabbed your wiener, what were you saying?\" Doe # 9 responded, \"[s]top it.\" The interviewer had just previously asked \"When daddy touched your weiner, what did he say?\" and Doe # 9 answered: \"Stop it.\" Between those two answers, the child said \"Let's go back home\"; he was clearly at the end of his tether; the interview concluded shortly thereafter; the tape and the transcript do not support the verbatim phrase the affidavit ascribes to Doe # 9 at the moment of described weiner-grabbing by \"Daddy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   These circumstances are relevant to the issue of fabrication because it is reasonable to infer that, by placing these statements ascribed to Doe # 9 in quotation marks, Kennedy's arrest affidavit intended the statements to be read as direct quotations, not paraphrased or interpreted dialogue. In \u00b6 8, the paragraph from which they are taken, these are the only two quoted phrases, while other declarations are made without quotation marks,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"The victim complains of a headache ....

At the beginning of the session the victim grabbed two baby dolls in her office and began to disclose. The victim said, \"Daddy\" and the doctor asked which Daddy, since the victim has 2 male parents. The victim said \"George.\" The victim then said \"put it in my butt.\" The victim indicated that it hurt. Dr. Kagel asked what was put in to his butt and the victim said, \"penis.\" The victim then went on to explain that he was sleeping and screamed real loud. The victim became distracted and Dr. Kagel tried to reengage the conversation and the victim said, \"I am done, call the police, stop Daddy. He keeps holding my penis.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   While the affidavit does not say so explicitly, it is apparent, and I find, that this account of Doe # 9's statements to Dr. Kagel during a therapy session on August 3 is based upon an interview Kennedy conducted with Dr. Kagel after receiving the Department's initial telephone call on August 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The arrest affidavit then says at \u00b6 7 that \"as a result of this disclosure, the affiant [Kennedy] made contact with DCF Social Worker Shannon Kiss and the victim was set up with a forensic Interview at Saint Francis Hospital.\" This is the August 11 forensic interview discussed and quoted in this Ruling,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . As the Conversion Ruling points out,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267800\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/461/\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Kennedy included in his arrest affidavit submitted to Judge Taylor \"Ferreira's separate report to Kennedy five days later, on August 16, that Doe # 9 had made additional charges of abuse by Harasz.\" Kennedy's arrest affidavit was sworn to on September 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   The record having been enlarged since the Court's prior opinion, it is now clear that no reasonable juror could conclude Kennedy committed the tort of fabrication of evidence. At the heart of the case, Plaintiffs' claim of fabrication targets Dr. Kagel and DCF social worker Ferreira, to whom Doe # 9 reported on separate occasions that Harasz had abused him. Plaintiffs' final brief on these summary judgment motions argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   Plaintiffs deny that Doe # 9 made the disclosures that were reported by Dr. Kagel and Ferreira. Plaintiffs claim that these disclosures were fabricated. This is not an issue of the credibility of Doe # 9's disclosures but of the\n   <em>\n    report\n   </em>\n   of the alleged disclosures. Plaintiffs admit that Dr. Kagel made a report and that Ferreira made a report, but Plaintiffs deny Doe # 9 made the disclosures that were reported..... Plaintiffs' claim is that after viewing the videotape, it becomes abundantly clear that Doe # 9 was incapable of making the reported disclosure to Dr. Kagel on 8/3/2011 and to Ferreira on 8/12/2011 - that it was self-evident that such disclosures were impossible.... Plaintiffs claim that any viewer of the videotape would conclude that Doe # 9 was incapable of making the disclosures\n   <em>\n    reported\n   </em>\n   by Dr. Kagel and Ferreira and that the\n   <em>\n    reports\n   </em>\n   were thus suspect and not deemed credible.... Plaintiffs have consistently used quotation marks around the word \"disclosure\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   to indicate that the disclosure, as\n   <em>\n    reported\n   </em>\n   , was not in fact made, but was fabricated - in other word, the\n   <em>\n    report\n   </em>\n   was a lie.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Plaintiffs' Sur-Reply Brief [Doc. 72] at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Under this scenario, to which Plaintiffs are committed, the fabricators of evidence that Harasz abused Doe # 9 are a treating psychologist and a state agency social worker, rather than Kennedy, a Glastonbury police officer, who included the psychologist's and social worker's reports in the arrest affidavit he submitted to Judge Taylor. That theory of the case is fatal to a claim by Plaintiff Harasz that Kennedy fabricated evidence against that Plaintiff. Even if one accepts\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' startling assertions that Dr. Kagel and Ferreira fabricated - that is to say, made up - Doe # 9's accusations of Harasz, I have previously held in this case: \"Kennedy may have included in his affidavit unpersuasive or valueless evidence, but he is not liable for the tort of fabrication of evidence unless\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   made it up.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267800\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/461/\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). That ruling was correct when made and remains so today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Kennedy is, of course, responsible for the way in which he worded his arrest affidavit. Nothing in that aspect of the case sustains a claim for fabrication of evidence. To the extent the words in the affidavit ascribed to Doe # 9 and placed in quotation marks do not fully conform to the interview videotape, the discrepancies constitute reporting errors or misstatements, products of a very low order of negligence which bear no resemblance to the deliberate falsehoods characteristic of an evidence fabricator. Moreover, the quoted language's effect of identifying Harasz as Doe # 9's abuser may be regarded as a conflation of the evidence collected in the affidavit, since the affidavit also refers to the reports of Dr. Kagel and Ferreira containing the same identification of Plaintiff Harasz. It is reasonable to suppose that Kennedy, whose September 1 affidavit depended on his memory and impressions of the August 11 interview, was also influenced by the Kagel and Ferreira accounts of the accusations Doe # 9 had made against Harasz. Nor are the quotation-mark discrepancies material to the effect of the arrest affidavit upon Judge Taylor, who issued the warrant to arrest Harasz on the basis of an affidavit which, in addition to Kennedy's account of the forensic interview of Doe # 9, also informed the judicial officer about the substance of the Kagel and Ferreira reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   In short, Kennedy's use of quotation marks in the arrest affidavit does not sustain a claim that he fabricated evidence against Harasz. The other challenges Plaintiffs make to the wording of the affidavit do not sustain a fabrication claim against Kennedy, for the reasons stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . It follows that Defendant Kennedy is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's fabrication claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Plaintiffs' theory of fabrication by Kennedy is summed up in one of their briefs on these motions. \"Plaintiffs' claim is that the statements Kennedy made in his arrest affidavit in regard to the forensic interview were fabricated in that they were affirmative falsehoods in which he\n   deliberately mischaracterized what Doe # 9 said, combined with misleading statements and omissions.\" Pl. Br. in Opp. to Glastonbury Def. [Doc 62] at 19. Having reviewed the tape recording of the forensic interview, and considered each of Plaintiffs' specific objections to the language of the arrest affidavit, I hold that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the arrest affidavit's characterization of the August 11, 2011 forensic interview constituted deliberate fabrication of evidence by Defendant Kennedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   That conclusion is appropriately reached on this converted motion for summary judgment. Additional discovery, including examination of the forensic interview videotape and its transcript, has been accomplished. Defendants Kennedy and Glastonbury, who move for summary judgment on the factual ground that Kennedy did nothing wrong during his participation in the investigation into whether Harasz abused Doe # 9, must show \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Plaintiffs may successfully resist that motion if they assert that the factual propriety of Kennedy's conduct \"is genuinely disputed,\" Rule 56(c)(1), and support that assertion by citing to admissible evidence, Rule 56(c)(1)(A). Plaintiffs at bar assert that Kennedy fabricated evidence against Harasz, a fact which if proved would be\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   to these Defendants' liability. But the dispute cannot be regarded as\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   , since Plaintiffs cite to no evidence supporting their factual position. For the reasons stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , a charge of fabrication by Kennedy is not made out by comparing his arrest affidavit with the interview videotape; and Plaintiffs offer nothing further except calling Kennedy names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   In that respect, this case resembles the one confronting Judge Underhill in\n   <em>\n    Turner v. Boyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363595\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/116/58/\">\n    116 F.Supp.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. 2015), where the plaintiff charged a particular defendant with maliciously initiating a criminal proceeding against him. Judge Underhill granted a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss that complaint, reasoning in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   Instead of offering any factual allegations indicating that Bednarz made a false complaint or otherwise attempted to ensure that Hardy initiated criminal proceedings against Turner, Turner relies on conjecture, hyperbole and ad hominem attacks to encourage the court to speculate that Bednarz acted with malice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363595\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/116/58/\">\n    116 F.Supp.3d at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That reasoning echoes the Second Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Gannon v.

Judge Underhill declined to speculate in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   . So do I in the case at bar, in respect of Plaintiffs' fabrication claim against Kennedy, and also their fabrication claim against Ferreira, which suffers from the same lack of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In reviewing Dr. Kagel's file there are some notes that conspicuously stand out. Phone messages document that \"Liz\" placed numerous calls to Dr. Kagel both prior to after the 8/3/2011 \"disclosure.\" There is a remarkable file note on 7/28/2011 in which Dr. Kagel wrote that she spoke directly with Liz - and noted that there had been \"no disclosure\" of either boy to date. \"She indicated ... police have not filed criminal charges to date. DCF will list both fathers on their registry of sexual offenders of minors. DCF will seek permanent custody and placement of the boys.\" It is noteworthy, and suspicious, that during the very next session, Doe # 9 makes a \"disclosure\" which was at odds with anything said previously and strikingly at odds with the forensic interview, when the \"disclosure\" could not be duplicated. Dr. Kagel also notes phone calls with Liz Ferreira on 8/4/2011, 8/7/2011, 8/10/2011, 8/16/2011, as well as on other occasions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Pl. Amend.

Pl. Br. in Opp. to Ferreira, at 15. Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Ferreira's report that, on August 12, Doe # 9 said he was \"scared\" of Plaintiff Harasz is inherently suspicious in light of Doe # 9's expressions\n   of affection for Plaintiff Harasz during the forensic interview, one day earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   I find both of these purportedly suspicious discrepancies unavailing. \"[M]ere conclusory allegations, speculation or conjecture will not avail a party resisting summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Cifarelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7627041\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/93/47/#p51\">\n    93 F.3d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, at the time of their investigation, defendants were left with little or no basis to conclude that their\n   alleged misconduct could even potentially intrude upon plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Thus, while we make a close call in holding that there was no constitutional violation on the record before us, it is abundantly clear that it was objectively reasonable for defendants, in light of prior case law, to conclude that their investigation, however flawed, was consistent with plaintiffs' \"clearly established\" rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544082\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/89/#p105\">\n    182 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The Second Circuit applied its\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   holding in the subsequent case of\n   <em>\n    V.S. v.

Kennedy, a police officer assigned to investigate suspected child abuse, and Ferreira, a state agency case worker sharing that assignment, were under no obligation to conduct that sort of evaluation of a troubling report made by a qualified psychologist who was the child's therapist. The Glastonbury police and the DCF did just what common sense and reason required of them: commencing a child abuse investigation by means of a forensic interview (Kennedy and Ferreira participating together); conveying a further account by Doe # 9 of abuse by Harasz (Ferreira reporting to Kennedy); and including these investigatory results in an affidavit seeking Harasz's arrest (Kenendy as author of the affidavit). Kennedy and Ferreira are entitled to qualified immunity because the actions they took during the child abuse investigation in this case were objectively reasonable.
