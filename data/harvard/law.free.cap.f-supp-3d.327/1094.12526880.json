CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Comprehensive Security Inc., Associated Protected Service, Inc., and OnTrac Security LLC (together \"Plaintiffs\") bring this action against Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (\"Metro\") for injunctive relief, alleging violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act for monopolization and attempted monopolization. Before the Court is Metro's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 13). As explained below, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs operate private, security-for-hire companies in Davidson County and surrounding areas, hiring Peace Officer Standards and Training (\"POST\") certified police officers and licensed security guards to provide static security, mobile security, and traffic control. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10.) Plaintiffs have hired both Metro Nashville Police Department (\"MNPD\") officers and non-MNPD police officers who are POST-certified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiffs allege that MNPD has engaged in three types of anticompetitive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, Plaintiffs allege MNPD undercuts prices and operates at a loss. MNPD required private security companies to reveal their hourly charges and reduced their hourly rate to below cost based on this information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege MNPD uses the Form 150 to stifle competition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.) MNPD officers are required to obtain written permission from the MNPD to engage in secondary employment on Metro's \"Form 150 Secondary Employment Request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The MNPD instituted procedural hurdles for officers seeking secondary employment with private security companies, often requiring them to submit multiple Form 150s and have the company answer multiple rounds of questions prior to approving their Form 150. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Third, MNPD requires event coordinators and vendors to use MNPD officers and forbids their officers from working for private security companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-33.) MNPD representatives inform event coordinators at Special Events Committee meetings that they must use MNPD officers to handle traffic control and security. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) On January 26, 2018, MNPD published a written policy forbidding MNPD officers from working for private security companies at special events.

The police powers Metro relies upon only allocate the most general authority to Metro to govern local affairs and do not address private security services. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Boulder\n   </em>\n   , \"Acceptance of such a proposition-that the general grant of power to enact [laws regulating safety and order] necessarily implies state authorization to enact specific anticompetitive ordinances-would wholly eviscerate the concepts of 'clear articulation and affirmative expression' that our precedents require.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303605\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/40/#p50\">\n    455 U.S. at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303605\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/40/#p50\">\n    102 S.Ct. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the Complaint defines the relevant market as \"the marketing and sale of private security services in Davidson County,\" which include \"static security, mobile security, and traffic control\" and alleges a variety of anticompetitive conduct that does not involve regulating such services, including price setting and requiring vendors to only use MNPD officers for security. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 35.) Although mobile security may be considered a \"street patrol service\" if it occurs in a public area or thoroughfare to serve multiple customers or facilities, static security and traffic control do not fall within the definition of street patrol services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Metro's alleged anticompetitive conduct, particularly outside of the regulation of street patrol services, was not a foreseeable consequence of the Tennessee Private Protective Services Licensing Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Nat.

However, that opinion discusses,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , whether a private security officer, who was not also a police officer, could direct traffic on public streets and therefore does not support Metro's position. Metro also cites to Tenn. Op. Att'y. Gen.
