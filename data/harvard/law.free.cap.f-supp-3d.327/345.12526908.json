Plaintiff alleges that Scottrade violated its internal policy by hosting incentivized sales contests, thus violating state law. Scottrade responds that the Enforcement Section is merely attempting to enforce federal standards that were set forth in the now-vacated \"Fiduciary Rule.\" After plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the Securities Division, defendant removed the action to this Court.

M.G.L. c. 9, \u00a7 10A.

Thus, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination was deemed not court-like because its non-adjudicatory powers were more significant than its adjudicatory powers and because the agency was not considered judicial under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whelchel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297058\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/83/#p86\">\n    914 F.Supp.2d at 86-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation was deemed not court-like because the proceeding was not\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    partes\n   </em>\n   and the agency \"appears to be\n   more administrative than judicial.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire Bureau of Sec.

Both analyses apply with equal force to the Securities Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Massachusetts Securities Division is not a court for the purposes of the removal statute.
