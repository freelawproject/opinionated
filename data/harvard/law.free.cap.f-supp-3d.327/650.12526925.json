They contend that the consular officers' failure to accept their petitions contravenes existing statutes and agency regulations. What is more, Plaintiffs contend that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") has impermissibly failed to send personnel to the Embassy in Djibouti to adjudicate I-130 petitions. In consequence, Plaintiffs bring claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the Mandamus Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), codified in part at 5 U.S.C. ch. 5; and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Special Procedures for Petitioners Residing Abroad\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For a United States citizen living abroad who wishes to file an I-130 petition, the filing method hinges on whether USCIS maintains a field office in the petitioner's country of residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 Foreign Affairs Manual (\"FAM\") 504.2-3. If a USCIS field office exists, petitioners may file their I-130 petitions directly with the USCIS public counter at the local embassy or consulate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n    504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .2-3(B). If not, petitioners must typically file the petitions by mail to the Chicago lockbox. In some instances, where petitioners demonstrate exceptional circumstances, they may be permitted to file their petitions directly with their local embassy or consulate, even where there is no USCIS public counter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n    504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the face of exceptional circumstances, USCIS may, in its discretion after receiving requests from consular officers or other State Department officials, permit petitioners to file I-130 petitions at the local embassies or consulates. The Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If a consular section without a USCIS public counter presence encounters an exceptional circumstance case, then the Consular Chief, or another designated officer, must receive authorization from the regional USCIS Field Office Director (or his/her designee) prior to accepting and adjudicating the filing. Post should contact the appropriate USCIS field office by phone or e-mail, providing the specifics of the reason for the exception request. USCIS will have discretion\n   to determine which cases can be processed using the exceptional circumstances procedures and which petitioners should be directed to file by mail with the USCIS lockbox in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   9 FAM 504.2-4(B)(1)(b)(2). Examples of exceptional circumstances include: threats to personal safety, where the \"petitioner or beneficiary is facing an imminent threat to personal safety\"; medical emergencies requiring \"immediate travel\"; and \"[c]ases close to aging out[, where the] beneficiary is within a few months of aging out of eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n    504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .2-4(B)(1)(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   USCIS considers various factors, including cost, in determining whether to permit consular officers to accept petitions filed directly at local embassies or consulates. In a Policy Memorandum dated May 14, 2012, USCIS explained that, \"it is more cost-effective for USCIS to adjudicate all I-130s with certain limited exceptions\" than to permit \"consular officers [to] process[ ] I-130 [petitions] filed overseas where USCIS does not have a presence.\" INS Policy Memorandum, PM-602-0043. Accordingly, USCIS generally requires that a petitioner residing outside the United States file the I-130 petition by mailing it to a domestic lockbox.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The memo further explains that, \"[i]f a consular officer in an embassy or consulate where USCIS is not present encounters an individual case that the officer believes requires immediate processing due to exceptional circumstances, the consular officer should contact the USCIS Field Operating Director (FOD) with jurisdiction over that location to determine whether [the consular officer] may accept and adjudicate the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Without approval from the USCIS Field Operating Director, consular officers have no authority to accept or adjudicate I-130 petitions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Procedures Specific to I-130 Petitions Filed on Behalf of Yemeni Beneficiaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Yemen does not have an established system of recording vital statistics, and most Yemenis do not contemporaneously register births, marriages, divorces, and deaths.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Department of State, Visa Reciprocity Schedule for Yemen, https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country/Yemen.html (last visited Aug. 30, 2018). For that reason, USCIS generally does not consider civil documents issued in Yemen to be sufficient where a petitioner seeks to establish a qualifying relationship for I-130 purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIS Policy Memorandum, PM-602-0064. Where a petitioner is able to produce credible DNA evidence, USCIS may approve the petition without an in-person interview; by contrast, \"a case without DNA evidence cannot be approved without the petitioner first being interviewed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs' Efforts to File I-130 Petitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2015, the United States Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen, was permanently closed due to security concerns relating to the Yemeni civil war. (FAC \u00b6 23). The Embassy in Sana'a housed a USCIS public counter, where Americans could file I-130 petitions on behalf of Yemeni beneficiaries; the Embassy in Sana'a also had a USCIS adjudicator onsite. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). Following the Embassy's closure, the Department of State transferred pending visa applications to other embassies, including the Embassies in Djibouti and Malaysia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). USCIS does not have a public counter presence where individuals could file their petitions in Djibouti, nor any personnel stationed at the Embassy in Djibouti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that they attempted to file their I-130 petitions at the Embassy in Djibouti, but that the consular officers at the Embassy refused to accept the petitions. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29-35). They allege that Defendants \"deliberately caused ... unnecessary and excessive delays and expenses by refusing to accept direct filed I-130 Petitions at the [ ] Embassy in Djibouti.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Because of USCIS's lack of presence at the Embassy in Djibouti, and because consular officers in Djibouti have refused to accept Plaintiffs' petitions, Plaintiffs have been unable to file at the Embassy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). Plaintiffs allege that the lack of onsite USCIS adjudicators makes it impossible for petitioners to have interviews conducted in Djibouti, which in turn \"has caused families to be separated from each other[,]\" and \"[i]n many cases\" has prevented \"elderly individuals, minor children, and several ill individuals from entering the [United States] in order to seek much needed medical attention\" and has resulted in the \"death[s] of children and elderly applicants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   If Plaintiffs are not permitted to file at the Embassy in Djibouti, their alternative would be to mail their petitions to the Chicago lockbox. But \"USCIS maintains a policy of interviewing the petitioners of I-130 petitions for Yemen[i] nationals.\" (FAC \u00b6 29). As a result, if Plaintiffs were to file their petitions via the Chicago lockbox, they would be required to travel to the United States for in-person interviews, which they are presently unable to do. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566649\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/428/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they should not be required to mail their petitions to the Chicago lockbox, in light of \"exceptional circumstances\" that, under existing regulations, allegedly give them the right to file their petitions at the Embassy in Djibouti. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29-35). These exceptional circumstances include threats to personal safety, medical emergencies, and temporal proximity to aging out of eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.uscis.gov/archive/archive-news/uscis-centralizes-filing-form-i-130-0 (last visited Aug. 30, 2018). Plaintiff Thani Ahmed alleges, for example, that she is a \"de facto single mother\" who \"is unable to leave her minor children to travel to the United States to file an I-130 [p]etition\" or \"to attend an interview at a USCIS field office in the United States[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Plaintiff Abu Mobarez's wife \"is currently hospitalized and in critical condition,\" in light of which Mobarez \"qualifies to file a direct I-130 Petition at the [ ] Embassy in Djibouti for his 13[-]year[-]old daughter in Djibouti so that she may see her mother before her mother passes away.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30).

Plaintiff Intisar Moflehi is a United States citizen who seeks to file I-130 Petitions on behalf of her minor children, who may soon \"ag[e] out to qualify as a child of an Immediate Relative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants have \"failed to accept Plaintiffs' direct I-130 Petitions even though Plaintiffs meet the requirements for filing I-130 Petitions at the [ ] Embassy in Djibouti,\" and \"have failed to provide a USCIS onsite adjudicator at the [ ] Embassy in Djibouti despite the fact that the volume of directly filed I-130 Petitions necessitates USCIS to staff the [ ] Embassy with an onsite adjudicator.\" (FAC \u00b6 37). Though Plaintiffs have not mailed their petitions to the Chicago lockbox, they claim to have \"exhausted all administrative options for relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The first is the consular officers' decisions not to accept Plaintiffs' I-130 petitions, which Plaintiffs attempted to file at the Embassy in Djibouti; the second, USCIS's failure to send\n   an adjudicator to Djibouti, which, in Plaintiffs' estimation, all but guarantees that Plaintiffs would eventually be required to travel to the United States for in-person interviews, which they are unable to do. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29, 56, 58, 63). Plaintiffs allege that, together, these actions \"have caused Plaintiffs severe physical, emotional, and financial hardship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58). Plaintiffs allege in particular that Defendants have \"infringe[d] upon Plaintiffs['] ... liberty interests to make personal choices with regard to family matters free from unjustifiable government interference[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). Plaintiffs \"are in dire need of schooling, medical attention, housing[,] and reunification with their family in the United States.\" (Pl. Opp. 17). They argue that their injuries are \"concrete, ongoing, and directly traceable to Defendants\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and are caused \"by the willful failure of the Defendants[ ] to provide a USCIS adjudicator to adjudicate the emergency direct I-130 Petitions and forward the case[s] to the Department of State for Immigrant Visa processing, as is their duty\" (FAC \u00b6 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants, for their part, assert that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury-in-fact because they \"need not leave Djibouti in order to file an I-130 Petition that will be adjudicated.\" (Def. Reply 8). Defendants further contend that, \"[b]ecause petitioners can submit their petitions via the USCIS Lockbox ..., to the extent that the purported harm is that a petitioner may be required to travel to the United States for an in-person interview, until USCIS makes such a determination in a particular case, there is no imminent or actual harm as to any plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In Defendants' estimation, \"the Chicago Lockbox facility is an adequate alternative remedy that the plaintiffs have failed to even attempt to pursue, and thus their claimed injury is purely fictive and fails to satisfy the minimum constitutional requirements for standing.\" (Def. Br. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   If Plaintiffs' only alleged injuries were based on their inability to travel to the United States for in-person interviews that were necessitated by USCIS's failure to send an adjudicator to Djibouti and the policy requiring interviews in the absence of DNA evidence for Yemeni beneficiaries, the Court might agree with Defendants that Plaintiffs' injuries are too speculative to confer standing. After all, \"[i]n petitions involving a biological parent-child relationship, a petitioner may not be required to attend an in-person interview if the petitioner voluntarily submits the results of a credible DNA test performed by an accredited laboratory which support the claimed relationship.\" (Sung Decl. \u00b6 5). In addition, USCIS \"has the discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct the petitioner's in-person interview at a USCIS international field office ... [where] the petitioner demonstrates exceptional circumstances ... which prevent him or her from traveling to the United States[.]\" (Nicholson Decl. \u00b6 12). Contrary to Plaintiffs' allegations, it is not certain that Plaintiffs would have to travel to the United States for in-person interviews, even if they were to file their petitions via the Chicago lockbox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As it happens, however, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries do not rest exclusively on their inability to travel to the United States for in-person interviews. Instead, Plaintiffs also allege that current USCIS and State Department regulations give them - and other petitioners facing exceptional circumstances - the right to file their petitions directly at the Embassy in Djibouti. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 69). They further allege that they attempted to file their petitions at the Embassy, and that, contrary to existing policy, consular officers have refused to accept those petitions. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-35). Plaintiffs argue that, in rejecting their petitions, Defendants \"unlawfully infringe[d] upon Plaintiffs['] ... interest in having their famil[ies'] I-130\n   Petitions accepted and adjudicated in a manner consistent with their constitutionally protected procedural due process interests[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' alleged injury - the disregard of their right to file directly at the Embassy - is concrete and particularized, not speculative or hypothetical. Taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true, as the Court must do at this stage of the litigation, the Court cannot overlook the fact that consular officers in Djibouti have already refused to accept Plaintiffs' I-130 petitions, a refusal that in Plaintiffs' estimation has prevented them from being reunited with family members and from seeking much-needed medical attention, schooling, and housing. Those injuries have affected Plaintiffs \"in a personal and individual way,\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"actually exist,\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet Defendants do not cite any cases suggesting that exhaustion is necessary to establish injuries-in-fact for purposes of Article III standing. In fact, exhaustion is a matter of statutory, not Article III, standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Daines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906105\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/582/475/#p479\">\n    582 F.Supp.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). The inquiries are distinct. Defendants have failed to explain why Plaintiffs must file their petitions via the Chicago lockbox before claiming to have been injured by consular officers' refusal to accept their direct-filed petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants' claim that Plaintiffs have not been \"adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of the relevant statute\" is unpersuasive. (Def. Br. 11 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). If Plaintiffs are correct that existing regulations required consular officers to accept Plaintiffs' I-130 petitions, then the refusal to accept those petitions at the Embassy in Djibouti constitutes an \"agency action\" that \"adversely affected\" the Plaintiffs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It begins by noting that, although the doctrine of ripeness has both constitutional and prudential strands, Defendants focus exclusively on constitutional ripeness. In their view, Plaintiffs' claims are unripe because Plaintiffs \"have not attempted to file their I-130 petitions through the Chicago Lockbox ... [and] have thus failed to demonstrate an adverse agency action or harm.\" (Def. Br. 12). \"Because the [P]laintiffs' claims do not challenge a particular 'administrative decision [that] has been formalized,' ... they are not ripe for review and should be dismissed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p148\">\n    387 U.S. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p148\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants' ripeness arguments as they pertain to Plaintiffs' claims relating to USCIS's failures (i) to maintain a public counter presence at the Embassy in Djibouti and (ii) to send adjudicators to Djibouti. The Court previously explained that the alleged harm stemming from USCIS's lack of presence in Djibouti rests on the inevitability\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of an in-person interview in the United States. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that if they were to file their petitions via the USCIS lockbox in Chicago, they would be required to attend in-person interviews in the United States, which they would be unable to do. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 29 (\"Even if Plaintiff ... filed I-130 Petitions for her children by mailing [them] to USCIS'[s] Chicago lockbox, she would be required to attend an interview at a USCIS field office in the United States[.]\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   But as the Court has already explained, Plaintiffs' claim that they will be required to travel to the United States for in-person interviews is speculative.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   at Section (B)(1)(a). Indeed, in petitions involving biological child-parent relationships, petitioners may be exempted from the in-person interview requirement if they submit the results of DNA tests performed by accredited laboratories. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nicholson Decl. \u00b6 11). And, for all other relationships, or where DNA evidence is either unavailable or unreliable, USCIS \"has the discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct the petitioner's in-person interview at a USCIS international field office in cases where the petitioner is residing abroad and has either filed at the USCIS domestic lockbox or attempted to file abroad but [the Department of State] has exercised discretion not to accept the filing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The papers filed in connection with the pending motion suggest that USCIS has, in fact, granted the sole request it received to permit Plaintiffs to file locally in Djibouti. As Laurie O'Bryon, USCIS's Rome Field Office Director, explains: \"[USCIS was] unable to find any record for any of the named plaintiffs except Plaintiff Jabra Naji[.] A request for authorization to accept a locally-filed [ ] I-130 petition from Plaintiff Naji [ ] was received on September 5, 2017. I approved that request on the same day.\" (O'Bryon Decl. \u00b6 5). This suggests that Plaintiff Jabra Naji likely will not need to travel to the United States for a possible interview with USCIS in connection with her I-130 petition. No other request for authorization to file locally has been received by the USCIS Field Office in Rome. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To the extent that such requests are transmitted on behalf of other Plaintiffs, those Plaintiffs may similarly be permitted to file locally, and potentially exempted from traveling to the United States for any interviews in connection with their I-130 petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At this time, Plaintiffs' claims relating to their alleged inability to travel for in-person interviews are speculative and therefore unripe. Those claims will ripen only once Plaintiffs have filed their petitions, interviews have been scheduled requiring travel that Plaintiffs are unable to undertake, and Plaintiffs have been denied accommodations despite having demonstrated exceptional circumstances that prevent them from traveling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   By contrast, the claims relating to the consular officers' refusal to accept Plaintiffs' direct-filed I-130 petitions - allegedly in contravention of existing statutes and regulations - are ripe. Those injuries were sustained the moment the consular officers rejected Plaintiffs' applications. The injuries are not speculative, nor would the claims related thereto \"entangl[e] [the Court] in abstract disagreements over administrative policies[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p148\">\n    387 U.S. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p148\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

USCIS staffing decisions are based on numerous factors, and the weight accorded each is left to agency discretion. As Defendants explain, \"USCIS's international staffing decisions are [made] pursuant to a deliberative process which considers and balances several different factors - the number of immigration applications filed in a given location being only one of those factors.\" (Def. Br. 14 (citing Nicholson Decl. \u00b6 5 (\"The decision to allocate USCIS staff at an international location is not based solely on the volume of immigration benefit applications received[.]\") ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants identify at least five considerations that USCIS takes into account in its staffing decisions.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , USCIS considers its and the Department of Homeland Security's policy priorities. USCIS \"starts by identifying the missions and goals within the DHS Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report ..., including: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security, and Enforcing and Administering Our Immigration Laws.\" (Nicholson Decl. \u00b6 5(a) ).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , USCIS considers its workload, including\n   \"not only [ ] adjudicative work on immigration applications, but also non-adjudicative work such as providing immigration information services, furthering fraud detection and national security priorities, providing logistical support to the Refugee Affairs Division, and engaging in intra and inter-governmental liaison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5(b) ).\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , it considers cost, and seeks to identify tasks that could be performed at lesser cost in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5(c) ).\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , it considers whether the quality of work associated with particular tasks might improve if performed within the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5(d) ).\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , it considers the effect that sending personnel overseas might have on other agencies; and before it sends personnel to a consulate or embassy, it must receive permission from the State Department's Chief of Mission.

Though Plaintiffs allege that those decisions are made on an \"as need basis\" (FAC \u00b6 38), the declarations submitted by USCIS officials in support of the pending motion cite many other factors that inform USCIS's decisions regarding where to send its personnel, and where to direct petitioners to file their papers. Neither Congress nor any of the Executive agencies has articulated a standard according to which the Court could mandate that USCIS relocate its overseas personnel. The Court agrees with Defendants that \"in order to grant the relief sought, the Court would need to ... apply the government's competing objectives and priorities in determining where to place staff at its international consulates,\" and that this is \"precisely the discretionary and policy-based ... assessment[ ] precluded by the political question doctrine.\" (Def.

Yet the memorandum does not require consular officers to accept direct-filed I-130 petitions, nor does it compel USCIS to send adjudicators overseas to ensure that petitioners may file their petitions locally.

Nor have they established a \"clear right\" to the relief sought. Instead, USCIS, in its discretion, may require Plaintiffs to follow the default procedures by filing their petitions via the Chicago lockbox. Plaintiffs have also failed to establish that they lack an alternative remedy. As discussed above, Plaintiffs' suggestion that filing their petitions via the lockbox would be futile is speculative. Indeed, that claim rests on Plaintiffs' view that they would inevitably be required to travel to the United States for in-person interviews, a view that Plaintiffs have failed to substantiate and that contradicts existing agency regulations. For these reasons, Plaintiffs' claim under the Mandamus Act fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

In dismissing these claims, the Court does not fail to appreciate the hardships that Plaintiffs have faced, and continue to face, as a result of the ongoing civil war in Yemen and the circumstances of their continued residence in Djibouti. However, because Plaintiffs' claims relating to USCIS staffing decisions are unripe and non-justiciable, and because Plaintiffs' pleadings regarding consular officers' failure to accept direct-filed I-130 petitions fail to state a valid claim for relief, the Court must grant Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Plaintiffs are at times referred to in the pleadings and motion papers as \"petitioners.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The facts in this section are drawn from the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\" (Dkt. # 35) ), filed on October 25, 2017.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Goldberg Decl. \u00b6 47 (\"Defendants' refusal to reinstate the blanket authority to accept I-130 petitions and/or place an[ ] onsite adjudicator at the [ ] Embassy in Djibouti and/or Malaysia is arbitrary and capricious and rooted in animus towards Yemen[i] nationals.\") ). In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs similarly argue that the Trump Administration should be required to \"return to the policies and practices USCIS and [the] Department of State previously implemented [under the Obama Administration.]\" (Pl. Opp. 11). However, Plaintiffs' allegations in the FAC do not directly challenge USCIS's failure to grant blanket authority to the State Department. Instead, the FAC appears to assume that blanket authority presently exists. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FAC \u00b6 B (urging the Court to \"[m]andate that the Defendants[ ] accept and adjudicate the direct filing of Petitioner[s'] I-130 Petition[s] ... at the United States Embassy in Djibouti as is their duty under their blanket authority from USCIS[.]\") ). Because Plaintiffs' pleadings do not contest the legality of USCIS's failure to extend blanket authority to the State Department, the Court will not construe their pleadings as advancing any such claim. However, because Plaintiffs' opposition brief and Plaintiffs' counsel's declaration challenge the failure to extend blanket authority, the Court here notes that the political question doctrine precludes such a claim, for the same reasons that apply to Plaintiffs' challenge to USCIS's internal staffing decisions. In each instance, there is a \"textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p217\">\n     369 U.S. 186\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 217,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p217\">\n     82 S.Ct. 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p217\">\n     7 L.Ed.2d 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1962).
