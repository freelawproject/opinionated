DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The issue is whether a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action may be maintained against a VA doctor where, in the course of medical treatment, the doctor allegedly violated the patient's constitutional rights. Plaintiffs argue that adding this claim only involves seeking\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedies previously recognized, and that these remedies are necessary to provide the Turners complete relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Rep. Br. at 1, ECF No. 14. Defendant argues that to recognize a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy here would be unprecedented because such remedies are generally disfavored and inappropriate in cases such as this, given that Congress has prescribed an alternative procedure for these types of claims. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, recognizing a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy in this case would require an expansion of the remedy and \"the [Supreme] Court has made clear that expanding the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v.
