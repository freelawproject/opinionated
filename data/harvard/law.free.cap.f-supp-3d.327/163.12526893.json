The letter issued to Mr. Iaccarino contains no reason for why his punishment, expulsion, was the appropriate sanction. There is only one sentence in the letter that is related to the discipline imposed in this case: \"I have determined that I believe the alleged misconduct occurred and the discipline imposed--expulsion--was appropriate.\" AR at 1. This statement that \"the discipline imposed--expulsion--was appropriate\" is the kind of conclusory statement that this Court has repeatedly held is insufficient to explain an agency's action.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tourus Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725989,9499806\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/731/\">\n    259 F.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The letter says nothing other than that the 'Affidavit of Indigency you submitted in lieu of a cost bond is not adequately supported.'

First, the defendants argue that PS King's Inquiry Report adequately explained the expulsion. Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 18-1 at 16-18. This argument fails because, as explained above, the Inquiry Report clearly relied on erroneous facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 175-76. The decision on appeal did not consider those facts; rather it based its finding of misconduct on facts borne out by the administrative record in explaining why the misconduct occurred. AR at 1 (explaining the facts it found persuasive in reaching its finding of misconduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants' second argument that the record contains ample evidence to support Mr. Iaccarino's expulsion similarly misses the point. The defendants point to several FLETC rules that Mr. Iaccarino allegedly violated as a rationale for the expulsion. Defs.' Reply, ECF No. 21 at 5-7. To be sure, the agency explained its reasoning as to why the misconduct alleged was substantiated by the preponderance of the evidence. AR at 1. However, after the agency explained the basis for the finding of misconduct, it provided no reason as to\n   <em>\n    why the imposed sanction was warranted\n   </em>\n   based on that finding of misconduct. To the extent the defendants seek to fill that void with references to other violations that Mr. Iaccarino may have committed, this \"court[ ] may not accept [the defendants'] post hoc rationalizations\" as a substitute for DHS's explanation, or lack thereof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remmie v.

It chose expulsion, effectively ending Mr. Iaccarino's career in federal law enforcement. The Court notes it is not passing judgment on the agency's methods or forms of discipline.
