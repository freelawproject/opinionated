INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves a group of individuals who believe that they have been defrauded by a government institution established, in part, to protect their interests; an institution that they claim has been corrupted by private interests opposed to their own. Plaintiffs are a group of taxicab drivers who have brought several common law, District of Columbia law, and federal law\n   claims against a District of Columbia regulatory agency, the Department of For-Hire Vehicles (\"DFHV\"), and Jeffrey Schaeffer, an owner of various taxi-related companies (together, \"Defendants\"). Plaintiffs allege that DFHV misrepresented important taxicab licensing information and then worked alongside Mr. Schaeffer to draft and implement new licensing regulations which effectively preclude them from obtaining licenses to operate their own taxicabs. Now before the Court are DFHV's motions to dismiss for insufficient service of process and lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and both Defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants both motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
