Ocean Properties is one of the largest and most dynamic privately held hotel management and development companies in North America, with an award-winning portfolio of over 100 hotels and 17,000 guestrooms. PSAMF \u00b6 47; DRPSAMF \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ocean Properties calls the Sable Oaks Marriott \"AmeriPort\".\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.

Burnett resides in the town of Eliot, Maine.\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Mr. Burnett worked in Ocean Properties' Portland reservation center, located at various times in several locations in the Sable Oaks properties in South Portland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Mr. Burnett is paralyzed from the T-9 level of his spine and below. DSMF \u00b6 5; PRDSMF \u00b6 5. Mr. Burnett has used a wheelchair for his entire adult life and uses a truck with a specially designed chair lift for transportation. DSMF \u00b6 5; PRDSMF \u00b6 5. Mr. Burnett cannot park in a regular spot because his truck has a wheelchair lift on the driver's side that assists him with loading and unloading his chair. PSAMF \u00b6 6; DRPSAMF \u00b6 6. This takes up nearly another whole parking spot on his driver's\n   side, and if a car parked beside him unaware of this issue, Mr. Burnett would not be able to get back into his vehicle. PSAMF \u00b6 6; DRPSAMF \u00b6 6. Due to his paralysis, Mr. Burnett has no control over his bowel movements. DSMF \u00b6 6; PRDSMF \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 16, 2009, Ocean Properties hired Mr. Burnett to work as a Reservations Agent at a call center. DSMF \u00b6 1; PRDSMF \u00b6 1. The call center was initially located in the basement of the Holiday Inn &amp; Suites near the Sable Oaks Marriot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 1; PRDSMF \u00b6 1; PSAMF \u00b6 1; DRPSAMF \u00b6 1. As a Reservations Agent, Mr. Burnett was responsible for taking calls for reservations at various hotels across the country. DSMF \u00b6 3; PRDSMF \u00b6 3. Mr. Burnett's disability was apparent at the time AmeriPort hired him. DSMF \u00b6 6; PRDSMF \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Burnett reported directly to several supervisors during his time as a Reservations Agent. DSMF \u00b6 3; PRDSMF \u00b6 3. Until the last eight months of his employment, Mr. Burnett's supervisor was Lori Darsaoui.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 3; PRDSMF \u00b6 3. Ms. Darsaoui is the payroll administrator for AmeriPort, Sable Golf, LLC, and GHM Portland Holiday Inn, LLC. PSAMF \u00b6 8; DRPSAMF \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Darsaoui's supervisor was Vice President of Revenue Management, Joyce Dawson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 4; PRDSMF \u00b6 4. Ms. Dawson is the person at the top of the organizational chart for the entity referred to as AmeriPort. PSAMF \u00b6 7; DRPSAMF \u00b6 7. Ms. Dawson also works for another entity called \"PCFSI\" with the title Vice President of Revenue Management. PSAMF \u00b6 7; DRPSAMF \u00b6 7. Ms. Dawson's supervisor is Tom Varley, who works for one of Defendants' affiliates. PSAMF \u00b6 9; DRPSAMF \u00b6 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Locked Rear Entrance at the Holiday Inn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since Mr. Burnett's place of employment in 2009 was inside a hotel, he expected that it would be wheelchair accessible at all times, without the need for him to request an accommodation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 2; DRPSAMF \u00b6 2. The first day Mr. Burnett went to work in the reservation call center, the door near the handicapped accessible ramp in the back of the building was locked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 3; DRPSAMF \u00b6 3. Mr. Burnett had to wheel his chair across the lawn, approximately fifty feet, over uneven ground, not an easy task for someone in a wheelchair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 4; DRPSAMF \u00b6 4. Mr. Burnett would have accessed the employee entrance for the reservation agents working in the basement of the Holiday Inn via the sidewalk instead of wheeling across the lawn, but he could not because there was a six-inch curb to get up over.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 5; DRPSAMF \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Darsaoui informed Mr. Burnett that he could use the handicapped accessible ramp at the rear entrance of the hotel if he chose to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 53; PRDSMF \u00b6 53. AmeriPort provided Mr. Burnett a keycard to access the rear door, though he alleges that sometimes the keycard did not function properly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 53; PRDSMF \u00b6 53. When his keycard did not work properly, Mr. Burnett would resolve the situation by tugging at the door until \"it would pop.\" DSMF \u00b6 54; PRDSMF \u00b6 54. Mr. Burnett stated that he could have used the front entrance to enter the building rather than \"pop\" the door, but only if the single handicapped parking spot near the front of the building was available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 55; PRDSMF \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When the head of maintenance, Walter Reiter III, discovered the door needed to be replaced due to Mr. Burnett's tugging, he told Mr. Burnett \"the next time we have to replace the door, it is coming out of your salary.\" DSMF \u00b6 54; PRDSMF \u00b6 54. Mr. Burnett had not yet made any complaints of discrimination, he had never talked with Mr. Reiter before the incident, and he had never requested anything of Mr. Reiter previously, and he only knew Mr. Reiter in passing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 56; PRDSMF \u00b6 56.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Mr. Burnett informed Ms. Dawson of the incident, an accommodation was made to forego the keycard access and leave the door unlocked after 6 a.m. for Mr. Burnett's access. DSMF \u00b6 58; PRDSMF \u00b6 58. According to Mr. Burnett, this was the accommodation that he wanted from AmeriPort, as he had asked for the door to be unlocked before that point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 58; PRDSMF \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Darsaoui described Mr. Reiter's behavior toward Mr. Burnett as \"inappropriate and unprofessional.\" PSAMF \u00b6 29; DRPSAMF \u00b6 29. Ms. Darsaoui does not recall whether Mr. Reiter received corrective action but said that if he had, it would be in his personnel file.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 29; DRPSAMF \u00b6 29. Although Mr. Burnett was not sure who spoke to the head of maintenance about the incident, Mr. Reiter later came and apologized to Mr. Burnett for the manner in which he handled having to replace the door. DSMF \u00b6 59; PRDSMF \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Blocked Ramp at the Holiday Inn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On one occasion in 2012, a handicapped guest had parked in the handicap loading/unloading zone while Mr. Burnett was\n   trying to leave work, which blocked Mr. Burnett from using the access ramp and forced him to use another exit point to get to his vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 40; PRDSMF \u00b6 40. After he reported the issue to Ms. Darsaoui, Mr. Burnett was dissatisfied that Ms. Darsaoui did not have the guest's car towed or ticketed. DSMF \u00b6 41; PRDSMF \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On that occasion, Ms. Darsaoui believed a guest with a handicapped sticker was parked in a handicapped spot in the back of the building, and she told Mr. Burnett, \"I couldn't prevent someone who was a guest at the hotel and had a handicapped accessible designation on their vehicle from parking there. I can't control that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 30; DRPSAMF \u00b6 30. Ms. Darsaoui did not see the guest's vehicle that was blocking the ramp; she instead relied on the general manager who told her that \"the guest was legitimately in the parking spot.\" PSAMF \u00b6 31; DRPSAMF \u00b6 31. However, the issue was not that a guest was parked in a handicapped parking space, it was that the guest had parked in a loading/unloading zone and completely blocked the handicapped ramp to the back-door entrance, so that Mr. Burnett could not access the ramp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 32; DRPSAMF \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This was the only occasion during Mr. Burnett's seven years with AmeriPort where he reported that the loading/unloading zone was blocked and the only occasion where a guest completely blocked the access ramp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 41; PRDSMF \u00b6 41. Mr. Burnett testified that access to the ramp was partially obstructed on other occasions, but he was able to get around the obstruction and did not report those incidents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   PRDSMF \u00b6 41. Prior to the time that the guest blocked the handicapped ramp, it was up to Mr. Burnett to come to his supervisor to report accessibility issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 34; DRPSAMF \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Snowstorm Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 30, 2012, there was a snowstorm, and by the time Mr. Burnett reported to work at the Holiday Inn location the following morning, on December 31, 2012, the rear access ramp had not been completely shoveled. DSMF \u00b6 43; PRDSMF \u00b6 43. The front entrance to the\n   hotel was shoveled, but the handicap parking spots at the front of the building were full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45; PRDSMF \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45. Mr. Burnett did not attempt to park and enter through the front entrance of the building and instead went home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 44; PRDSMF \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same day, on December 31, 2012, Mr. Burnett reported to Ms. Darsaoui that he had an issue accessing the building to get to work following the snowstorm in which the walkways and ramps were not cleared. PSAMF \u00b6 36; DRPSAMF \u00b6 36. Mr. Burnett told Ms. Darsaoui that \"honestly this is not the first time\" he had encountered issues with \"access to the building.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 37; DRPSAMF \u00b6 37. Mr. Burnett offered that Ms. Darsaoui could contact his vocational rehab counselor at the Department of Labor for more information. PSAMF \u00b6 38; DRPSAMF \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On January 2, 2013, Mr. Burnett submitted a \"missed punch\" form to Ms. Darsaoui requesting that he be compensated for the December 31, 2012 shift he did not work. DSMF \u00b6 46; PRDSMF \u00b6 46. Ms. Darsaoui responded to Mr. Burnett by telling him that he is permitted to park under the canopy at the main entrance of the hotel and enter through the main lobby. DSMF \u00b6 47; PRDSMF \u00b6 47. This was the first time anyone mentioned to Mr. Burnett that he was permitted to park underneath the canopy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 33; DRPSAMF \u00b6 33. Ms. Darsaoui also reminded Mr. Burnett that he was free to park in any of the hotel's handicapped parking spots in the front or rear of the hotel if needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 47; PRDSMF \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When Mr. Burnett complained that he could not access the building on or about December 31, 2012, Ms. Darsaoui believed that he had arrived to work, saw that the back of the building was not cleared of snow, left work without trying to access the building in the front, and then asked to be paid for the day. PSAMF \u00b6 39; DRPSAMF \u00b6 39. Ms. Darsaoui does not know whether Mr. Burnett tried to access the front of the building after the snowstorm on December 31, 2012, and she did not find out before concluding that \"he didn't work, which is why he was not paid\n   for the day.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 40; DRPSAMF \u00b6 40. Ms. Darsaoui believes that if a snowstorm makes it difficult for an employee like Mr. Burnett to travel and access the workplace, \"it would be the employee's responsibility\" to call and \"discuss with us if there were individual situations that needed an accommodation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 41; DRPSAMF \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even though Ms. Darsaoui knows that Mr. Burnett cannot physically walk and, therefore, must wheel his chair through snow when there is a significant storm in order to get to and from work, Ms. Darsaoui would need more information to know whether this would be a reason to excuse him from being absent from work due to snow. PSAMF \u00b6 42; DRPSAMF \u00b6 42. Some of the questions Ms. Darsaoui would want answered about whether absence due to a snowstorm is disability-related include: \"where the issue was, if it was at the home, if it was at the workplace, what the issue was.\" PSAMF \u00b6 43; DRPSAMF \u00b6 43. However, although Ms. Darsaoui called Mr. Burnett and left voicemails after he did not arrive for his shift, she never had a conversation about the reason Mr. Burnett needed to miss work due to a snowstorm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 44; DRPSAMF \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Dawson said that in the event of snowstorms presenting access challenges, she would work hard to make sure that snow would be removed so that an employee like Mr. Burnett would be able to access the building and be able to work, and that she \"can't understand a situation where we wouldn't be able to get the snow removed so someone could enter a building.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 35; DRPSAMF \u00b6 35. This was the only incident in Mr. Burnett's nearly seven years with AmeriPort that he could not access the building due to snow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 48; PRDSMF \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Moving Mr. Burnett's Truck for a Kitchen Delivery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Several months later, in the spring of 2013, a maintenance employee and a morning\n   cook told Mr. Burnett that there was a scheduled kitchen delivery and he needed to move his truck from under the hotel's front entrance canopy or it would be towed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 50; PRDSMF \u00b6 50. The employees indicated that the directive came from General Manager Jason Bartlett, although Mr. Bartlett was not with the employees when they told Mr. Burnett to move his truck, nor did Mr. Burnett speak with Mr. Bartlett about it afterward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 50; PRDSMF \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   No AmeriPort management personnel witnessed this incident, but Mr. Burnett did tell a shift supervisor about it before leaving work that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 51; PRDSMF \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

In November 2013, before the move, some AmeriPort employees went to the new location for a training session, and Mr. Burnett notified another employee, who in turn notified Ms. Darsaoui, that the restroom was not wheelchair accessible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   PRDSMF \u00b6 62. After the move, Mr. Burnett emailed Ms. Darsaoui on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2013, indicating that the new building's bathrooms were not wheelchair accessible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 62; PRDSMF \u00b6 62. The same day, Ms. Darsaoui forwarded his email to Ms. Dawson, and by December 26, 2013, AmeriPort representatives were working to address the issues, including the ordering of additional handicap parking signs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 62; PRDSMF \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   AmeriPort placed Mr. Burnett on leave until it was able to make the changes to the restroom that Mr. Burnett needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DSMF \u00b6 63; PRDSMF \u00b6 63. Ms. Darsaoui called him and left a voicemail saying that she wanted to discuss the accessibility issues to \"make sure [AmeriPort] got it done right.\" DSMF \u00b6 63; PRDSMF \u00b6 63. Prior to his return to work, Mr. Burnett was contacted and asked to inspect the bathroom with contractor Mark Mooney. DSMF \u00b6 63; PRDSMF \u00b6 63. Mr. Burnett told Mooney that \"this will be fine for what I need it for.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 63; PRDSMF \u00b6 64.

The Wooden Doors and Handicapped Parking Spaces at the Golf Club Location\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the December 24, 2013 email, Mr. Burnett also indicated that there was an insufficient number of handicapped parking spaces at the new location. DSMF \u00b6 62; PRDSMF \u00b6 62. Mr. Burnett said that there were at least three employees who needed to use handicapped spaces and only one handicapped parking space available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 48; DRPSAMF \u00b6 48.

DSMF \u00b6 64; PRDSMF \u00b6 65. Mr. Burnett sometimes had difficulty opening these doors if he had his \"lunch pail, morning coffee, smoothie or whatever\" in one hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 64; PRDSMF \u00b6 65.

Tom Varley gets paid by Hotel Providers, and his salary is charged back to PCFSI in order to shield his salary. PSAMF \u00b6 50; DRPSAMF \u00b6 50. In the email responding to Mr. Burnett's accessibility complaints, Tom Varley said he would \"get with [B]illy we will need to address it all.\" PSAMF \u00b6 51; DRPSAMF \u00b6 51. Mr. Varley copied Cedric Rothkegel on this email, the manager of the HR department at PCFSI. PSAMF \u00b6 52; DRPSAMF \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On August 28, 2014, Mr. Burnett sent a message to Nick Robertshaw requesting \"that we need to put push button automatic doors in for the entry of [the] building,\" because the doors were heavy, and \"hard to hold open\" when Mr. Burnett would push himself through \"without them closing\" on him. PSAMF \u00b6 53; DRPSAMF \u00b6 53. At the time of the August 28, 2014 message, Mr. Robertshaw would have been one of Mr. Burnett's direct reservation supervisors he reported to on a day to day basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6 54; DRPSAMF \u00b6 54.

On September 10, 2014, Ms. Darsaoui followed up with contractor Mark Mooney to determine whether the set of large wooden doors to enter the lobby of the hotel's clubhouse were compliant with the ADA, and Mooney responded, \"as constructed when the building was built, yes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 66; PRDSMF \u00b6 67; PSAMF \u00b6 58; DRPSAMF \u00b6 58.

Questioning about Time Spent in the Bathroom\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In his Amended Complaint, Mr. Burnett alleged that he was \"humiliated\" after his then-manager was critical for his taking too long to use the bathroom during a shift. DSMF \u00b6 68; PRDSMF \u00b6 69. This discussion took place in one of Mr. Burnett's supervisor's office at the start of his annual performance review. DSMF \u00b6 69; PRDSMF \u00b6 70. Mr. Burnett's supervisor asked whether it took him longer than most to use the restroom. DSMF \u00b6 69; PRDSMF \u00b6 70. When he responded \"yes,\" the manager said that she would not ask him any further questions due to medical privacy laws, but she may need a doctor's note to verify his statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 69; PRDSMF \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The supervisor continued Mr. Burnett's annual performance review and, according to Mr. Burnett, there was nothing discriminatory or concerning about the rest of the review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 70; PRDSMF \u00b6 71. In fact, Mr. Burnett received the highest score of his AmeriPort career in his 2014 performance review. DSMF \u00b6 70; PRDSMF \u00b6 71. The subject of time spent in the bathroom was never brought up again. DSMF \u00b6 69; PRDSMF \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Unexpected Elevator Malfunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On or about February 20, 2015, AmeriPort's elevator at its new location was improperly locked and was inaccessible to anyone using it. DSMF \u00b6 72; PRDSMF \u00b6 73. Mr. Burnett reported to work that morning and was informed by his morning supervisor that the elevator was out of service. DSMF \u00b6 72; PRDSMF \u00b6 73. Mr. Burnett was sent home because the elevator needed to be repaired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 72; PRDSMF \u00b6 73. Later that day, Ms. Darsaoui called Mr. Burnett stating that the elevator had been fixed and that he would be compensated for the four hours the elevator was out service, due to the inconvenience of having to come into work and then being sent home. DSMF \u00b6 73; PRDSMF \u00b6 74. Mr. Burnett told Ms. Darsaoui that he was not coming back in to work on the day that the elevator was down because \"he was back at home\" by the time the elevator was fixed, and \"it was a very long distance.\" PSAMF \u00b6 70; DRPSAMF \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Four days later, on February 24, 2015, Mr. Burnett sent a message to Ms. Dawson via AmeriPort's instant messaging system. DSMF \u00b6 74; PRDSMF \u00b6 75. Mr. Burnett stated that Ms. Darsaoui informed him that he would be paid for four hours of the scheduled seven hour shift, even though no actual work was performed. DSMF \u00b6 74; PRDSMF \u00b6 75. However, Mr. Burnett complained that he should have been paid the full six and a half hours (seven hours less a half-hour lunch break) that he would have been paid had the elevator been in service. DSMF \u00b6 75; PRDSMF \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On February 24, 2015, Mr. Burnett sent a message to Ms. Dawson explaining that the elevator was not working \"last Friday,\" when he was scheduled to work from 7 am to 2 pm. PSAMF \u00b6 63; DRPSAMF \u00b6 63. Mr. Burnett's message to Ms. Dawson further explained that his supervisor, Nick Robertshaw, was notified, and Mr. Robertshaw told Mr. Burnett to \"go home\" because \"there was nothing he could do.\" PSAMF \u00b6 64; DRPSAMF \u00b6 64. Mr. Burnett\n   filled out a \"missed punch\" for the 7-hour shift that he missed. PSAMF \u00b6 65; DRPSAMF \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Approximately one week after the February 20, 2015 incident with AmeriPort's elevator, Ms. Dawson held a meeting with Ms. Darsaoui and Mr. Burnett to discuss his concerns with being paid for the full seven-hour shift. DSMF \u00b6 76; PRDSMF \u00b6 77. During the meeting, Ms. Dawson explained to Mr. Burnett that sometimes things were going to happen out of AmeriPort's control, but if Mr. Burnett would work with them, they could find solutions to overcome these problems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 77; PRDSMF \u00b6 78. Ms. Dawson recalled telling him that, because he was able to come back to work, \"we were going to pay him for ... the inconvenience of when he couldn't come to work and he was able to work the rest of his shift.\" PSAMF \u00b6 67; DRPSAMF \u00b6 67. Mr. Burnett explained to Ms. Dawson that the situation was something beyond his control, and \"not the first time\" he had lost hours due to something out of his control. PSAMF \u00b6 66; DRPSAMF \u00b6 66. Mr. Burnett therefore requested to be paid for six-and-one-half hours (seven hours, minus a lunch break). PSAMF \u00b6 66; DRPSAMF \u00b6 66. Ms. Dawson told Mr. Burnett that she was going to request he be paid for four hours, but not the seven he would have worked. PSAMF \u00b6 65; DRPSAMF \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Ms. Dawson's conversation with Mr. Burnett about not being paid for his full shift due to the elevator malfunction was very brief. PSAMF \u00b6 73; DRPSAMF \u00b6 73. In making the decision to pay Mr. Burnett for less than the entire shift, Ms. Dawson did not take into consideration where or how far away he lived, and did not recall having a conversation with Mr. Robertshaw or Ms. Darsaoui about the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSAMF \u00b6\u00b6 68; DRPSAMF \u00b6\u00b6 68, 69.

The Expected Elevator Repairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In or around March of 2015, AmeriPort informed its employees that its elevator would be out of service for a couple of weeks due to a repair to begin on May 26, 2015. DSMF \u00b6 79; PRDSMF \u00b6 80. One employee in addition to Mr. Burnett required the elevator to work on the second floor. DSMF \u00b6 79; PRDSMF \u00b6 80. During the repair, Mr. Burnett and the other employee were placed in a workspace on the first floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 79; PRDSMF \u00b6 80. Mr. Burnett was asked to do a walkthrough of the workspace to determine if it met his needs. DSMF \u00b6 80; PRDSMF \u00b6 81. Mr. Burnett noted that his desk was not accessible due to its height. DSMF \u00b6 80; PRDSMF \u00b6 81. Mr. Burnett reported the issue to Shift Leader Eric Meserve, who in turn reported the issue to Ms. Darsaoui. DSMF \u00b6 80; PRDSMF \u00b6 81. Maintenance Specialist Dwayne Haskell was also aware. DSMF \u00b6 80; PRDSMF \u00b6 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On May 2, 2015, the elevator quit working, and the scheduled elevator repair was suddenly moved up from May 26, 2015 to May 5, 2015. DSMF \u00b6 81; PRDSMF \u00b6 82. Mr. Burnett was scheduled to work on May 5, 2015, and when he reported to the new workspace that day, there was an issue with the desk. DSMF \u00b6 81; PRDSMF \u00b6 82. When Mr. Burnett noted the issue, the desk was fixed the same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 81; PRDSMF \u00b6 82.

AmeriPort also informed the custodial employee to ensure that the door to the pro shop was unlocked so that Mr. Burnett had access to the handicapped accessible restroom there. DSMF \u00b6 82; PRDSMF \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Burnett's was not satisfied with the situation because he felt segregated, had to ask a supervisor to bring him water, and the company \"could have had a microwave available or something of this sort\" since the breakroom was on an upper level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSMF \u00b6 83; PRDSMF \u00b6 84.

On at least two occasions in 2012 and 2013, Mr. Burnett requested time off in advance specifically to address issues relating to his disability. DSMF \u00b6 14; PRDSMF \u00b6 14.

The problem with AmeriPort's argument is that Mr. Burnett did not have an attendance problem so much as a tardiness problem. The Court does not view these as presenting exactly the same obstacle to job performance. Except in circumstances not present here, an employee must come to work in order to work. But whether there is latitude in precisely when the employee arrives is a different matter. While many jobs undoubtedly require consistently prompt arrivals, a reasonable jury could find that it was not essential for AmeriPort's call center reservations agents because it used staggered shifts and the number of workers present at each shift often varied.

There is no suggestion he was overlooked for advancement. Furthermore, many of the discrete actions which Mr. Burnett raises are time barred because they occurred long before the 300-day limit, such as the illegally parked guest at the rear entrance, the incident with the maintenance employee, or the time Mr. Burnett was told to move his truck from under the front canopy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Neither do the corrective actions constitute \"unwarranted negative job evaluations\" that could rise to the level of an adverse employment action. It is true that many employees find it frustrating to be \"written up,\" particularly if they believe that it resulted from events beyond their control. But, apart from the write-up itself, there is no evidence in the record that any negative consequences flowed from these corrective actions. The only evidence in the record indicates that AmeriPort disciplined or warned Mr. Burnett in an attempt to reduce his tardiness, a conclusion bolstered by AmeriPort's offer to adjust his schedule so that Mr. Burnett could improve his punctuality. Even assuming that some of those instances of tardiness included in the corrective actions were disability-related, that does not make the corrective actions adverse employment actions. Mr. Burnett suggests that each corrective action carried the \"threat of discharge,\" but that never occurred and there is no other indication in the record that the corrective actions resulted in other material negative consequences, like reduced pay or missed opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The question about time spent in the bathroom from one of Mr. Burnett's supervisors during an annual performance review did not constitute an adverse action either. Nor is it direct evidence of discriminatory animus. Even according to Mr. Burnett's description of the incident, it was brief, occurred in private, was free of mockery or intentional insult, and was never raised again. It was understandable that Mr. Burnett found this question awkward or embarrassing, particularly if the supervisor was not sensitive in her delivery. But the evidence in the record here confirms that Mr. Burnett's supervisor merely asked whether he needed additional time in the bathroom due to his disability and when he responded affirmatively, the supervisor made no further inquiry. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the employer sanctioned Mr. Burnett as a result of additional time in the bathroom. From the Court's perspective, it cannot be inappropriate for an employer merely to ask an employee whether an aspect of the employee's performance is related to a disability so long as the employer does not hold an affirmative response against the employee. If an employee does not affirmatively inform the employer, the Court is unclear how an employer is to know, unless the employer asks the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Mr. Burnett has not produced any cases finding an adverse employment action in similar circumstances. While the Court accepts that many of the incidents were uncomfortable for Mr. Burnett, it cannot conclude that a reasonable jury could find that any of them constituted an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

When Mr. Burnett sought wheelchair accessible entry to the rear of the building, AmeriPort provided a key card for him to access the rear guest door with the handicapped accessible ramp. When this accommodation proved less than ideal after the keycard often failed to work properly and there was damage to the door, AmeriPort provided Mr. Burnett's preferred accommodation by leaving that door unlocked. After Mr. Burnett's access was limited one morning following a snowstorm, AmeriPort provided an accommodation by allowing him to park under the front lobby canopy in the event of future problems accessing the rear door. After the move to the new golf club location, when Mr. Burnett reminded AmeriPort that he could not use the bathroom, AmeriPort quickly altered the bathroom, and Mr. Burnett told them it would meet his needs. The Court also notes that these requests and accommodations occurred well before the 300-day window preceding Mr. Burnett's Charge and, therefore, would be time barred even if AmeriPort's conduct constituted a denial of a reasonable accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680886\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/27/#p31\">\n    587 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Mr. Thornton did not file timely charges related to any alleged act of discrimination other than the single act identified in his 2001 MCAD charge.

Mr. Burnett does not cite any authority that AmeriPort was obligated to pay Mr. Burnett for the shift he missed, but AmeriPort paid Mr. Burnett for the time the elevator was not working, which amounted to half of the missed shift.

No reasonable jury could find this temporary situation during elevator maintenance to constitute a failure to accommodate Mr. Burnett's disability. Regarding his second frustration, that he felt segregated from other employees, Mr. Burnett has not met his burden of putting forth a reasonable accommodation that would have addressed the segregation issue during the elevator repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    b. There is a genuine dispute of material fact concerning Mr. Burnett's request for an accommodation to make the heavy wooden doors more accessible.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The remaining incident is Mr. Burnett's request for push-button access to the\n   heavy wooden doors at the golf club location. Adopting a view of the facts most favorable to Mr. Burnett, he made plain, direct requests for an accommodation, and while employees at AmeriPort looked into the situation, they did not respond to him directly and did not alter the doors until much later, after Mr. Burnett resigned. Mr. Burnett has met his burden at this stage of showing that the requested accommodation was reasonable, and AmeriPort has not shown that it would have represented an undue hardship, especially as AmeriPort eventually made the alteration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   This accommodation might not have been needed for Mr. Burnett to perform the essential functions of his position and enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.

Depending on how heavy the lobby doors were, it might have been quite difficult to operate for someone in a wheelchair or it might have been only a minor inconvenience that did not sufficiently interfere with Mr. Burnett's ability to access his\n   workplace as to require AmeriPort to install an automatic opener. For purposes of summary judgment, the Court adopts the former conclusion. Whether an automatic push-button mechanism for those doors represented a reasonable accommodation is best resolved by a fact-finder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The timing of Mr. Burnett's request for an accommodation related to the wooden doors presents an additional wrinkle.

Mr. Burnett did not receive a response, and AmeriPort did not alter the doors until after he resigned. Mr. Burnett raised the issue again on August 28, 2014, and Mr. Burnett discussed the heavy wooden doors in his Charge on June 29, 2015. AmeriPort's non-response to Mr. Burnett's first request is, therefore, time barred. But the failure to respond to the second request is an independent discrete act which occurred within the 300-day window because there is no evidence that Mr. Burnett knew or reasonably should have known that AmeriPort was unlikely to grant the request within the five days that elapsed between the date of his second request and the start of the 300-day window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that, even if AmeriPort were required to grant Mr. Burnett's request, whether he sustained any damages from its failure to do so is a close issue.

He then alleged that AmeriPort had been administratively dissolved and was no longer authorized to do business in the state of Maine.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 6. He therefore asserted that his employer was Ocean Properties as it owned and operated the hotel where he worked.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    On September 6, 2016, Ocean Properties filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), asserting, among other things, that it is not a proper party to the lawsuit.\n    <em>\n     Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Pl.'s Compl.\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 5). On September 26, 2016, Mr. Burnett filed an amended complaint pursuant to Rule 15(a) in which he added AmeriPort as a party defendant.\n    <em>\n     First Am. Compl.\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 7) (\n    <em>\n     Am. Compl.\n    </em>\n    ).

Partial Mot. to Dismiss Pl.'s Am. Compl. and Mot. to Strike Impertinent Allegations\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 19). On April 11, 2017, the Court denied the motion to dismiss and the motion to strike because a more detailed factual record was needed in order to determine if the two entities shared an identity of interest.\n    <em>\n     Order on Mot. to Dismiss\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 37).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    The parties do not make additional arguments in their summary judgment memoranda based directly on the identity of interest question, and they have not submitted additional evidence to assist the Court. But the issue pervades their responses to each other's statements of facts. Throughout their statements of facts the parties attribute the same facts to different entities. For example, Mr. Burnett sometimes describes his employer as Ocean Properties and the actions of his supervisors as the employees or agents of that company and of AmeriPort, whereas the Defendants ascribe those actions and individuals to AmeriPort only.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Since the issue now appears to be ancillary, and because the Court is obligated to view contested facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Burnett,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    footnote 2, throughout this order the Court frequently uses \"AmeriPort\" to refer to both companies but adopts Mr. Burnett's perspective of an identity of interest such that the actions of AmeriPort may be attributed to Ocean Properties. At other times, the Court resolves ancillary factual disputes by replacing certain references to one company with the other company or both companies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    In accordance with \"conventional summary judgment praxis,\" the Court recounts the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Burnett's theory of the case consistent with record support.\n    <em>\n     Gillen v.

The Court overrules the objection because the statement accurately reflects Mr. Burnett's own view of the timing of events and his testimony about his relationship, or lack thereof, with Mr. Reiter. Mr. Burnett's arguments about the legal significance, or lack thereof, of that timing, are best left for legal memoranda.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    AmeriPort also sought to include: \"Burnett did not immediately inform human resources of the incident with the rear door.

Mr. Burnett admitted that he informed Ms. Dawson but offered a qualification because he denied that he \"waited\" to tell her. PRDSMF \u00b6 57.

Mr. Burnett disputed this durational language because, by the time Ms. Darsaoui called Mr. Burnett to tell him the elevator was fixed, there was no way for him to come back to work in time.

The Court modifies the original statement slightly to resolve the qualification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"58\">\n   <p id=\"p-286\">\n    Mr. Burnett admitted \"the nature of the conversation\" but offered a qualification: \"denied that 'things' were out of Defendants' 'control,' or that they offered to 'find solutions' since Mr. Burnett was not paid for his full shift.

DRPSAMF \u00b6 69. Mr. Burnett's statement about Ms. Dawson's recollection of conversations with Ms. Darsaoui is supported by Ms. Dawson's testimony, so the Court rejects that qualification. The original statement also specified that Ms. Dawson did not consider whether it was true that his supervisor, Mr. Robertshaw, told him to go home. PSAMF \u00b6 68. The record indicates that Ms. Dawson did not have a conversation with Mr. Robertshaw to verify Mr. Burnett's claims, but did take Mr. Burnett at his word.

Mr. Burnett provided additional details as to why he was unsatisfied with the \"makeshift space.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 80. The Court resolves the qualification by drawing no inferences about Mr. Burnett's satisfaction with the makeshift space but includes the statement because \"workspace\" appears to be an accurate descriptor; it was a \"space\" in which Mr. Burnett \"worked.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"62\">\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    Mr. Burnett offered a qualification because the original statement ended with the phrase \"in order to accommodate him.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 82.

Paragraph twelve, however, disputes whether last minute requests to miss scheduled shifts were \"approved\" because they were cited in Mr. Burnett's later corrective action, rather than requests not to be put on the schedule. PRDSMF \u00b6 12. Paragraph twelve, in-turn, cites AmeriPort's paragraph 25, which describes a corrective action that contained reference to a tardy arrival that was labelled \"excused.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 12; DSMF \u00b6 25;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    footnote seventy-three.

It is not clear from this record whether the corrective action's reference to the \"excused\" tardy arrival was meant to exclude that incident from discipline, or whether its inclusion meant it was counted against Mr. Burnett. Because the Court must adopt Mr. Burnett's version of contested facts at summary judgment, the Court assumes the incident was held against Mr. Burnett, which means he was not always \"permitted\" to call out at 7 a.m. for a 7 a.m. shift and, therefore, omits the statement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"74\">\n   <p id=\"p-304\">\n    AmeriPort's original statement read, \"Burnett admits that being on time for his shift was an important part and an essential function of his job.\" DSMF \u00b6 26. Mr. Burnett denied this statement, despite Mr. Burnett's admission to the contrary, citing positive performance reviews and other evidence that the call center deployed strategies like staggered shifts and accepted high turnover rates because poor attendance records for Reservations Agents was typical. PRDSMF \u00b6 26. AmeriPort's own paragraph twenty-eight indicates that there were other occasions where only one other Reservation Agent was working when Mr. Burnett arrived, even though three or four employees are scheduled to work that shift, indicating that it was not a rare occurrence for other Reservation Agents to arrive late or miss shifts. DSMF \u00b6 28. There is enough evidence in the record to create a genuine dispute as to the exact scope of the essential duties for Reservation Agents, despite Mr. Burnett's deposition testimony to the contrary. Accordingly, the Court omitted that particular phrase and limited the statement to Mr. Burnett's admission that attendance is important.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"75\">\n   <p id=\"p-305\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement because the description does not include arriving to work on time under the location where \"essential functions\" are listed. PRDSMF \u00b6 26. The statement does not specify that the job description included it as an \"essential function,\" only that it was listed in the description. Accordingly, the Court rejects the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"76\">\n   <p id=\"p-306\">\n    Mr. Burnett objected to this statement, seeking further discovery from Defendants on the issue of other employees' attendance. For the reasons described in footnote fifty, the Court overrules the objection.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"77\">\n   <p id=\"p-307\">\n    AmeriPort's original statement read, \"If Burnett was absent, there may not have been anyone to receive a customer's reservation or inquiry, as there were often only three to four individuals assigned to the morning shifts. On other occasions, there was only one other reservation agent in the office when Burnett arrived to work.\" DSMF \u00b6 28. Mr. Burnett denied this statement, explaining that there were typically three to five people starting their shifts with Mr. Burnett, with shifts staggered roughly every thirty minutes so different employees arrived throughout the day. PRDSMF \u00b6 28. Mr. Burnett appears to take issue with the implication that \"no one\" would be available to receive calls if he were tardy. PRDSMF \u00b6 28 (\"If only one person was working when Mr. Burnett arrived, it is because other people were late as well\"). The Court modifies the statement to refer to the call center's \"capacity\" to receive calls, which captures the undisputed core of the two statements: there were other employees working and tardiness was still of concern to management.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"78\">\n   <p id=\"p-308\">\n    AmeriPort's original statement also said, \"... but Burnett was only disciplined for those days where no excuse was given for his tardiness or absenteeism.\" DSMF \u00b6 23; see also DRPSAMF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Mr. Burnett denied this statement, citing the references to excused absences in the corrective actions. PRDSMF \u00b6 23. For the reasons described in footnote seventy-three, the Court omits the statement, consistent with Mr. Burnett's view of the disputed fact.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"79\">\n   <p id=\"p-309\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, maintaining that \"Mr. Burnett never wrote on these corrective actions because he knew it would not make a difference; no matter what he wrote, Mr. Burnett was still going to get the corrective action,\" and that he did tell supervisors at other times that certain absences or tardiness was personal, medical, or both. PRDSMF \u00b6 31. The statement makes no claim about Mr. Burnett's motives, only that he did not write in the space provided, which Mr. Burnett's statement of denial seems to admit. Accordingly, the Court rejects the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"80\">\n   <p id=\"p-310\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, contending, \"These absences were not just 'documented' but formed part of his corrective action ....\" PRDSMF \u00b6 25. This statement only claims the incidents were \"documented.\" Mr. Burnett's view, that the incidents were \"documented\" and also \"formed part of his corrective action,\" is not inconsistent with AmeriPort's statement that incidents were \"documented.\" Accordingly, the Court rejects the denial and includes the statement, but for the reasons described in footnote seventy-three, the Court adopts Mr. Burnett's inference that the incidents marked as \"excused\" were part of the basis of his corrective action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"81\">\n   <p id=\"p-311\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-312\">\n    Denied. In DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, OPL contends that Plaintiff was never disciplined for \"excused\" absences related to his disability. However, DSMF \u00b6 20 attempts to hold Plaintiff accountable for inexcusable attendance problems on 25 separate occasions, three of which were disability or sickness related. The remaining 22 attendance issues cited in September of 2010 involved tardiness, many of which were also related to Plaintiff's disability. Furthermore, tardiness by reservation agents was a common occurrence. Mr. Burnett observed his co-workers being late to work often, and to his knowledge they were not disciplined as harshly as he was; in fact, one chronically tardy employee was rehired by Defendants.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-313\">\n    PRDSMF \u00b6 20. Despite the additional arguments, Mr. Burnett does not appear to seriously dispute that he was in fact tardy or absent on the twenty-five occasions in the two-month period. The additional explanation admits those twenty-five occasions did occur. Since Mr. Burnett's real dispute is with the implications of this fact, and not the veracity of the statement itself, the Court rejects the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"82\">\n   <p id=\"p-314\">\n    AmeriPort offered a qualification to point out that different employees interpret corrective actions differently and reiterated their position that they only reported Mr. Burnett's excused absences in the corrective action forms for documentary purposes, but those were not held against him. DRPSAMF \u00b6 16. For the reasons explained in footnote seventy-three, the Court rejects the qualification and includes the statement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"83\">\n   <p id=\"p-315\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this portion of AmeriPort's paragraph thirty-five, pointing to another portion of Mr. Burnett's testimony that he found it discriminatory that Defendants wrote him up continuously when they knew he had a proven medical condition. PRDSMF \u00b6 35. The statement accurately reflects Mr. Burnett's deposition testimony, so the Court rejects the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"84\">\n   <p id=\"p-316\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, seeking to clarify that sometimes these issues only made Mr. Burnett late, rather than causing him to miss an entire shift.

The Court includes an additional statement from Mr. Burnett's deposition to clarify these statements and resolve the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"86\">\n   <p id=\"p-318\">\n    AmeriPort offered a qualification, admitting that all the absences were documented, but maintaining that the excused instances were not held against Mr. Burnett. DRPSAMF \u00b6 17. For the reasons discussed in footnote seventy-three, the Court adopts Mr. Burnett's version of that contested fact and rejects the qualification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"87\">\n   <p id=\"p-319\">\n    AmeriPort offered a qualification, reiterating their view that Mr. Burnett was not disciplined for excused incidents, and that Mr. Burnett could have informed her if there were additional disability-related absences or tardees in the corrective action, but did not do so. DRPSAMF \u00b6 21. For the reasons discussed in footnote seventy-three, the Court rejects the qualification and includes the statement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"88\">\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    Mr. Burnett objected to this statement for misstating the evidence introduced by AmeriPort, and denied the statement, offering explanation as to why Mr. Burnett never told Ms. Darsaoui that his tardiness was sometimes related to his disability, or why Ms. Darsaoui should have known his tardiness was related to his disability. PRDSMF \u00b6 33. Mr. Burnett says, \"The call out policy requires reservation agents to call in to a supervisor, not Payroll/Human Resources like Darsaoui,\" and \"OPL should have known that Mr. Burnett had disability-related medical issues just by seeing that he used a wheelchair, and presented doctor's notes on frequent occasions related to his medical condition.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 33.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    The Court overrules the objection and the denial because the statement accurately restates Ms. Darsaoui's deposition testimony, which is uncontradicted in the record. The rest of Mr. Burnett's arguments about what Ms. Darsaoui should have known are not inconsistent with the statement that he never explicitly told her his tardiness sometimes resulted from his disability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"89\">\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    This portion of Defendants original statement read, \"Neither Darsaoui nor Dawson was aware of the fact that Burnett had no control over his bowel movements during Burnett's employment.\" DSMF \u00b6 6. Mr. Burnett admitted that Mr. Burnett never told Darsaoui or Dawson but denied that they were not aware. PRDSMF \u00b6 6. To resolve the denial, the Court modifies the statement to reflect the undisputed area of overlap between the two competing paragraphs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"90\">\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    AmeriPort offered a qualification to point out that while Ms. Dawson was not notified of the reasons, Ms. Darsaoui was notified.

Mr. Burnett denied this statement, listing the incidents described in several of the subsections of this summary of facts, and seeking to clarify that Mr. Burnett believes he was unfairly written up in corrective actions for disability-related medical incidents. PRDSMF \u00b6 24. The Court modifies the statement to hew more closely to Mr. Burnett's actual deposition testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"92\">\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, citing his responses to paragraph twenty-six and twenty-eight. The statement accurately reflect Mr. Burnett's deposition testimony, which indicates that he agrees that employers have an interest in ensuring reliable attendance for their employees, and also that he believes his employer could have done more to work out a better arrangement, but he does not know what a better arrangement might have looked like. Accordingly, the Court includes the statement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"93\">\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, asserting that he \"reported instances of discrimination, retaliation, and inaccessibility throughout his employment.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 32.

Mr. Burnett offered a qualification to specify that he did not fully \"transfer\" to this department and still answered some telephone reservations. PRDSMF \u00b6 7. The Court modifies the statement to hew more closely to the deposition testimony and to resolve the qualification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"95\">\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, citing his affidavit and other testimony that there was \"one big continuous issue\" with accessibility that was never fully resolved. PRDSMF \u00b6 8. The Court modifies the statement slightly to hew more closely to the text of the deposition transcript, reflecting that no new issues arose during that time but otherwise includes the statement because it is supported by Mr. Burnett's testimony. Mr. Burnett testified to a lack of new problems during the last months of his employment; he cannot create a genuine dispute of fact regarding specific incidents during that time period by invoking vague or general assertions that it was all \"one big continuous issue.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"96\">\n   <p id=\"p-329\">\n    Mr. Burnett denied this statement, citing his denial of AmeriPort's paragraph eight.

Mr. Burnett denied this statement because \"the allegations ... speak for themselves, and include 55 statements of material facts reciting the ways in which Mr. Burnett was discriminated and retaliated against....\" PRDSMF \u00b6 88. The Court agrees that this paragraph restating an aspect of Mr. Burnett's complaint is not pertinent to this section of the order summarizing the facts. The Court addresses the complaint in the discussion section.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"98\">\n   <p id=\"p-331\">\n    AmeriPort said these incidents \"were not part\" of the Charge, which Mr. Burnett denied, characterizing his complaint as covering a series of ongoing incidents.

DSMF \u00b6 78. Mr. Burnett offered a qualification, specifying that AmeriPort did send him a check for \"missed work\" but that it did not address other accessibility issues, like moving his truck, or the snowstorm, or the bathroom renovation, and Mr. Burnett never cashed the check. PRDSMF \u00b6 79. Mr. Burnett also made a similar additional statement. PSAMF \u00b6 74; DRPSAMF \u00b6 74. The Court modifies the statement to reflect the undisputed portion of these related statements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"100\">\n   <p id=\"p-333\">\n    Mr. Burnett also sought to include, \"Throughout his employment, Defendants never gave Mr. Burnett a form outlining his rights and responsibilities under the FMLA, or notifying him of his right to take intermittent leave under the FMLA.\" PSAMF \u00b6 75. AmeriPort objected to this statement, arguing that it goes beyond the pleadings and seeks to introduce a new theory of liability never mentioned before. DRPSAMF \u00b6 75. AmeriPort also denies the statement, arguing that the notification is contained in the employee handbook, which Mr. Burnett acknowledged receiving. DRPSAMF \u00b6 75.
