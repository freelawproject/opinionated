(Nexstar), a company that LIN-TV merged with after the events in this case occurred. Defendants move for summary judgment on the merits of all of Plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment on the single issue of Nexstar's successor liability for the acts committed by LIN-TV. I grant Defendants' motion as to the retaliation claims which Plaintiff withdraws, grant the motion on the \"interactive process claims\" to the extent they are asserted as stand-alone claims, grant the motion on the intentional interference with emotional distress claim, and deny the motion on all other claims. I grant Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the relevant time, LIN-TV owned local television station KOIN-TV in Portland. KOIN hired Plaintiff as an assignment editor in its news department in April 2012. Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 4, ECF 45 at 2. He was terminated in October 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 28, ECF 45 at 41-42. According to an undated job announcement for the position, an assignment editor \"facilitates producers' needs for the stations [sic] newscasts[;] [and] [g]enerates story ideas, researches, assigns, and directs crews and provides for follow up as needed.\" Busch Apr. 23, 2018 Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 34-1 at 4. Assignment editors must be able to work various shifts and possess \"[s]olid news judgment as well as strong logistical skills,\" the \"ability to work well in a fast paced and intense environment,\" and the ability \"to multi-task and prioritize[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, according to Casey Wenger, Nexstar's Human Resources and Business Administrator at KOIN, assignment editors \"are responsible for establishing a network of contacts and constantly interact with numerous organizations throughout the community on a daily basis to gather information, including various local and state police departments.\" Wenger Apr. 20, 2018 Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF 34-2. \"As such,\" Wenger states, \"it is an essential part of the job to have a good working relationship with these organizations, especially the police departments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff initially worked as a weekend assignment editor as well as a helper three days during the week. Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 43-1 (Arbitration Hearing Transcript at 54) (hereinafter \"Arb. Trans.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff moved to weekday mornings and then was moved back to the weekend assignment editor position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Work History From Hire to September 1, 2015\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's last performance appraisal at KOIN before his October 2015 termination is dated November 2, 2013. Plaintiff met expectations in eighteen categories and exceeded expectations in two categories. Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 6, ECF 45 at 3-6. He was not rated as below expectations or unsatisfactory in any category.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was never placed on a performance improvement plan. Arb. Trans. at 312 (Pl. Test.). Generally, he received both positive and critical feedback about his work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 312-14. KOIN's News Director Kate Glover, however, described Plaintiff's work as showing a \"progressive pattern of unprofessional behavior that was getting worse as time went by despite corrective measures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. She described his performance as \"very inconsistent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The summary judgment record shows that in 2014 and 2015, Plaintiff received several written warnings for unacceptable conduct.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Wenger Apr. 20, 2018 Decl., Ex.

Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 5 (Pl. Depo.) 123:22-124:5, ECF 43-1 at 359-360. At his arbitration hearing, he testified that in June or July 2012, just a few months after he was hired, he told then-Assistant News Director Jason Kravarik and lead assignment editor Tamara Greenville about his mental health issues because he wanted them to know he was having problems with depression and suicidal thoughts in case he might need time off. Arb. Trans. 316:24-317:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the October 2014 written warning, Plaintiff told Glover that he had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 323:16-324:3-5. Glover asked him if the PTSD was related to military service, to which Plaintiff answered no and explained that it was the result of childhood abuse and trauma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 324:3-8. Then, in December 2014, Carrie Biggs-Adams, Plaintiff's union representative, had a conversation with Cheryl Robb, LIN-TV's labor relations professional, about Plaintiff's mental health conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 414:7-415:21. Biggs-Adams emailed Robb a treatment summary from Plaintiff's treating therapist stating that he was being treated for major depressive disorder, mild, single episode; generalized anxiety disorder ; and PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 11, ECF 45 at 12 (copy of email to Robb with therapist's treatment summary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Leave Requests\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sometime in the \"spring of 2015,\" Plaintiff disclosed to Glover and Miner that he was an alcoholic and needed to go to inpatient treatment for help. Arb. Trans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   326:10-13; 327:8-13. Plaintiff initiated the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He believed his depression was worsening and his alcohol consumption outside of work was very high.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 326:15-23. He was concerned about himself and his health.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Glover responded that she had no idea Plaintiff had an alcohol problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 328:1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the time, Plaintiff was working Monday through Friday, 4 am to 12 pm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 328:10-11. He took medical leave from May 4, 2015 to May 17, 2015. Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 12. He was treated at Cedar Hills Hospital and diagnosed with alcohol dependence, history of marijuana dependence versus abuse, and PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. On May 15, 2015, Liisa Heard, Plaintiff's therapist at Cedar Hills, notified KOIN that Plaintiff was ready to return to work on May 18, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 13. The letter informed KOIN that Plaintiff had been receiving treatment at Cedar Hills's Outpatient Services since May 11, 2015, and that Heard recommended he return to work on May 18, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also recommended that Plaintiff continue his participation in the Impaired Professionals Program at Cedar Hills Outpatient for the duration of the eight-week program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She referred to Plaintiff's commitment to outpatient treatment and his active participation in the program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His completion date was set for July 6, 2015, after which he would be encouraged to attend the ongoing \"Continuing Care\" support group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon return from leave on May 18, 2018, Plaintiff worked his Monday-Friday, 4 am to 12 pm schedule. At some point, Plaintiff was told his shift would be changed. According to Plaintiff's arbitration hearing testimony, Miner told him his shift was going back to Wednesday through Sunday, with split hours. Arb. Trans. 329:2-8. Plaintiff states that he was displeased and wanted to remain on his current shift.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 329:10-12. He was disappointed because KOIN was giving his old shift to a new hire and \"this was her, her first job and I'd been doing this for awhile.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 329:12-16. Plaintiff stated that Miner explained that placing Plaintiff back on weekends would let Plaintiff keep his \"head down\" and \"out of Kate's [Glover's] sights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 329:17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff discussed the planned change with Heard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 330:2-4. On June 24, 2015, Heard sent a letter via email to Wenger, as well as to union representatives Biggs-Adams and Kevin Wilson. Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 14. Heard wrote that during group and individual counseling sessions, Plaintiff had disclosed experiencing increasing anxiety after receiving news that his shift was changing back to weekends.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She wrote that Plaintiff reported that his current weekday, early-morning shift was \"conducive to his early recovery, allowing him to regularly attend AA meetings, participate in group, and re-engage with his family.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Heard recommended that Plaintiff's weekday schedule stay the same for at least three months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She explained that \"during early remission, it is important that support systems established are maintained and if his shift changes this could potentially undermine his progress thus far.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Glover and Wenger then met with Plaintiff on June 30, 2015. Reaves Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF 42. In his Declaration, Plaintiff states that Glover was hostile as evidenced by her facial expressions and raised voice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Plaintiff believes that Glover \"refused to accept the recommendation of my therapist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He told Glover that the schedule change would prevent him from spending time with his wife and children on the weekends when they were available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He told her further that the split shift hours would prevent him from getting sufficient sleep.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, Glover told\n   Plaintiff she would change his schedule effective on or about July 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In a June 30, 2015 memorialization of the meeting, written by Wenger six days after the meeting, Wenger states that he and Glover told Plaintiff that they had received Heard's letter and wanted to make sure to accommodate Plaintiff's needs for all of his appointments. Busch Apr. 23, 2018 Decl., Ex. 6, ECF 34-1. Wenger confirmed with Plaintiff that he would still be able to make his appointments with his new schedule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wenger and Glover discussed the reason for the schedule change and why they believed it would relieve Plaintiff's stress and be good for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wenger noted that Plaintiff had been making a lot of errors and mistakes which could not be tolerated and that he told Plaintiff he had to cut down on the errors and mistakes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Glover then attempted to describe some error that Plaintiff had recently made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff tried to defend himself and Glover \"got very vocal and loud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She explained she was frustrated, that she wanted him to succeed, and she was not seeing \"that success.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wenger wrote that Glover was again \"very loud and almost yelling at [Plaintiff] while explaining her view.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She scolded Plaintiff and yelled at him about a particular incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff tried to explain but she would not listen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At that point, Wenger cut it off and explained it was not going to be resolved \"like this.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He told Plaintiff to \"take this new opportunity and show us what you can do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They believed this new schedule would be less stressful for Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At that point, Plaintiff walked out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wenger wrote that later that day, Plaintiff came to Wenger's office and they talked for about an hour.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff expressed frustration and believed Glover was trying to terminate him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He believed that despite his trying hard, he was never good enough to please Glover.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After further discussion about the dynamic of the relationship between Plaintiff and Glover, Wenger told Plaintiff that Glover was the news director and the final say was hers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wenger wrote that Plaintiff said \"he was only given a two week chance to work the morning shift and now [Glover] was going with the new college girl.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff told Wenger that the switch in mid-week from day to mornings was tough and he was unable to sleep. This is where some of his alcohol problems started because he was using it to make him sleepy or black out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his Declaration, Wenger states that he and Glover agreed to make sure that Plaintiff was scheduled so that he would have time to participate in his group therapy and to attend AA meetings. Wenger Decl. \u00b6 10. They told him that he would not be given a weekday/early morning schedule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Wenger, at no time in this meeting or at any point, did Plaintiff suggest that he could not do his job on the weekday/weekend shift.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III.

On September 1, 2015, he was depressed, intoxicated, had an argument with his wife, and walked out of his house with the intention of being hit by a car. Arb. Trans. 334:1-25. He went to a relatively busy road, lay down, and closed his eyes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That is the last thing he remembers until he woke up the next morning in a holding cell in the Multnomah County jail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Plaintiff left his house, Plaintiff's wife called 911, stating that Plaintiff had left the house on foot and was threatening to hurt himself.

Stark May 14, 2018 Decl., Ex. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When Plaintiff did not show up at work as scheduled on September 2, 2015, assistant news director Jason Stevens called Plaintiff's wife who told Stevens Plaintiff was not well. Arb. Trans. 223:12-224-13. Stevens passed the information to Glover.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224:12-13. Glover called Plaintiff's wife.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91:7-19.

Termination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After speaking with Plaintiff on September 2, 2015, Glover asked the assignment desk to see if there was information in the court system about the September 1, 2015 incident.

An assignment editor found the charging document and a mug shot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Glover also called the Portland Police Bureau's Public Information Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98:16-18, 101:4-5. In an email on September 3, 2015 sent to Wenger and others, Glover summarized what had been learned from the police and concluded by saying that Plaintiff had lied to her.

She stated: \"he never said he was arrested or was in jail or had a mug shot taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Wenger states that because of the nature of Plaintiff's position and the importance of his relationship with police departments, KOIN believed it was necessary to investigate the incident further.

Stark Decl., Ex. 27. Apparently, Plaintiff waited until the day before the October 14, 2015 meeting to request the letter from his doctor. Arb. Trans. 352:8:18. During a regular session with Dr. Simas on October 13, 2015, Dr. Simas told Plaintiff that his assistant would email Plaintiff the letter clearing him for work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also told Plaintiff that he was going to be out of town for two weeks and Plaintiff would not be able to see him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By closing time of Dr. Simas's office, Plaintiff had not yet received the letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 352:19-20.

Plaintiff accessed his work LexisNexis account from his home computer to look up an email address for Dr. Simas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 353:4-8. After finding some gmail addresses, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Simas to request that he ask his assistant to send the letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 353:9-15.

Plaintiff explained why he had accessed the account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Glover told Plaintiff that his access to LexisNexis had been cut off as a result of the September 4, 2015 call (presumably referring to the administrative leave).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As Wenger explains in his Declaration, after the October 14, 2015 meeting with Plaintiff, the station reviewed all of the information gathered during its investigation, considered the information provided by Plaintiff, and reviewed Plaintiff's disciplinary history. Wenger Decl. \u00b6 21. Wenger states that KOIN decided to terminate Plaintiff effective October 16, 2015 because his actions demonstrated a failure to meet acceptable work conduct and performance standards and evidenced his inability to effectively perform his job then and in the future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The actions cited included his intoxication on September 1st, his failure to be \"upfront\" with the station following the incident (by not disclosing the arrest presumably), and by accessing the company's LexisNexis account while on leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wenger states that Plaintiff's acts showed that he had \"completely disregarded the final warnings\" he had been given.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A formal termination letter, dated October 16, 2015, summarized prior incidents, noted the September 1, 2015 disorderly conduct arrest, remarked on his failure to be \"upfront\" with KOIN, and discussed his access to the LexisNexis account.

There is\n   no evidence that he ever made a threat of violence to any supervisor or coworkers. While there is evidence indicating he may have lost his temper or yelled at work, Busch Apr. 23, 2018 Decl., Ex. 5 (Miner June 27, 2015 email to Glover and Stevens), nothing in the record supports an inference that he was violent or threatening at work or toward his professional colleagues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff's conduct on September 1, 2015 was threatening because he put others in danger when he lay down in the road. Defendants also suggest that Plaintiff threatened police officers. Defendants' arguments are not supported by the facts when those facts are taken in a light most favorable to Plaintiff which they must be when analyzing Defendants' summary judgment motion. First, it is clear that even under Defendants' contentions, Plaintiff's September 1, 2015 conduct did not actually threaten any of his coworkers. Plaintiff's actions occurred while he was at home, not at work, and involved only his family, other drivers on Shattuck Road, and the police. While Plaintiff conceded to KOIN that his conduct that night was capable of tarnishing KOIN's image, no reasonable juror could conclude that his conduct was actually threatening to any coworkers or supervisors. Second, when viewed in Plaintiff's favor, the evidence supports an inference that while he created a traffic inconvenience, he caused no harm. Plaintiff's wife testified that \"neighbors heard him and moved their cars so that nobody would run over him.\" M. Reaves Dep. 110:19-21. The police report notes one witness who saw Plaintiff \"stagger out of the trail head\" at Southwest Shattuck and 53rd, stumble into the street, and fall down. Busch Apr. 23, 2018 Decl., Ex. 2 at 4.

But there is no evidence that he actually threatened the police officers or attempted to hurt them. The record does not suggest that the police were in fear of Plaintiff or believed he jeopardized their safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Moreover, as Plaintiff notes in his response to the summary judgment motion, he was not fired for making threats. He was fired for off-duty conduct of getting arrested which Defendants assert subjected the station to embarrassment and public ridicule, not being forthcoming about having been arrested, and using his LexisNexis account to obtain Dr. Simas's email address. Putting aside issues of fact as to whether his use of the LexisNexis account was to benefit him personally or his employer and whether the fact of his behavior on September 1, 2015 actually caused embarrassment to the station, Plaintiff was not in fact terminated for being unable to handle stress, inappropriate interactions with coworkers, or making any threats or engaging in any other misconduct at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants' argument also overlooks\n   <em>\n    Mayo's\n   </em>\n   limited holding. While\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   noted that an \"essential function of almost every job is the ability to appropriately handle stress and interact with others,\" the court did not hold that every employee who has difficulty handling stress cannot, as a matter of law, establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. The court made clear that its holding was that threatening \"to kill co-workers in chilling detail and on multiple occasions\" revealed a \"vastly disproportionate reaction\" to stress on the job which, as a matter of law,\n   precluded the plaintiff from performing the job's essential functions.\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289781\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/941/\">\n    795 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   944 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289781\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/941/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289781\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/941/\">\n    at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Mayo's credible, detailed, and unwavering plan to kill his supervisors more than adequately demonstrated that he lacked the ability to appropriately handle stress and interact with others\").

Contrary to Defendants' assertion, absent a credible threat of violence to a coworker or supervisor, facts showing that an employee may have adverse reactions to stress are not enough to conclude, as a matter of law, that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job.

Mot. 18. Defendants cite to Plaintiff's \"lack of candor\" during the subsequent investigation done by KOIN into the incident and his violation of company policy precluding employees from using company resources, such as LexisNexis, for any use not solely to benefit the company. Defendants contend that Plaintiff used the LexisNexis program for his own benefit to obtain his own release to work, making his use primarily for personal purposes. Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot show that his mental health conditions \"caused\" his termination. Instead, he was terminated due to his repeated violations of work performance and conduct standards, including, Defendants state, multiple events involving insults directed toward the police, who serve as an important source of information for LIN-TV.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants assert that there are no facts indicating that Plaintiff's termination was due to his depression, anxiety, or PTSD.

There are issues of fact as to whether the reasons given by Defendants in support of termination are related to Plaintiff's mental health diagnoses. Defendants wrote that Plaintiff was terminated because he was arrested for disorderly conduct which was unprofessional and subjected the station to embarrassment and public ridicule. Yet, Plaintiff was not convicted of any crime or shown to have violated a law. Second, Plaintiff's attempt to kill himself by drinking and walking into the road are arguably attributable to his depression. Moreover, Plaintiff testified that the stress resulting from the schedule change away from the Monday-Friday schedule urged by his counselor, contributed to his suicide attempt.\n   <em>\n    Humphrey\n   </em>\n   recognized that a \"link between the disability and termination is particularly strong where it is the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a known disability\" that results in a discharge for performance problems arising from that disability.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077367\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1128/\">\n    239 F.3d at 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As to his failure to tell KOIN that he had been arrested, KOIN did not directly ask Plaintiff this question. It is arguable that his failure to disclose the details of the September 1, 2015 incident when he spoke to Glover while still in the hospital on a psychiatric hold, is attributable to his mental health diagnoses. Moreover, there is certainly an argument that accessing the LexisNexis account was for the employer's benefit. Although Defendants argue that Plaintiff's use of the account was for his own benefit, there is no policy in writing regarding the use of the account and employees are permitted to use the program for employment-related matters. Arb. Trans. 280:12-281:9. Based on these facts, it is arguable that Plaintiff's use did not violate company policy. If so, this undermines the reason articulated by Defendants which then provides a reasonable basis for arguing that Defendants' reason(s) for termination are pretextual. Additionally, in attempting to provide evidence of his fitness to return to work from his medical doctor, Plaintiff's conduct in accessing the account was related to his mental health disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff needs little evidence to establish a prima facie case.\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

With no citation to the record, Defendants assert that Plaintiff obtained the note from his counselor because he believed he was going to be moved to a new shift due to performance issues. According to Defendants, Plaintiff never required accommodations to perform his essential duties. Alternatively, Defendants argue that even if KOIN was obligated to provide reasonable accommodations, it did so. It accommodated his schedule to attend therapy sessions and made sure he would be able to attend his appointments. It also allowed him to take leaves of absence as necessary.

Inadequate sleep would obviously interfere with his ability to perform his job. Time with his family was critical to his recovery and although the evidence is that Plaintiff had never been intoxicated at work, if his recovery were not sustained he could arguably be precluded from performing the essential functions of the job.

Defendants move for summary judgment on all punitive damages claims, arguing that under either the state or federal standard, Plaintiff has failed to set forth facts justifying an award. Under the ADA, punitive damages are available if the defendant has \"engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1). Under Oregon law, an award of punitive damages requires \"clear and convincing evidence\" that a defendant \"acted with malice or has shown a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm and has acted with a conscious indifference to the health, safety and welfare of others.\" O.R.S. 31.730.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendants argue that because Plaintiff fails to present facts indicating that KOIN was consciously taking Plaintiff's disabilities into account at the time of his termination, he is not entitled to punitive damages. The preceding discussion of Plaintiff's disability claims disposes of Defendants' argument. When the facts are construed in Plaintiff's favor, there is evidence from which a jury could determine that Defendants were at least recklessly indifferent to Plaintiff's rights.

Moreover, the court continued, the concept of informal settlement and conciliation, which is the purpose of the administrative exhaustion requirement, would not be served by requiring an aggrieved person to file a new charge for each new successor company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It could even encourage \"evasion through corporate transfers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And as to bona fide transfers of ownership, delays could be substantial, discriminatees could be prejudiced, and \"serious questions would be presented as to whether a charge filed against a successor would be barred by the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, the\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   court noted the \"multiplicity of factors\" that other courts had considered in analyzing the successorship question in the labor context.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/\">\n    at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those are the factors quoted in\n   <em>\n    Slack.\n   </em>\n   The court found that MacMillan's own affidavit presented in support of its motion to dismiss created issues of fact on the issue of successor liability.

The Ninth Circuit reversed. Although the case did not address successor liability, it affirmed the concept that there are exceptions to the \"general rule\" that defendants must be named in the administrative charge in order to be named in the civil case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549126\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/1451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549126\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/1451/\">\n    at 1458-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That injunction was issued in May 1981. Several years later, Western was acquired by Delta. The merger was completed in 1987. After the merger, Delta began enforcing the same discriminatory policy that had been the subject of the claims against Western.

The district court granted the motion and\n   held that Delta was a successor to Western. Delta appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The court began its discussion by explaining that \"[i]n an employment discrimination action, there are three principal factors relating to successor liability: (1) continuity in operations and work force of the successor and predecessor employers; (2) notice to the successor employer of its predecessor's legal obligation; and (3) ability of the predecessor to provide adequate relief directly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534036\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/868/1093/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534036\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/868/1093/\">\n    at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

AN Luxury Imports of Tucson, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 11-617-TUC-FRZ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012044519\">\n    2013 WL 12044519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Ariz. Dec. 5, 2013). I agree with Plaintiff that although the EEOC/BOLI administrative process was already complete, Nexstar had notice of the claims before suit was actually filed. And, Nexstar had further notice once the Complaint in this case was filed and has had the opportunity to present its legal defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that only Nexstar can provide relief because LIN-TV no longer exists. Defendants do not dispute this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The law is clear that Plaintiff's failure to name Nexstar in his BOLI complaint does not preclude naming Nexstar in this action. The relevant facts are undisputed. These undisputed facts show that Nexstar is jointly liable as a successor to LIN-TV. The Ninth Circuit cases focus on the continuity of operations and personnel as well as notice and the ability of the predecessor to provide relief. The factors used in the Ninth Circuit discussion of the issue emphasize substantially similar operations at what could be called \"the production level,\" not whether there are overlapping boards of directors or key executives.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Slack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111512\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/522/1091/#p1094\">\n    522 F.2d at 1094-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (focusing on whether the employer uses the same plant, same work force, same supervisors, same machinery and equipment, and uses the same jobs with similar working conditions to produce the same product);\n   <em>\n    Criswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534036\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/868/1093/\">\n    868 F.2d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (looking at continuity in operations and work force). Here, KOIN produces the same product post-merger as it did pre-merger, uses some of the same personnel, is still located in Portland, and continues with similar staffing. Nexstar had notice of the claims and there is no relief available from LIN-TV. Additionally, Nexstar has assumed the liabilities and claims of Nexstar. The \"origins of successor liability are equitable,\" and therefore, \"fairness is a prime consideration in its application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534036\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/868/1093/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under this standard, the facts show that Nexstar is liable on the ADA claims as a successor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   B. Plaintiff's Oregon Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's OFLA claim is untimely. Under the applicable statute, Plaintiff has one year after the alleged unlawful employment practice to file a civil action under O.R.S. 659A.885,\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the person has filed a BOLI complaint. O.R.S. 659A.875(1). The same is true for Plaintiff's disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims brought under Oregon statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534036\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/868/1093/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If a BOLI complaint has been filed, the civil claims are timely if filed within ninety days after a ninety-day right to sue notice is mailed. O.R.S. 659A.875(2). There is no dispute that Plaintiff timely filed this action on March 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Defendants' motion against the Oregon claims assumes that Plaintiff's failure to name Nexstar in his BOLI complaint means that Plaintiff had to file his OFLA claim against Nexstar within one year of the unlawful employment practice. Given that Oregon statutory employment claims are to be construed and treated like their federal counterparts, the analysis of successor liability developed under federal employment discrimination claims should apply equally to the OFLA claim and the Oregon statutory disability claims. Alternatively, even if Oregon common law applies, Nexstar is liable as a successor under those principles as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In a 2004 case, Judge Coffin considered the issue of successor liability in the context of claims for breach of contract, account stated, and quantum meruit.\n   <em>\n    Giant Mfg.

Bikee Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. Civ. 02-6222-TC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201698056\">\n    2004 WL 1698056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Or. July 28, 2004). There, he explained that Oregon courts follow the \"traditional rule regarding successor liability\" as stated in\n   <em>\n    Erickson v. Grande Ronde Lumber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1973494\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/162/556/#p568\">\n    162 Or. 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1973494\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/162/556/#p568\">\n    92 P.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1939) ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Quoting from\n   <em>\n    Erickson\n   </em>\n   , Judge Coffin wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \"The general rule is that where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all of its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.... To this general rule there are four recognized exceptions, under which the purchasing corporation becomes liable for the debts and liabilities of the selling corporation. (1) Where the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such debts; (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporations; (3) where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation; and (4) where the transaction is entered into fraudulently in order to escape liability for such debts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Erickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1973494\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/162/556/#p568\">\n    162 Or. at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1973494\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/162/556/#p568\">\n    92 P.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Here, given the Merger Agreement's assumption of outstanding liabilities and claims, the \"purchaser\" expressly agreed to \"assume such debts.\" Additionally, the facts discussed above show that as to KOIN, Nexstar, as the purchasing corporation, is a continuation of the selling corporation. Thus, under either federal or state law principles of successor liability, Nexstar is jointly liable as a successor to LIN-TV for the Oregon statutory claims. With that, Plaintiff's failure to bring suit within one year is not fatal because Plaintiff's administrative charge against LIN-TV, the predecessor entity, was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   C. Successor Liability-Timely to Raise or Premature\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff's motion on the issue of Nexstar's liability is premature because as presented, Plaintiff seeks a successor liability determination in the abstract and without reference to what law the liability was incurred under. Defs.' Resp. to Pl's Mot. 13-14. I reject this argument because Defendants offer no law to support their position that the successor liability issue is premature and the facts support a determination as a matter of law that Nexstar is jointly liable as a successor on Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment [34] is granted in part and denied in part as follows: (1) granted as to Plaintiff's IIED claim; (2) granted as to Plaintiff's retaliation claims; (3) granted as to the interactive process claims as stand-alone claims; and (4) denied as to all other claims.
