Fairbanks claims that defendants, various police officers employed by the Town of Danvers, Massachusetts, falsely arrested him and conducted an unlawful search and seizure in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January, 2013, plaintiff hosted a small social gathering at his apartment in Danvers, Massachusetts. The guests included his estranged father, Mark Kendall, his neighbor, Maria Melendez and his father's girlfriend, Holly Fletcher. During the gathering, plaintiff and his father, Kendall, stepped into the bathroom to have a conversation which devolved into an argument with raised voices. During the course of the argument, fixtures in the bathroom were damaged and the toilet was broken off of its base and began leaking water into the apartment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately 3:00 A.M., the individual who lived in the lower apartment called the police about the water leak. Officer Dana O'Hagan arrived at plaintiff's apartment shortly thereafter. Kendall and Fletcher met him in the lobby and told him that plaintiff was a Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and was \"crazy\". O'Hagan and other officers went upstairs to plaintiff's apartment. They found plaintiff in the hallway where they handcuffed and frisked him. They also asked him if he had any weapons and he responded that he had three guns: a .45 caliber pistol, a .38 caliber revolver and a .22 caliber rifle two of which were in his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officers then entered plaintiff's apartment to recover his keys and subsequently seized the revolver and rifle from his car. They also confiscated a knife, a \"scope\", the pistol and other property not specifically identified in the complaint from plaintiff's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fairbanks was charged in the Massachusetts District Court with 1) assault and battery, 2) assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, 3) two counts of improper storage of a firearm and 4) malicious destruction of property. In July, 2013, he admitted to sufficient facts for a guilty finding with respect to the assault and battery charge and one of the charges of improper storage of a firearm. With respect to those admissions, he agreed to a two-year continuance without a finding. The other charges were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January, 2016, plaintiff filed suit in this Court against the Town of Danvers and five Danvers police officers, Officer Dana O'Hagan, Detective Carleton, Sergeant Janvrin and Officers Cassidy and George (collectively \"defendants\"). This Court dismissed the Town of Danvers from the suit in September, 2016 and, shortly thereafter, the remaining defendants filed a motion to dismiss which this Court allowed, in part, and denied, in part. Plaintiff's claims for 1) false arrest, 2) an unreasonable search and 3) the impermissible seizure of items from his apartment remain pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November, 2017, defendants moved to compel production of documents and answers to interrogatories from Fairbanks. He filed no opposition to that motion which was then allowed by Magistrate Judge Bowler in January, 2018. The following month, defendants filed a notice informing the Court that plaintiff had failed to comply with that discovery order and suggesting that it was appropriate to dismiss the case. Defendants did not, however, move to dismiss the case at that time. Shortly thereafter, counsel for plaintiff filed a motion for an order declaring plaintiff incompetent to testify at his deposition and moved to seal medical documentation in support of that motion. Defendants opposed plaintiff's motion to be declared incompetent, contending that issues of testimonial competence should be reserved for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment on all claims on April 30, 2018 which Fairbanks opposes. The Court\n   convened a status conference in May, 2018 to hear the parties on the status of the case and to determine the proper order in which to consider the pending motions. The parties agreed it would be appropriate at this juncture for the Court to consider the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants and to revisit the testimonial competence of plaintiff if any claims remained viable. In his opposition to the motion for summary judgment, plaintiff's counsel submitted a five-page affidavit purporting to summarize the testimony of four of the individual defendants. They moved to strike that affidavit and plaintiff opposes that motion. Defendants' motions to strike and for summary judgment are the subject of this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on the merits of each of plaintiff's three remaining claims.

They proffer evidence of information provided by Fairbanks's father, Mark Kendall and his girlfriend, Holly Fletcher, about plaintiff's violent behavior and the presence of \"several loaded guns\" in the apartment. Defendants assert that those statements provided the officers probable cause for plaintiff's arrest for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and domestic assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fairbanks opposes summary judgment on Count One, contending that the officers had a duty to further investigate the victims' complaints and that the officers failed to ask Fairbanks for his version of events.

He contends that the officers had a duty to investigate further because Kendall has had \"scrapes with the law\", is larger than Fairbanks who purportedly assaulted him and Fairbanks also sustained injuries. Fairbanks submits that the incident was a \"he-said-she-said\" situation and therefore required further investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The statements made by Kendall and Fletcher and the officers' observations of injuries to Kendall were sufficient to establish probable cause here. The officers were told that Fairbanks beat his father, Kendall, threw him into the bathtub, punched him in the face, ripped the toilet out of the wall and hit him in the head with it. Fletcher, the girlfriend, informed the officers that she witnessed Fairbanks beating Kendall and that Fairbanks had loaded guns in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Victim statements, even uncorroborated, can be sufficient to establish probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9151315\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/386/5/#p11\">\n    386 F.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The officers submit that (1) plaintiff's girlfriend consented to entry and led the officers to the firearm, (2) the protective sweep was reasonable, (3) there were exigent circumstances warranting entry, (4) the community caretaking exception applies, (5) the weapons were in plain view and the inevitable discovery doctrine applies and (6) seizure of the weapons is supported by the plain view doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants first contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on Counts Two and Three because plaintiff's girlfriend, Maria Melendez, consented to the officers' entry into the apartment and lead them to the seized weapon. They suggest that it was reasonable to rely on Melendez's permission to enter the apartment given her relationship to plaintiff, the time of night (between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M.) and the fact that she was wearing a Marine Corps sweatshirt when the officers were aware that plaintiff was a marine. Defendants proffer the affidavit of Officer Cassidy who states that \"Ms. Melendez invited us into the apartment to recover the firearm\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff disputes the officers' version of events and submits an affidavit of Melendez in which she rejoins \"[the officers] did not seek permission from either of us to search car or apartment\". The dueling affidavits here create a genuine issue of material fact about whether the officers had permission to enter the apartment and the officers are therefore not entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that the search was a result of the uncoerced consent of Ms. Melendez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants also contend, however, that the search of the apartment was reasonable as a protective sweep to protect themselves and others and that there were exigent circumstances that justified the entry. Plaintiff counters that a protective sweep was unnecessary because he left the apartment when asked and the officers were unaware of any other individuals in the apartment at the time of the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A warrantless search of a private residence is generally considered unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tibolt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415038\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/965/#p968\">\n    72 F.3d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (1st Cir. 1995).

Although plaintiff suggests that the officers did not know whether there was another individual in the apartment, they have set forth an articulable basis for their reasonable suspicion that there was a remaining risk of danger in the house.\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5323590\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/115/#p118\">\n    444 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The protective sweep and seizure of the firearm were reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants further suggest that there were exigent circumstances justifying their entry into the apartment. The exigent circumstances exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement generally requires a threshold showing that law enforcement officers had probable cause to enter.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Capelton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051227\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/231/#p240\">\n    350 F.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (1st Cir. 2003).

The First Circuit has recognized the presence of an exigent circumstance in cases where there is a threat of destruction of evidence inside a residence or where there is a potential threat to the safety or lives of the public or police officers.\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Town of Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11553683\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/41/#p49\">\n    196 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (1st Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The officers' decision to enter the apartment without a warrant was reasonable under the exigent circumstances doctrine. Defendants have proffered evidence sufficient to suggest that it was objectively reasonable to conclude that there may have been others in the apartment. Furthermore, they were told by Melendez and plaintiff that there was a loaded firearm on the premises. Although Fairbanks suggests that the officers' description of a party connotes a \"convivial atmosphere of celebration rather than a multitudinous host of people\", that suggestion does not affect the reasonableness of the officers' on-site determination that there was a potential threat to public or officer safety under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, the officers are entitled to summary judgment on Counts II and III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Strike\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In his opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, plaintiff submitted the affidavit of his counsel, Michael Walsh. That affidavit summarizes testimony of four of the individual defendants, Officers Hagan, Cassidy, Carleton and Sergeant Janvrin. Defendants move to strike that affidavit, asserting that it fails to meet the Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) requirements that such affidavits (1) be made on personal knowledge, (2) set out facts that would be admissible in evidence and (3) show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated. Defendants aver that the affidavit is inadmissible hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 802 and contains improper legal arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Fairbanks disputes the officers' characterization of the affidavit, rejoining that it does not contain legal conclusions and suggesting that the summaries of the officers' testimony \"reflects the imperfection of human memory\". In a convoluted argument, plaintiff submits that the summaries of the testimony are admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 1006, but glosses over the requirement of that rule that the proponent must submit originals or duplicates of the summarized testimony. Plaintiff maintains that counsel's summaries of the officers' testimony are not hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff's opposition is unavailing,\n   <em>\n    Casas Office Machines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mita Copystar Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416428\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/668/#p682\">\n    42 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (1st Cir. 1994), but even if it prevailed and the Court accepts the statements in counsel's affidavit as true, the Court has determined that defendants are entitled to summary judgment and, accordingly, it will deny defendants' motion to strike as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, defendants' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 49) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   .
