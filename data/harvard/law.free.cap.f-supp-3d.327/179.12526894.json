Lazier Decl. \u00b6 5, Dkt. 16-3. Frank represents plaintiffs in a lawsuit against PRA and believes that \"[r]ecords and information in the CFPB's possession that pertain to the CFPB's findings against PRA and its attorneys constitute evidence that would greatly strengthen the claims of the plaintiffs and putative class\" in that lawsuit. Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 20 at 3.

An agency satisfies this requirement when it \"establish[es] a rational nexus between [an] investigation and one of the agency's law enforcement duties and a connection between an individual or incident and a possible security risk or violation of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell v.

Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n    164 F.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (D.C.

As the CFPB notes, \"the very fact that the two transcripts are responsive to Frank LLP's FOIA request demonstrates that the transcripts were compiled for law enforcement purposes\" because Frank \"sought documents that the Bureau 'relied upon' in making a specific finding of fact in the Bureau's consent order with PRA, which resolved an enforcement action against PRA.\" Def.'s Mot., Dkt. 16 at 8 (citing Lazier Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. A, Dkt. 16-3; Dkt. 1, Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Frank's main argument is that \"[t]he CFPB's methods in questioning PRA's professional affiants do not amount to 'techniques and procedures' for purposes of Exemption 7(E) withholding, because the CFPB could not have employed any interviewing methods that are particularly unknown to the public.\" Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 20 at 9. But decisions from other judges of this court show that investigative questioning can qualify as such a \"technique\" or \"procedure.\" In\n   <em>\n    Barouch v. United States Department of Justice\n   </em>\n   , the court allowed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to withhold portions of an ATF interview because ATF explained that the withheld information related to \"questioning techniques used by the ATF agents and local law enforcement agents\" and disclosure of \"how law enforcement agents and officers question suspects and the tactics they use could lead to criminals using maneuvers to circumvent the law enforcement measures.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305200\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/10/\">\n    87 F.Supp.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30 n.13 (D.D.C. 2015) (internal quotations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Releasing the information could have \"permit[ted] individuals to prepare responses to counter these law enforcement strategies\" and thereby \"hinder[ed] future use of these tactics.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305200\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/10/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So too here: the redacted materials \"contain the specific questions asked by Bureau investigators of two of PRA's affiants, including the specific information and types of information sought, the manner of questioning, the sequencing of questioning, and the manner and sequencing of follow-up questions on specific items of interest,\" and \"[i]f entities were aware of this information, they could\n   coach future witnesses in similar cases on how to avoid providing incriminating information, hindering the future use of these investigative techniques.\" Petersen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, Dkt. 16-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg v. United States Department of Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement\n   </em>\n   , the court granted summary judgment to the FBI when it withheld a questionnaire prepared by an FBI special agent investigating allegations of obstruction of justice.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220956\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/92/#p113\">\n    13 F.Supp.3d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113-14 (D.D.C. 2014). The questionnaire contained \"specific questions, the rationale for a particular question, and recommendations to be followed by [Special Agents] conducting the interrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220956\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/92/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220956\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/92/#p113\">\n    at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting FBI declaration). The Court concluded that the questionnaire was properly withheld under exemption 7(E) because \"[r]elease of the redacted questions would disclose what the FBI deems relevant to investigating obstruction of justice cases,\" because \"the redacted information includes the FBI's rationale for one particular question as well as recommendations of follow-up questions,\" and because the FBI \"logically and reasonably explained how releasing what the FBI deems relevant to obstruction of justice investigations would allow criminals to 'adjust their responses and behavior to circumvent the law.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220956\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/92/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220956\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/92/#p113\">\n    at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting FBI declaration).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Frank attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the questionnaire \"disclosed questions that the agency\n   <em>\n    might have\n   </em>\n   asked\" and thus provided \"a meticulous blueprint covering\n   <em>\n    every possible\n   </em>\n   question-and-answer eventuality.\" Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 20 at 12 (emphasis in original). But first, it is not clear which way that cuts-the fact that the transcripts here contain\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   instead of\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   questions may actually reveal more about what the CFPB ultimately considers important. And second, even assuming this fact cuts in Frank's favor, the difference is only in the quantity-not the quality-of information disclosed: even if only\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   rather than\n   <em>\n    all potential\n   </em>\n   avenues of CFPB investigative questioning are revealed, they still reveal \"what the [CFPB] deems relevant to [Consumer Financial Protection Act and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act] investigations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Frank cites an out-of-circuit case,\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v.

But that case involved \"routine questioning\" that Customs and Border Protection used with \"more than 500\" children and that were \"well known\" through \"filmed arrests,\" copies of interviews that had been made available to lawyers, and \"the 57-episode Border Wars [television] series.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLUF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274741\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/393/#p404\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d at 404-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record here does not demonstrate that level of publication; to the contrary, the CFPB's declaration details the ways in which the CFPB keeps investigational hearing transcripts confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petersen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, Dkt. 16-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally,\n   the\n   <em>\n    ACLUF\n   </em>\n   court expressly declined to adopt reasoning from this Court allowing withholding even for some well-known techniques.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At any rate, to the extent the\n   <em>\n    ACLUF\n   </em>\n   decision conflicts with decisions in this circuit, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Barouch\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   more convincing and concludes that the questioning at issue qualifies as a \"technique\" or \"procedure\" under exemption 7(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties disagree about whether the CFPB must also demonstrate that \"disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E), and offer competing statutory analyses.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Dkt. 16 at 11-13,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 20 at 13-14. But the Court need not reach this issue because the CFPB\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   shown such a risk of circumvention, whether it was required to or not. The bar is not high: \"the exemption looks not just for circumvention of the law, but for a risk of circumvention; not just for an actual or certain risk of circumvention, but for an expected risk; not just for an undeniably or universally expected risk, but for a reasonably expected risk; and not just for certitude of a reasonably expected risk, but for the chance of a reasonably expected risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415764,3556965\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/37/\">\n    646 F.3d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayer Brown LLP v.

Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 20 at 12-13. But the\n    <em>\n     Barouch\n    </em>\n    court reached the merits, notwithstanding the plaintiff's failure to object:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    Plaintiff does not challenge defendants' withholdings based on FOIA Exemption 7(E), but the Court considers them anyway.... Although plaintiff has not specifically challenged this withholding, defendants have the burden to justify their reliance on any FOIA exemption, and neither defendants' pleadings nor the Boucher declaration addresses this withholding. Still, the Court finds that the explanation in the\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index provides a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that defendants have carried their burden to justify this particular withholding, especially in light of plaintiff's failure to object to it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <em>\n     Barouch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305200\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/10/\">\n     87 F.Supp.3d at 29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 30 n.13 (internal citations omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The CFPB filed a redacted version of the Petersen declaration along with its motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 16-2. The CFPB then moved for leave to file an unredacted version ex parte and in camera, Dkt. 17, and the judge previously assigned to this case granted that motion. The Court has since received and reviewed the unredacted declaration, which adds detail about the questions and information contained in the withheld materials. To avoid disclosing that information, the Court here quotes and cites only to unredacted portions of the initially filed declaration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Frank also argues that the CFPB \"necessarily reveal[ed]\" its questions to the PRA employees it interviewed \"during the underlying investigation,\" that those employees \"undoubtedly\" shared the questions with their supervisors and \"likely\" shared them at industry group meetings, and that the questions are consequently widely known. Pl.'s Opp'n &amp; Cross-Mot., Dkt. 20 at 15. But as the CFPB points out, that argument proves too much: if sharing interview questions during the interview itself automatically stripped the questions of exemption 7(E) protection, other cases in this court should have come out the other way.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Barouch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305200\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/10/\">\n     87 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    30 n.13 (exempting portions of \"Interview of David Barouch\");\n    <em>\n     Piper v.
