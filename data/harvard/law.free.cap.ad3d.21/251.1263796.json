The fact that defendant had been offered a favorable plea bargain does not negate the validity of the sentence imposed under the circumstances of this case <em>(see People v Pena, </em>50 NY2d 400, 411-412 [1980], <em>cert denied </em>449 US 1087 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge under <em>Apprendi v New Jersey </em>(530 US 466 [2000]) to New York\u2019s discretionary persistent felony offender sentencing scheme is unpreserved, and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. Were we to review this claim, we would reject it, (see <em>People v Rivera, </em>5 NY3d 61 [2005]; <em>People v Rosen, </em>96 NY2d 329 [2001], <em>cert denied </em>534 US 899 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The court properly denied defendant\u2019s request for substitution of counsel prior to his persistent felony offender hearing. Defendant supported his request with nothing more than his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>unjustified hostility toward and lack of confidence in his attorney (see <em>People v Sawyer, </em>57 NY2d 12, 19 [1982], <em>cert denied </em>459 US 1178 [1983]; <em>People v Medina, </em>44 NY2d 199, 207-209 [1978]). Defendant\u2019s attacks on counsel\u2019s competence were entirely conclusory. Concur\u2014Buckley, P.J., Andrias, Saxe and Nardelli, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
