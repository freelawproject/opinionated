The jewelry was last seen at 10:00 a.m. on June 6, 2001 when the plaintiffs left the house together. The plaintiff Margo Benzaken discovered that the jewelry was missing about nine hours later at around 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 deposition testimony established that during the course of the day, the house was occupied by the plaintiffs\u2019 live-in housekeeper, the plaintiffs\u2019 four children, and the plaintiff Allen Benzaken\u2019s sister-in-law. There is no evidence in the record as to whether additional individuals were present in the house when the plaintiffs were not present. Talarico was alone in the master bedroom at around 3:00 p.m. since he had to walk through the master bedroom to check on a telephone line he had just installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">In response to Talarico\u2019s prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, the plaintiffs attempted to raise a triable issue of fact through circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is sufficient if a defendant\u2019s conduct may be \u201creasonably inferred\u201d based upon \u201clogical inferences to be drawn from the evidence\u201d <em>(Staples v Sisson, </em>274 AD2d 779, 781 [2000]). In the instant case, the plaintiffs\u2019 submissions constituted pure speculation. Although Talarico had access to the location where the jewelry was stored, other individuals had equal or better access. The inference that Talarico was responsible for the disappearance of the jewelry is based upon the plaintiffs\u2019 opinion of the character of the various persons who they knew had access, and the fact that Talarico was the only individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>personally unknown to them who, to their knowledge, had access. Such speculation is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">In support of their argument that Talarico was not entitled to summary judgment, the plaintiffs rely upon <em>Gayle v City of New York </em>(92 NY2d 936, 937 [1998]), which dealt with the sufficiency of proof that a defective condition for which the defendant was responsible constituted a proximate cause of the injury. However, the issue in this case is not whether Talarico\u2019s wrongful conduct constituted a proximate cause of the loss. Rather, the issue here is whether Talarico committed any wrong. There is no evidence in this record indicating that Talarico committed any wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Accordingly, Talarico\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The Supreme Court properly granted the motion of Talarico\u2019s employer, Verizon Communications, Inc., for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it <em>(see Manno v Mione, </em>249 AD2d 372 [1998]). H. Miller, J.P., Schmidt, Adams and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
