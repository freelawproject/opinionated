Reading City.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AAt\">Before Fell, C.

On a rule for a new trial and for judgment for defendant n. o. v. Endlich, P. J., filed the following opinion;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">The complaint that the verdict rendered in this case is excessive was abandoned at the argument. The remaining reasons assigned in support of the application for a new trial, except those relating to the refusal of defendant\u2019s points, were not attempted to be sustained by any contention pertinent to them. The points referred to contemplating binding instructions in favor of defendant, their consideration is more properly involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>in the disposition of the application for judgment n. o. v., \u2014 which, indeed, is the only one now pressed. It is grounded, as the city solicitor explicitly states, upon the theory that the testimony of the plaintiff himself discloses contributory negligence on his part to be declared by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-3\">The very recent decision in Joyce v. R. R. Co., 230 Pa. 3, reiterates the well-established rule that the question of contributory negligence is for the court only where both the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them are free from doubt, \u2014 so much so as to make it inconceivable that any two minds could rationally differ in their conclusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-4\">The plaintiff had had a year\u2019s experience in riding his motor-cycle when the accident happened upon Eighth street, one of the principal thoroughfares of the city. He was riding south towards Penn street, which is two blocks from the point where he came upon Eighth street. He had not been in the habit of passing over this portion of Eighth street, and was not familiar with its condition. The block immediately north of Penn street, between it and Washington street, had for some considerable time been and then was very much out of repair. The asphalt pavement was broken up with numerous holes. When plaintiff reached Washington street he found the street freshly sprinkled, and slowed down to a very low speed. Beyond Washington street he at once encountered a large hole, but passed it keeping close to the curb. Looking ahead of him he observed between the curb and the street railway track several teams, some moving and one standing at the curb. With his attention directed partly to the street bed and partly to the teams, he ran into another hole which he did not see. His machine broke and he, in falling, was very severely and permanently injured. His own testimony in chief and on cross-examination as to what he was doing and how he was proceeding cannot be declared as matter of law to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>vict Mm of any omission of duty. After getting by the first hole, he says\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-4\">I proceeded but a very short distance when my attention was attracted by some teams; I was going ahead, I looked carefully. Q. Did you look at the roadway? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you see any hole? A. No, sir..... Q.....You say you didn\u2019t see a hole? A. No, sir..... Q. You didn\u2019t look down at the time that you were passing there because you say you were looking at the teams? A. I looked carefully ahead when I was riding there, straight ahead.....Q. And your attention was directed to the teams; is that right? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you you were not looking down on the street at that time? A. No, sir, not when I was looking at the teams.....Q. And you were thinking of passing by those teams? A. Yes, sir, I was thinking of passing the team that was moving; it was my intention that that team should pass the one that was tied to the post and I would pass it at Court street.....Q. (After passing the first hole) you didn\u2019t look for any more holes after that? A. No, sir. I looked ahead on the road and watched the teams too .....as a man will do when he is driving, he cannot give his sole attention to a horse or to an automobile or to the road, because in doing one or the other something else may happen; he has to watch for both. Q. Just at that particular time.....you were not paying any attention to the street and you said so, didn\u2019t you? A. No, sir; I looked ahead on the road. Q. You just said that your attention was directed to the teams? A. Well, I looked at the road and then looked at the team; I couldn\u2019t look at the two at one time.....Q. And you looked down on the ground? A. I looked at the ground and then looked around for teams, that I might avoid the teams.....Q. Well, it was daylight? A. It was daylight. Q. It was light enough for you to have seen the hole if you had looked for it? A. No, sir, I couldn\u2019t see the hole. Q. You couldn\u2019t see the hole? A. I didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>see the hole. Q. And your eyesight was good? A..... yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\">If in all this there are any inconsistencies, it was of course for the jury to deal with them and to ascertain the effect of the testimony as a whole: Kohler v. R. R. Co., 135 Pa. 346; Danko v. Rys. Co., 230 Pa. 295. It certainly does not exclude, as unreasonable and capricious, an interpretation whereby his conduct would appear to have been unobjectionable, judged by the rules laid down in such cases as Evans v. Philadelphia, 205 Pa. 193; Quinlan v. Philadelphia, 205 Pa. 309; McClay v. Philadelphia, 224 Pa. 174. Under the charge, which is not impugned, the jury must be understood as having put that interpretation upon it, and that settles his right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">The rules to show cause are discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in refusing binding instructions for defendant and in refusing motion for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-7\"><em>Henry P.

Phila., 205 Pa. 309; McCay v. Phila., 224 Pa. 174, and Graham v. Phila., 19 Pa. Super.
