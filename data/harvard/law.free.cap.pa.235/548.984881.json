On a motion for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. Endlich, P. J., filed an opinion which was in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-9\">It is an uncontested fact in this case that the injury which resulted in the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband was received by him in the discharge of his duty as defendant\u2019s employee. It is equally undisputed that it was received by him in passing from one part of the building to another over a trap-door covering an elevator shaft, opening upwards to let the elevator through, constituting when closed a part of the floor, intended to be used as such, and affording the only means of passage from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>side on which he was to that to which he was going. There was no danger in passing over this trap-door except when the elevator was moving. For the purpose of giving notice of its movements there were electric bells fixed at certain points. There appears, however, to be no room under the evidence for a reasonable doubt that these bells, during a considerable period, had been working unreliably. Frequently they did not ring. The defendant was repeatedly advised of this fact. There was no serious attempt on its part to put them into more efficient condition. The batteries would be shaken up by the engineer or some other employee, and then the bells would work for awhile. Several times on the morning of the accident they did not; once quite early they did. There is no pretense that at the precise time of the occurrence they sounded. The defendant\u2019s superintendent was with the deceased, but a few feet behind him. He does not say that the bells rang. It is not clear that there were any other means by which one approaching the trap-door could ascertain whether the elevator was moving or not. The plaintiff\u2019s husband \u25a0 had been employed at this place for quite some time and frequently gone over the trap-door. There is nothing to indicate that he knew the bells to have failed that morning. Nor, since they had not failed each time, is there anything to show that he had not reason to think they were working. He went towards the trap-door rapidly and stepped upon it without first stopping.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-3\">Upon this statement of facts two questions arise involving the right of recovery, (1) whether the deceased had assumed the risk of the injury that befell him and (2) whether any negligence on his part contributed to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">Whatever risk there was in the mere presence of the trap-door, the plaintiff\u2019s husband undoubtedly assumed. But there was no danger in that to him so long as the signal apparatus was in working order, unless he chose to ignore its warnings. That, however, the defendant owed him the duty of keeping that apparatus effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>can hardly be doubted. See Ortlip v. Traction Co., 198 Pa. 586. Its efficiency was not, therefore, one of the risks he can be deemed to have assumed by accepting his employment or continuing in it. Nor was the knowledge brought home to him by the evidence such as to imply that assumption. Granted he knew all that the facts shown in relation to the elevator could fairly have apprised him of. Then he knew that there were bells intended to give notice of the movements of the elevator, and that when in order they did so; and whilst he knew that they often got out of order, he knew also that, when they did, they were brought back to efficiency in the manner above stated. That he knew them to have failed on the morning of the accident would be a mere guess. He could not, of course, hear that they did not ring, and there is nothing to prove that he observed or was in a position to observe the elevator going up without previous signal. It would be just as permissible to suppose that he heard the bell ring on the one occasion in the morning of the day of the accident when, it was testified, it sounded, and that he was justified by having heard it in believing it to be in working order. In short, whatever peril there was to the deceased, employed where he was, from the failure of the bells to ring, it was not one ordinarily, reasonably or necessarily incident to his employment at that place, but exceptional, and of his knowledge of its existence at the critical moment there is no evidence. It follows that the question of his assumption of that risk was not in the case either as a matter of law to be declared by the court or as one of fact to be found by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">The question of his contributory negligence was undoubtedly in the case, \u2014 not indeed as one to be negatived by plaintiff\u2019s evidence in the first instance: Baker v. Gas Go., 157 Pa. 593; Weitzel v. Traction Co., 184 Pa. 407, 412, nor as one to be affirmed by the court: See Joyce v. R. R. Co., 230 Pa. 1, but as one to be passed upon by the jury in the light of all the circumstances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>evidence bearing upon the prudence or imprudence of his actions and movements. It was so submitted to the jury and negatived by their verdict. Upon the familiar principle laid down in Phila. Trust Co. v. R. R. Co., 160 Pa. 590, 600, the court is without the means of testing the accuracy of their conclusion on a matter which the law refers to them exclusively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-2\"><em>Error assigned </em>amongst others was in refusing judgment for defendant n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-3\"><em>John B.
