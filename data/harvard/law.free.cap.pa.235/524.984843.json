In an action to recover such money the court left two questions to the jury, (1) was the payment made by mistake on the part of plaintiff\u2019s officers, and (2) was it caused by inadvertence in reading the first paragraph of the will as the paragraph under which plaintiff was acting as trustee; and was that due to the similarity of the names mentioned in the will. The first question was answered \u201cyes,\u201d the second \u201cno.\u201d Thereupon a third question was submitted, viz: \u201cState what was the character of the mistake?\u201d This was answered \u201cCarelessness of the officers of the Union Trust Company.\u201d The court asked the jury in what particular the officers had been careless, and the foreman said, \u201cin reading the will.\u201d These words were then added to the answer. The court then directed a verdict for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed no erroreither in propounding the questions to the jury, or in directing a verdict for the plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b552-7\">Argued Feb. 19, 1912.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArP\">Appeal No. 235, Jan.

Before Newcomb, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-3\">At the trial the court gave binding instructions for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-4\">The facts appear by the opinion of Newcomb, J., on motion to amend the verdict, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-5\">This suit was brought to recover money paid to defendant by mistake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">The payment was made in October, 1902, and arose out of the management of a trust fund which had come to plaintiff\u2019s hands in 1893, under the second paragraph of the will of Robert McKim. In round figures the fund was $100,000.00, of which two equal one-tenth parts were held, one for the use of defendant and the other for that of her sister, Mrs. Hart, but each during life. At their death the principal in each case went to their respective issue, if any; otherwise to the executors of the will. Mrs. Hart\u2019s maiden name was Angelica Church, and she was so named in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">Under the provisions of the first paragraph of the will another $100,000.00 came to the hands of the United States Trust Co., also of New York. Inter alia sums of $10,000.00 each were by it held for these sisters for life with remainder in each case to the survivor in the event that the other died without issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">In the summer of 1902 Mrs. Hart died leaving no issue. In October plaintiff was advised of the fact by letter of Mr. Gilpin suggesting that he understood his wife thereby succeeded to the fund held for her sister\u2019s use. To this there was a prompt reply assenting to that understanding with a formal receipt enclosed for Mrs. Gilpin\u2019s signature in order to close the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-9\">Hence, the evidence of payment is a written instrument duly executed and delivered to plaintiff. Mrs. Gilpin thus acknowledged the receipt of $10,000.00, together with some accrued income, being \u201cthe one-tenth part of the trust fund mentioned in said first paragraph of said will heretofore held by Union Trust Co. for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Angelica Church,\u201d etc. There was other reference to this particular fund and paragraph \u201cin pursuance of which,\u201d it was set forth, defendant \u201chad become entitled\u201d to the principal on the death of her <em>sister; </em>and in consideration of the payment, it proceeded to say, plaintiff was discharged from its liability on account of that fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-4\">Other than in the matter of Mrs. Hart\u2019s death, these assumptions of fact, forming the consideration of the payment, were radically erroneous. It was, therefore, undisputed and indisputable that the money was paid by mistake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">The fund which the parties had in mind had never been in plaintiff\u2019s hands. With the trust described in the voucher the plaintiff had nothing whatever to do. That was the fund in the hands of the other company. The two trusts were quite as distinct and independent of each other as two separate paragraphs of a written instrument could make them. The death of her sister in no way affected the relations of Mrs. Gilpin with the plaintiff Trust Co. The plaintiff took nothing by the release. The liability which it purported to discharge had never existed. All this is apparent upon a mere reading of the will, if read with care and attention to what it says. There is nothing ambiguous about either paragraph, calling for anything more than careful reading. So that upon examination of the two instruments, the bequest on the one hand and the receipt on the other, the inference would seem to be irresistible that the payment was the result of mistake on part of some officer of the Trust Company in failing to note the identity of the trustee named in the first paragraph on the occasion of being advised of Mrs. Hart\u2019s death and the defendant\u2019s understanding in the premises. There is nothing outside of these writings to throw any light on the nature and character of the mistake except this correspondence, and.nothing in that to weaken the inference arising from the terms of the receipt. There was no attempt to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>pair plaintiff\u2019s equity unless it be in the offer to prove that defendant had in the meantime spent the money so that repayment would now be a hardship; and that is believed to be immaterial for reasons to be mentioned below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-3\">From the inception of the suit the close question has seemed to be whether it wasn\u2019t a case for binding instructions for plaintiff. The court being divided on the question, the defendant was given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to go to the jury. 6. (But, instead of a general submission, two specific questions were first submitted to the jury subject to further instruction upon return of their answers. These were as follows: \u201c(1) Was the payment of October 22, 1902, made by mistake on part of plaintiff\u2019s officers? (2) Was it caused by inadvertence in reading the first paragraph of the will as the paragraph under which plaintiff was acting as trustee; and was that due to the similarity of the names of the two trustees mentioned in the will?\u201d The first was answered, \u201cYes;\u201d the second, \u201cNo.\u201d Thereupon a third question was submitted, viz: \u201cState what was the character of the mistake?\u201d This was returned with the somewhat indefinite answer: \u201cCarelessness of the officers of the Union Trust Co. of New York.\u201d Their attention being called to the necessity of stating in what particular the officers had been careless, it was disclosed that what was meant was carelessness in reading the will; and thereupon, by hand of their foreman, the jury were permitted to complete the answer in open court. In order to guard against possible misunderstanding the answer as so completed was then first read aloud to them, not by the clerk, but by the court, and they were asked if that was correct \u2014 as appears by the transcript \u2014to which the foreman replied \u201cyes,\u201d and the others nodded assent in the usual way. Upon that a verdict was directed for plaintiff, for the reasons then stated and which in my judgment made it inevitable.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\">These circumstances are referred to because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>learned counsel seeks to support the present motion, in part, by the foreman\u2019s testimony. The effort is to reform the finding of the jury by substituting the term \u201cconstruing\u201d in place of \u201creading\u201d the will, thus characterizing the mistake as one of law rather than of fact, and so to defeat the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-4\">Accordingly the motion is to amend the verdict to one in favor of defendant. Aside from the foreman\u2019s version of what was in the minds of the jurors, the motion is based on the answer to the second question. The point made is that this negatived the specific averment upon which plaintiff\u2019s case turned, and was therefore a finality. The contention is believed to be unsound. If for the jury at all the case was such as made it important to have the benefit of their unbiased judgment as to the nature and character of the mistake. That wasn\u2019t accomplished by the first two answers. They left the matter just where it was at the outset. The second question was probably somewhat inapt by reason of its having two branches. I can think of no good reason why the courts in attempting to administer the law through trial by jury may not submit any question appropriate to the issue of fact. That the final question here was inappropriate to that purpose has not been suggested. The answer affirms the substance of plaintiff\u2019s allegation. As such, it warranted the verdict as directed, unless recovery is barred by the fact of plaintiff\u2019s negligence; or the finding be open to revision on the deposition of a juror; and this, for no better reason than that in the opinion of the witness \u201cno person can read a will without putting a construction on it.\u201d This is manifestly incompetent and merits no consideration: Smalley v. Morris, 157 Pa. 349. Citations could be multiplied if the occasion called for it. For the sake of discussion it may be conceded that the jury would have held the Trust Co. to the loss of the money if at liberty to do so. They were called upon, however, only to decide the facts, unmoved by sympathy or prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>for or against either party, regardless of the consequences. Undoubtedly their conclusion was correct. No one could read the will attentively without being forcibly impressed with the fact that a blunder had been made. That would be quite as apparent to a jury of average understanding as to a lawyer. The final answer here was not only consistent with the evidence, but it is not apparent how there could have been any escape from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-3\">Turning now to the effect of plaintiff\u2019s negligence, I take it to be well settled that it will only bar recovery where defendant has irrevocably changed his position before demand made. 2 Street\u2019s Found. Leg. Liab. 213; Kelly v. Solari, 9 M. &amp; W. 54; Keener on Quasi-Contracts, 70 et seq; Appleton Bank v. McGilvary, 70 Mass. 518; G-irard Trust Co. v. Harrington, 23 Pa. Super. Ct. 615; Lawrence v. Bank, 54 N. Y. 432. It has been sometimes said that plaintiff\u2019s laches will preclude recovery unless defendant can be put in statu quo. And it is upon this principle that it was sought to be proven here that defendant had spent the money. There is neither reason nor authority, however, to support the theory that the mere fact of the money having been spent amounts to an alteration of defendant\u2019s legal position. It is enough to say that if it were so, the instances in which the right to recover has been affirmed would have been much less frequent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-4\">Essentially the claim here is founded on a transaction in which there was a total failure of consideration, due to a mutual misunderstanding as to the existence of the subject matter. In such case where the plaintiff\u2019s equity is complete there can be no doubt of his right to recover: 2 Street\u2019s Found. Leg. Liab. 211; Martin v. Sitwell, 1 Show. K. B. 156; McDonald v. Lynch, 59 Mo. 350. And it has been so held whether the mistake be one of law or fact: Champlin v. Laytin, 6 Paige 189. In principle and analogy it is not unlike a suit for breach of warranty of title. So, in a case differing from this in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>no essential particular, where by mistake a legacy had been paid to one not entitled under the will it was held that the money could be recovered whether the mistake was either of fact or law: Northrop v. Graves, 19 Conn. 548. Speaking by Chief Justice Church, the court said: \u201cWe mean distinctly to assert that where money is paid by one under a mistake of his rights and his duty, and which he was under no legal or moral obligation to pay, and which the recipient has no right in good conscience to retain, it may be recovered back in an action of indebitatus assumpsit whether such mistake be one of fact or law; and this we insist may be done both upon principle of Christian morals and the common law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-4\">The case affords a good illustration of the modern tendency of the courts to limit the earlier doctrine which denied in general the right to recover where money had been paid under a mistake of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">We are not called upon to decide whether the present case falls outside the general rule. 6. (It was tried on the theory of mistake of fact only. Assuming it to have been for the jury, it is believed the facts, so far as in dispute, were well found in the affirmative, and that the verdict was regular. This is decisive against the motion, and the rule to amend is discharged.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\"><em>Errors assigned, </em>among others, was (1, 2) in instructing the jury as to answers to questions; (3) in giving binding instructions for plaintiff and (6) in refusing to amend the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-7\"><em>Samuel B.
