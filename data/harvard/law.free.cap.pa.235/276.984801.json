I also offer to prove by other witnesses that this portion of three feet of the lot is of great value, and was worth at the time of the taking over $5,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\">\u201cMr. Gibbons: This offer is objected to, because the deed offered in evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs recites the property purchased as follows: \u2018All that certain lot or piece of ground, with the buildings and improvements thereon erected, described according to a survey made thereof by W. C. Cranmer, surveyor and regulator of the third survey district of the city of Philadelphia, on the 9th day of October, A. D. 1895, as follows, to-wit: Situate on the south side of Arch street (as widened to the width, of 72 feet) and west side of Thirteenth street, in the \u2022 ninth ward of the city of Philadelphia, containing in front or breadth on the said Arch street 60 feet and extending of that width in length or depth southward along the west side of said Thirteenth street 134 feet to the north side of Cuthbert street, bounded northwardly by the said Arch street, eastward by said Thirteenth street, southward by said Cuthbert street and westward by ground now or late of William Sansom,\u2019 said deed being dated February 17, 1902, and recorded in Deed Book W.

This description is carried in the deed from Henry Charles Lea to Morris Liveright and Benjamin F. Greenwald, dated February 17, 1902, the grantees in that deed being the plaintiffs in the case at bar. It would seem, therefore, that the plaintiffs did not take title under the deed from Lea to Livei\u2019ight and Greenwald to the three feet of ground for which they now claim compensation, by reason of the alteration of the building and the widening of Arch street to the width of 72 feet, as set forth in the Ordinance of 1886.

In 1886 the city by ordinance directed the widening of the street to seventy-two feet, three feet to be added to either side. The ordinance was not to apply at once to properties on which buildings were erected, but all new or altered buildings were to be placed back on the new line established. At that time the St. George\u2019s Hall Association was the owner of a lot with a building thereon, at the South-west corner of Arch and Thirteenth streets, sixty feet in front on Arch street, which was sixty-six feet wide, and extending south on the line of Thirteenth street, one hundred and thirty-seven feet. In 1895 the Association conveyed this lot to Henry C. Lea by deed, in which it was described as being on the South side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Arch street as widened to the width of seventy-two feet and containing in front or breadth on Arch street sixty feet and extending of that width southward along the west side of Thirteenth street one hundred and thirty-seven feet, bounded northward by said Arch street, and eastward by the said Thirteenth street. In 1902 Mr. Lea conveyed the property by deed containing the same description to the plaintiffs, who desiring to rebuild, receded three feet in accordance with the ordinance of 1886. This proceeding was to recover the value of the strip of ground three feet in width included in the street by its widening. At the trial a non-suit was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The contention of the appellants is that under the well established rule of law that a conveyance of land bounded on a highway gives the grantee a title to the middle of the highway, if the grantor himself had title to it, and did not expressly or by clear implication reserve it, they acquired title to the strip of land three feet wide on the Arch street front, and c\u00e1n recover of the city the loss occasioned by being required to recede three feet when they rebuilt. This contention could be sustained if they had bought a lot one hundred and thirty-seven feet in depth, bounded by a street sixty-six feet in width. But in the deed to them and the deed to their grantor, the lot is described as \u201csituate on the South side of Arch street, as widened to the width of seventy-two feet,\u201d and the three feet' taken from the south side of the street is deducted from the depth of the lot. The right the plaintiffs acquired to the land in question was to its use as part of the highway, in. common with the general public, with the rever-, sionary right to the land as a part of the bed of the street in the event that the street should be vacated. This was all their grantor possessed and all that he conveyed to them. The St. George\u2019s Hall Association in 1895 established a new line as the northern boundary of its lot that conformed with the ordinance of 1886 and conveyed according to it. As between the Asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ciation and its grantee the three feet at the northern end of its lot was made a part of the street, as effectually as a formal dedication to the use of the public could have made it: Bornot v. Bonschur, 202 Pa. 463; Forsythe v. Philadelphia, 211 Pa. 147. The plaintiffs, therefore, lost nothing and had no right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">The fact that the coping and steps of the building extended onto the strip of land included in the widening of the street is unimportant as affecting the rights of the parties, since the encroachment was not beyond the limits of the usual permissive use of city streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
