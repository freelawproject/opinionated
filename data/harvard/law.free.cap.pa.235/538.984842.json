Lloyd, wife of John Lloyd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-10\">Edwards, P. J., filed tbe following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-11\">This case has been before us twice on a rule for judgment for the want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Each time, for adequate reasons, we refused to dispose of the merits of the case on the record as presented, and we suggested that the controversy could be more satisfactorily considered on a case stated. Our suggestion was accepted by counsel, and the case stated is now before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-12\">The legal questions involved arise from the consideration of two wills, that of Barbara Lloyd, the wife and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>that of John Lloyd, the husband. Does the will of Barbara Lloyd vest in her husband a valid power of appointment? And, has John Lloyd, in his will, properly exercised the power of appointment so vested in him?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">Barbara Lloyd devised her estate in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">\u201cI do hereby give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved husband, John Lloyd, all my property, real, personal and mixed of what nature or kind soever, to hold during the term of his natural life, and after his death one-fourth of my entire estate to~go to my son, John D. Lloyd, one-fourth to my daughter, Mary Ann Patten, one-fourth to my son, Samuel J. Lloyd; (the remaining\\ ''one-fourth of my estate to be divided between my son, \\ Thomas T. Lloyd, and my adopted son, William Lloyd, \\ in such shares as my husband, John Lloyd, shall see | fit.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-7\">It is clear that the wife, in reasonably apt terms, gave to her husband the power to dispose of one-fourth of her estate between her son, Thomas, and her adopted son, William, \u201cin such shares as my husband, John Lloyd, shall see fit.\u201d There can be no serious doubt, but that a limited power of appointment was vested by the wife in the husband as to one-fourth of her entire estate. Counsel, we understand, concede this proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-8\">The real dispute relates to the exercise of the power of appointment by the husband. Two of the items in his will read thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-9\">Item 6. \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my son, Thomas Lloyd, a share of all the real estate like Samuel Lloyd and Mary Ann Patten, share and share alike, equal shares.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-10\">Item 7. \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to William Prosser, whom I have raised, the sum of $5.00, as his full share.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-11\">It is agreed that the William Lloyd, named in the wife\u2019s will, is the same person as the William Prosser named in the husband\u2019s will. He was an adopted son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In reading the wife\u2019s will it will be noticed that she gave the power to her husband to dispose of the one-fourth of her \u201centire\u201d estate. Her will in terms devises all her property, \u201creal, personal and mixed of what nature or kind soever.\u201d In disposing of the one-fourth over which he had the power of appointment, the husband gives to one son \u201ca share of all the real estate like Samuel Lloyd and Mary Ann Patten\u201d that is, one-fourth of the real estate. There is nothing in the case stated to indicate the sum of the one-fourth of the wife\u2019s \u201centire\u201d estate. It may be a mooted question as to whether the husband has fully exercised the power vested in him by bis wife\u2019s will. There may be some part of the one-fourth of the wife\u2019s entire estate yet undisposed of; but that question does not concern us now. So far as it is shown by the husband\u2019s will, he has given one-fourth of the real estate to one son, and to the other son he has given $5.00 \u201cas his full share.\u201d The items six and seven of the husband\u2019s will should be read together, and thus reading them together we find a valid exercise of the power of appointment vested in the husband,. He gives to one son the one-fourth of the real estate and to the adopted son he gives $5.00 as his full share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">The title of the plaintiffs in this case depends upon the validity of the devise by John Lloyd of the one-fourth interest in the real estate to the son, Thomas. We are of the opinion that the devise is valid and that the title is good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">It is not necessary to discuss at length the law applicable to the present controversy. As early as 1863, in the case of Graeff v. DeTurk, 44 Pa. 527, it was decided that the English equity rule that where there is a power of appointment among several distributees each shall have an interest in the fund fairly proportioned to the amount for distribution and that the appointment of a nominal share to a beneficiarv is illusory and void, has never been adopted in Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">The same doctrine has been recognized in several sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sequent cases, cited in counsel\u2019s briefs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">For tbe reasons stated tbe plaintiffs are entitled to judgment. An order to this effect has already been signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-7\"><em>John J.
