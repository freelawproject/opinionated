Frazier alleged that, when he was transferred to a Special Housing Unit, Wingo and the other officers confiscated his property and discarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The district court dismissed Frazier\u2019s FTCA claim against the United States for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed his <em>Bivens </em>action against Wingo and the other unknown officers on summary judgment. He now appeals. This court\u2019s review is de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">On appeal, Frazier fails to challenge the dismissal of his FTCA claim. By failing to identify any error regarding the dismissal of this claim, it is the same as if Frazier had not appealed this issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Frazier has thus abandoned on appeal any arguments against the dismissal of this claim. Additionally, Frazier\u2019s brief fails to provide facts and argument challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his claims set forth in his <em>Bivens </em>action. Even pro se litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Issues not briefed are considered abandoned; thus, these claims are also deemed abandoned. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
