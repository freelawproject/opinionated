News-Texan, Inc. (NTI), the local newspaper, asked the City to disclose the names of candidates for the post and \u201call other data relevant to the names that would be in possession of the city of Garland.\u201d When the City did not comply, NTI filed suit in state court in January 1985 asking that the information requested be declared public under the Texas Open Records Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. Ann. art. 6252-17a (Vernon Supp.1986), and that a writ of mandamus issue compelling the City to disclose this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">On January 17, 1985, the day before the state hearing was scheduled, the City removed this case, alleging that removal was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1443(2) and. 1441(a)-(c). The state proceedings were held in abeyance. On January 22, NTI moved for remand and costs, but, that same day, the City Council called an emergency meeting and hired a new city manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">More than two years later, NTI has yet to be heard in state court. Although the court below ordered this case remanded in July 1986, the City brought this appeal, advancing various theories it claims justify either our reversal of the remand or our dismissal of this case as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City proclaims that its theories \u201crely on logic and subtle nuance\u201d and \u201clie on the frontier of the law governing removal of civil rights cases.\u201d Paradoxically, the City, having initiated proceedings in federal court and appealed the 1986 remand, also now informs us, though it never so contended below,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201c[a]ny action taken by this Court will resolve absolutely nothing as far as NTI is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">We find the City\u2019s legal arguments to be utterly devoid of merit. We affirm the district court\u2019s remand of the case to state court; we vacate the district court\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions on the City for improvident removal and remand to the district court for its reconsideration of whether such sanctions are appropriate under the correct legal standard; and, finally, we award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>peal to NTI and against the City for the City\u2019s plainly frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The merits of this appeal need not long detain us. We do not decide whether the information sought by NTI should be made available or whether NTI\u2019s request is now moot under Texas\u2019 Open Records Act. Those decisions will be made by the courts of the State of Texas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, as <em>Thompson v. Brown, </em>434 F.2d 1092 (5th Cir.1970), relied on by the City, clearly holds, the mootness of a case does not prevent our review of the propriety of a remand order (in cases removed under section 1443). If the case is moot (as indeed <em>Thompson </em>apparently was even when it was removed) and was properly removed and erroneously remanded, the federal district court\u2019s remand order is reversed and that court, which has been determined to be the only court having jurisdiction of the case, is then directed to dismiss it as moot. <em>Id. </em>at 1096. <em>A fortiori, </em>if the removal was improper and the federal district court\u2019s remand is affirmed, the question of the mootness of the suit is left for the state court, which has exclusive jurisdiction of the case and which may have different standards of mootness than do the federal courts. Here, as below-noted, we hold that the removal was improper and affirm the remand; hence, the mootness issue is to be resolved by the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The City\u2019s appeal as to the remand raises what amounts to two claims: first, that the district court erred by remanding without requiring a full evidentiary hearing, and, second, that removal was proper because release of the information requested would compel the City to violate the Voting Rights Act. However, because no evidentiary hearing is required if the section 1443 grounds purportedly justifying removal are patently invalid from the face of the removal petition, <em>see Smith v. Winter, </em>717 F.2d 191, 199 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Varney v. Georgia, </em>446 F.2d 1368 (5th Cir.1971), and because we agree with the district court that removal was plainly improper, the City\u2019s contentions effectively collapse into the single assertion that removal was proper, which we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">\n<em>A. Propriety of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The Garland City Charter provides that city managers are to be chosen by the City Council. The City\u2019s petition for removal asserted that requiring the disclosure of the applicants\u2019 names would violate a provision of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, because publication of information about job applicants would open city manager selection to public debate, thereby transforming a selection process into an election process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(2), removal is proper if an appropriate official is sued in state court for \u201crefusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with\u201d any law providing for equal rights, such as section 1973c. <em>See Whatley v. City of Vidalia, </em>399 F.2d 521 (5th Cir.1968).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The City asserts that it has a federal right to refuse to comply with state law, because section 1973c prohibits certain changes affecting voting without court approval or the United States Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>eral\u2019s preclearance, and that removal is therefore proper under section 1443(2). The City alleges that those informed citizens who would influence the City Council in its selection of a new city manager would reflect a different racial mix than do the electors of the council members, each of whom represents a defined geographical area, and that this citizen influence would bypass the existing representational system of the city charter and (presumably) in some way dilute minority voting power.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Adopting the City\u2019s theory would stretch the Voting Rights Act beyond rational limits, if not distort its purpose, and seal off significant aspects of City government from citizen scrutiny. Article IV, section 1, of the Garland City Charter empowers the Garland City Council to \u201c[a]ppoint the city manager.\u201d This same section of the charter also directs the City Council to establish administrative departments; \u201c[a]dopt the budget of the city and disburse municipal funds\u201d; authorize the issuance of bonds; \u201c[i]nquire into the conduct of any office, department or agency of the city\u201d; \u201c[o]pen, widen, extend or straighten public streets\u201d; \u201c[p]rovide ... for the exercise of the police powers of the city\u201d; \u201c[ajdopt... plans ... for the replanning, improvement and redevelopment of neighborhoods\u201d; and \u201c[p]ass all ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The City\u2019s claim is that the Voting Rights Act protects the City Council\u2019s absolute prerogative to make decisions entrusted to it by the city charter, and that enforcement of Texas\u2019 Open Records Act, by providing information to citizens, increases the possibility that citizens might influence Council decisions, thereby somehow changing the City\u2019s representational structure. If this theory proves anything at all, it proves far too much. The absurdity of the City\u2019s premise becomes self-evident when the theory is applied evenhandedly to all powers given the City Council by the charter, because the City\u2019s argument requires the parallel conclusion that voting rights are threatened by public awareness about and involvement in matters such as the creation of city departments, the city budget, issuance of bonds, official conduct in office, public thoroughfares, the exercise of police powers, neighborhood planning, the enactment of city laws, and the appointment of major city officials. We decline the City\u2019s invitation to explore this far \u201cfrontier of the law\u201d and hold that the district court was clearly correct in finding that this is not the sort of change envisioned by the Voting Rights Act and addressed by section 1973c. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Winter, </em>717 F.2d 191 (5th Cir.1983) (discussing the \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cvoting\u201d requirements of section 1973c and removal under section 1443).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Because this fundamental defect was plainly evident in the City\u2019s petition for removal, no evidentiary hearing was required, and remand was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\n<em>B. Sanctions Under Rule 11 and Section 1447(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">NTI by cross-appeal argues that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in its decision not to sanction the City. At the outset, we observe that we retain jurisdiction to review sanction decisions even though removal was improper and even though the removal was sought in part under section 1441, as well as under section 1443. In that respect, this case presents a fact situation almost the converse of that of <em>In re Vatican Shrimp Co., Inc. v. Solis, </em>Nos. 86-2412, 86-2579, 86-2601 (5th Cir.1987), in which Vatican Shrimp appealed the district court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>award sanctions against the company based on the court\u2019s conclusion that Vatican Shrimp's removal of the case under section 1441 was unwarranted. There, we reversed an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, noting that although section 1447(d)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201cprecludes our review of the order of remand, it does not shield the subsidiary issue of Rule 11 sanctions from appellate review. Absent review of Rule 11 sanctions in section 1447(c) removal cases, the district courts would have unlimited authority to impose a wide range of penalties. This is clearly not the intent of either the removal statute or Rule 11. Moreover, our review on the merits of the Rule 11 sanctions is distinct and separable from a review on the merits of the order of remand.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n. 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The decision to impose \u2014 or not to impose\u2014 sanctions in a removal asserted on both sections 1441 and 1443 is likewise reviewable by this Court. Just as we could review the district court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees if they had been imposed on the City, we can review the denial of costs and fees, including the legal standard applied by the district court, in its decision that removal was improper under both sections 1441 and 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The district court declined to impose sanctions for the City\u2019s removal of this case, noting that \u201c[t]he court can characterize the City\u2019s arguments in support of removal in various pejorative terms, but \u2018bad faith\u2019 is not one of them.\u201d The district court apparently assumed that bad faith is a prerequisite to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order does not make clear whether it addresses the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs only under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), only under Rule 11, Fed.R.Civ.P., or under both provisions. Rule 11 permits a district court \u2014 either on a party\u2019s motion or <em>sua sponte</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 to award costs and attorneys\u2019 fees against a party or attorney, or both, for filing a \u201cpleading, motion, [or] other paper of a party\u201d that is not \u201cwell grounded in fact and ... warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law,\u201d <em>or </em>if it is \u201cinterposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\u201d Rule 11 also imposes upon the attorney signing a party\u2019s pleadings, motions, and other papers the duty of reasonable inquiry and permits sanctions even in the absence of bad faith.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Accordingly, because it appears that the district court may have applied an improper threshold standard to sanctions under Rule 11, we vacate the decision not to impose sanctions and remand to allow the district court to reconsider this decision. We also observe that section 1447(c) permits an award of \u201cjust costs\u201d if the district court finds that \u201cthe case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction\u201d and that the language of section 1447(c) does not require bad faith as a precondition to an award of costs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\n<em>C. Appellate Sanctions Under Rule 38</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">NTI also seeks sanctions against the City for bringing a frivolous appeal. \u201cIf a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 38. \u201cA frivolous appeal is one which \u2018involves legal points not arguable on their merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olympia Co., Inc. v. Celotex Corp., </em>771 F.2d 888, 893 (5th Cir.1985) (citation omitted); <em>see also Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d 217, 221-23 (5th Cir.1984) (imposing frivolous appeal sanctions on both the litigant and counsel), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 333, 88 L.Ed.2d 317 (1985); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 (authorizing award of damages and double costs to party prevailing on appeal if a decision of a lower court is affirmed), <em>cited and quoted in Olympia, supra, </em>at 893 n. 3; 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper &amp; E. Gressman, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 3984, at 463-66 (1977); <em>id. </em>at 369-81 (Supp.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We find that Rule 38 sanctions are appropriate in this appeal and direct appellant to pay appellee\u2019s costs on appeal as well as appellee\u2019s reasonable appellate attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount determined by the district court following our remand of this case. <em>See, e.g., Stelly v. Commissioner, </em>804 F.2d 868, 870-72 (5th Cir.1986) (noting court of appeals may remand for a determination of the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees or itself fix the amount thereof based on information filed with the appellate court).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">We hold that the district court correctly determined that this case was not removable under section 1443, and accordingly its remand is affirmed. We vacate the district court\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions on appellant, and remand to the district court both for reconsideration of sanctions respecting the removal proceedings below applying the standards of Rule 11 and section 1447(c), and to determine the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by NTI on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-13\">. The City appeals only on the basis of its removal under section 1443, under which remand is subject to our review. The remand of a case removed under section 1441 is not reviewable, unless, as is not the case here, the district court \u201chas affirmatively stated and relied upon a non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <em>Royal v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>685 F.2d 124, 126 (5th Cir.1982). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case ... removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201d); <em>see also Whitaker v. Carney, </em>778 F.2d 216, 219 (5th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 64, 93 L.Ed.2d 23 (1986); Annot., <em>Civil Actions Removable from State Court to Federal District Court Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443, </em>28 A.L.R.Fed. 488, \u00a7\u00a7 11-14, at 511-16 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-20\">. Indeed, in July 1986, shortly before the remand order, the City urged the district court that NTI had waived its motion to remand, requested six months to conduct discovery, and demanded a jury trial on the merits of NTI's Open Records Act suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">. Certainly that the city manager has been chosen does not necessarily render of no public interest who else had applied for that position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. The City points to NTI's original state court petition, which urged prompt action because the City Council might hire a new city manager before \"the public will have an opportunity to consider the qualifications of the candidates or to engage in public debate regarding the same. The lack of the information which has been requested denies the public the opportunity <em>to attempt </em>to influence the choice that is to be made for a public official whose conduct will affect many members of the public.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The City\u2019s petition for removal misrepresented NTI\u2019s petition by altering the second sentence quoted, substituting the words \"the opportunity <em>to properly </em>influence the choice\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b304-15\">. <em>Whatley </em>was removed under section 1443(1). We do not reach the question of whether city officials are the kind of officials intended to be protected by section 1443(2) in the context of this case. <em>See Detroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants Association v. City of Detroit, </em>597 F.2d 566, 568 (6th Cir.1979). We assume, <em>arguendo, </em>the availability of section 1443(2) on all bases except that rejected in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AEm\">. The district court characterized this theory as follows: \"[T]he City has embraced the nonsensical notion that a newspaper, by seeking to obtain information about city government, can unilaterally alter the city charter. Because the major premise of the City\u2019s argument is clearly wrong, the balance of its argument is likewise without merit and is summarily rejected by the court.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. We need not decide whether \u2014 as NTI also contends \u2014 the City\u2019s petition must fail because section 1973c reaches only changes arising from a state enactment. <em>Cf. Allen v. State Board of Elections, </em>393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 826-27, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. The fact that NTI\u2019s request for sanctions referred only to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) does not preclude sanctions under Rule 11, which states, \u201cIf a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, <em>shall impose </em>... an appropriate sanction, which may include ... the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing ... including a reasonable attorney's fee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See also </em>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, Rule 11, 1983 Amendment (\"[T]he words \u2018shall impose\u2019 ... focus the court\u2019s attention on the need to impose sanctions for pleading and motion abuses. The court, however, retains the necessary flexibility to deal appropriately with violations of the rule. It has discretion to tailor sanctions to the particular facts of the case____\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b306-12\">. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. National Cash Register Co., </em>808 F.2d 1119, 1127 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201d[A]n attorney\u2019s good faith is no longer enough to protect him from rule 11 sanctions.\u201d); <em>Davis v. Veslan Enterprises, </em>765 F.2d 494, 497 n. 4, 498 n. 5 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b306-13\">. <em>See </em>14A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d </em>\u00a7 3739, at 586-87 (1985) (assessing just costs is appropriate \u201cwhen the nonremovability of the action is obvious\u201d); <em>see also Robertson v. Ball, </em>534 F.2d 63, 66 n. 5 (5th Cir.1976) (per curiam) (discussing duty to \"insure that the \u00a7 1443 exception to \u00a7 1447(d) not be used as a dilatory tactic by recalcitrant state court defendants\u201d); <em>Texas v.

There appear to be at least two difficulties here. First, the federal constitutional assertion would appear to be a matter of defense barred as a ground for removal under the \"well-pleaded complaint\u201d rule. <em>See Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). Second, it is questionable that an applicant for an important public position such as city manager has even a colorable claim that the United States Constitution protects his identity from disclosure, particularly where disclosure is required by state statute. <em>Cf. Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d 35 (1971) (candidate for public office is public figure or public official within rule of <em>New York Times Co. v.
