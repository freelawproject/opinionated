Concluding that Cowan\u2019s pleadings do present claims upon which relief could be granted, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-18\">Utilizing vehicles registered in his wife\u2019s name, Cowan operated a wrecker service in Montgomery County, Texas, a county just north of Houston. According to the undisputed allegations in the pleadings, Montgomery County has a population of nearly 200,000, many of whom are employed in Houston, and is traversed by two major federal highways, Interstate Highway 45 and U.S. Highway 59. These highways carry substantial vehicular traffic, including trucks, buses, and automobiles in interstate travel. 1-45 and U.S. 59 are the major north-south traffic arteries in East Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">In September 1983, Sheriff Corley met with various persons operating wreckers in Montgomery County and proposed the formation of a trade association. As a consequence, the Montgomery County Wrecker Association was formed. Immediately thereafter, Sheriff Corley issued a set of 31 Emergency Wrecker Requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>requirements mandate that only members of the newly-formed association would be permitted to tow vehicles from public property. An initiation fee of $4,000 and annual dues of $150<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was established as were, <em>inter alia, </em>rules governing membership, insurance, grievances, and fee charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Cowan joined the association, paying the initiation fee and requisite dues. He was limited to three wreckers to be operated totally within a small area of Montgomery County. Other members, alleged to be favorites of Sheriff Corley, were not subjected to such restrictions. All wrecker assignments, including those made on an owner-preference basis were routed through the sheriffs office and the association\u2019s dispatcher. Cowan complained to Sheriff Corley that assignments were not being made on an even-handed basis. Because of this challenge, Cowan alleges that he was summarily expelled from the association without warning or hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Following his expulsion Cowan filed suit alleging that: (1) the actions of the sheriff, county officials, and the association and its representatives constituted a combination in restraint of trade in violation of federal antitrust laws; (2) their actions, as a pattern of racketeering activity, constituted a violation of RICO; and (3) their actions deprived him of his constitutional rights, contrary to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">As noted, certain defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6), alternatively seeking summary judgment. In granting the motion to dismiss, the district court concluded that Cowan had not established a jurisdictional basis for the antitrust claims, had not shown a pattern of racketeering activity, and had not shown the deprivation of a right secured by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALF\">1. <em>The antitrust claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">Cowan\u2019s antitrust claims are based on sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> legislation adopted pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Conduct deemed violative of that Act must have a substantial connexity to interstate commerce. In dismissing the complaint the district court found such a nexus absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">We are mindful that Cowan has the burden of establishing the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the antitrust claim. <em>McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., </em>444 U.S. 232, 100 S.Ct. 502, 62 L.Ed.2d 441 (1980); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Hillman, </em>796 F.2d 770 (5th Cir.1986). The pleadings suffice for this purpose. Cowan\u2019s complaint directly involves vehicular travel on two major federal highways in Montgomery County. The district court concluded that the providing of wrecker service to traffic on these traffic arteries did not bear a sufficient relationship to interstate commerce to implicate federal antitrust laws. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">In enacting the Sherman Act, Congress exercised the full panoply of power authorized by the Commerce Clause. <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Mid-cal Aluminum, Inc., </em>445 U.S. 97, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980). And as the Supreme Court elucidated in <em>McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., </em>444 U.S. at 241, 100 S.Ct. at 508, <em>citing Wickard v. Filbum, </em>317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe broad au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>thority of Congress under the Commerce Clause has, of course, long been interpreted to extend beyond activities actually <em>in </em>interstate commerce to reach other activities that, while wholly local in nature, nevertheless substantially <em>affect </em>interstate commerce.\u201d The <em>McLain </em>court applied the Sherman Act to a real estate brokerage operation, a quintessentially local activity, declaring that for the establishment of federal jurisdiction \u201cthere remains only the requirement that respondents\u2019 activities which allegedly have been infected by a price-fixing conspiracy be shown \u2018as a matter of practical economics\u2019 to have a not insubstantial effect on the interstate commerce involved.\u201d 444 U.S. at 246,100 S.Ct. at 511. Applying this expansive standard, and after surveying similar relevant cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we conclude that the Sherman Act is applicable to the scenario alleged by Cowan.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">It cannot be gainsaid that travel to and through Texas involves interstate commerce. Actions directly related to the competitive pricing, marketing, and furnishing of towing services to the interstate vehicular movement of people and goods through Montgomery County, substantially affect interstate commerce. It is within the power of Congress to eradicate or dampen activities which pose a threat to the free flow of any aspect of interstate commerce, including that which might appear to be totally local in nature. <em>See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, </em>379 U.S. 241, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964); <em>Katzenbach v. McClung, </em>379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964). Cowan\u2019s complaint alleges a sufficient intrusion into the interstate marketplace to implicate the Sherman Act. The district court has jurisdiction to hear this claim and the pleadings advance a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">2. <em>The RICO claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Cowan\u2019s complaint alleges that the manner in which the Montgomery County Wrecker Association was formed and operated, the initiation and periodic dues, the restrictions imposed on his business operation, the refusal of the defendants to consider his complaints, and his expulsion from the association without the semblance of due process, all constitute a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962. Citing <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), the district court found that Cowan had not alleged a pattern of racketeering activity, but rather relied on alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 1952(b)(2). The trial court concluded that \u201ctwo isolated acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u201cA pattern of racketeering activity is defined as at least <em>two </em>acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred within ten years after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Carlock, </em>806 F.2d 535, 542 (5th Cir.1986); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5). As <em>Sedima </em>teaches, two acts of racketeering activity may constitute a RICO pattern, but such will not always be the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">Indeed, in common parlance two of anything do not form a \u201cpattern.\u201d As the Senate Report explained: \u201cThe target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one \u2018racketeering activity\u2019 and the threat of continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of <em>continuity plus relationship </em>which combines to produce a pattern.\u201d S.Rep. No. 91-617, p. 158 (1969)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\"><em>Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d at 358 n. 14 (emphasis by Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>We read this language in <em>Sedima </em>to direct a narrower definition of pattern than had been sometimes employed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consistent therewith, the district court correctly concluded that two illegal acts will not constitute a RICO pattern in every instance. In the case at bar, however, Cowan\u2019s complaint contains not only allegations of the two specific alleged criminal acts, but a litany of other predicate acts involved in the formation, organization, and operation of the association, including the manner of the organization, the setting and use of dues, the allocation of wrecker business, his expulsion from the association, and the concomitant exclusion from all wrecker calls originating on public property, calls which purportedly are the source of most wrecker business. Assuming without deciding that some of these acts were criminal violations, the combination of these activities suffices to constitute a pattern within the intendment of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As with the antitrust claims, RICO must relate to interstate commerce. But the connexity required is minimal. <em>R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt, </em>774 F.2d 1350 (5th Cir.1985). As reflected in our discussion of the antitrust claims, adequate interstate involvement was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">3. <em>The \u00a7 1983 claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The district court concluded that Cowan had not alleged a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, observing that Cowan had not asserted a liberty interest violation. Although the pleadings claim a property interest violation, the factual allegations upon which the categorization is based directly relate to both property and liberty interests. The essence of Cowan\u2019s complaint is that he has been denied the opportunity to pursue his livelihood. That is a constitutionally protected interest. As we held in <em>Phillips v. Vandygriff, </em>711 F.2d 1217, 1222 (5th Cir.1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">\u2018It requires no argument to show that the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [fourteenth] Amendment to secure.\u2019 <em>Truax v. Raich, </em>239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 7, 10, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915). <em>See also Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923) (\u201cWithout doubt, [\u2018liberty\u2019 in the fourteenth amendment] denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life____\u201d); <em>Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, </em>353 U.S. 232, 238-39, 77 S.Ct. 752, 756, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957) (\u201cA state cannot exclude a person from the practice of law or from any other occupation in a manner or for reasons that contravene the Due Process or Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Greene v. McElroy, </em>360 U.S. 474, 492, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 1411, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959) (\u201c[T]he right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within the \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018property\u2019 concepts of the Fifth Amendment____\u201d); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573-74, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2707, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (respondent denied relief because \u201c[t]he State, for example, did not invoke any regulations to bar the respondent from all other public employment in state universities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Had it done so, this, again, would be a different case.\u201d). This Circuit has also repeatedly acknowledged the principle that a person has a liberty interest in pursuing an occupation. <em>See, e.g., Ferrell v. Dallas Independent School District, </em>392 F.2d 697, 707 (5th Cir.1968); <em>Shaw v. Hospital Authority, </em>507 F.2d 625, 628 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Daly v. Sprague, </em>675 F.2d 716, 727 (5th Cir.1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><em>See also Bacon v. Patera, </em>772 F.2d 259 (6th Cir.1985), upholding a \u00a7 1983 claim against a police chief for allegedly harassing private security guards who did not seek commissions from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">As our holding in <em>Phillips </em>makes clear, the right to engage in the occupation of one\u2019s preference is not absolute. Within the strictures of due process both property and liberty interests may be constrained. Ultimately, that may prove to be the situation in the matter now before us. On that we express no opinion. But dismissal at this stage on the basis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">APPENDIX \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"APji\">Effective JANUARY 17, 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">1.
