Spurney, Stack and their three insurance companies, based on alleged intentional misrepresentations and negligence relating to the promotion of the Louisiana World\u2019s Fair. Both the original and first amended complaint <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed in the above case are, as conceded by appellants, virtually identical to the complaints previously found legally insufficient in the <em>Hot Boudin Company, Inc. and Ray Manning v. Harrison Price Company, Inc., </em>et al, 800 F.2d 1143 (5th Cir.1986) and <em>1884 Shop, Inc. v. Harrison Price Company, Inc., </em>et al, 813 F.2d 406 (5th Cir.1987). Counsel in each of the three cases is the same. We dismissed the appeal in <em>1884 Shop </em>as frivolous, based on the prior controlling authority of the <em>Hot Boudin Company, Inc. </em>and <em>Unimobil, Inc. v. Spurney, </em>797 F.2d 214 (5th Cir.1986). We further advised counsel in the second appeal that only the court en banc could overrule prior panel opinions and that \u201cany future app\u00e9als of cases based on the <em>Hot Boudin </em>pleadings will not be so generously treated\u201d as to avoid an award of sanctions. Counsel nevertheless continues to plow the same ground in both the district and appellate courts, but she has concurrently filed with the instant case a motion for en banc review of <em>Hot Boudin </em>and <em>Unimobil. </em>No judge in regular active service has seen fit to request an en banc poll, and the motion is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-22\">Because counsel took this precautionary step, we decline to award sanctions for a frivolous appeal, only because our prior opinion may be read to have suggested this course as a safe harbor for plaintiff\u2019s counsel. There are no more safe harbors on the issues raised by this appeal, however. The defendants have been required to appeal too many times. Any further action before this Court in this case or similar cases will result in an award of sanctions against plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and/or her clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-23\">The judgment of the district court, dismissing this case as to defendants Spurney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Stack, and the three insurance companies is AFFIRMED. The motion for en banc hearing is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-20\">. Appellants' counsel sought to amend the defective pleadings literally on the eve of the district court hearing to reconsider dismissal on the pleadings. We are unsure of the status of the proposed amended pleading, which added a new defendant. We note, however, that the allegations of the amended pleading do not resuscitate the earlier pleadings, being almost exclusively on the conduct of the new defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
