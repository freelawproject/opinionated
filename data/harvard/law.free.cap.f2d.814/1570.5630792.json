Though that section was repealed by \u00a7 805(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, the repeal was effective as of December 31, 1986 and, hence, is inapplicable to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Claims Court granted summary judgment for the government and denied partial summary judgment for Beneficial. We reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Beneficial is an accrual basis taxpayer in the consumer finance business and keeps its books on a calendar year basis. In the course of its business, Beneficial makes long term loans that are not always paid back. Section 166(c) of the IRC allowed a deduction for such losses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac8Q\">\u00a7 166. Bad debts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abr\">(a) General rule</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-17\">(1) Wholly worthless debts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-18\">There shall be allowed as a deduction any debt which becomes worthless within the taxable year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-19\">(2) Partially worthless debts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-20\">When satisfied that a debt is recoverable only in part, the Secretary may allow such debt, in an amount not in excess of the part charged off within the taxable year, as a deduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-22\">* * * # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-23\">(c) Reserve for bad debts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a_i-dedup-0\">In lieu of any deduction under subsection (a), there shall be allowed (in the discretion of the Secretary) a deduction for a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-24\">Section 166(a) prescribed a specific charge-off method for bad debts that actually became worthless, and were charged off on the taxpayer\u2019s books, in the taxable year. Under that section, the amount of deduction reflected the actual charge-off experience during the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-25\">In lieu of a deduction for specific bad debts incurred during the taxable year, \u00a7 166(c) allowed an accrual basis taxpayer to establish a reserve for bad debts and to deduct reasonable additions thereto. The reserve approximated loan amounts presently outstanding but expected to be uncol-lectable in the future. Each year, the proper amount of reserve was redetermined, and a reasonable addition to the reserve balance necessary to bring it up to the proper level was deductible, subject to the Secretary\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-26\">Beneficial utilized the reserve method of \u00a7 166(c). On audit of Beneficial\u2019s tax returns for 1976 and 1977, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) found that Beneficial\u2019s reserve level reflected an amount exceeding those bad debts reasonably expected to be written off in the next succeeding year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>As a result, the IRS disallowed Beneficial\u2019s additions to its bad debt reserve. Instead, it applied the <em>\u201cBlack Motor </em>formula,\u201d which is based on the methodology used in <em>Black Motor Co. v. Commissioner, </em>41 B.T.A. 300 (1940), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>125 F.2d 977 (6th Cir.1942).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The Commissioner\u2019s application of the <em>Black Motor </em>formula resulted in Beneficial having deficient tax obligations of $16,037,-089 and $4,641,296 for 1976 and 1977, respectively. The difference stems basically from Beneficial including in its reserve all outstanding debts presently expected to become worthless in the next and succeeding years. In contrast, <em>Black Motor </em>focuses on outstanding debts expected to become worthless in the next succeeding year only. Beneficial paid the resulting deficiencies and filed timely claims for refund pursuant to \u00a7 6511 of the IRC. After its claims for refund were disallowed by the IRS, Beneficial filed this action for refund in the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The Claims Court, in granting the government\u2019s summary judgment motion and denying Beneficial\u2019s partial summary judgment motion, weighed heavily the discretion expressly granted the Commissioner in \u00a7 166(c). Stating that Beneficial has a \u201cheavy burden\u201d of proof, the Claims Court held that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in using the <em>Black Motor </em>formula to calculate reasonable addition to bad debt reserve. That formula, reasoned the Claims Court, has been in existence for many years and approved in numerous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Beneficial argues that, where the outstanding receivables have an average maturity substantially in excess of one year, the current reserve should be large enough to cover those receivables expected to be charged off in later years as well as those receivables expected to be written off in the next succeeding year. Beneficial maintains that the Commissioner\u2019s discretion in \u00a7 166(c) pertained to choosing those who should be eligible for that section or approving the accuracy of figures used, but that it did not allow the Commissioner to change the concept of \u201creserve for bad debts\u201d so that it would reflect projected losses only in the next year. Beneficial urges that a bad debt reserve by its nature accounts for an \u201cimpairment to capital,\u201d and if it is reasonably certain that some portion of the outstanding loans will never be recovered\u2014whether in the next or succeeding years\u2014that amount of taxpayer\u2019s capital has been presently impaired because it is for all practical purposes forever lost.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The government does not challenge the accuracy of Beneficial\u2019s projected losses beyond the next year. Instead, it contends that the statute expressly gave the Commissioner discretion to allow a deduction for a reasonable addition to a bad debt reserve and that the Commissioner did not abuse that discretion in focusing only on next year\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">Whether the Commissioner\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 166(c) allowed him, when assessing \u201creasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts,\u201d to focus only on that portion of outstanding debts expected to become worthless in the next taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">Normally, the Commissioner had great discretion under \u00a7 166(c) in determining a \u201creasonable\u201d addition to a reserve for bad debts. The Commissioner\u2019s determination of a reasonable addition had to be sustained unless the taxpayer proved that the Commissioner abused that discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number><em>Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, </em>439 U.S. 522, 99 S.Ct. 773, 58 L.Ed.2d 785 (1979); <em>Paramount Finance Co. v. United States, </em>157 Ct.Cl. 824, 304 F.2d 460 (1962). As stated by the Claims Court in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aae-dedup-0\">It is clear from the language of the statute that a taxpayer has an absolute right to choose to deduct his worthless debts when they are ascertained to be worthless [Section 166(a)], but if, instead, he chooses to deduct additions to a reserve, he subjects himself to a reasonable and discretionary review of the additions to the reserve [Section 166(c) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We agree with the Claims Court that deductions based on reserves are rarely permitted under the IRC and that, when Congress makes an exception to that rule but explicitly conditions the exception upon the Commissioner\u2019s discretion, the condition <em>(i.e., </em>the Commissioner\u2019s discretion) \u201cis as important as the permission.\u201d <em>Krim-Ko Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>16 T.C. 31, 37 (1951). However, undue expansion of that condition beyond its legitimate scope would improperly circumvent congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">\n<em>Congressional Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Section 166 itself did not define \u201creserve for bad debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Beneficial introduced expert testimony supporting an established, commonly accepted definition of that phrase in the accounting world in 1921, the time of enactment of \u00a7 166(c). That definition is inconsistent with the \u201cnext-year only\u201d focus of the government. The government\u2019s focus, Beneficial argues, is inconsistent with the concept of a reserve, which is to reduce the amount of accounts or lower receivables to what will ultimately be collected. Indeed, Beneficial argues, not only is the 1921 accounting concept still with us today but the government\u2019s focus on \u201cnext-year only\u201d is unknown in accounting theory and practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The government does not dispute that there was a well established, commonly accepted meaning of \u201creserve for bad debts\u201d in the accounting field at the time of enactment of \u00a7 166(c). Indeed, the government does not even contend that a competing meaning of \u201creserve for bad debts\u201d existed at that time. Instead, the government argues that the meaning of \u201creserve,\u201d as established for purposes of business accounting, is inconsistent with the notion of annual accounting in tax law, that Congress did not intend to adopt the accountant\u2019s meaning of \u201creserve for bad debts,\u201d and that the Commissioner\u2019s discretion expressly conferred by statute, as well as a demonstrated legislative concern for the fisc, overrides that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">We take as uncontested this fact: at the time of enactment of \u00a7 166(c), the only acceptable meaning of \u201creserve for bad debts\u201d was the accounting concept urged by Beneficial. The Claims Court opinion does not reveal a genuine dispute on that fact; nor does the government contest it on appeal. Indeed, both parties filed summary judgment motions below, each urging no genuine disputes on material facts, and the government\u2019s summary judgment motion was granted by the Claims Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Given the accounting concept of \u201creserve for bad debts\u201d as the only approach in 1921, we find compelling Beneficial\u2019s argument that Congress intended to incorporate that concept into the statute. Though the government persuasively argues that accounting concepts do not always apply to income tax purposes, we conclude that in the present instance Congress intended to apply the accounting concept to the statute. It would be unreasonable to presume that Congress had adopted a statutory term, whose sole meaning was well established in the field, in a manner contrary to that established meaning without an explicit indication to that effect. Though \u00a7 166 gives the Commissioner discretion, that discretion was not to change the concept but to work with it, <em>e.g., </em>in determining which entities should be allowed to use it and in approving the various figures used.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>We are not unmindful that, in matters of statutory interpretation, the construction adopted by an agency charged with the duty to administer that statute, here the IRS, is usually given deference. <em>See, e.g., Young v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>476 U.S. 974, 106 S.Ct. 2360, 2364-65, 90 L.Ed.2d 959 (1986) (considerable deference); <em>Chevron U.S.A. v.

FCC, </em>453 U.S. 367, 382, 101 S.Ct. 2813, 2823, 69 L.Ed.2d 706 (1981); <em>Southern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 411, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979); <em>Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 566 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 790, 800 n. 20, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979); <em>NLRB v.

United States, </em>785 F.2d 994, 1001 (Fed.Cir.1986), if the agency interpretation \u201ccontravenes clearly discernible legislative intent\u201d or is otherwise unreasonable, it should not stand. For the reasons stated above, and below, the agency interpretation in this case perverts the intent of Congress and is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">\n<em>Case Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">As support for its \u201cnext-year only\u201d focus, the government has cited, and the Claims Court relied on, case law upholding the Commissioner\u2019s application of the <em>Black Motor </em>formula to calculate a reasonable addition to a taxpayer\u2019s bad debt reserve under \u00a7 166(c). <em>See, e.g., Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, </em>439 U.S. 522, 99 S.Ct. 773, 58 L.Ed.2d 785 (1979); <em>S.W. Coe &amp; Co. v. Dallman, </em>216 F.2d 566 (7th Cir.1954); <em>Atlantic Discount Co. v. United States, </em>473 F.2d 412 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Roth Steel Tube Co. v. Commissioner, </em>620 F.2d 1176 (6th Cir.1980); <em>Paramount Finance Co. v. United States, </em>157 Ct.Cl. 824, 304 F.2d 460 (1962); <em>Ehlen v. United States, </em>163 Ct.Cl. 35, 323 F.2d 535 (1963); <em>James A. Messer Co. v. Commissioner, </em>57 T.C. 848 (1972); <em>Valmont Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>73 T.C. 1059 (1980); <em>Time Acceptance, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>49 T.C.M. (CCH) 1186 (1985), <em>aff'd., </em>787 F.2d 587 (5th Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">None of those cases, however, involved a taxpayer having accurate estimates on existing debts of loan losses beyond the next succeeding year, and hence, in none of those cases was the court asked to decide whether the Commissioner must consider such accurate figures in calculating the allowable deduction under \u00a7 166(c). Consequently, those cases do not represent a rejection of Beneficial\u2019s position in this case, <em>i.e., </em>using future losses beyond next year when they are accurately presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">The government relies on <em>Investors Discount Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>48 T.C. 767 (1967), in which the Tax Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\">The essential question to be determined in establishing an addition to a bad debt reserve is whether, looking at the factual situation as it exists at the end of the taxable year, the reserve is sufficient to absorb the bad debts that are anticipated during the subsequent taxable year. The fact that feared contingencies may arise in a later period, although possibly justifying an accumulation of surplus from the viewpoint of sound business management, does not justify the type of reserve contemplated by section 166. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>deed, the manner in which the amount of the deduction is calculated reveals that the anticipated losses for the following year is the focal point of inquiry. The amount in the reserve is reexamined annually in order to determine the amount of the addition required. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Though that language supports the \u201cnext-year only\u201d focus of the government, the suspected future losses in <em>Investors Discount Corp. </em>appear to have been more speculative than the future loss figures presented by Beneficial here. In any event, the Sixth Circuit in <em>Thompson v. Commissioner, </em>761 F.2d 259 (6th Cir.1985), expressly rejected the view articulated in <em>Investors Discount Corp. </em>We fully adopt the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The petitioner in <em>Thompson </em>desired to deduct under the reserve method of \u00a7 166(c) an amount representing a reasonable estimate of potential worthlessness of its outstanding loans, apparently without regard to whether such worthlessness will be realized in the next succeeding year. The Commissioner, on the other hand, insisted on application of the <em>Black Motor </em>formula to calculate the amount of deduction. Citing <em>Investors Discount Corp., </em>the Commissioner argued that \u201c \u2018[t]he essential question to be determined in establishing an addition to a bad debt reserve is whether, looking at the factual situation as it exists at the end of the taxable year, the reserve is sufficient to absorb the bad debts that are anticipated during the subsequent taxable year.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court, however, rejected that argument</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AClb\">We decline to follow the dictum in <em>Investors Discount. </em>There is no indication in the statute that bad debts can be reserved only one year in advance. To the contrary, the whole theory of the provision is that bad debts may be deducted when a loan is made or a receivable is taken into income, notwithstanding the fact that the character of the individual debts may not become evident for many years. The year end reserve therefore is calculated as the amount that can be expected to cover losses properly anticipated, whenever occurring, on all the debts outstanding at the end of the tax year. <em>See Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, </em>439 U.S. 522, 546, 99 S.Ct. 773, 788, 58 L.Ed.2d 785 (1979). No other case has followed <em>Investors Discount, </em>and its authority for the proposition instead refers to subsequent years. <em>Krim-Ko Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>16 T.C. 31, 37 (1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">761 F.2d at 268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">The Claims Court refused to adopt <em>Thompson </em>as a \u201cguiding light for this case.\u201d It distinguished <em>Thompson </em>as a case where, under the particular facts present, the taxpayer was able to rebut the \u201cpresumptive reasonableness\u201d of the <em>Black Motor </em>formula. In <em>Thompson, </em>stated the Claims Court, the taxpayer\u2019s year-end receivables fluctuated drastically. Its yearly sales were dropping but its accounts receivable were rising. Hence, stated the Claims Court, \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s average loss experienced from accounts receivable failed to adequately reflect actual losses.\u201d Here, however, states the Claims Court, \u201cplaintiff had no unusual loss experience with which to rebut the application of the <em>Black Motor </em>formula.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">We disagree with the Claims Court. We do not believe that <em>Thompson </em>can be distinguished on its facts. The language quoted above from <em>Thompson </em>broadly condemns the rationale of <em>Investors Discount Corp. </em>and clearly states that losses should be those of future years with no limitation to one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">Other cases, though not directly confronting the issue, indicate in dicta that the focus is on all future losses. For example, the Supreme Court in <em>Nash v. United States, </em>398 U.S. 1, 2, 90 S.Ct. 1550, 1550, 26 L.Ed.2d 1 (1970), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-13\">Under the reserve method of accounting a taxpayer includes in his income the full face amount of a receivable on its creation and adjusts at the end of each taxable year the reserve account so that it equals that portion of current accounts receivable that is estimated to become worthless in <em>future years. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number><em>Merchants Industrial Bank v.

United States, </em>the Supreme Court refers to the reserve method of accounting by \u00a7 166(c) and says that the year-end adjustment equals that portion of the receivables \u2018estimated to become worthless in future years.\u2019 The use of the plural rejects the concept that the adjustment takes into consideration only the next taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\"><em>See also Thor Power Tool Co. v.

Ct. 1061, 4 L.Ed.2d 1011 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">\n<em>Other Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"atl-dedup-0\">We have carefully considered the government\u2019s other arguments, and the Claims Court\u2019s rationale stated in its opinion, but we are not persuaded by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">For example, the government argues that it would be inconsistent to permit a deduction immediately for losses anticipated in all future years while taxing the interest income from outstanding loans only from year to year as they become due. Beneficial\u2019s \u201cfuture-years\u201d focus, the government urges, is inconsistent with the concept of annual tax accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">We are not persuaded that such inconsistencies exist. The accounting notion of a bad debt reserve is based on \u201cimpairment to capital.\u201d If it is reasonably certain that an outstanding debt will ultimately be un-collectable, that amount of debt is deemed worthless immediately. The taxpayer has constructively suffered a present loss because it will never be repaid the money it has loaned. We do not see how taxing interest in the year due is inconsistent with that. Moreover, proper additions to reserve, with appropriate adjustments, are calculated each year\u2014certainly consistent with annual tax accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU2\">The government argues that Beneficial\u2019s approach created a clear, practical disadvantage for banking institutions that were separately restrained, under \u00a7\u00a7 585(b)(3) and 593(b)(1)(A) and (4) of the IRC, to loan losses occurring in the next succeeding year. Even if that disadvantage existed, it is not our job to correct it. We merely construe the statute to see what was intended. If, of course, a practical problem bears on the issue of Congressional intent, we will consider it when construing the statute. But, courts are not at liberty to construe statutory language contrary to its meaning merely because its practical effects are undesirable. Correcting those effects is up to Congress. Indeed, as indicated at the outset of this opinion, \u00a7 166(c) has been repealed by \u00a7 805(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Now, the reserve method of accounting for bad debts is available only to certain institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. <em>See </em>\u00a7 901 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, amending 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-13\">. Reference to the IRC throughout this opinion is to the tax code prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-14\">. The deductible addition equalled the appropriate level of the reserve at the end of the year minus an adjusted level of the reserve balance at the beginning of the year. The adjusted level of the reserve at the beginning of the year eq-ualled the level of the reserve at the beginning of the year minus bad debts actually charged off during the year plus amounts actually recovered during the year on debts previously charged off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">. Under that formula one: (1) computes an average percentage based on bad debts for the current and five preceding tax years divided by the accounts and notes receivable outstanding; (2) multiplies the percentage by the receivables outstanding at the end of the current tax year, thereby giving the \"loss reserve\u201d; (3) adds the charges to the reserve during the current tax year, thereby giving the \"total reserve requirement\u201d; and (4) subtracts the balance in the reserve at the end of the preceding tax year. The resulting amount is the deductible addition to the bad debt reserve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b823-16\">. Beneficial adds that, if any part of that impairment is subsequently recovered, corresponding adjustments are made to reflect the reduction in impairment. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b824-11\">. <em>Compare Mingus Constructors v. United States, </em>812 F.2d 1387, 1391, (Fed.Cir.1987) (a party filing an unsuccessful summary judgment motion below is not necessarily estopped from arguing on appeal (from an order granting its opponent\u2019s summary judgment motion) the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b827-10\">. Beneficial filed a motion for partial, not complete, summary judgment because, it contends, there may still be minor computational issues remaining in the case. The case is remanded for the Claims Court to address any such issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
