The order at issue was granted in response to appellee\u2019s petition to increase the support payments for her child until the child reached age eighteen. That order, though not specific, was intended to continue at least until the child was seventeen years and three months old, and more likely until her eighteenth birthday. Under either view, reliance was clearly placed on the District of Columbia support laws <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and not on the earlier divorce decree which provided for support only until age seventeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">Finally, even if for some reason the 1961 order was based on the divorce decree, the contention that it was res judicata as to the child support is unfounded. It is well settled that \u201ca decree for child support is res judicata only as long as the circumstances remain the same as when the decree was rendered.\u201d 24 Am. Jur.2d Divorce &amp; Separation \u00a7 846, p. 959 (1966). Here it is undisputed that some circumstances, <em>id est, </em>the child\u2019s need and the appellant\u2019s ability to pay, had changed materially since the divorce was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1035-20\">. The Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (enacted both in Michigan and in the District of Columbia) makes duties of support enforeible if \u201cimposed under the laws of any State in which the defendant was present during the period for which support is sought * * D.C.Code \u00a7 30-304 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
