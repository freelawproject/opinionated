Kanas was inducted into the Army on June 28, 1967. His father, Matthew Kanas, petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, on his son\u2019s behalf, for a writ of habeas corpus. The application claimed that Stuart\u2019s induction was unlawful because he was a cantor employed by a Jewish congregation in Pennsylvania, and thus entitled to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>emption from the draft as a \u201cminister of religion.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 29, following a hearing, Judge Dooling denied the writ, but stayed his order pending this court\u2019s review. We reverse. The writ releasing Stuart M. Kanas from the Army is granted without prejudice to any reclassification his local board finds proper following a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">From September 1961 until June 1966, the registrant was a student at the Hebrew Union College \u2014 Jewish Institute of Eeligion, School of Sacred Music in New York. There, while he studied to become a cantor, he enjoyed a II-S deferment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a June 1962 letter to the local board, the Hebrew Union College described the registrant\u2019s program and the College\u2019s goal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">The program of studies in which Mr. Kanas is currently enrolled * * * requires five full years of attendance and leads to the degree of Bachelor of Sacred Music and diploma as Cantor. Our graduates are trained to serve as qualified functionaries in conducting religious worship and other religious activities in synagogues of all denominations in Judaism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Upon graduation, the registrant received this degree and certification as a cantor. On June 24, 1966, the registrant notified his local board, No. 66 in Flushing, New York, of the change in his status, and told the board that he had been \u201celected as a resident clergyman\u201d by Congregation Melrose B\u2019nai Israel, a synagogue in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. On July 7, the Congregation informed the board that the registrant was employed \u201cfor an initial period of two years as Cantor and Musical Director of our Synagogue,\u201d and that the Cantor and his wife \u201chave taken residence close to the Synagogue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">The local board thereupon initiated reclassification procedures; it invited the registrant to appear at the next board meeting and to bring all information pertinent to his status. The board also sent him SSS Form 127, entitled \u201cCurrent Information Questionnaire.\u201d The registrant did not attend the meeting, but completed and returned the Form; on it he characterized his job as \u201cCantor\u201d and, in response to the request that he \u201cgive a brief statement of his duties,\u201d described them as \u201cPastoral duties, Conduct Worship Services, Teach children in Hebrew School.\u201d He also noted \u201cother occupational qualifications\u201d \u2014 \u201cPlay Saxophone &amp; Clarinet.\u201d On this record, without written opinion, the local board on August 10, 1966 unanimously classified registrant I-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">By letter to the local board dated August 14, 1966, the Congregation defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the position of \u201cReverend Cantor Kanas\u201d in more detail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">He is a regular minister of our Congregation, co-officiating with the Rabbi at all worship services. As a minister of our Congregation he also has the right to perform marriages and funerals and any other such ministerial duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Reverend Kanas is also a teacher of the principles of our faith in our Religious School and is director of all music at the synagogue, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">This letter was construed as an appeal by the registrant\u2019s employer from the I-A classification, see 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.2. The Government Appeal Agent also appealed. The latter referred to the Congregation\u2019s letter, and then stated his \u201cstrong personal belief\u201d that IV-D should and does include cantors, because they are \u201cvitally needed as an instrument of the Jewish religion and its observance.\u201d He also thought that IV-D should include \u201clesser officers than merely ministers and priests in other religions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In January 1967, the New York City appeal board, two to one, upheld the I-A classification. The board found that registrant\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d vocation was that of \u201cCantor and Musical Director,\u201d and that \u201cby far the major portion of his time\u201d was spent in that capacity. Moreover, \u201cmost, if not all, of his claimed ministerial functions involve, in major degree, the exercise of his ability and qualifications as Cantor.\u201d The board concluded, without more explanation, that these ministerial functions in his role as cantor were \u201cmore or less irregular and incidental to his duties as Cantor and Musical Director.\u201d The board also noted the apparent \u201cconcession\u201d of the Appeal Agent that cantors were not presently within the IV-D exemption, and refused to act in a manner which might enlarge the class of those eligible for IV-D. An appeal to the President was unavailing, and the registrant\u2019s induction in June 1967 followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Judicial review of Selective Service determinations is severely limited; only if there exists \u201cno basis in fact\u201d for a classification will a court interfere. See United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), quoting from Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-123, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946); Cox v. United States, 332 U.S. 442, 452-453, 68 S.Ct. 115, 92 L.Ed. 59 (1947).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This does not mean, however, that a local board is free to disbelieve all evidence in the record in the absence of any impeaching or contradictory material.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">The task of the courts in cases such as this is to search the record for some affirmative evidence to support the local board's overt or implicit finding that a registrant has not painted a complete or accurate picture of his activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\n<em>******</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">But when the uncontroverted evidence supporting a registrant\u2019s claim places him prima facie within the statutory exemption, dismissal of the claim soler ly on the basis of suspicion and speculation is both contrary to the spirit of the Act and foreign to our concepts of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 396-397, 74 S.Ct. 152, 157-158, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">We have carefully searched the record before us, and have set out its relevant portions above. We note that there is no intimation in the record that the registrant is not in fact performing full time the duties for which the congregation hired him. Moreover, the basic facts in the record appear undisputed. We find that the registrant made out a prima facie case for classification IV-D and that there is no affirmative evidence to rebut his claim. We make these findings with full awareness that the registrant must bear the burden of establishing his right to an exemption, and that the ministerial exemption is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>narrow one. See Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. at 394-395, 74 S.Ct. 152 at 157-158; 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The only Selective Service statement before us concerning the basis of the registrant\u2019s I-A classification is the appeal board\u2019s opinion. One possible interpretation of that opinion is that because registrant is a \u201cCantor and Musical Director\u201d his primary occupation is musical by definition. Consequently, the ministerial functions he performs are secondary and he does not qualify for a IV-D exemption. This theory constitutes a ruling that a person denominated \u201cCantor and Musical Director\u201d is per se not qualified. Judge Dooling did not so construe the action of the board, and we would also be loath to do so since each classification must be determined on its particular facts, not on the basis of any blanket characterization. See, e. g., United States ex rel. Hull v. Stalter, 151 F.2d 633, 637-638 (7th Cir. 1945). Moreover, we believe that at least in some instances cantors may qualify for IV-D.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is a surprising paucity of cases on the point; whether this shows that such exemptions are usually allowed, we simply do not know. In any event, the statute requires that a \u201cregular minister of religion\u201d be one who \u201cas his customary vocation preaches and teaches the principles of religion * * 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 466(g) (2). In <em>Dickinson, </em>the Supreme Court identified \u201cregularly, as a vocation, teaching and preaching the principles of his sect and conducting public worship in the tradition of his religion\u201d as the \u201cvital test\u201d of a registrant\u2019s claim. 346 U.S. at 395, 74 S.Ct. at 157. The legislative history of the ministerial exemption reveals that IV-D classification is intended \u201cfor the leaders of the various religious faiths and not for the members generally.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1268, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1948). We are aware that this standard was formulated with the particular problems of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in mind, but it seems likely that under this test the cantor described in Abraham A. Salkov, 46 T.C. 190 (1966), would qualify for IV-D exemption. To give the tenor of that decision, we quote from it briefly, 46 T.C. at 198:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">Regardless of the theoretical power of a Jewish layman, what in fact does Cantor Salkov do and what are his functions? He is a spiritual leader. He teaches. He performs pastoral duties. He is the minister-messenger of the Chizuk Amuno Congregation, commissioned and licensed by the congregation and by the Cantors Assembly of America to officiate professionally and regularly in the sacred religious service of the Jewish people. His functions are beyond any \u201cminister of music.\u201d * * * For long periods of both prayer and service he is the only person standing at the pulpit. At all times he and the rabbi share the pulpit. Historically and functionally he is a sui generis minister.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">We do not decide whether Stuart M. Kanas is such a cantor. But he cannot be denied IV-D solely on the ground that he is a \u201cCantor and Musical Director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">An alternative interpretation of the board\u2019s opinion, and the one adopted by the district court, is that the board found as a fact that the registrant\u2019s activities as a minister were merely \u201cirregular and incidental\u201d to his other functions, which it regarded as non-ministerial. The difficulty with this approach is that the distinction between the two types of activities is nowhere stated and, even if it were, there is a total lack of evidence to support any such breakdown. The record shows that the registrant co-officiates with the rabbi at services of worship, conducts funerals and, perhaps, marriages,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> teaches Jewish principes to chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>dren, and supervises all music at the synagogue. Nowhere is there any record support for an allocation of time between the admittedly ministerial duties, which the board found \u201cirregular and incidental,\u201d and the music supervision which the board apparently thought to be registrant\u2019s primary occupation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the record is totally devoid of any consideration whether the musical aspect of a cantor\u2019s work is, in fact, unrelated to preaching and teaching the principles of the faith. As already noted, \u201csuspicion and speculation\u201d cannot fill the need for some \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d to support the board\u2019s conclusion. See Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955). It seems to us that the registrant has made out a prima facie case at least equal to others that have been held sufficient, e. g., Batterton v. United States, 260 F.2d 233 (8th Cir. 1958); Schuman v. United States, 208 F.2d 801 (9th Cir. 1953); United States v. Scott, 137 F.Supp. 449 (E.D.Wis.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The board possesses broad investigative powers. It may subpoena any necessary witnesses, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1621.15, and invoke the facilities of local, state and national welfare and governmental agencies, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1621.14. Before this court, both parties referred to material which might have been helpful to the local board or the appeal board; e. g., appellant relied on <em>Salkov, </em>supra, which contains a detailed description of the functions of a cantor, and the Government brought to our attention a decision of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which incorporated the re-suits of a survey of leading authorities of the three major branches of Judaism.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In cases such as this, involving difficult determinations of whether a complex of activities are sufficient to qualify for IV-D status, placing informed opinions before the local or appeal boards in a proper manner would seem desirable. Cf. Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.S. 304, 67 S.Ct. 313, 91 L.Ed. 308 (1946); United States ex rel. Goodman v. Hearn, 153 F.2d 186 (5th Cir.) cert. granted, 328 U.S. 833, 66 S.Ct. 1375, 90 L.Ed. 1608, case dismissed, 329 U.S. 667, 67 S.Ct. 24, 91 L.Ed. 589 (1946); United States ex rel. Trainin v. Cain, 144 F.2d 944 (2d Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 795, 65 S.Ct. 439, 89 L.Ed. 635 (1945); United States ex rel. Levy v. Cain, 149 F.2d 338 (2d Cir. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">In view of our decision we need not consider the other bases of appeal or the propriety of Judge Dooling\u2019s action on the motions made below. One claim deserves mention, however. The appeal board emphasized a \u201cconcession\u201d made by the Government Appeal Agent; the registrant argues that under these circumstances he was denied due process because the Agent filed his handwritten appeal on the registrant\u2019s behalf without consulting with him at all. An appeal agent is called upon \u201cTo be equally diligent in protecting the interests of the Government and the rights of the registrant in all matters\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 a demanding if not impossible obligation. See Note, The Selective Service, 76 Yale L.J. 160, 168-169 (1966). It has been suggested that an appeal agent tends to identify with the local board<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that most regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>trants are unaware that his service is available to them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do not know whether these criticisms are accurate, but at least as to the latter, the Selective Service System now commendably provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">Whenever a local board places a registrant in * * * I-A * * * it shall, at the time the Notice of Classification * * * is mailed, also inform the registrant that the Government Appeal Agent is available to advise him on matters relating to his legal rights, including his right of appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">However, this does not deal with the problem presented here where apparently the registrant himself did not appeal (although his employer did) and the Appeal Agent took his own appeal in support of the registrant\u2019s position without consulting with him. Such a situation is probably unusual, but whether an appeal agent is protecting the interests of the Government or the rights of the registrant, it is essential that the registrant receive a copy of the memoranda submitted to the appeal board by the appeal agent and be given sufficient time in which to reply. In such a case, the registrant should be in no worse position than if he had taken his own appeal; in the latter event, he has the right to file a statement on his own behalf before the appeal board. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.12. \u201c[T]he right to file a statement before the Appeal Board includes the right to file a meaningful statement, one based on all the facts in the file and made with awareness of the recommendations and arguments to be countered.\u201d Gonzales v. United States, 348 U.S. 407, 415, 75 S.Ct. 409, 414, 99 L.Ed. 467 (1955). If a special theological panel had been set up to pass upon the validity of the registrant\u2019s claim to a IV-D exemption, he clearly would have had the right to examine its report in order to explain, correct, or deny it. Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.S. 304, 67 S.Ct. 313, 91 L.Ed. 308 (1946). A registrant should be given equal procedural safeguards when an appeal agent interposes his views as to a registrant\u2019s theological status.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">The writ of habeas corpus is granted and Stuart M. Kanas is ordered released forthwith from the Army, without prejudice to whatever further classification procedures may be in order within the Selective Service System. See United States v.
