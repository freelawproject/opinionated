Appellant Natick Broadcast Associates filed a complete application on May 10, 1965, which the Commission rejected for violation of its overlap rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant had relied on Figure M-3 data <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to compute the ground wave contours of its proposal, which data, if properly used, would demonstrate overlap between appellant\u2019s proposal and Station KYW, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Appellant, however, had made a mistake in its Figure M-3 data computation and its application showed no overlap violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Subsequently appellant retendered its application along with a petition for reconsideration. The retendered application included an engineering exhibit consisting of actual field intensity measurement data<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> demonstrating that overlap with KYW would not occur. The Commission denied appellant\u2019s request for reconsideration. We think the Commission\u2019s action was hypertechnical and arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">The original complete application filed by Natick on the cut-off day for a permit to construct a broadcast station at Na-tick, Massachusetts, did not violate the overlap rule. It is true the computation of the Figure M-3 data was in error. But the fact remains that when actual field intensity measurements were made the proposed station did not violate the overlap rule. The Commission apparently concedes this fact. If in fact Natick\u2019s proposed station is shown objectionably to violate the overlap rule, of course the application should be rejected. Otherwise a comparative hearing with the application filed by Home Service Broadcasting Corporation for the 1060-kilocy-cle frequency at Natick, Massachusetts, must be conducted.
