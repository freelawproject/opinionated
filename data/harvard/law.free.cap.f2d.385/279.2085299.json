ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">Convicted by a jury and sentenced on three re-tried counts <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging violations of federal narcotic drug laws,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant contends that the District Court erred in (a) refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment; (b) ruling that appellant\u2019s prior convictions could be used for purposes of his impeachment in the event that he testified; (c) permitting an undercover police officer, on the Government\u2019s rebuttal case, to contradict testimony given by a defense witness; and (d) denying appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal sought on the ground that parts of the officer\u2019s \u2022 testimony were uncorroborated. Our investigation of these claims, however, convinces us that the determinations to which they are addressed were correct. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">During 1964, Private William L. Hampton functioned as an undercover agent for the Narcotics Squad of the Metropolitan Police Department. An addict, George Pettas, cooperated in the venture by introducing Hampton to narcotics peddlers. Hampton and Pettas were the principal witnesses heard at appellant's trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">Hampton testified that on February 27, 1964, appellant approached a parked automobile occupied by Hampton and Pettas and asked whether they \"were looking,\" that is, if they were seeking narcotics. Receiving an affirmative response from Hampton, appellant inquired as to how many \"things,\" idiomatic for \"capsules,\" they desired, to which Hampton replied that he wanted ten. Appellant asked for the purchase price and was given $15 in special police department funds. He then left, returning a few minutes later to deliver to Hampton ten capsules filled with a white powder. Subsequent chemical analysis, according to other testimony for the Government, revealed the presence of heroin in five of the capsules but only talcum powder in the others.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AG\">Pettas, as a defense witness, gave a different version. Needing drugs himself on that date but lacking funds with which to buy them, he prepared ten \"blank\" capsules by filling them with talcum powder. Prior to any transaction with Hampton, Pettas engaged appellant in a conversation behind the parked car from which a scheme to obtain money from Hampton evolved. Pettas requested appellant, as a favor, to give him $15 and recoup it by selling the ten capsules to Hampton for that amount, stating that the capsules contained only talcum powder. Appellant agreed, gave Pettas $15, and thereafter sold the capsules to Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"Acb\">Instructions on the law of entrapment had been given at appellant's original trial. At the outset of retrial, the judge inquired as to whether that defense would be asserted. Appellant's counsel expressed his \"current thinking\" that the contention, rather than entrapment, would be that the transaction was \"just not a knowing possession or sale.\" <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the close of the evidence, however, counsel requested an \"entrapment\" instruction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at one point stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\"The jury could conceivably find that these were genuine narcotics, and that Pettas did do everything he said he would, but still knew, himself, that they were genuine, and was hoping to snag him to improve his own record.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">The trial judge denied the request, deeming the evidence insufficient to raise an entrapment issue. His charge, not otherwise objected to, informed the jurors that appellant could not be found guilty of any offense for which he was being tried unless at least some of the capsules contained a narcotic drug and unless appellant actually knew this to be the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">Counsel's \"entrapment\" request was supported by what appears to have been a suggestion of the familiar frame-up which, although involving essentially similar policy considerations, would in the circumstances of this case be some-</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>thing quite different.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Undoubtedly, in the context of a tense and fast moving criminal trial, this tended to produce confusion. Prom our reading of the transcript it seems possible that while counsel was endeavoring in the name of entrapment to request an instruction on frame-up, the trial judge, accepting the misnomer at face value, may have ruled on the request in the belief that it sought an instruction on entrapment. With conditions so odd, and in the interest of assuring full justice, we have examined the record in order to reassess the need for additional instructions pertaining to either entrapment or frame-up. We have concluded that, viewed in either aspect, the charge as given sufficed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We may assume, without deciding, that for purposes of an entrapment instruction, the jury might properly have found that appellant was induced by Pettas\u2019 entreaty to engage in a sale to Hampton which he was not predisposed to make,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that under the circumstances Pettas was a governmental representative within the meaning of the entrapment doctrine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nonetheless, an instruction on that subject was both unnecessary and improper unless there was an evidentiary basis for a finding that, entrapment aside, appellant was guilty of one or more of the offenses charged. The entrapment doctrine operates, not to negate a component of the offense, but to exonerate from criminal liability, because of overriding considerations, one who otherwise would be guilty of the offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Entrapment, as a legal phenomenon, comes into play only where all essential elements of the offense exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\"> Hampton\u2019s testimony alone did not occasion an instruction on entrapment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pettas\u2019 testimony could have established not only the inducement and lack of predisposition which make for the entrapment defense, but could also have nullified two essential elements of each of the offenses on trial. Given full credit, Hampton\u2019s testimony warranted conviction while Pettas\u2019 required acquittal. The trial judge\u2019s instructions amply covered those two alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">But the inquiry cannot halt here, for jurors ordinarily may, and frequently do, accept some but not all of the testimony related by particular witnesses. Where the situation is conducive, they may support a finding by parts of the testimony of two or more witnesses, and may resort to both prosecution and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>fense sources.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If, on such a pick-and-choose basis, the evidence permitted findings that appellant knew that one or more of the capsules contained a narcotic drug, but that he was nevertheless induced but was not predisposed to engage in the questioned transaction with Hampton, instructions on entrapment were in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">As already indicated, the Government\u2019s case made available an inference of knowledge without indicating inducement, while appellant\u2019s case reflected inducement but negated knowledge. Thus the question is whether the jury could have chosen evidentiary items from each in such fashion as to yield both inducement and knowledge. We answer, on this record, in the negative. We are led to this conclusion by the basic consideration that, despite the jury\u2019s broad authority in treating the proofs, the selective process must not be so attenuated as to strain credulity to the breaking point. Among the inquiries we deem relevant when the legitimacy of the process is at stake are whether there must be extensive picking and discarding of evidence, whether the ultimate finding necessitates fragmentation of testimony in such degree as to distort it, and whether facts not supported by proof must be supplied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">To conclude, on the evidence in this case, that appellant was entrapped, the jury would have had to find that Pettas approached appellant, conversed, with him, and induced him to sell to Hampton capsules some of which actually and to appellant\u2019s knowledge contained a narcotic substance. To do this, it would have had to reject Pettas\u2019 testimony that he filled all of the capsules with talcum powder, and accept Hampton\u2019s that he had not tampered with them as well as other Government evidence that five possessed a heroin content. It would have had to accept Pettas\u2019 testimony that he had a conversation with appellant, and reject Hampton\u2019s that Pettas never left the car. It would then have had to discard Pettas\u2019 testimony that he told appellant that the capsules contained talcum powder, while continuing to believe that the conversation took place. And, while accepting Pettas\u2019 testimony that there was a conversation, it would have had to throw out much of what was said during that conversation. In sum, it would have had to cancel and substitute from the testimony of Hampton and Pettas on a truly amazing scale.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">To have treated Pettas\u2019 testimony as somehow yielding an entrapment situation would have twisted it completely out of focus. Pettas testified to a transaction with appellant indivisible in theme and thrust \u2014 that he involved appellant in a scheme to defraud Hampton through the use of capsules which actually and to appellant\u2019s knowledge contained no narcotic drug. To have extracted from this version any indication that appellant knew of heroin in some of the capsules would have distorted his testimony into something which it clearly was not.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Additionally, in so doing, the jury would have had to supply information not forthcoming from the evidence. Pettas testified positively that he told appellant that the capsules contained only talcum powder. That the jury might discard chis statement would not license a finding that the very opposite was true.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And certainly the jury could not be permitted to speculate, without the slightest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>evidentiary basis, that appellant in some mysterious way learned that some of the capsules contained heroin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We are satisfied that an instruction on entrapment, properly spoken of, was not warranted in the circumstances of this case. Indeed, it would have served not only to mislead the jury but also to obscure a defense which some of the evidence tended to support \u2014 that appellant was framed by Pettas.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Appellant\u2019s real point, measured by his counsel\u2019s statement to the trial judge, was that the evidence warranted an instruction tailored to the contingency that the jury might find that Pettas, knowing that five of the capsules contained heroin, persuaded appellant to engage in the transaction with Hampton in the belief that no narcotic was present. There was ample evidence to support such a theory. Pettas testified that he turned ten capsules over to appellant. Hampton said appellant delivered ten capsules to him. The Government\u2019s evidence supported a finding that five of the capsules contained heroin. Other testimony in the case indicated that Pettas\u2019 reward for collaborating with Hampton was conditioned upon satisfaction with his work. Accepting this rather short chain of circumstances, a jury might conclude that Pettas put the heroin in the five capsules or at least knew of its presence and, with a view to enhancement of his record, framed appellant by inducing him to sell them to Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Where there is evidentiary support for special facts sustaining a rational defensive theory, to which the court\u2019s attention is specifically directed, the defendant is entitled to have the jury charged on that theory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However weak the evidence, however implausible the theory may appear to be, the matter is for the jury\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In Smith v. United States,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the evidence indicated that a special police employee may have \u201cplanted\u201d capsules on the defendant which, when found, formed the basis for his conviction. We held that the trial judge was obligated to honor the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction \u2014 there, as here, denominated \u201centrapment\u201d \u2014 adapted to the issue as framed. We said that the judge \u201cshould have submitted to the jury the question of whether or not this appellant was the victim of a \u2018frame-up\u2019 in the light of the background\u201d of the case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-20\">Similarly, an issue here was whether appellant was duped into unwittingly selling to a police officer heroin contained in capsules represented to contain nothing but talcum powder; in other words, an issue as to whether appellant was ignorant of the presence of the drug, a circumstance that would negate his guilt. The trial judge instructed, however, not only as to the essential elements of each of the three offenses, but also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-21\">\u201cThe Government has the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt, first, that the defendant Albert B. Brooke possessed and transferred to Officer Hampton capsules containing genuine narcotic drugs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-22\">\u201cSecond, that the defendant actually knew at that time that the capsules or some of them contained narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1i\">\u201cNow, you are instructed that knowledge is an essential element of each of the three offenses with which Albert B. Brooke is charged, that is, you may not find Albert B. Brooke guilty of any of these offenses unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was fully aware and understood that at least some of the capsules contained genuine narcotic drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Upon completion of the charge, appellant\u2019s counsel, while preserving the point earlier made, expressed satisfaction with what was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We think the charge as given adequately accommodated the issue to which counsel\u2019s request for an instruction was addressed. It informed the jury that, to authorize conviction, at least some of the capsules must have contained narcotic drugs and that appellant must have known that they did. Discarding the more glamorous but indecisive evidentiary details, these were the issues the request for the \u201centrapment\u201d instruction raised, and these the charge covered in clear and concise language shorn of unnecessary verbal embellishments. We hold that nothing more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">After Pettas had testified, appellant made known his desire to take the stand, and sought immunity under Luck v. United States<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> from impeachment by prior convictions of crime in the event that he did so. As the trial judge ascertained, appellant had several times been convicted on charges of selling narcotics.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The judge ruled that these convictions could be utilized for impeachment purposes, and appellant decided not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">In <em>Luck, </em>we delineated the discretionary exercise that motions of this type demand. v Impeachment of an accused by proof of past criminal violations remains a legitimate technique only so far as its probative importance on credibility justifies, in terms of the quest for truth, the inherent risk of prejudice on the issue of guilt. / Judicial wisdom, we said, must be brought to bear upon the situation evolving at trial if the balance is to be appropriately struck. The matter, however, remains one of discretion and, as we have recognized, \u201cthat discretion is to be accorded a respect appropriately reflective of the inescapable remoteness of appellate review.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">The diametrically opposed testimony of Hampton and Pettas furnished the backdrop against which the judge\u2019s determination had to be made. This conflict gave central importance to the fact that appellant proposed to relate to the jury substantially the same version previously narrated by Pettas,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and detachment of the embarrassing convictions from his testimony was calculated to artificially inflate its weight on the evidentiary scale. The judge\u2019s ruling reflects a considered judgment that with credibility so vital, the cause of truth was not likely to be advanced by permitting appellant to testify to events already delineated to the jury if facts germane to the reliability of that testimony were suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Convictions for crime retain statutorily <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> some degree of relevance to trustworthiness which <em>Luck </em>does not automatically dispel. On the contrary, <em>Luck </em>\u201cestablishes only that Congress, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>legislating to the effect that prior convictions may be used to impeach, left some room for the play of judicial discretion over the unfolding circumstances of the immediate trial. The alert and experienced trial judge presiding over a criminal case has a grasp of how the interests of justice are best served in the case taking shape before him.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The evaluation <em>Luck </em>requires invariably involves intangibles for which an appellate court\u2019s feel is nebulous at best. We do not disturb such highly discretionary adjudications unless the wisdom of doing so is very clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The trial judge carefully explored the matter and entertained extensive argument from appellant\u2019s counsel prior to ruling. So far as we can see, no irrelevance was permitted to invade the equation to contaminate the governing standard.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> And although appellant did not testify, Pettas\u2019 elaborate testimony filled amply what otherwise would have been an absence of proof to combat the inferences suggested by the circumstances.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We find no warrant to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The Government\u2019s case in chief left almost completely untouched the matter of any pre-sale conversation or transaction between appellant and Pettas. There was no inquiry whatever on Hampton\u2019s direct examination as to whether Pettas had left the automobile or had conversed with appellant before the sale occurred. During Hampton\u2019s lengthy cross-examination, there was but one question in that regard, and this elicited only a short answer to the effect that Pettas never got out of the car.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It was thereafter, of course, that Pettas testified elaborately to the conversation in the rear of the vehicle during which, he said, the capsules were passed and arrangements for their sale to Hampton were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">When, on rebuttal, the Government recalled Hampton, defense counsel objected to any testimony as to whether Pettas had left the automobile, urging as ground that during the Government\u2019s presentation Hampton had stated that he had not. The objection was overruled, whereupon the Government propounded a single question in response to which Hampton testified that he was certain that Pettas never got out of the car, and so did not converse with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">The admission and scope of rebuttal evidence are matters entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The conversation and concomitant transaction to which Pettas testified were evidentiary events as vital to the Government as to appellant. There was no occasion for the Government to investigate Pettas\u2019 claim until the defense brought it into the case. But when it did so, the Government was entitled to a fair opportunity to meet it, for which defense counsel\u2019s minuscule inquiry on Hampton\u2019s cross-examination can hardly be viewed as an adequate substitute. Pettas had testified, as a defense witness, to more than departing from the car; he had elaborated upon a conversation with appellant, the delivery of blank capsules to him, and an arrangement for their sale to Hampton. To contradict this testimony the Government could only have Hampton restate that Pettas never left the vehicle, and so could not have talked with appellant or passed blank capsules to him. This the Government did in about the briefest manner possible, and with only modest reiteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The lack of merit in appellant\u2019s present point thus becomes apparent when fully investigated. We perceive no error or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">YI</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We reach now appellant\u2019s final contention: that the conviction should be upset because it rests in some respects upon Hampton\u2019s uncorroborated testimony.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We are referred in this connection to Ross v. United States,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> but it is immediately evident that appellant\u2019s reliance upon that decision is grossly mistaken. Appellant presses no claim of unreasonable delay between the offenses and his arrest; the period here was only slightly longer than two months.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> He does not suggest mistaken identity; he conceded his participation in the transaction with Hampton, but insisted that it was non-criminal. Nor does he assert any loss of evidence or impairment of memory; indeed, he produced Pettas, who detailed the events on the offense date, and was himself prepared to do likewise if the specter of impeachment could have been dissipated.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In sum, all significant earmarks of <em>Ross </em>save non-corroboration of the undercover agent\u2019s testimony are conspicuously absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We held, prior to <em>Ross, </em>that a conviction for violation of the narcotic drug laws could be sustained upon the uncorroborated testimony of a narcotics agent,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and we have reaffirmed this principle since <em>Ross.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have decided, too, that jurors are not to be instructed that such testimony is to be suspiciously viewed or cautiously accepted.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The plain teaching of these decisions, read together, is that for purposes of credibility, weight, and legal sufficiency to support a conviction, testimony given by narcotics officers is to be tested by the same rules and considerations applicable to ordinary witnesses. The fact that it is the testimony of such an officer does not of itself entitle it to greater respect, but certainly does not relegate it to less.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-14\">. At his original trial, appellant was convicted on the first five of the seven counts of the indictment. After an appeal was taken, and on the Government\u2019s motion, we reversed the conviction on a ground unrelated to the present appeal and remanded the case for a new trial. Brooke v.
