He also charges that the indictment was fatally defective and that the District Court erred in holding to the contrary. Finally, he contends that the District Court erred in disposing of his petition to vacate his sentence without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>On review of the record we are of the opinion that the defendant\u2019s contentions are utterly without merit and that the District Court did not err in entering the Orders involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">For the reasons stated the Orders of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-23\">. In his motion for reconsideration the defendant also asked leave to amend his motion to vacate sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
