In June 1963 Atlantic filed a routine renewal application with the Federal Communications Commission and, in August 1964, petitioner Bethesda-Chevy Chase Broadcasters, Inc. applied for a construction permit to operate on the same frequency. Since the two applications were mutually exclusive, public notice was given of the cut-off date, De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>eember 18, 1964, set for filing additional applications. Also pending before the Commission, but not accepted for filing pending the conclusion of the Commission\u2019s clear channel proceedings, were two applications filed previously by Atlantic, one tendered in 1960 to increase its power from 250 watts to five kilowatts and one tendered with its renewal application in 1963 to change WUST\u2019s city designation from Bethesda, Maryland, to Washington, D. C,</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">No new applications were filed prior to the cut-off date, nor was any action taken on Atlantic\u2019s two modification applications. Subsequently, Atlantic amended its Washington application to increase its power to one kilowatt. The Commission then denied the Washington application because of its potential interference with clear channels, but at the same time, ruled that Atlantic\u2019s application to incr\u00e9ase its power in Bethesda was acceptable. At this time petitioner\u2019s application and Atlantic\u2019s applications for renewal and for increase of power to five kilowatts were designated for comparative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">When the Commission became aware that the contours of one kilowatt service from Washington would fall wholly within five kilowatt service from Bethesda and would therefore in fact cause less interference than the previously accepted five-kilowatt proposal, the Commission reversed its earlier decision and invited Atlantic to amend its renewal application with a change in city designation and an increase of power to one kilowatt. The Commission found that there was good cause to waive its procedural rules with respect to post-designation amendments, Section 1.522(b), 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.522(b) (Supp.1967), and consolidation of applications for hearings, Section 1.571(j) (1) and (c), 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.571 (j) (1) and (c) (Supp.1967). Petitioner objected to the Commission\u2019s order, claiming it effectively denied petitioner\u2019s substantive right to a comparative hearing. This order, and the Commission\u2019s denial of the request for reconsideration, provide the basis for this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Congress has conferred on this court jurisdiction to review only final orders of the Federal Communications Commission. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 (1965-66); Southland Industries v. Federal Communications Com\u2019n, 69 App.D.C. 82, 99 F.2d 117 (1938). Final orders are not limited to the last order issued in a proceeding, but to be final an order must \u201cimpose an obligation, deny a right or fix some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process.\u201d Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113, 68 S.Ct. 431, 437, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948). <em>See also </em>Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 86 L.Ed. 1563 (1942); Isbrandtsen Co. v. United States, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 293, 211 F.2d 51, <em>cert. denied, sub nom. </em>Japan-Atlantic &amp; Gulf Conference v. United States, 347 U.S. 990, 74 S.Ct. 852, 98 L. Ed. 1124 (1954). <em>Compare </em>Delta Air Lines v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 97 U.S. App.D.C. 46, 228 F.2d 17 (1955). The order in question here, the Commission\u2019s invitation to Atlantic to amend its application for hearing, does not impose an obligation, deny a right, or fix a legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">The consolidated hearing on the merits of the mutually exclusive applications of petitioner and Atlantic has not yet been held. If petitioner should ultimately prevail on the merits, the alleged error in allowing Atlantic to amend its application would not be prejudicial. If petitioner should not prevail, the decision today would not preclude a review of the Commission\u2019s action at such time as the court is presented with a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
