Appellant asserts continuous use since May 13, 1963. Registration is sought in class 23 which relates to cutlery, machinery and tools, and parts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Appellee is the registrant of \u201cBOREMATIC\u201d for machines for the precision finishing of holes or bores in parts of metal, fiber and like materials (Reg. No. 292,921, issued March 29, 1932; renewed), also in class 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Both parties rely on affidavits accompanied by exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">The record discloses that appellee is a large manufacturer of machine tools. Long prior to appellant\u2019s date of first use, appellee has used BORE-MATIC on many types of boring machines, one of which possesses characteristics the same as those of a lathe. In addition to the above products, appellee manufactures hydraulic cross slides and manual cross slides which serve as attachments for its BORE-MATIC machines. During .the period since 1931, appellee has expended $2,000,000 in advertising its BOREMATIC machines with sales amounting to $62,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">Appellant\u2019s proof, in material substance, is to the effect that it uses the registered mark SPEEDMASTER for spindle assembles for machine tools <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and BORMASTER for cross slide assemblies for metal working lathes. The spindle and cross slide assemblies are accessories for use on lathes which are sold under the mark AMCOT. The AMCOT lathes sell for approximately $50,000, and the BORMASTER cross slide assemblies sell for approximately $5,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">Priority of registration and use clearly reside with appellee. It is abundantly clear that the involved products are closely related and normally move through the same channels of trade to the same class of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">Appellant contends that, inasmuch as the only feature which the marks possess in common is the prefix \u201cBor\u201d or \u201cBore,\u201d which is in the public domain and possesses little trademark significance and, further, that the goods of the parties are expensive and sold only to a prudent and discriminating class of purchasers, confusion is not likely to occur in the market place.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">In sustaining the opposition, the board reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-22\">While the prefix \u201cBOR\u201d or \u201cBORE\u201d may be publici juris as applied to boring machines, we must still consider the marks of the parties in their entireties and, when so considered, we conclude that applicant\u2019s \u201cBORMAS-TER\u201d so resembles \u201cBORE-MATIC\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that, as applied to applicant\u2019s goods, there would be a likelihood of confusion or mistake. In so doing, we have given due consideration to applicant\u2019s argument that these products are sold to discriminating purchasers but do not believe that where, as here, the products of the parties are substantially the same, such factor is of controlling significance. See: In re Dobeckmun Company [286 F.2d 187, 48 CCPA 810] (1961). While there may be some elements of doubt as to whether confusion would be likely because of the highly suggestive nature of the marks of the parties, we follow the established practice of resolving any such doubts in favor of the first user. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We have considered the cases cited and relied on by appellant and the arguments advanced. We are persuaded, however, that the rationale employed by the court in the <em>Dobeckmun </em>case, 286 F.2d 187, 48 CCPA 810, is pertinent here and was correctly applied by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Here, as in <em>Dobeckmun, </em>we have closely related goods. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">The owner of the prior registered mark has the right to use his mark on such closely related goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">Similarity of the products of appellant and of registrant is of greater legal significance in applying Section 2 (d) than are the possible semantic differences * * *. Section 2(d) requires us to determine not whether the goods are identical but only whether applicant\u2019s mark so resembles the prior mark as to be likely when applied to its goods to cause confusion, or mistake, or to deceive purchasers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Even though we are dealing here with expensive goods which are purchased by discriminating and sophisticated purchasers, the marks and the goods on which they are used are sufficiently close as to raise the question of likelihood of confusion. While we agree with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that there may be some elements of doubt as to whether confusion would be likely in this particular situation, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the first user.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">Perceiving no reversible error in the decision of the board, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-23\">. 147 USPQ 533.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-24\">. Reg. No. 769,491, issued May 12, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b506-16\">RICH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AbN\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">In substance, all the majority opinion says by way of explaining why it affirms is that it agrees with the reasoning of the board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2**I cannot find in the board\u2019s opinion any rationalization of <em>why </em>it thought confusion would be likely. The opinion merely recites some of the stipulated facts <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and then states the conclusion that confusion is likely. No doubt the board based its conclusion on the obvious similarities of the marks <em>as a whole </em>and its holding that the goods are \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d It then cited In re Dobeckmun Co., 286 F.2d 187, 48 CCPA 810, which I consider no precedent for the result reached, even if we consider the goods to be <em>identical </em>in the sense of all being machine tools. Within that category, the goods are actually quite different. The true state of mind of the board seems to have been that it was in <em>doubt </em>about likelihood of confusion, out of which state it delivered itself by applying the old rule to resolve doubt in favor of the first user.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">I believe that confusion is not likely and have no doubt to be resolved. The reasons for my conviction follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">First, insufficient weight has been given to the facts as to the actual goods sold under the respective marks, to whom they are sold, the purposes for which they are bought, and the prices involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Appellant\u2019s cross-slide assemblies cost $5,500 or so \u2014 as much as a luxury automobile \u2014 and are designed expressly for use with appellant\u2019s $50,000 lathes. The record shows that they will not fit any other machine tool. Therefore, what is involved in the purchase of one of these BORMASTER cross-slide assemblies is ownership of a $50,000 tool and purchase of a $5,500 attachment for it. Such a purchase is not a casual transaction and unquestionably involves engineering specification of exactly what is wanted and of a specific known source, from which alone it can be had, and knowledgeable corporate purchasing-agent handling of the whole transaction. Appellee\u2019s affidavit states as to purchasers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">In every ease, the sales are made to manufacturers who make use of machine tools and use them for manufacturing a finished product. These customers would be the same customers who would purchase lathe cross-slide assemblies and similar machine products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">These are thus capital goods involving large capital outlays, not consumer goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Opposer\u2019s position, accepted below and by the majority, is that because it sells BORE-MATIC boring machines, the aforesaid purchasers are going to be confused as to the source of the $5,500 BOR-MASTER cross-slide attachments and think they come from the opposer. I cannot see the slightest possibility of such confusion for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">1. The extreme care that goes into the purchase of a $5,500 attachment for a $50,000 machine with an attendant <em>certainty </em>of the source from which it is purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">2. The obvious differences in the marks: (a) the wholly different mental impressions generated by \u201cMASTER\u201d vs. \u201cMATIC\u201d, both used ad nauseaum in trademarks; (b) the different spellings of \u201cBORE\u201d and \u201cBOR\u201d; (c) the hyphenation vs. the non-hyphenation; and the very significant fact that the word \u201cbore,\u201d however spelled, is descriptive of the goods of both parties, indicating that they are machines or accessories for accomplishing boring operations in a factory, for which reason that portion of the marks would not be taken by anyone as an indication of origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">3. The fact, not mentioned by the majority, that opposer-appellee appears to emphasize \u201cMATIC\u201d in its business by using at least a small family of marks including, in addition to BORE-MATIC, CENTRI-MATIC, GAGE-MATIC, and SIZE-MATIC. Why, then, should anyone take a \u201cMASTER\u201d mark as indicating origin in appellee? Because \u201cBOR\u201d is in the mark? Certainly not! I note again that this is a hyphenated family and that appellant\u2019s mark is non-hyphenated.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">4. If the $2,000,000 of advertising and $62,000,000 of sales by appellee have any significance in this case it is, in my opinion, that the purchasers, actual and potential, of appellee\u2019s machines must by now be quite familiar with the BOREMATIC trademark so that they would be even less likely to think BORMAS-TER has any connection with appellee than if the sales and promotion had been smaller.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">The <em>Dobeckmun </em>case is no real support for the board\u2019s decision \u2014 or the majority\u2019s \u2014 when its facts are considered. The marks there involved were DURAFILM, sought to be registered for packaging films, and the cited prior registration of DUROFOIL for foil laminated to paper or to transparent film for wrapping purposes. We felt that purchasers of the films and foils \u2014 who were industrial packagers \u2014 might well think DURAFILM and DUROFOIL were products \u201cof a single producer,\u201d trademarks on \u201ccompanion products\u201d of film and foil. I see no such possibility on the facts of the present case. The \u201crationale\u201d we applied in <em>Dobeckmun </em>cannot be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">The test we have to apply here is a statutory test as prescribed in section 2 (d) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052 (d)). It is not enough that there are resemblances between the marks and similarities between, or even identity of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>goods and priority in the opposer. The test of the statute is that applicant\u2019s mark</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">* * * <em>so </em>resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a mark * * * previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, <em>when applied to the goods of the applicant, </em>to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive: * * *. [My emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">We are thereby required to consider realistically <em>all </em>of the circumstances pertaining to the use of the applicant\u2019s mark on the applicant\u2019s goods vis \u00e1 vis the op-poser\u2019s marks and uses. I do not believe the board did so. In fact, its opinion indicates that it put aside one of the principal circumstances; the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">In so doing [concluding confusion was likely], we have given due consideration to applicant\u2019s argument that these products are sold to discriminating purchasers <em>but do not believe that where, as here, the products of the parties are substantially the same, such factor is of controlling significance. </em>[My emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">It cited the <em>Dobeckmun </em>case for that proposition but that case does not support such a broad statement; all we did there was to decide that on <em>all </em>the circumstances there before us confusion was likely. The circumstances here are quite different. Even if the goods are identical, it remains necessary to consider all the other circumstances and they may be of controlling significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The majority opinion adds nothing new. It gives blanket approval to what the board said and the board\u2019s application of the <em>Dobeckmun </em>case. I think both were in error. Like the board, the majority appears to have ended up in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Since I conclude on all the circumstances of record surrounding the sale of the respective goods under the marks involved that there is no room for doubt, I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\">. The board opinion is published at 147 TJSPQ 533.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\">. It was stipulated by the parties that the testimony could be introduced in the form of affidavits. Each side then submitted the affidavit of a vice-president reciting facts about his own company\u2019s business. There are no conflicts between the two affidavits. This is tantamount to stipulating facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b508-12\">SMITH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">While I agree with Judge Rich that this case should be reversed, I arrive at this conclusion for somewhat different reasons than are stated in his dissenting opinion. I agree with him that In re Dobeckmun Co., 286 F.2d 187, 48 CCPA 810 (1960), is not properly applicable here, \u201cwhen its facts are considered.\u201d In <em>Dobeckmun, </em>this court pointed out that even a discriminating purchaser might well assume that the marks there in issue were trademarks on <em>companion products </em>of a <em>single </em>producer. Id. 286 F.2d at 188, 48 CCPA at 813. On the facts before us here, I believe, as Judge Rich has indicated, that the \u201cdiscriminating purchaser\u201d argument has merit. I do not think, however, that the \u201crationale\u201d of <em>Dobeckmun, </em>and the approach there taken in the analysis of trademark problems of the present type should be ignored even though other factors may well dictate the ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">As a result of dissecting the competing marks to find their similarities and their differences, as I agree must be done, the only similarities of the marks reside in a common non-distinctive prefix. The prefix \u201cBOR\u201d or \u201cBORE,\u201d it seems to me, is somewhat descriptive of the respective apparatuses to which the marks are applied. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, these common portions of the marks under review must be considered to indicate the nature of the goods rather than the source of the goods. Section 2(d) of The Trademark Act of 1946 proscribes registration of a mark when, as applied to applicant\u2019s goods, it is likely to cause confusion, mistake or to deceive. It is the likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers as to the source of the goods on which applicant\u2019s mark is used that forms the basis for the fundamental inquiry here.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">The differences in the marks are found primarily in the respective suffixes, \u201cMASTER\u201d as used by the applicant and \u201c-MATIC\u201d as used by the opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>As I compare the entire marks here in issue, keeping in mind the similarities and differences noted by dissection of the marks, it is my opinion that they differ so in sound, meaning and appearance that I believe there would be no likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of discriminating purchasers as to the source of the goods arising by reason of the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">It is only when all of the facts of record, properly weighed and carefully considered, do not prove conclusive of one result or another that we should resolve the doubt in favor of the first user. As a <em>mechanism of policy, </em>this practice should be resorted to only when the record provides a reasonable basis for the existence of such a doubt. I do not believe that this is a case which requires application of this policy since the conclusion seems to be quite clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">I would, therefore, reverse the decision below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
