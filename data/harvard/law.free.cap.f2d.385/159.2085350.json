The stock was delivered to the Commerce Union Bank and placed in escrow. Before the end of the week the purchasers of the stock learned they were unable to complete the transaction and agreed to forfeit their down payment of $75,000., as consideration for their being released from further liability under the contract. The Taxpayer agreed to release the purchasers from further liability under the contract and accepted the down payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The sole question in the case is whether or not the gain is to be treated as a sale or exchange of a capital asset under Sections 61(a) (3) and 1002 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The Taxpayer contends that the sale was completed when the stock was placed in escrow. The Commissioner determined that the $75,000. which was forfeited, was ordinary income since the sale had not been completed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the District Court be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
