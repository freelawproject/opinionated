He also contends that prior to and during trial his constitutional rights were vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>lated. We shall consider this latter contention first.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-4\">For several years prior to indictment the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) investigated defendant\u2019s income tax liability for the years in question, interviewed him at home as early as December 1960 and in March 1964 wrote a letter inviting him to appear for a formal interview.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response to this letter defendant went to the I.R.S. office in Boston on April 1, 1964, and was interviewed. A stenographic transcript was made, the relevant portions of which are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKc\">\u201c1. Mr. Reale: Doctor Spinney, you recently received a letter inviting you to come here today, if you so chose, for a Formal Interview. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">Dr. Spinney: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-6\">2. Q. Doctor Spinney, the purpose of this interview, if there is to be one, is to afford you the opportunity to offer any explanations, or submit any evidence you might choose to submit. You should understand if you do make any statements, or submit any evidence, these statements must be made under oath, and you should be cognizant of your constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. Is that perfectly clear to you, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\">A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqqQ\">3. Q. Are you aware of your rights under the Fifth Amendment, that you cannot be compelled to testify against yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-9\">A. No, but that doesn\u2019t interest me. I don\u2019t know why it should. Go ahead. If you should bring up a problem I will let you know. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I am ready to listen and see what happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-10\">4. Q. Doctor, the subject matter is your Income Tax Liability for the years 1958 and 1959. Now do you wish to be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-12\">A. Do I wish to be what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-13\">5. Q. Do you wish to be heard, or to make an explanation with regard to your 1958 and 1959 Income Tax Returns, and the liability that was shown thereon as you filed them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-15\">A. \u25a0 Yes. Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-16\">6. Q. Do you want to stand and be sworn? Doctor Spinney, do you solemnly swear that your testimony here today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-18\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-19\">Prior to trial defendant moved to suppress the transcript of the interview and the evidence obtained by the I.R.S. as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>result of it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This motion was denied. United States v. Spinney, 264 F.Supp. 774 (D.Mass.1966). At the trial the transcript of the interview was admitted in evidence. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and that the admission in evidence of the transcript as well as the fruits of the April 1 interrogation violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Specifically he complains that in neither the letter nor the interview was he given the required warnings enunciated in Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed.2d 694 (1966), that he had a right to remain silent at the proposed interview and also that anything he said could be used as evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\"><em>Miranda </em>involved a custodial interrogation. To be sure, the Court said in that case that custodial interrogation means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody <em>or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Miranda, </em>supra at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612 (emphasis supplied) Clearly, however, this defendant was not deprived of his freedom of action at all. He was not compelled to appear at the interview or answer questions. He did both voluntarily. In this circuit we have recently held that whatever the limits of <em>Miranda, </em>it does not extend to a factual situation such as is presented here. Morgan v. United States, 377 F.2d 507 (Ist Cir. 1967). Although in <em>Morgan </em>defendant complained that he was not warned of his right to counsel, our holding in that case is not based on such a narrow factual distinction. <em>Morgan </em>stands for the proposition that where one is legally free, albeit at the risk of unpleasant consequences, to reject the government\u2019s invitation to appear and participate in an I.R.S. interview, the requirements enumerated in <em>Miranda </em>do not apply. We think the observations we made at 508 in <em>Morgan </em>apply with equal force here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-11\">\u201c * * * the background of <em>Miranda </em>demonstrates that it was the product of the Court\u2019s concern with the difficulty of protecting persons in the custody of the police from coercive interrogation tactics carried on in secret. See Developments in the Law \u2014 Confessions, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 935, 954-1022 (1966). That, of course, is not this case. Defendant makes no assertion, nor could he, that he was not free to walk out of the Internal Revenue office at any time. Nor is there any suggestion of trickery or fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-12\">\u201cThere must be reasonable limits to the solicitude required of the government. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">Therefore, we find no merit in this contention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">Nor are we impressed by defendant\u2019s claim that there was not sufficient evidence of willfullness to withstand his motion for judgment of acquittal. It is uncontested that there was an understatement of gross receipts. As above stated, it is only the question of willfullness that defendant contests. In support of this contention he cites his cooperation with the I.R.S. investigation to show his lack of intention to defraud. Even if true, this can hardly be considered proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>of his innocence. Otherwise, anyone accused of this crime could assure his acquittal by cooperating with the investigating authorities regardless of what the investigation might uncover.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">\u201cWilfulness is, of course, a question of fact. But direct proof thereof is not essential. It may be inferred from acts and circumstances, and the inference may be drawn from a combination of acts and circumstances, although each separate act and circumstance standing alone is inconclusive.\u201d Gaunt v. United States, 184 F.2d 284, 290 (1st Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 917, 71 S.Ct. 350, 95 L.Ed. 662 (1951). The real question here is whether there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer defendant\u2019s willfullness. We think that there is. There is evidence that defendant understated his gross receipts on his 1958 tax return by $11,248 and on his 1959 return by $3,173.38.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His accountant, one Lewis, testified that he obtained the figures on Dr. Spinney\u2019s gross receipts for the two years in question from monthly totals furnished by Dr. Spinney himself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lewis further stated that he merely added these monthly totals but did not check their accuracy from the daily sheets. These sheets which were examined by the I.R.S. support the understatements of gross receipts as defendant subsequently admitted. The jury was entitled to consider the unlikelihood of a man who had shown a keen interest in knowing whether his practice was increasing being unaware of his gross income during these years.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\">In addition, it was shown that defendant substantially overstated his deductions for dentures, dental supplies and other professional expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is evidence that he paid these bills himself, that he did this by check and that the only information the accountant had on these expenses was what he obtained from the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">Defendant\u2019s entertainment deductions of $722 taken in 1958 and $825 in 1959, although relatively small, are nevertheless of particular significance on the issue of intent. I.R.S. agent Rosenberg testified that when he asked Dr. Spinney if he could explain and substantiate these deductions, he replied \u201cNo. Everyone else takes them. So can I.\u201d In this connection defendant\u2019s accountant testified that in discussing entertainment expenses for the years in question, he told defendant that certain of these expenses were deductible but warned that they would have to be substantiated in case of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-18\"> From all of the above stated evidence, we think the jury could reasonably infer that this defendant knowingly and willfully understated his gross receipts and overstated his deductions in an attempt to evade his income tax liability for the years 1958 and 1959.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlN\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-17\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. <em>Attempt to evade or defeat tax</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-18\">\u201cAny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\u2019'</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-19\">. Both counts charged the defendant with willfully and knowingly attempting to evade and defeat a large part of his and his wife\u2019s income liability by filing false and fraudulent joint tax returns for the years in question. Count 1 charges that the reported taxable income of the defendant and his wife for 1958 was $1,443.82 and their reported tax liability $430.51, whereas the correct taxable income was $16,923.09 and the tax $4,375.60. Count 2 alleges that their reported taxable income for 1959 was $1,412.54 and their reported tax liability $462.51, whereas the correct taxable income for that year was $10,160.24, with a tax liability of $2,421.-66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-20\">.

Defendant also raises the point that the trial judge erred in refusing to give three requested instructions with reference to deductible expenditures not reflected on his returns. The only such item involved is fees allegedly paid to his accountant. The accountant testified that he received nothing for preparing the 1958 and 1959 returns and Dr. Spinney\u2019s own records do not reflect any such payment, but he claims payments to his accountant of $150 a year dm-ing these years. Even if true, a deduction of such a small amount would have no substantial effect on defendant\u2019s taxable income and could not affect the outcome of the case. Therefore he was not entitled to such an instruction. United States v. Bender, 218 F.2d 869 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 920, 75 S.Ct. 660, 99 L.Ed. 1253 (1955) ; cf. Small v.
