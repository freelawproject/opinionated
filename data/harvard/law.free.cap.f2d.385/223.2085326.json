Co. is a distributor of plumbing, heating, and refrigerating supplies and equipment. Defendants are known as Manufacturers Clearing House of Illinois, and are in the business of rendering information with respect to the financial responsibility of businesses in the same or related categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">The publication complained of is a letter which defendants sent out to people who were not subscribers to defendants\u2019 services, for the purpose of inducing them to subscribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The letterhead announced that defendants are <em>\u201cA </em>Mercantile Agency specializing in information regarding the financial responsibility and paying habits of distributors of plumbing, heating, cooling, hardware &amp; mill supplies\u201d and listed the following activities: \u201cCapital Ratings, Paying Records, Mercantile Reports, Collections, Adjustments, Investigations.\u201d The body of the letter was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201cMay 31,1963</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">I just want to take this opportunity to quote from two recent subscriber (*) letters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u2018Enclosed is my check for $445.00 for 1963, also signed contract. I still think it is the best bargain in the plumbing and heating industry.\u2019 \u2018We offer our congratulations on the way you handled and collected the $4,072.11 from our customer, Fleck Bros. Co., Camden, N. J. It was $37.50 well spent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">Do you feel this way about the service you are getting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">/s/ W. W. Nagel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acq\">General Manager</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">WWNagel/LL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">\"Names will be furnished upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">The pertinent Illinois law has been stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-15\">\u201cThus, a written publication of false words in order to be libelous per se must, in these jurisdictions, by their plain, unambiguous and ordinary meaning, and without resort to innuendo or construction, be injurious on their face and impute some matter falling within the first four categories of offensive material as, in the case of oral utterances, would constitute slander per se. Any other kind of libel is regarded as one per quod, and, like - slander, in every instance requires allegations and proof of special damage.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">The category of words relevant here is \u201c4. Those prejudicing a particular party in his profession or trade;\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">The Supreme Court of Illinois has adopted an \u201cinnocent construction rule,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-22\">\u201cThat rule holds that the article is to be read as a whole and the words given their natural and obvious meaning, and requires that words allegedly libelous that are capable of being read innocently must be so read and declared nonactionable as a matter of law.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Applying Illinois law, this court has held that a written direct accusation of fraud, mismanagement, or financial instability on the part of a business man or firm is libel per se, but that something less than a \u201cdirect\u201d charge is not actionable without proof of special damages resulting from the publication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">Considering defendants\u2019 circular letter merely on its face, its purpose was to advertise the satisfaction of defendants\u2019 customers with the service they received, and not to give information concerning plaintiff, though it surely did so incidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-24\">Viewed strictly, the information so given was that defendants\u2019 subscriber had a claim against plaintiff on which defendants collected $4,072.11 in return for a fee of $37.50. This indicated a single instance in which plaintiff failed to pay an obligation in the ordinary course of business. Conceivably a single such instance could result from mistake or a good faith dispute over liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-25\">The letter did not, in terms, express the generalization that plaintiff customarily could not or would not settle accounts promptly, or that it is an unsound credit risk. Plaintiff contends such generalization was necessarily implied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>and defendants concede that this generalization, if stated, would be actionable without proof of special damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Whether an indication that a business firm has in one instance failed to pay up without the intervention of a collection agency should be treated as an imputation of financial instability is perhaps a close question. Conceivably members of the business community would so consider it. We have found no helpful cases, although a venerable New York decision held that a statement that a judgment had been recovered was not actionable per se.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We conclude, however, as did the district court, that the Illinois innocent construction rule requires the holding that the publication was not actionable without proof of special damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In dismissing the complaint, the district court also held that special damage had not been pleaded with sufficient particularity. We do not agree. The complaint discloses that this letter was distributed by an agency specializing in credit ratings and collections to persons from whom plaintiff might well be seeking credit. Although the complaint made general (and insufficient) claims of loss of reputation, it also averred that as a result of the letter plaintiff \u201chas been and is still being refused normal credit terms by its suppliers\u201d and has expended time, money, and effort to reestablish its credit. In our opinion, these averments sufficiently notify defendants of plaintiff\u2019s claim that it has suffered monetary loss as a result of refusals of credit, stemming in turn from the statement in defendants\u2019 letter. Procedures are available by which defendants can learn the names, circumstances, and amounts, and the details need not be pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The complaint should have been deemed sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Plaintiff included a second count, claiming an invasion of its right of privacy. Met by the contention that a corporation has no right of privacy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> counsel urges that he has pleaded a deliberate and malicious act, intended to injure plaintiff, and thus has sufficiently stated a tort claim other than for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">We see no reason to discuss this count. If plaintiff can prove what it claims to have pleaded in Count II, and that it has been damaged thereby, it will have succeeded under Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-25\">.
