KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The perils of acting without competent tax advice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2are demonstrated anew, if further evidence be needed, by this petition to review a decision of the Tax Court, 47 T.C. 258 (1966), holding that distributions in 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963 to the taxpayer in redemption of her stock in a family corporation were \u201cessentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d within the meaning of section 302(b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and hence taxable at ordinary income rates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">The evidence, as found by the Tax Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> established that Mrs. Levin\u2019s family corporation, the Connecticut Novelty Corporation, Inc., commenced operations as a partnership between her husband and her brother, Joseph Levine. In its early years the business centered on the wholesale distribution of \u201cfireworks,\u201d but it shifted exclusively to retail jewelry after the state prohibited their use in 1951. Taxpayer succeeded to her husband\u2019s interest in the business upon his death in 1940. Thereafter, her brother Joseph came to live with her and her son Jerome, and became a \u201csecond father\u201d to him. She relied heavily on Joseph\u2019s advice in business matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-18\">Following incorporation of the business in 1948, its 1300 outstanding single class common shares were held as follows: Joseph Levine, 650 shares; Mrs. Levin, 649 shares; Jerome Levin, 1 share.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ***The three stockholders also constituted the board of directors and officers of the corporation until Joseph Levine\u2019s death in April 1962, when Jerome\u2019s wife became a director. \u2022 Taxpayer was secretary and treasurer until 1959, when she limited her office in the company to secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-19\">Jerome was employed full time in the business since graduating from high school in 1944. In 1957 he contemplated marriage and discussed his status in the company with his mother and uncle in order to learn \u201cwhere he stood\u201d in the business. He insisted on this so that if it became necessary he could embark on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>another career while still young. Thereafter, Joseph and the taxpayer agreed to give him a greater participation in the business ownership and management. As a result the existing stock was can-celled and 1300 new shares of common stock were issued and distributed in this manner: Joseph, 485 shares; taxpayer 484 shares; Jerome, 331 shares. Jerome gave no consideration for the 330 additional shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Within a few years Jerome sought outright ownership of the business and to retire his uncle and mother. But he desired to accomplish this by a method which would make provision for them during the balance of their lives. Accordingly, on January 19, 1960, a plan was devised whereby the corporation would redeem the stock of taxpayer and Joseph at $200 per share. Pursuant to, this plan Joseph and taxpayer executed identical agreements with the corporation. She was to receive $7000 per year without interest beginning April 1, 1960 until $96,800 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was paid. Upon default the unpaid balance would become due upon the \u201cseller\u2019s\u201d election. As an alternative, the corporation was given the option to pay the entire or any part of the purchase price \u2019at any time. After the plan was consummated, Jerome conducted the business with \u201ca greater freedom of action.\u201d But out of \u201crespect and sentiment,\u201d as we are told, Joseph and taxpayer were retained as directors and officers of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Coincidentally, the taxpayer and Joseph became eligible for social security benefits. But, they continued to perform services for the corporation and to receive salaries while at the same time taxpayer accepted a cut in her salary to $1200 per year, the maximum amount then permitted to be earned without a reduction in her social security benefits. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403 (1964 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The dispute before us arises from taxpayer\u2019s treatment of the $7000 payments. In the taxable years in question, 1960 through 1963, she reported the compensation from the corporation under the 1960 agreement as long-term capital gains.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commissioner treated the payments as essentially equivalent to dividends and accordingly determined deficiencies for all the years in question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">The difference between a stock redemption that is essentially equivalent to a dividend and one that is not is grounded on a long history in the tax law. The distinction was essential because without it the tax on dividends at ordinary income rates could easily be defeated by the simple expedient of issuing more stock to the shareholders, who then would \u201csell\u201d back their new shares to the corporation. It would then be asserted that the proceeds of this alleged sale were taxable at capital gains rates because they represented proceeds from the \u201csale\u201d of a capital asset. To eliminate this patent loophole, Congress early provided that such distributions would receive capital gain treatment only if they were \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend.\u201d See generally 1 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 9.99 (Oliver ed. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">But this simplistic formula created more problems than it solved for the courts were then called upon to answer the elusive question as to when a distribution was or was not \u201cessentially equivalent to a dividend.\u201d At first it was generally believed that, in view of its history, the provision was aimed only at distributions motivated by a tax avoidance purpose. Accordingly, if a distribution served a \u201cbusiness purpose,\u201d the courts held it was not essentially equivalent to a dividend. This rationale was becoming increasingly difficult to apply, however, and it came to its demise in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>1945 when, in interpreting an analogous statutory provision, the Supreme Court ruled that motive had little relevancy. The Court then adopted a more objective \u201cnet effect\u201d test, under which the question of dividend equivalency depended on whether the distribution in redemption of stock had the same economic effect as a distribution of a dividend would have had. Commissioner v. Estate of Bedford, 325 U.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 1157, 89 L.Ed. 1611 (1945).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In time this test also proved ephemeral; some courts developed many criteria, to determine the \u201cnet effect\u201d of a distribution,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while in determining \u201cnet effect\u201d we differed and relied primarily on changes in \u201cbasic rights of ownership.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, most cases have been resolved on their own facts and circumstances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Until 1954 the \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d test, with all its perplexing problems, had been the sole statutory guide in this area. But the draftsmen of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, faced with \u201cthe morass created by the decisions,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> attempted to clarify the standards and thus to make more precise the dividing line between stock redemptions that qualified for capital gains treatment and those that did not by adding objective tests, see \u00a7 302(b) (2)-(4), and rules defining constructive ownership, see \u00a7 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">Since the \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d test is no longer applied in a vacuum, it is impossible to interpret it without examining the statutory scheme of which it is now a part. Section 3'02(a) provides that a stock redemption <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> shall be treated as an \u201cexchange\u201d if it falls into any one of the categories of \u00a7 302(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These categories are: (1) a redemption that is \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d under \u00a7 302(b) (1); (2) a \u201csubstantially disproportionate\u201d redemption under \u00a7 302(b) (2); (3) a complete redemption terminating the shareholder\u2019s interest in the corporation under \u00a7 302(b) (3).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 302 (b) (2) contains an exact mathematical formula to determine whether the disproportion is \u201csubstantial.\u201d The test in \u00a7 302(b) (3) is not mathematical, but it is stated with equal clarity. The shareholder must redeem all of his actually and constructively owned stock to qualify for capital gain treatment under this provision, and \u00a7 302(c) (2) provides that if certain clear-cut conditions are met the family attribution rules of \u00a7 318(a) will not apply in determining whether the shareholder has disposed of all his stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Mrs. Levin concedes that she fails to meet the requirements of either \u00a7 302 (b) (2) or \u00a7 302(b) (3),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and so she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>relies on \u00a7 302(b) (l).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Our task of interpretation and reasoned elaboration cannot be adequately performed if we examine each provision as if it existed in a vacuum. The Code draftsmen hopefully expected that the preciseness of the tests set out in the new provisions, \u00a7 302(b) (2) and \u00a7 302(b) (3), would serve to relieve the pressure on the \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d test re-enacted as \u00a7 302(b) (1). The new requirements, if carefully observed, provided safe h\u00e1rbors for taxpayers seeking capital gain treatment. As a result, their enactment permitted more accurate and long range tax planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 302 (b) (1) supports the view that it was designed to play a modest role in the statutory scheme. As originally passed by the House of Representatives, no provision was made for the \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d test; reliance was placed entirely on provisions similar to \u00a7 302(b) (2) and \u00a7 302(b) (3). Thereafter the Senate Finance Committee added \u00a7 302(b) (1) and explained its action as follows:<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">While the House bill set forth definite conditions under which stock may be redeemed at capital-gain rates, these rules appeared unnecessarily restrictive, particularly in the case of redemptions of preferred stock which might be called by the corporation without the shareholder having any control over when the redemption may take place. Accordingly, your committee follows existing law by reinserting the general language indicating that a redemption shall be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for stock if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">As a leading commentator observed, \u201cIt is not easy to give \u00a7 302(b) (1) an expansive construction in view of this indication that its major function was the narrow one of immunizing redemptions of minority holdings of preferred stock.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The 1954 Code also adopted a number of constructive ownership rules that provided for the attribution of stock owned by one person or legal entity to another. These provisions overruled the prior case law which unrealistically had not viewed the family as a unit unless other family members were \u201cdummy stockholders.\u201d Lukens v. Commissioner, 246 F.2d 403, 407-408 (3d Cir. 1957). By providing a \u201creasonable rule of thumb,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> these rules reduced the difficulties necessarily involved in determining in each case the extent of actual control in a family corporation, in which informal influence over relatives, often impossible of proof, was more important than formal control through voting rights based on actual stock ownership. Like \u00a7 302(b) (2) and \u00a7 302(b) (3), these rules represented an attempt to make the law more predictable, and thereby to serve as aids to the tax or estate planner.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Section 318(a), the family attribution rule applicable here, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\"><em>General rule. </em>\u2014 For purposes of those provisions of this subchapter [\u00a7\u00a7 301-395] to which the rules contained in this section are expressly made applicable\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-14\"><em>(1) Members of </em>family.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-15\"><em>(A) In general. </em>\u2014 An individual shall be considered as owning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">(ii) his children * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> In this case, then, the taxpayer must be deemed the owner of her son\u2019s shares since \u00a7 302(c) (1) provides in part: \u201csection 318(a) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock for purposes of this section.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Taxpayer argues that the family attribution rules should not be determinative in this \u00a7 302(b) (1) case. But the definitive language of the statute gives her small comfort despite the three cases upon which she relies so heavily.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">In Perry S. Lewis, 47 T.C. 129 (1966), the Tax Court ignored the stock attribution rules in deciding a \u00a7 302(b) (1) case. Lewis and his sons owned an automobile dealer franchise, and Lewis\u2019 shares were redeemed after the automobile manufacturer put heavy pressure on older men like Lewis to yield franchises to younger men. Lewis severed all relations with the corporation other than remaining as an apparently honorary director and officer. The Tax Court held that distributions to Lewis over a period of five years in exchange for his stock were not essentially equivalent to a dividend, because the stock redemption served a substantial \u201cbusiness purpose.\u201d While the majority ignored altogether the family attribution rules, Judge Simpson, in a separate concurrence, pointed out that they required that Lewis be treated as owning his sons\u2019 shares, and hence as owning 100% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding stock. He concurred, however, on the ground that there was a complete termination of Lewis\u2019 interest in the corporation which satisfied \u00a7 302 (b) (3). <em>Lewis </em>does not aid the taxpayer <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> because this court has not looked with favor upon the \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d test.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Even if we were to consider it, the Tax Court failed to articulate any reason for ignoring \u00a7 318. But, taxpayer argues that the Tax Court in <em>Lewis </em>simply considered the \u201cbona fides\u201d of the change in ownership with special care because of the attribution rules, and suggests we do the same. We have already stated that the core of the changes made by the 1954 Code in this not uncommon reticulate fashion for a tax statute was to shift from uncertainty and impreciseness to objective tests; \u201ctax administration would be severely handicapped if the rules applied only as presumptions * * *\u201d Ringel, Surrey &amp; Warren, Attribution of Stock Ownership in the Internal Revenue Code, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 209 (1958). Acceptance of taxpayer\u2019s argument would eviscerate the attribution rules and all that Congress hoped to achieve thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Mrs. Levin also refers us to the footnote dictum in Ballenger v. United States, 301 F.2d 192, 199 (4th Cir. 1962), indicating that some commentators have \u201csuggested that the attribution of ownership rules should not be too literally applied to \u00a7 302(b) (1).\u201d It is interesting, \u2022however, that the attribution rules were applied in <em>Ballenger, </em>and the quoted dictum lends feeble support to taxpayer\u2019s claim that the attribution rules should be ignored here as they were in <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Finally, taxpayer relies on another footnote observation in Himmel v. Commissioner, 338 F.2d 815, 820 (2d Cir. 1964), stating that \u201c[w]e think it quite proper to be aware of the effect of a distribution on significant corporate interests without strict regard to the attribution rules.\u201d The reliance is misplaced. In <em>Himmel </em>we <em>applied </em>the attribution rules in determining that if there had been a dividend on the common stock rather than a redemption of the non-voting cumulative preferred, taxpayer <em>constructively </em>would have received significantly <em>less </em>than he did as a result of the redemption. This alteration in rights to earnings was \u201csubstantial enough in itself to bar treatment of the redemption as \u2018essentially equivalent to a dividend.\u2019 In no other case has a comparable difference apparently been considered otherwise.\u201d <em>Himmel, </em>at 818. In the case before us, if there had been $14,000 annual dividends (the amount of the annual distributions to taxpayer and Joseph) instead of a stock redemption, taxpayer would have received constructively about $8,778 <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or <em>more </em>than she received from the stock redemption. The Tax Court correctly stated that the comparative dividend test is designed to test \u201cwhether the distributions <em>equal or exceed </em>the amounts that would be received as a cash dividend,\u201d and that accordingly <em>Himmel </em>\u201cis not analogous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Moreover, <em>Himmel </em>involved a corporation with three classes of stock which were not held proportionately. This situation created \u201cadditional and more difficult problems;\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> compliance with \u00a7 302(b) (2) was impossible,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and immediate compliance with \u00a7 302(b) (3) was impractical.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> By contrast, in the present case taxpayer easily could have complied with \u00a7 302(b) (3) by simply resigning as a director, officer, and employee of the corporation and notifying the Secretary of the Treasury.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> She simply could not have her cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We do not hold that there may not be cases in which strict application of the attribution rules may be inappropriate. In addition to the preferred stock situations referred to in the Senate Report quoted supra, family estrangement may render the application of the family attribution rules unwise. See Bittker, The Taxation of Stock Redemptions and Partial Liquidations, 44 Cornell L.Q. 299, 324 (1959); Moore, Dividend Equivalency \u2014 Taxation of Distributions in Redemption of Stock, 19 Tax L.Rev. 249, 252-55 (1964). But in the case before us taxpayer has offered no valid reason for ignoring the family attribution rules, and we perceive none.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">iY.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Accordingly, we must attribute Jerome\u2019s shares to his mother. As a result, before the redemption she constructively owned her 484 shares and her son\u2019s 331 shares, or about 63 per cent of the 1300 outstanding shares. After the redemption she still constructively owned her son\u2019s shares. Thus, after the redemption of the stock owned by her and her brother, by the rule of attribution she became the constructive owner of 100 per cent of the outstanding stock. It is apparent therefore that her constructive ownership actually increased as a result of the redemptions. As the Tax Court said, this \u201cis most unlike a sale.\u201d, For when a taxpayer\u2019s (constructive) ownership decreases by a significant amount, we are justified in concluding that a substantial reduction in taxpayer\u2019s interest in the corporation has occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>warranting capital gain treatment as a sale or exchange. But when only a small reduction in control occurs, the distribution has been held to the essentially equivalent to a dividend; <em>a fortiori, </em>when no reduction, but rather an increase, in control occurs, taxpayer has not parted with anything justifying capital gain treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The Tax Court correctly noted that in this case control in the sense of access to corporate benefits was more important than any legal right to direct the destiny of the corporation. In reality, taxpayer\u2019s benefits from the corporation changed little as a result of the redemption. Before 1960 she received a salary of $7800 per year; after 1960 she received $8200 per year, composed of annual distributions of $7000 and salary of $1200. While in form taxpayer redeemed her stock, in substance she parted with nothing justifying capital gain treatment.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">. This is not meant to reflect upon taxpayer\u2019s counsel before us, who we understand were not involved in the original transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\">. The Tax Court found deficiencies in income taxes due of $1,015.22 in 1960, $1,-037.74 in 1961, $970.04 in 1962, and $2,-783.44 in 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">. The facts were largely stipulated. The only significant factual dispute is whether a shift in control over the corporation actually occurred as a result of the redemption. In the view we take of the ease, it is unnecessary to decide this question; nor need we consider whether, as taxpayer urges, the clearly erroneous rule has any application to \u00a7 302(b) (1) cases.

A redemption that does not fall within one of these categories is treated, by virtue of \u00a7 302(d), as a distribution under \u00a7 301, i. e., as a dividend to the extent of current and post-1913 earnings and profits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b572-17\">.

Taxpayer fails to meet the test of \u00a7 302(b) (3) because she remained a director, an officer, and an employee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>corporation after the redemption. Moreover, she failed to file the proper notification with the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">. In determining whether the redemption satisfies \u00a7 302(b) (1), we are directed by \u00a7 302(h) (5) not to take into account that the redemption fails to meet the requirements of \u00a7 302(b) (2) or \u00a7 302(b) (3); but a discussion and understanding of these provisions are useful in interpreting \u00a7 302(b) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b573-17\">.

Although some commentators have argued that the attribution rules are not applicable to \u00a7 302(b) (1) because it does not expressly refer to the \u201cownership\u201d of stock, Bittker &amp; Eustice, op. cit., 292, correctly point out that it is reasonable to apply the attribution rules whenever ownership of stock is relevant, whether by statutory direction or otherwise. Indeed, the Treasury Regulations initially made the application of the attribution rules to \u00a7 302(b) (1) mandatory, 19 Fed. Reg. 8240 (1954), although they now provide only that the attribution rules \u201cmust be considered,\u201d Treas.Regs. \u00a7 1.-302-2 (b), thus allowing some play in the joints for cases hereinafter discussed, e. g., situations involving family estrangement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b574-15\">. Of course the \u25a0 concurring opinion in <em>Lewis </em>does not support taxpayer\u2019s position here, because she makes no claim that there was a complete redemption under \u00a7 302(b) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b574-16\">.
