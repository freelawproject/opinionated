On the record before us, we affirm the Commission\u2019s order although, as will appear, we do not immunize the agreement from further scrutiny in the event additional administrative proceedings are instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">Sea-Land is a common carrier operating on the intereoastal route between ports in California and Elizabeth, New Jersey with an en-route call at Puerto Rico on eastbound voyages. As opposed to conventional break-bulk operations, Sea-Land operates ships capable of carrying hundreds of containers which are pre-packed at the point of origin, shipped via surface transportation to dockside, crane loaded onto its vessels for the inter-coastal voyage, and offloaded for ground transportation to the ultimate destination. The convenience of this service and the attractive shipping rates offered have made Sea-Land\u2019s operations successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">In late 1964, Sea-Land decided to place additional vessels in intercoastal service and enlarge each ship\u2019s cargo capacity by removing ship-based loading cranes and relying instead on shore-based supporting equipment. Sea-Land contacted various California ports and outlined its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>requirements which contemplated the use of expensive shore-based loading cranes. Following extensive negotiations, Oakland agreed to purchase the cranes at a cost of over two million dollars and to assign to Sea-Land two docking berths on a preferential basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To finance the purchase of the cranes, Oakland issued municipal bonds. In return, Sea-Land agreed to pay Oakland the applicable tariff rates for these and other needed facilities and services subject, however, to an annual minimum charge of $450,000 and an annual ceiling of $550,000. The agreement, which has a twenty-year life, was reduced to writing and filed with the Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">To put the issues in proper perspective, it is helpful to sketch the impact of the Shipping Act on port operations and agreements such as are involved in this case. Section 1 of the Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, defines \u201cother person subject to this chapter\u201d to include those \u201ccarrying on the business of * * * furnishing wharf-age, dock, warehouse, or other terminal facilities in connection with a common carrier by water.\u201d In 1940, the Commission\u2019s predecessor held that a port operated by a state was an \u201cother person\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Wharf-age Charges and Practices at Boston, 2 U.S.M.C. 245, 246-247 (1940). The following year, that ruling was applied in a proceeding instituted to determine whether the practices of terminal operators in the San Francisco Bay Area were unlawful. Practices Etc. of San Francisco Bay Terminals, 2 U.S.M.C. 588 (1941). There, following exhaustive hearings, the Commission found a series of practices unlawful and entered a sweeping remedial order which included the establishment of minimum charges for specified services and obligated the ports to file information copies of their tariffs with the Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">The Commission\u2019s order was vigorously, but unsuccessfully, challenged in the courts. State of California v. United States, 46 F.Supp. 474 (N.D.Calif.1942), aff\u2019d. 320 U.S. 577, 64 S.Ct. 352, 88 L.Ed. 322 (1944). From this litigation emerged the principle that, although the Commission has no rate-making power such as has been conferred on it with respect to common carriers,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it has an obligation to insure that ports \u201cestablish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable regulations and practices,\u201d see Section 17, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 816, and that no port makes or gives \u201cany undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, locality, or description of traffic.\u201d See Section 16, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 815. Agreements between ports and shippers which are subject to Section 15 of the Act must be submitted to the Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission is authorized to \u201cdisapprove, cancel, or modify\u201d any such agreement which it finds \u201cto be unjustly discriminatory or unfair * * * or to operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States, or to be in violation of this chapter * * * \u201d and it must approve all other agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>With these general propositions in mind, we turn to the agreement before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Petitioners\u2019 principal argument is that <em>any </em>agreement for the use of terminal facilities at a rate computed other than in accordance with the applicable tariff is unlawful. Although the Commission views such agreements with healthy skepticism, it has heretofore declined to construe the Shipping Act to erect an absolute ban on so-called minimum-maximum agreements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, it adhered to that rule holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">* * * since compensation for the use of terminal facilities in a minimum-maximum rather than straight tariff form is not in itself unlawful, there must be some showing of an unreasonable disadvantage among the users of the facilities on these different bases before a minimum-maximum compensation can be declared contrary to section 17, and 16 itself requires a showing of such unreasonable disadvantage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Thus, the issue on this branch of the case is whether an agreement is <em>per se </em>\u201cunjustly discriminatory or unfair,\u201d or otherwise in \u201cviolation of this chapter,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>in violation of Section 16 or 17, merely because the parties calculate compensation in a manner other than by strict application of the tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\"> While an agency\u2019s construction of its statute is not binding on the courts, that construction is entitled to great weight.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioners must shoulder the burden of persuading us that the body charged by Congress with the day-to-day administration of the Shipping Act has deviated from or ignored an ascertainable legislative intention. This, they have not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">The tariff filed by a port is significantly different from the tariff filed by a common carrier. With respect to the former, the Commission is only authorized to halt rates or practices which are unreasonable or discriminatory. Subject to its limited power to translate these statutory prohibitions into \u201cdollars and cents\u201d terms by establishing a maximum or minimum rate,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Commission has no rate making power with respect to ports. The situation is much different with respect to common carriers, for Section 18 of the Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 817, explicitly gives the power to establish the rates to be charged and the carrier is obligated to abide by its effective tariff without exception on pain of criminal fines. We are not prepared to say that the Commission was required to do what Congress has refrained from doing, and to expand Section 18 so as to include ports.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\"> Moreover, in the absence of an ascertainable direction by Congress to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the contrary, we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s conclusion may not embody a sound, or at least reasonable, judgment. Sea-Land\u2019s rapid operation, using a shore-based loading crane, requires facilities and services different from those utilized by conventional break bulk vessels calling at ports. We do not think Congress wrote such an inflexible statute that the Commission is barred from taking into account such differences as justification for a difference in rate, or to require that what are essentially unique arrangements must be published in the form of a tariff \u2014 at least where, as here, the agency has a stated policy of subjecting applications that a special situation be governed by a particular agreement rather than a general tariff to the full airing of an evidentiary hearing before according its approval.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At such a hearing, the full facts and circumstances may be developed and the Commission may determine whether or not to approve the different rates and charges, subject always to the Act\u2019s ban on unreasonable or discriminatory practices. Any particular agreement departing from tariff rates may run afoul of the Act, but we are not willing to say that all do as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Petitioners also argue that this particular agreement \u201cdoes not include all of the elements of direct and indirect wharfinger costs which should be allocated to [the Sea-Land agreement] and is therefor [e] noncompensatory.\u201d This, of course, stirs issues quite distinct from the statutory broadside which we have already considered and rejected. We may assume, and neither the Commission nor intervenors argue otherwise, that an agreement which fails to allocate a fair share of the port\u2019s overhead expenses might be noncompensatory and thereby unreasonable, unjust and discriminatory within the meaning of the Act. Additionally, failure to properly allocate expenses reflects on the overall rate of return projection on which the Commission\u2019s approval rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Petitioners\u2019 main argument on this branch of the case seems to be directed to the proposition that Oakland did not compute its costs in line with the so-called Freas Formula. Under that formula, the port\u2019s entire overhead costs and expenses are taken into consideration in fixing the applicable charge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here, as Oakland\u2019s Chief Engineer testified, the port segregated the specific terminal facilities to be assigned to Sea-Land and the particular services which Oakland would render pursuant to the agreement and computed its cost of service accordingly. The Commission found no reason to conclude that this method of computing costs did not fairly allocate the cost of providing the service and reflect an accurate rate of return projection upon which a judgment of reasonableness could be based. We have no occasion to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The goal is not slavish adherence to any particular formula, but a method of computation which takes into account the direct and indirect expenses and projects an accurate estimate of the cost of providing the particular service and the rate of return which the port may realize from the particular agreement. Compare Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>States, 345 U.S. 146, 149-150, 73 S.Ct. 592, 97 L.Ed. 912 (1953); Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, 335 U.S. 573, 593, 69 S.Ct. 278, 93 L.Ed. 243 (1949); Federal Power Commission v. Hope Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). If, in a particular case, a port uses a method of calculation other than the Freas Formula and convinces the Commission that its computations accurately reflect the anticipated costs and return, we know of no reason why the Commission may not accept and rely on such calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">We are made uneasy by petitioners\u2019 subsidiary contention that Oakland\u2019s calculations excluded \u201cthe non-revenue producing facilities of a port which are used in whole or in part in connection with revenue producing facilities. * * * \u201d Oakland\u2019s witness admitted that his figures did not take into account such things as depreciation and improvements on property not directly involved in this agreement, and some general administrative costs. At oral argument, we probed this matter further and it appears that other items of expense, such as might arise from security and weather services, were also excluded from consideration by Oakland. Failure to include such items might reduce significantly the projected rate of return on which the Commission\u2019s findings turned, or it might have no appreciable effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The difficulty we have is that this record contains no evidence as to the actual cost of these non-included items. No doubt petitioners, who fully participated in the hearing, regarded this aspect of the case as a subsidiary or even sub-subsidiary one, and focused their attention in the main to broader issues. The cross-examination of Oakland\u2019s witness on this point is reflected in but five pages of the record, and the questions put to him were designed to point up omitted items in an apparent effort to show that nothing but a straight Freas Formula computation could properly be utilized, rather than in an effort to demonstrate that omitted items had a material bearing on the accuracy of Oakland\u2019s figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The relative insignificance that petitioners attached to this point at the administrative level leads us to conclude that they were impliedly conceding that if they were wrong in their contention that the Freas Formula was required, the extra expenses that might be assigned under another allocation technique would not be sufficient in extent to affect the Commission\u2019s determination in this particular case. We note that petitioners did not file a motion requesting, in the alternative, a remand to the Commission for the purpose of permitting additional evidence to be adduced. <em>Cf. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>2347 (c). We think the interest of justice does not require a remand to clarify the ambiguity of this aspect of the record as a condition of passing on the validity of the order. Taking the record in the posture as we discern it, we see no reason why the order should not be affirmed. See West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (No. 1), 294 U.S. 63, 76, 55 S.Ct. 316, 79 L.Ed. 761 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The Commission has continuing jurisdiction over this agreement, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 824, and may reopen the proceedings either on its own motion or on an appropriate showing from an interested party. Perhaps changed circumstances or additional evidence would lead the Commission to reconsider its approval and to disapprove or modify the agreement. Certainly nothing we have said precludes that possibility and we decline to assume that the Commission would not lend a receptive ear to any future showing that continuance of this agreement is not in accord with the policy considerations and express limitations of the Shipping Act. Because such reevaluation is a continuing possibility and because, on this record, we have no warrant to overturn the Commission\u2019s findings, we affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-16\">.

The Commission has succinctly stated its rule: \u201cAn agreement for the use of a public terminal facility at a rental which deviates from the terminal\u2019s regular tariff provisions, may run afoul of the Shipping Act\u2019s proscriptions and is deserving of our scrutiny for any illegal discrimination or prejudice that may result.
