D.A. and C.A. (the \u201cChildren\u201d) were placed in the custody of the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d). In 2016, the Department filed a petition seeking to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights. Following a hearing, the court granted the Department\u2019s petition and terminated appellant\u2019s parental rights. In this appeal, appellant presents the following question for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Did the circuit court err in terminating [ajppellant\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">For reasons to follow, we answer appellant\u2019s question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">C.R.-A. (\u201cMother\u201d) gave birth to D.A. and C.A. on February 7, 2007 and February 20, 2009, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Father, who was in the country illegally, was arrested in 2010 \u201cdue to domestic violence between himself and the children\u2019s mother\u201d and was eventually deported to his home country of Mexico. At that time, Mother and her five minor children, all of whom were the children of Father, \u201cresided in a boarding house with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>multiple families known for illegal activities including drug use, gambling and excessive alcohol.\u201d In 2011, Mother was indicated for neglect by the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (hereinafter \u201cPGDSS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In August of 2013, Mother befriended Levi R. and Mary D., a married couple whom she met while the couple was doing missionary work for their church. At the time, Mother was living in a tent in Washington D.C. with her five children, including D.A. and C.A., and her boyfriend, Phillipe W. Not long after meeting Levi R. and Mary D,, Mother asked Mr. R. if he and his wife would care for the five children. The couple agreed and eventually filed for emergency custody of all five. The juvenile court granted custody of the five children to Mr. R. and Ms. D. in December of 2013. In that order, the court found that Father had \u201cno present involvement in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Around the same time, Father was arrested and incarcerated in a federal prison in Louisiana because he again came into the United States illegally and was \u201ctrying to bring others into the country.\u201d The record does not disclose Father\u2019s whereabouts between the time he was deported in 2010 and the time he was incarcerated in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In February 2014, PGDSS investigated a report of child sexual abuse against Phillipe W. involving D.A. and C.A. The alleged sexual abuse happened \u201csometime in later 2012 or early 2013\u201d when the Children were living in a tent with Mother and Phillipe W. PGDSS ultimately determined that the allegations involving D.A, were \u201cindicated;\u201d a finding of \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d was issued regarding the allegations involving C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In July of 2014, Mr. R. informed the Department that he and his wife could no longer care for the Children. The Department subsequently filed and was granted a Petition with Request for Shelter Care, and D.A. and C.A. were placed in foster care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time, Mother\u2019s whereabouts were un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>known, while Father remained incarcerated in federal prison. In August of 2014, the court held a review hearing regarding the shelter care order, and, on September 15, 2014, the court found D.A. and C.A. to be CI\u00d1A and ordered out-of-home placement under the care of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The court held another review hearing in January of 2015. By this time Mother had been located and was present at the hearing. Also present was counsel for Father, who remained in federal detention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the hearing, the court found that the Department had made reasonable efforts at reunification. The court also ordered that D.A. and C.A. were to remain in the custody of the Department and that Mother be allowed supervised visitation. The court made no findings regarding Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In May of 2015, the court held a hearing regarding D.A. and C.A.\u2019s permanency plans. Again, Mother and counsel for Father were present for the hearing. Following the hearing, the court found that Mother had made \u201cno progress toward correcting the problems that caused the children to be placed in foster care,\u201d that she continued \u201cto live with a man who may have abused one of her children,\u201d that she had no employment or place to live, and that she continued \u201cto test positive for illegal drugs.\u201d The court also noted that Father remained \u201cincarcerated in Louisiana.\u201d As a result of these and other findings, the court ordered that D.A. and C.A.\u2019s permanency plans be changed from reunification to custody and guardianship with a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In November of 2015, the court held another hearing regarding D.A. and C.A.\u2019s permanency plans. Mother and counsel for Father were present at the hearing, and Father, who was still incarcerated, participated by telephone. The court ultimately ordered that D.A. and C.A.\u2019s permanency plans be changed to custody and guardianship by a non-relative. The Department, in April of 2016, filed petitions for guardianship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of D.A. and C.A., and the court held a hearing on the Department\u2019s petitions in October of 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">At that hearing, Maggie Swink, one of the Department\u2019s assigned in-home services workers for D.A. and C.A., testified that, during her time as the Children\u2019s caseworker, the Department provided Mr. R. and Ms. D. with various in-home services, including weekly visits, assisting with clothing and food for the Children, offering referrals for therapy, and working with the couple on parenting techniques. Ms. Swink also testified that she contacted Father regarding placement for the Children and that Father provided two potential resources: his mother and a \u201cfictive relative that he called a cousin who was living in California.\u201d Ms. Swink could not locate Father\u2019s \u201ccousin\u201d but did manage to locate his mother, who indicated that she was not willing to be a resource at that time. Ms. Swink also reported that she tried to communicate with Father on other occasions and that she \u201csent him court reports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Hadassah Freed, who replaced Ms. Swink as the Children\u2019s caseworker in August of 2014, testified that Father was in prison the whole time she was his caseworker, that she only spoke with him \u201ctwo or three times,\u201d and that he tried to contact her only one time. Ms. Freed also testified that she mailed \u201cevery service agreement\u201d to Father but never received a signed service agreement in return. When asked about Father\u2019s phone contact with the Children, Ms. Freed responded that \u201cit wasn\u2019t frequently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">She also reported that Father informed her that he had family in the United States and that his mother was \u201cavailable in Mexico.\u201d She had \u201cphone conversations\u201d with his family in the United States, and she contacted the International Social Services regarding his mother. The International Social Services completed a home study with Father\u2019s mother, which, according to Ms. Freed, had been \u201cfavorable.\u201d Ms. Freed left the Department in April of 2015, before she could follow up on any of these resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Following Ms. Freed\u2019s departure, Kimberly McKay was assigned as D.A. and C.A.\u2019s caseworker. Ms. McKay reported that she made several attempts to reach Father by phone but was unable to do so. She also sent several service agreements to Father for him to sign, but Father never sent any back. Ms. McKay also spoke with Father\u2019s mother about \u201cpossibly coming here to the United States ... to care for the children,\u201d but she was \u201cdenied her visa to the United States.\u201d Ms. McKay stated that she later investigated Father\u2019s niece in Arizona as a potential resource, but the niece did not take the appropriate steps to initiate the process of becoming a resource. She also investigated Father\u2019s \u201ccousin\u201d in California and discovered that he was in the country illegally and without a known address.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the meantime, D.A. and C.A.\u2019s foster parents informed the Department that they could no longer care for the Children. In September of 2015, the Children were moved into the care of a new foster parent, Melanie R., with whom they now live. Ms. R. testified that the Children\u2019s adjustment into her home had gone \u201cextremely well,\u201d that they loved school and reading, and that they were involved in numerous activities, including soccer and Girl Scouts. Ms. R. also testified that the Children regularly attended therapy and that she had not seen any behavioral problems with the Children since they moved into her home. She added that the Children had requested that they not be addressed by their birth names (D.A. goes by \u201cS.\u201d and C.A. goes by \u201cM.\u201d). When asked about long-term plans for the Children, Ms. R. responded that \u201cthey\u2019re going to be adopted by me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Regarding the Children\u2019s relationship with Father, Ms. R. testified that the Children had been speaking with him by phone \u201cless than once a month\u201d but that the conversations had become more frequent in recent months. When Father and the Children spoke, there was \u201ca language barrier\u201d because Father spoke to the Children in Spanish, which neither child can speak fluently. Ms. R. reported that, during one conversation, Father suggested that he be allowed to live with her and the Children after his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>After their permanency plans had been changed to adoption, D.A. and C.A.\u2019s case was transferred to Susan Lonergan, a case manager with the Department\u2019s adoptions unit, in June of 2016. Ms. Lonergan testified that she conducted in-home visits with Ms. R. and the Children at least once a month and that she had no concerns about the Children\u2019s care under Ms. R. She reported that the Children were \u201calways clean\u201d and \u201calways appropriately dressed\u201d and that they were \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cappear comfortable.\u201d According to Ms. Lonergan, the Children never expressed an interest in speaking with Father. Ms. Lonergan also testified that she made frequent attempts to reach Father\u2019s case manager in prison but that \u201cthey never call back.\u201d She also stated that she sent several documents to Father but that she did not receive any response.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Lisa Cammauf, a family support worker with the Department, testified that she had been assigned D.A. and C.A.\u2019s case in November of 2014 and that she had worked with them ever since. Ms. Cammauf reported that she had been involved in several \u201cteam decision meetings\u201d in which Father participated by telephone and that she had assisted in answering questions that he had regarding the Children. During one meeting, she told Father that his ability to be a resource for the Children was limited because he was in prison, to which Father responded that \u201cwhen he gets out, no matter what, [D.A. and C.A.] are his children\u201d and \u201che will do everything he can to come back and... get his kids.\u201d Father reiterated this sentiment at a subsequent meeting in which he again participated by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Ida Johnson, a family therapist, testified that she had been treating D.A. and C.A. since July of 2014. Ms. Johnson reported that the Children had behavior problems when they first came into her care, including stealing, lying, wetting the bed, and fighting with their siblings. She attributed the Children\u2019s behavioral issues in part to the instability of their home life and having to continually adjust to new surroundings.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Regarding D.A. and C.A\u2019s current situation, Ms. Johnson reported that the Children had adjusted \u201cvery well\u201d to life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>with Ms. R.; that Ms. R. was \u201cvery committed\u201d to the Children\u2019s therapy; and, that Ms. R. and the Children were \u201cvery bonded\u201d and \u201cvery affectionate.\u201d She further stated that the Children were \u201cmaking significant progress adjusting to their new home\u201d and that they \u201cappear happy and comfortable with their surroundings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Father testified by telephone from prison, admitting that he is \u201can illegal alien\u201d and that, on at least two occasions, he had entered the United States illegally.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Father, it was his last entry into the United States, which occurred in December of 2013, that resulted in his being incarcerated. He also stated that he would not be released until July of 2017, at which time he would be deported to Mexico. Father asserted that he was not to blame for \u201ceverything that\u2019s happened\u201d and that he loved his Children and wanted to do \u201cabsolutely everything possible to be with them.\u201d He also claimed that after his deportation he would \u201cfind a way to come back\u201d but that if he could not \u201cGod will bless them anyway.\u201d Father stated that he had not seen D.A. or C.A. since 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">As to resources available to him, Father testified that his mother had been willing to care for the Children but that she had passed away prior to the hearing. He also reported that he had a cousin in California but that he did not know the cousin\u2019s name. As to the Department\u2019s efforts in providing services, Father testified that he and the Department had \u201chad meetings;\u201d that the Department told him that there were papers he needed to sign; that the Department had sent him letters \u201call about court hearings, meetings;\u201d and, that the Department sent him updates on the Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">At the close of the hearing, the court issued a written order terminating Father\u2019s parental rights and granting the Department the authority to consent to D.A. and C.A.\u2019s adoption. In so doing, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">The Juvenile Court finds after giving primary consideration to the health and safety of [D.A. and C.A.] and consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>to each of the relevant statutory factors, it is in the best interests of each minor child.. .to terminate the parental rights of [Father.]... He is not able to provide a safe and healthy environment for the children. [Father], has been incarcerated in a federal prison since December 2013, and is due to be deported to Mexico upon his release in July 2017, nine months from this hearing. He entered the U.S. illegally resulting in his incarceration. This is his second incarceration for illegal entry, and this second time he was incarcerated for transporting other illegal immigrants into the United States. He has not seen his children since sometime in 2012.... There has been some contact by telephone, once a week approximately these past few months.... The father has not provided care for his children in approximately four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">[D.A. and C.A.] want to remain in the care of their current foster mother who is an adoptive resource. They have adjusted well to their home and are in a stable and nurturing environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">The father is not in any better circumstance than when the children were placed in foster care in July 2014, 26 months ago, or even 11 months prior to that date when the mother asked [Mr. R.] to take her five children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">The Court finds that pre-placement services were not offered to the father because he was incarcerated in a federal prison in Louisiana beginning in December 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">The Department was able to locate [Father] at the federal prison and discussed with him by telephone the children\u2019s placement into foster care. In response to the request of the Department, [Father] provided the names of paternal relative residing in Mexico and [a] fictive relative, first name only, in the United States. The Department attempted to contact the relative by written correspondence, but at least initially, the paternal grandmother was not able to be a resource.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The Court finds that the extent, timeliness, and nature of the services offered to [Father] was reasonable given his out of state incarceration during the entire time the children were in foster care. The father was included by telephone in two Team Decision Making meetings: May 2015 and in February 2016.... The Department secured the assistance of interpreters and translators to ensure meaningful communication with [Father], The Department sent written documents, service agreements, letters and court orders, to [Father] in both English and Spanish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">Because the father was incarcerated.. .in federal prisons, not to be released until July 2017, but to be deported back to Mexico upon his release, any further attempts at reunification services to him were prohibitive and futile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">This Court finds that the Department has fulfilled its obligations under the agency service agreements with the parents, but that neither parent met its obligations in full under the service agreements. The Department attempted to enter into service agreements with the father, who did not return any document signed.... Although the father did not return a signed agreement to the Department, he did contact the Department by phone to confirm receipt of the first service agreement. The Department discussed with him by telephone service plans and obligations and court orders. At no time did he state to the Department that he did not understand what had been sent or explained to him about his children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">The Court finds that the father.. .is not a resource for his children. He indicated in a letter to the Department that his plan was to take the children to Mexico once established there. He also stated in both May 2015 and February 2016 that he was \u201cgoing to get\u201d his children, even if it meant his entering into the United States again illegally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">The Court finds that the Department made reasonable efforts to attempt to maintain regular contact with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>father by phone and mail service.... The Department made regular attempts to speak with him and his case manager. The Department attempted to arrange a translation service (\u201cLanguage Link\u201d) for the father (who speaks some English but [D.A. and C.A.] have some difficulty understanding him, and the foster mother does not speak Spanish) to facilitate communication with the children but the prison would not permit the service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">Contact between the father and foster mother, while feasible, has been minimal.... The father has been inappropriate. He asked the foster mother during one phone call to allow him to live with her when he is released from prison. She told him no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">The Court finds that the father has not contributed financially to a reasonable part of the child\u2019s care and support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">The Court finds that there has not been any evidence presented that the father has a disability that renders [him] consistently incapable of caring for the children\u2019s immediate and ongoing physical and psychological needs for long periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">This Court finds that additional services would not be likely to bring about a lasting adjustment so that the children could be returned to the father within an ascertainable time not to exceed 18 months from the date of placement. The children have been in care over 26 months. The children have been out of the care of the father, for over an estimated four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">This Court finds that [D.A. and C.A.] have adjusted to their community, foster home, and school. The Court further finds that there are no known or reasonably foreseeable negative feelings demonstrated by the children regarding the severance of the parent-child relationship and that the likely impact of the termination of parental rights on each child\u2019s well-being is positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAY\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Recently, the girls started to call themselves by different names....

In other words, \u201cwhen the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [juvenile court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 234, 372 A.2d 231 (1977). An abuse of discretion occurs when the court\u2019s decision is \u201c Veil removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 313, 701 A.2d 110 (1997) (quoting <em>North v.

Therefore, \u201cin all cases where the interests of a child are in jeopardy the paramount consideration is what will best promote the child\u2019s welfare, a consideration that is of \u2018transcendant importance.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 561, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994) (citation omitted). In other words, \u201cthe controlling factor in adoption and custody cases is not the natural parent\u2019s interest in raising the child, but rather what best serves the interest of the child.\u201d <em>In re No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d 201; <em>see also In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. 90, 111, 8 A.3d 745 (2010)(\u201c[W]hile the parental rights are recognized ... the child\u2019s best interest standard trumps all other considerations.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201cIn determining the child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court is required to consider the statutory factors in [Maryland Code, Family Law] FL \u00a7 5-323(d).\u201d <em>In re Jasmine D., </em>217 Md.App. at 734, 94 A.3d 837. Moreover, \u201c[i]n cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>where parental rights are terminated, it is important that each factor be addressed specifically not only to demonstrate that all factors were considered but also to provide a record for review of this drastic measure.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 87A262, </em>323 Md. 12, 19-20, 590 A.2d 165 (1991). If, based on these factors, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child\u2019s best interests are served by a termination of parental rights, the court may terminate said rights. <em>In re Jasmine D., </em>217 Md.App. at 734, 94 A.3d 837. As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">The court\u2019s role in TPR cases is to give the most careful consideration to the relevant statutory factors, to make specific findings based on the evidence with respect to each of them, and, mindful of the presumption favoring a continuation of the parental relationship, determine expressly whether those findings suffice either to show an unfitness on the part of the parent to remain in a parental relationship with the child or to constitute an exceptional circumstance that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child, and, if so, how. If the court does that\u2014articulates its conclusion as to the best interest of the child in that manner\u2014the parental rights we have recognized and the statutory basis for terminating those rights are in proper and harmonious balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>In re Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 501, 937 A.2d 177 (footnote and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The primary statutory factor the court must consider before terminating parental rights is \u201cthe health and safety of the child[.]\u201d FL \u00a7 5-323(d). The other factors the court must consider are, in relevant part: (1) the nature and timeliness of the services offered by the Department to the parent; (2) the extent to which the parent has fulfilled his obligations under a social service agreement; (3) the parent\u2019s efforts in adjusting his circumstances, condition, or conduct to make it in the child\u2019s best interest to be returned to the parent\u2019s care; (4) the extent to which the parent has maintained regular contact with the child, the child\u2019s caregiver, and the Department; (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the parent\u2019s financial contributions to the child\u2019s well-being; (6) whether additional services would likely bring about a lasting parental adjustment so that the child could be returned to the parent within a reasonable time not to exceed 18 months from the date of placement unless the court finds that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to extend the time period; (7) whether the parent has abused or neglected the child or another minor and the seriousness of the abuse or neglect; (8) the child\u2019s emotional ties with and feelings toward the parent and others who may affect the child\u2019s best interests; (9) the child\u2019s adjustment to community, home, placement, and school; and (10) the child\u2019s feelings about severing the parent-child relationship and the likely impact this severance would have on the child\u2019s well-being. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In addition to being mandatory considerations pri- or to a termination of parental rights, the factors outlined in FL \u00a7 5-323 also serve \u201cas criteria for determining the kinds of exceptional circumstances that would suffice to rebut the presumption favoring a continued parental relationship and justify termination of that relationship.\u201d <em>In re Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 499, 937 A.2d 177. Other criteria relevant to an exceptional circumstances determination include: the length of time that the child has been with his adoptive parents; the strength of the bond between the child and the adoptive parent; the relative stability of the child\u2019s future with the parent; the age of the child at placement; the emotional effect of the adoption on the child; the effect on the child\u2019s stability of maintaining the parental relationship; whether the parent abandoned or failed to support or visit with the child; and, the behavior and character of the parent, including the parent\u2019s stability with regard to employment, housing, and compliance with the law. <em>In re No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. at 562-64, 640 A.2d 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Viewing the court\u2019s decision in light of the above legal principles, we hold that the juvenile court in the instant case did not err or abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights. We are persuaded that the presumption favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ing a continued parental relationship between Father and the Children was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Father resided in the United States illegally around the time D.A. and C.A. were born and was ultimately deported in 2010 following a domestic violence incident involving the Children\u2019s Mother. Rather than adjust his circumstances and make legal efforts to obtain entry into the United States, Father, by his own admission, made another illegal entry into the United States in 2013, this time bringing other individuals with him. That resulted in his arrest and eventual incarceration in federal prison, where he remained through the date of the hearing on October 11, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Thus, for the vast majority of the Children\u2019s lives, Father made little to no effort in adjusting his circumstances to make the Children\u2019s living situation better or become more involved in the Children\u2019s lives. Although his incarceration made such adjustments difficult, that incarceration did not commence until December of 2013, which was at least a year after he last saw the Children. During that time, the Children were subjected to unacceptable living conditions, neglect, and possible sexual abuse while in the care of their Mother. Father, according to the evidence, did nothing to remedy that situation. In fact, other than Father\u2019s claim that he last saw the Children in 2012, there is little indication that he was even involved in the Children\u2019s lives at any time prior to his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Father maintained minimal contact with the Children during his incarceration, and any sort of parental bond was virtually non-existent at the time of the hearing. Not surprisingly, the Children expressed no real desire to speak with him or maintain the relationship. Other than Father\u2019s insistence that he \u201cloved\u201d the Children, there was no indication of any meaningful bond with the Children. On the other hand, the Children had developed a strong bond with their foster mother, Melanie R., with whom they had lived for over a year. The Children were adjusting extremely well in her care, were safe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and healthy, and were excited about the prospect of being adopted. While in Ms. R.\u2019s care, the Children did well in school, took part in activities, and participated in therapy, which their therapist indicated was progressing well.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Father argues that the record fails to establish how retaining the parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the Children\u2019s best interests. We disagree. Not only did he show a consistent disregard for the law and a general inability and/or unwillingness to provide a safe and stable environment for the Children prior to his incarceration, he also showed a general lack of regard for the Children\u2019s best interest during their time in foster care. He stated several times that \u201cno matter what\u201d he was \u201cgoing to get\u201d the Children, despite the fact that he had no legal right to do so, and he even expressed a desire to live with Ms. R. and the Children following his release from prison, even though neither Ms. R. nor the Children suggested that such an arrangement was feasible or desirable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Father also suggested that the Children could live with his \u201ccousin\u201d in California, even though he did not know the cousin\u2019s name or present any indication that this \u201ccousin\u201d was capable of caring for the Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">At the time of the hearing, Father was incarcerated and would not be released until July of 2017, nine months after the hearing and almost three years after the Children\u2019s date of placement. Moreover, Father was to be deported following his release, and there was no indication as to when or whether he would be able to come back to the United States to care for the Children. Despite his insistence that he planned to reenter the United States legally, Father offered no explanation for how he would manage to do so. In fact, Father admitted that he might not be able to come back into the country at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Father has taken no discernable steps toward ensuring that he would become more active in the Children\u2019s lives or how he planned to care for the Children following his release from prison and eventual deportation. Father offered no feasible resources available to him in the United States, no explanation of what he would do upon his release or how he would manage to reenter the United States, and no evidence that he was capable of even sustaining a relationship with the Children, much less providing them with a safe and healthy environment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Meanwhile, both D.A. and C.A. expressed an eagerness to move on with their lives. And, after having been subjected to substandard living conditions for three years and then shuttled through the foster-care system for the next two, the Children were finally living in a stable, supportive, and healthy home with someone who is qualified and willing to adopt them. Clearly, any impediment to the Children\u2019s relationship with Ms. R., including maintaining a parent-child relationship between the Children and Father, would be detrimental to the Children\u2019s best interest. Conversely, severing what little relationship the Children and Father have will likely have no negative impact on the Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Father argues that, although the Children may have adjusted well to life with Ms. R., that fact cannot trump his liberty interest in maintaining his parental relationship with the Children. He also argues that the length of time they were out of his care cannot be treated as dispositive. While we agree, generally, with those statements, Father has conflated the issues and misrepresented the court\u2019s determination. The court did not terminate Father\u2019s parental rights based solely on the Children\u2019s relationship with Ms. R. or the amount of time they were in foster care. Rather, these were but two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>many factors that the court considered in determining that it was in the Children\u2019s best interests to terminate their relationship with Father. And, as previously stated, a child\u2019s best interests <em>do </em>trump the parent\u2019s liberty interest in maintaining his relationship with a child. For these reasons, Father\u2019s reliance on <em>In re James G., </em>178 Md.App. 543, 603-04, 943 A.2d 53 (2008)(holding that the court\u2019s changing of a child\u2019s permanency plan was erroneous because the court failed to address the child\u2019s best interest while giving \u201cparamount consideration\u201d to the length of time the child was out of the parent\u2019s care); <em>Washington County Dept. of Soc. Serv. v. Clark, </em>296 Md. 190, 197, 461 A.2d 1077 (1983)(finding unconstitutional a Maryland statute that created a legal presumption that termination is in the best interest of the child when the child had been in foster care for two or more continuous years); and, <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Alonza D., Jr., </em>412 Md. 442, 468, 987 A.2d 536 (2010)(holding that the court\u2019s termination of parental rights was erroneous because \u201cthe judge focused primarily on the length of time [the children] had been in foster care and the apparent bond that had developed between [the foster parent] and the children\u201d while at the same time failing to show \u201chow a continued parental relationship would have caused a detriment to the children[.]\u201d) is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Father also contends that the Department \u201cdid not do enough to provide him with services during his incarceration\u201d and that \u201cthe services agreements did not meaningfully outline obligations for [him] to complete.\u201d Again, we disagree. As the court explained, pre-placement services were not offered to Father because he was incarcerated. When the Department spoke with Father about possible relative resources, he provided several names, all of which were investigated and ruled out by the Department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, any provision of services toward reunification would have been futile given that Father was incarcerated the entire time the children were in foster care. Nevertheless, the Department still provided the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ing services: including Father, via telephone, in certain meetings; securing the assistance of interpreters and translators; sending written documents, service agreements, letters, and court orders to Father in both English and Spanish; discussing service plans and court orders with Father; maintaining contact with Father by phone and mail service; and, making regular attempts to speak with Father and his case manager. The fact remains that no amount of services would have alleviated the primary obstacle to Father\u2019s ability to care for the children, namely, his incarceration and impending deportation. Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that the juvenile court\u2019s determination that the Department\u2019s provision of services was reasonable was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Finally, Father avers that the evidence showed only that he could not take custody of the Children immediately, which he claims did not \u201chave a direct bearing on whether the parental relationship should remain intact.\u201d On this point, <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. J970018, </em>128 Md.App. 242, 737 A.2d 604 (1999) is instructive. There, the appellant, James L., fathered a child in 1991 while in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 737 A.2d 604. At the time of the child\u2019s birth, James was serving a sentence of twenty years to life for first-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 737 A.2d 604. In 1997, the Department of Social Services filed a petition to terminate James\u2019 parental rights, and a hearing on the petition was held in 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 246-47, 737 A.2d 604. The juvenile court ultimately ordered James\u2019 parental rights terminated because of his incarceration. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that, while James was \u201ccoming up for\u201d parole in \u201ca couple of years,\u201d it was possible \u201cthat he could be in jail for the rest of his natural life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 737 A.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On appeal, James argued that the court erred in terminating his parental rights based on his incarceration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 245, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>737 A.2d 604. We disagreed, explaining that \u201c[g]iven the appropriate set of factual circumstances.. .incarceration may indeed, under the facts of a particular case, be a critical factor in permitting the termination of parental rights, because the incarcerated parent cannot provide for the long-term care of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 737 A.2d 604. Applying this principle to the facts of that case, we held that the juvenile court \u201cwas acting in the best interests of [the child] in terminating the parental rights of [James].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 737 A.2d 604. We reasoned that such a finding was not clearly erroneous because, had James\u2019 parental rights remained intact, the child\u2019s status would be \u201cplaced in suspended animation until 2001 or even beyond waiting for [James\u2019] potential for parole to be realized, an occurrence that the trial court noted may never come to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 737 A.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This case presents a similar situation. Despite Father\u2019s claims that he planned to legally come back to the United States following his deportation, he recognized that his reentry may never happen. Therefore, not only was he unable to take care of the Children immediately, or even in the immediate future, there exists the very real possibility that he may never be able to enter the United States legally. This distinct possibility is made even more probable in light of the fact that Father made no known efforts at securing legal entry in the years between the Children\u2019s birth and his incarceration in 2013. As was the case in <em>In re No. J970013, </em>maintaining Father\u2019s parental rights under these circumstances would have placed the Children\u2019s status in a state of suspended animation until a future date that may never occur. We cannot say, therefore, that the trial court was clearly erroneous or abused its discretion in finding that terminating Father\u2019s parental rights was in the Children\u2019s best interest. <em>See In re No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 106, 642 A.2d 201 (discussing Title 5 of the Family Law Article as being based on the premise \u201cthat it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>is in a child\u2019s best interest to be placed in a permanent home and to spend as little time as possible in foster care.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.
