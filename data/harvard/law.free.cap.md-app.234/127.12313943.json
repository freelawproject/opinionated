(\u201cDavid\u201d) was involved in attempted first-degree arson and reckless endangerment. At a subsequent disposition hearing, David was placed in the custody of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services (\u201cdepartment\u201d) and sent to an out-of-state facility for detention.</p> <p id=\"b165-5\" pgmap=\"165\">David now appeals, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence as to both findings of involvement.</p> <p id=\"b165-6\" pgmap=\"165\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p> <blockquote id=\"b165-7\" pgmap=\"165\">We have reworded David\u2019s questions for clarity, as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b165-8\" pgmap=\"165\">I. Was the evidence sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding of David\u2019s involvement in attempted arson?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b165-9\" pgmap=\"165\">II. Was the evidence sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding of David\u2019s involvement in reckless endangerment?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b165-10\" pgmap=\"165\">III. Did the juvenile court err in denying the motion to suppress an out of court identification?</blockquote> <p id=\"b165-11\" pgmap=\"165\">For the reasons stated below, we answer the first two questions in the negative. Accordingly, we vacate David\u2019s convictions, and we do not reach the third question.</p> <p id=\"b165-12\" pgmap=\"165\">FACTS</p> <p id=\"b165-13\" pgmap=\"165\">Nuzhat Nada provided testimony as to the following facts.</p> <p id=\"b166-4\" pgmap=\"166\">On March 21, 2016, Nada was at her residence at 205 Walnut Street, Salisbury, in Wicomico County. At 7:00 p.m. on that evening, Nada heard a noise at her door and walked over to open it. No one was standing at the doorway, but she observed a person running away. Nada later heard the noise a second time, and again opened the door to find no one there. She then stood by the door, waiting to hear the noise again. When the noise started for a third time, she immediately opened her door and saw David running from her doorstep, looking backwards over his shoulder. Nada then followed David to his house, at 121 Chestnut Street, with the intention of informing his mother about what had happened. However, Nada returned home without speaking to anyone at David\u2019s house.</p> <p id=\"b166-5\" pgmap=\"166\">A few minutes after returning home, Nada heard a noise at her door again. She opened the door to again see someone running away, and she saw two matches burning on the bricks in front of her door. Nada explained that the matches were about \u201cone and a half feet away from the door,\u201d and that she has \u201ca lot of wood and cones\u201d on her other porch.</p> <p id=\"b166-6\" pgmap=\"166\">Nada then called the police. She testified that while waiting for the police, she stood by the matches and let them burn because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to touch them.\u201d She testified that she did not extinguish the matches, but watched to make sure they did not fly off, fearing that the matches could ignite dry leaves at the side of the house \u201cbecause of the wind,\u201d Nada testified that the matches left scorch marks \u201con the bricks\u201d in front of the home and that she had photos of the marks. No such photos were offered as evidence.</p> <p id=\"b166-7\" pgmap=\"166\">The police arrived and Nada conveyed her account of what had happened. An officer took Nada to 121 Chestnut for a show-up identification. Beforehand, neighborhood residents spoke with Nada about their own experiences with David.</p> <p id=\"b166-8\" pgmap=\"166(38) 167(110)\">Officer Brian Weglarz testified next for the State. He confirmed responding to a call at 205 Walnut Street and meeting with Nada at her residence. Weglarz further testified that he observed \u201ctwo extinguished matches\u201d in front of the home on a concrete area attached to the front door. Weglarz described the matches as \u201cabout two inches in length, the cut that you would find out of a match book.\u201d On cross examination, Weglarz answered affirmatively when asked if Nada had extinguished the matches by stepping on them, and he also answered affirmatively when asked if Nada \u201chad to actually extinguish\u201d the matches. Weglarz further testified that he did not see scorch or burn marks on the porch. Finally, Officer Carroll testified for the State and provided testimony regarding the circumstances of the show-up identification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The above was the extent of the evidence actually presented at trial.</p> <p id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p> <p id=\"b167-6\" pgmap=\"167\">The Court of Appeals has remarked: \u201cIn a juvenile delinquency matter, an appellate court will \u2018review the case on both the law and the evidence.\u2019 We review any conclusions of law de novo, but apply the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact.\u201d In re Elrich S., 416 Md. 15, 30, 5 A.3d 27 (2010) (internal citation omitted). This Court has noted that \u201c[a] delinquent act is an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d In re Lavar D., 189 Md.App. 526, 585, 985 A.2d 102 (2009) (citing Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 3-8A-01(l)).</p> <p id=\"b167-7\" pgmap=\"167\"> Accordingly, as to the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings the same standard of review as in criminal trials:</p> <blockquote id=\"b167-8\" pgmap=\"167(63) 168(19)\">\u201cAppellate review of the [trial] court\u2019s judgment on the evidence is limited to determining whether there is a sufficient evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s underlying factual findings. [T]he appropriate inquiry is not whether the reviewing court believes that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather, whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b168-5\" pgmap=\"168\">Elrich S., 416 Md. at 30, 5 A.3d 27 (quoting In re Anthony W., 388 Md. 251, 261, 879 A.2d 717 (2005)); see also In re Kevin T., 222 Md.App. 671, 676-77, 114 A.3d 297 (2015).</p> <p id=\"b168-6\" pgmap=\"168\"> The State notes that circumstantial evidence suffices to affirm a conviction as long as \u201cthe circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d Painter v. State, 167 Md.App. 1, 11, 848 A.2d 692 (2004) (citation omitted). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as persuasive as direct evidence. With each, triers of fact must use their experiences with people and weigh probabilities.\u201d In re Lavar D., 189 Md.App. at 586, 985 A.2d 102 (quoting Mangum v. State, 342 Md. 392, 400, 676 A.2d 80 (1996)).</p> <p id=\"b168-7\" pgmap=\"168\"> The juvenile court, as the finder of fact, \u201cpossesses the ability to choose among differing inferences that might possibly be made from a factual situation and [the appellate court] must give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws.\u201d In re Landon G., 214 Md.App. 483, 491, 78 A.3d 431 (2013) (citations omitted). \u201cHowever, [w]hen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\" In re Antoine H., 319 Md. 101, 108, 570 A.2d 1239 (1990) (quoting Md. Rule 8-131(c)).</p> <p id=\"b168-8\" pgmap=\"168\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b168-9\" pgmap=\"168\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\u2014Attempted Arson</p> <p id=\"b168-10\" pgmap=\"168(30) 169(14)\"> David avers that the State failed to meet its burden for the charge of attempted arson, because it failed to prove the requisite mens rea for attempted first-degree arson\u2014a specific intent crime. Holbrook v. State, 364 Md. 354, 371, 772 A.2d 1240 (2001).</p> <p id=\"b169-4\" pgmap=\"169\"> The crime of first-degree arson is set out by statute:</p> <blockquote id=\"b169-5\" pgmap=\"169\">(a) A person may not willfully and maliciously set fire to or burn:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b169-6\" pgmap=\"169\">(1) a dwelling; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b169-7\" pgmap=\"169\">(2) a structure in or on which an individual who is not a participant is present.</blockquote> <p id=\"b169-8\" pgmap=\"169\">Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7 6-102(a). The statutory offense expands the universe of the buildings covered, but retains the common-law definition of arson which has four elements:</p> <blockquote id=\"b169-9\" pgmap=\"169\">(1) that the building burned was a dwelling house or outbuilding within the curtilage; (2) that the building burned was occupied by another; (3) that the building was actually burned, as mere scorching would not suffice; and, (4) that the accused\u2019s mens rea was willful and malicious.</blockquote> <p id=\"b169-10\" pgmap=\"169\">Holbrook, 364 Md. at 367, 772 A.2d 1240 (citation and footnote omitted). No arson takes place where \u201cthe fire is not communicated to any part of the structure itself.\u201d Hines v. State, 34 Md.App. 612, 618, 368 A.2d 509 (1977) (citation omitted).</p> <p id=\"b169-11\" pgmap=\"169\"> Both parties agree that arson is a specific intent crime. \u201cA specific intent is not simply the intent to do the immediate act but embraces the requirement that the mind be conscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act.\u201d Smith v. State, 41 Md.App. 277, 305, 398 A.2d 426 (1979). Applying this understanding to arson, the mens rea requires not only having an intent to do the immediate act of setting a fire, but also embracing the purpose of causing harm to person or property. Further, \u201c[m]ere knowledge that a result is substantially certain to follow from one\u2019s actions is not the same as the specific intent[.]\u201d Spencer v. State, 450 Md. 530, 567, 149 A.3d 610 (2016) (quoting Thornton v. State, 397 Md. 704, 738, 919 A.2d 678 (2007) (internal citation omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b170-4\" pgmap=\"170\">Although the State agrees that the \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d standard imposes a specific intent mens rea requirement, the State, first relying on Richmond v. State, 326 Md. 257, 604 A.2d 483 (1992), avers that \u201csetting a fire with reckless and wanton disregard for the consequences satisfies the willful and malicious requirement\u201d of the statute. Id. at 268, 604 A.2d 483 (citation omitted). \u201cWhile this reasoning may have been true in 1992 when Richmond was filed, it is not so today.\u201d Holbrook, 364 Md. at 371, 772 A.2d 1240. This is the case because the General Assembly repealed the arson statute in 1993, one year after Richmond, and enacted new definitional provisions defining \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cmaliciously.\u201d Id. \u201cMaliciously\u201d is defined as \u201cacting with intent to harm a person or property,\u201d CL \u00a7 6-101(c), and \u201cwillfully,\u201d is defined as \u201cacting intentionally, knowingly, and purposely.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6-101(e). Therefore, in order to be convicted of arson, a person must have acted \u201cwith intent to harm a person or property,\u201d and \u201cintentionally, knowingly, and purposefully.\u201d Holbrook, 364 Md. at 371, 772 A.2d 1240.</p> <p id=\"b170-5\" pgmap=\"170\">The State interprets the statutory change and Holbrook to require specific intent to do harm, but not more than reckless or wanton disregard for the consequences. The State posits that a person may be convicted where specific intent is found as to the conduct\u2014ie., the lighting of a match, but mere recklessness is found as to the consequences that follow\u2014\u00bfe., the burning of the building.</p> <p id=\"b170-6\" pgmap=\"170(139) 171(46)\">We find no merit in this position, as it ignores the concept of a specific intent crime as one in which the party has not only the \u201cintent to do the immediate act\u201d but where his mind is also \u201cconscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act.\u201d Smith, 41 Md.App. at 305, 398 A.2d 426. We also decline the State\u2019s invitation to examine the legislative history of the statute to determine the legislative intent to support the State\u2019s position. Rather, we continue to follow the standard stated in Hol-brook\u2014in order to be convicted of arson, a person must have acted \u201cwith intent to harm a person or property,\u201d and acted \u201cintentionally, knowingly, and purposefully.\u201d 364 Md. at 371, 772 A.2d 1240. Although David may have acted without regard for the consequences of his actions, following the General Assembly\u2019s abrogation of the common law, the State\u2019s assertion\u2014that specific intent to light a fire, but with only reckless and wanton disregard for the consequences, will satisfy the mens rea required for an arson conviction\u2014is incorrect.</p> <p id=\"b171-5\" pgmap=\"171\"> Here, David was charged with attempted arson rather than arson itself. A conviction for an attempt crime does not require completion of the crime, but rather \u201c[a] person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with intent to commit a crime, the person engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that crime whether or not his intention is accomplished.\u201d Grill v. State, 337 Md. 91, 94, 651 A.2d 856 (1995) (citation omitted).</p> <p id=\"b171-6\" pgmap=\"171\"> An attempt crime has a mens rea element of intending to commit the underlying crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dabney v. State, 159 Md.App. 225, 234-35, 858 A.2d 1084 (2004). \u201c[A] defendant must be charged with an attempt to commit a specifically designated crime, and it is to that crime one must look in identifying the kind of intent required.\u201d Young v. State, 303 Md. 298, 306 n.5, 493 A.2d 352 (1985) (citation omitted). \u201cIt is a mistake to speak of attempts generally as having a single monolithic intent element. Some attempts, to be sure, require a specific intent. Other attempts, however, require only a general intent. An attempt to commit a specific intent crime requires the same ultimate specific intent as would the consummated crime.\" Wieland v. State, 101 Md.App. 1, 40, 643 A.2d 446 (1994) (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b172-4\" pgmap=\"172\"> The \u201crequisite intent need not be proved by direct evidence.\u201d Young, 303 Md. at 306, 493 A.2d 352 (citation omitted). \u201cIt may be inferred as a matter of fact from the actor\u2019s conduct and the attendant circumstances.\u201d Id. (citations omitted).</p> <p id=\"b172-5\" pgmap=\"172\"> As discussed supra, arson is a specific intent crime, and because an attempt to commit a specific intent crime requires the same ultimate specific intent as the consummated crime, the exact question before us is whether the evidence sufficed to prove that David had the specific intent to willfully and maliciously set fire to Nada\u2019s home. \u201cSince intent is subjective and, without the cooperation of the accused, cannot be directly and objectively proven, its presence must be shown by established facts which permit a proper inference of its existence.\u201d Spencer, 450 Md. at 568, 149 A.3d 610 (citation and quotations omitted). Accordingly, our evaluation focuses on the circumstances surrounding David\u2019s actions, and the action itself, although we are looking to the actions to understand the actor\u2019s intent\u2014not to evaluate the actions for sufficiency of the actus reus.</p> <p id=\"b172-6\" pgmap=\"172\">David states that, \u201c[t]wo matchbook matches dropped on the flame-retardant landing in front of a home cannot constitute an overt act evincing specific intent to commit arson.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b172-7\" pgmap=\"172\">The facts again are as follows. After thrice causing a ruckus on her porch that brought Nada out of her home, David lit two matches and dropped them on the bricks of Nada\u2019s front stoop, about one and a half feet away from her door. He then ran away. A wicker doormat was nearby, and there were quantities of dry leaves around the side of the house. Nada also had \u201ca lot of wood and cones\u201d on her other porch.</p> <p id=\"b172-8\" pgmap=\"172\">Although ample case law illustrates conduct that satisfies the elements and constitutes an attempted arson, very little case law illustrates conduct that does not rise to required level. We look to both Maryland and our sister states for guidance.</p> <p id=\"b172-9\" pgmap=\"172(22) 173(53)\">In Maner v. State, 43 Ga.App. 772, 159 S.E. 902 (1931), the Court of Appeals of Georgia addressed the threshold for an attempt crime in an appeal related to attempted arson. The Court concluded that an attempted arson occurred, where \u201creasonable construction of the acts alleged ... force one to the conclusion that such acts were committed for no purpose other than to set fire to the building, and thereby commit arson.\u201d Id. at 903.</p> <p id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173\"> The presence of an accelerant is a common characteristic in convictions for arson. See State of Missouri v. Ailshire, 664 S.W.2d 630, 633 (Mo. Ct. App. 1984) (\u201cThe presence of gasoline splashed on the basement walls, gasoline vapors in the stairwell, and a fire burning on the bottom three steps, in close proximity to the basement door, constituted a \u2018substantial step\u2019 towards the commission of the offense of arson.\u201d). The use of an accelerant allows a reasonable inference of intent, because it forces one to the conclusion that the actor was intending to set fire to a building, as there is no other rational purpose for conduct such as splashing gasoline on building walls.</p> <p id=\"b173-6\" pgmap=\"173\">Here, the State points to the \u201cwicker mat nearby\u201d where David \u201cdropped two lit matches\u201d as evidence to support the finding of involvement. The State avers that David\u2019s \u201c \u2018overt act\u2019 of lighting the matches, coupled with the fact that he dropped them where he did, constituted a \u2018substantial step\u2019 towards the arson.\u201d The State seemingly asks that we infer the required intent from these actions. We agree that where David put the matches is relevant, but unlike the State, we believe that where he put the matches cuts against a finding of a malicious or willful intent to burning the dwelling. We explain.</p> <p id=\"b173-7\" pgmap=\"173(88) 174(56)\">Although flammable material was nearby, the matches were laid on an nonflammable material, and not on the wicker mat. Similarly, David could have easily collected the nearby pine-cones or dry leaves to create an accelerant, but he did not do so. Where he laid the matches supports the conclusion that David was a juvenile playing with matches, not that he lit the match intending to set a fire. If an adult struck a match and threw it into an empty brick fireplace, we would not say that person was building a fire. Rather, to show intent to build a fire, we would understand that the person must first gather logs and sticks, arrange them, and only then, strike and lay the match. The mere striking and laying of a match on an nonflammable surface alone does not show intent to start a fire.</p> <p id=\"b174-5\" pgmap=\"174\">Further, the intent requirement is that David intended to set a fire to cause harm. Because of his prior behavior, Nada immediately went onto the porch as soon as she heard noise again\u2014so quickly that she saw the matches still burning. David\u2019s behavior essentially put Nada on notice that mischief was occurring, allowing her to immediately respond to his subsequent actions, and thereby negating any remote chance that may have existed that the matches may have ignited nearby materials. This evidence is not a basis by which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that David did have an intent to harm, which is the State\u2019s burden and which was not met in this case.</p> <p id=\"b174-6\" pgmap=\"174\">The State seems to ask us to affirm that David acted with specific intent, because he took a substantial step by laying the matches near the mat, and that his actions fell short of completion because the wind did not blow in such a way to carry the lit matches to the mat, while also blowing in such a way to not extinguish the matches, all before Nada came to the porch, despite her previous appearances. This theory of the case requires an external, uncontrollable, factor to intervene in order for the crime to reach fruition and therefore, undercuts the finding of specific intent.</p> <p id=\"b174-7\" pgmap=\"174(98) 175(71)\">Rather than viewing his actions as circumstances from which we can infer intent to maliciously set fire to her home, we instead infer a lack of specific intent to start a fire in order to bum the building or to cause harm to Nada herself. A \u201creasonable construction of the acts alleged\u201d allows one to conclude that David was a reckless juvenile playing with matches, rather than facts which \u201cforce one to the conclusion that such acts were committed for no purpose other than to set fire to the building.\u201d Maner, 159 S.E. at 902-03. To allow a finding of involvement on these facts would allow a conviction for attempted first-degree arson every time that a person intentionally drops a still-burning cigarette butt on a sidewalk that happens to be feet away from a building where there are nearby leaves. This position completely ignores the requirement of intending to cause harm or acting purposefully or knowingly, and it expands the bounds of arson far beyond its original constraints.</p> <p id=\"b175-5\" pgmap=\"175\">For this reason and those discussed above, we conclude that the State failed to prove that David acted willfully or maliciously with an intent to bum the dwelling, and that no rational trier of fact could have found this essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Elrich S., 416 Md. at 30, 5 A.3d 27.</p> <p id=\"b175-6\" pgmap=\"175\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\u2014Reckless Endangerment</p> <p id=\"b175-7\" pgmap=\"175\"> Next, David asks if the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding of his involvement in reckless endangerment.</p> <blockquote id=\"b175-8\" pgmap=\"175\">CL \u00a7 3-204(a), provides, in relevant part:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b175-9\" pgmap=\"175\">(a) A person may not recklessly:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b175-10\" pgmap=\"175\">(1) engage in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] to another[.]</blockquote> <p id=\"b175-12\" pgmap=\"175(72) 176(53)\"> The State\u2019s burden in proving a charge of reckless endangerment is to show beyond a reasonable doubt that, \u201c1) that the defendant engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another; 2) that a reasonable person would not have engaged in that conduct; and 3) that the defendant acted recklessly.\u201d Perry v. State, 229 Md.App. 687, 697, 146 A.3d 529 (2016) (citation omitted). The aim of the criminal prohibition is \u201cto deal with the situation in which a victim is put at substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm but may, through a stroke of good fortune, be spared the consummated harm itself.\u201d Moulden v. State, 212 Md.App. 331, 355, 69 A.3d 36 (2013) (citation omitted).</p> <p id=\"b176-5\" pgmap=\"176\">Here, unlike above, David admits the required mens rea, recklessness, but avers that the State failed to prove the actus reus of the crime\u2014conduct that creates a substantial risk to another, In order to evaluate this claim, we look to what constitutes a \u201csubstantial risk.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b176-6\" pgmap=\"176\">For a risk to be \u201csubstantial\u201d it need not be \u201calmost certain to occur.\u201d Williams v. State, 100 Md.App. 468, 505, 641 A.2d 990 (1994). Rather, \u201c[i]t is enough .,. that one has created an unnecessary risk that his conduct might cause the harmful result.\u201d Id, (emphasis in original). \u201cIt is well established in Maryland that the actus reus of creating a substantial risk is to be measured objectively, not subjectively ... on the basis of the physical evidence in the case.\u201d Perry, 229 Md.App. at 700, 146 A.3d 529 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p> <p id=\"b176-7\" pgmap=\"176\">Much of the related case law in Maryland addresses situations where a party has recklessly brandished a firearm. Although not directly on point, the discussion and standards set by these cases do inform what types of conduct create a substantial risk.</p> <p id=\"b176-8\" pgmap=\"176(125) 177(18)\">To sustain a conviction for reckless endangerment in the case of a firearm, it is necessary to establish that the firearm was operable. Moulden, 212 Md.App. at 358, 69 A.3d 36 (\u201ccases hold that the risk of death or injury created in recklessly handling a loaded, operable firearm is that the weapon may discharge\u201d) (emphasis added). However, a loaded, and operable gun on its own also does not immediately create a substantial risk, and \u201ceven if a gun is fired, that standing alone, is not enough to constitute the commission of a crime.\u201d Perry, 229 Md.App. at 701, 146 A.3d 529 (citation omitted). Rather, there is sufficient evidence of a substantial risk when a person puts a loaded and operable firearm in a position to discharge lethal force at an individual. E.g., State v. Albrecht, 336 Md. 475, 505, 649 A.2d 336 (1994).</p> <p id=\"b177-5\" pgmap=\"177\">To analogize the risk of harm from a match to a gun, David asks that we view the risk from the two lit matches as analogous to the situation in Perry where \u201cshooting a pistol into the air or in the general direction of a roadway but considerably short\u201d was found to be insufficient to be considered a substantial risk. 229 Md.App. at 701, 146 A.3d 529 (citation omitted). We agree. As David identifies, force was created, but not related in any meaningful way towards a person. Because the matches were so overwhelmingly likely to burn themselves out on the nonflammable surface, as they did, they created no appreciable risk of spreading harm to the house, much less the person inside.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b177-6\" pgmap=\"177\">David also points us to a similar case from our sister state of New York, where the New York appellate court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"Ac\" pgmap=\"177\">Here, respondent lit a match, set the corner of a piece of paper on fire, and then dropped the piece of paper on the floor and stamped out the fire. The auditorium in which he was located had no carpeting, and no other students were in proximity to him. Although the seats in the auditorium were described as being made of wood, there was no proof that the seats could be set on fire by a single piece of burning paper. Because no risk of injury to any other person was actually created by the conduct of respondent, his conduct does not constitute reckless endangerment in the second degree. Consequently, the order must be reversed and the petition dismissed.</blockquote> <p id=\"b177-7\" pgmap=\"177\">In re Kysean D.S., 285 A.D.2d 994, 728 N.Y.S.2d 323, 324-25 (2001) (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b177-8\" pgmap=\"177(43) 178(43)\">The State again points to Nada\u2019s presence watching over the matches as a relevant fact of why the fire did not spread and asserts that the fire could have spread and caused Nada injury, but for her presence to prevent such harm. However, this argument once again ignores that Nada was immediately on the porch to watch or put out the matches, because she was on notice of David\u2019s misbehavior because of his own, immediately prior actions and mischief on her porch just moments prior.</p> <p id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178\">We agree with David that the likelihood that the matches would ignite the home and cause injury to Nada cannot be described as a \u201csubstantial risk.\u201d The juvenile court noted that the lit matches \u201cpotentially could have resulted in the house catching on fire and harm to both the house, and potentially, to Ms. Nada in this case.\u201d While the juvenile court is correct that these outcomes potentially could have occurred, that outcome is again reliant on an uncontrollable, external factor of the wind carrying the matches in such a way so as to keep them lit while blowing them to a combustible material, and ignores the aspects of his conduct that mitigated whatever very remote chance did exist. We cannot agree that the possibility of such an occurrence was likely enough for any rational trier of fact to conclude that it constituted a \u201csubstantial risk.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178(69) 179(16)\">The record does not disclose what motivated David to harass his neighbor. Certainly, a reasonable person in Nada\u2019s position could have perceived the implicit threat in David\u2019s behavior, namely that lit matches could just as easily be placed on flammable material. David\u2019s conduct might have been the basis for a finding of involvement with the criminal harassment, CL \u00a7 3-803,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but that is not the way that he was charged. For this reason, we reverse the juvenile court\u2019s finding of David\u2019s involvement with reckless endangerment.</p> <p id=\"b179-4\" pgmap=\"179\">Because we reverse both findings of David\u2019s involvement, we need not address the merits of the third question regarding the suppression of the show-up identification.</p> <p id=\"b179-5\" pgmap=\"179\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WI-COMICO COUNTY, SITTING AS A JUVENILE COURT REVERSED.
