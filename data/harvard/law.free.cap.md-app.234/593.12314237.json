All relevant activity leading to the merger of companies challenged in the underlying shareholder action occurred outside Maryland except one: the incorporation of a transitory merger subsidiary.</p> <p id=\"b635-11\" pgmap=\"635\">Gary W. Stisser and Fundamental Partners (\u201cAppellants\u201d) are not residents of Maryland, but they owned shares of common stock in SP Bancorp, Inc. (\u201cSP\u201d), which was a company headquartered in Texas and incorporated in Maryland. They filed a shareholder class action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City following the merger of SP into a newly formed subsidiary of Green Bancorp, Inc. (\u201cGreen\u201d)\u2014a bank holding company incorporated under Texas law with its principal place of business in Texas.</p> <p id=\"b635-12\" pgmap=\"635(33) 636(89)\">Appellants filed the lawsuit against SP and the individual members of SP\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cSP Directors\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cSP Defendants\u201d), and against Green and Green\u2019s newly-formed Maryland subsidiary, Searchlight Merger Sub, Inc. (\u201cSearchlight\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cGreen Defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 primary contention was that the SP Directors breached their fiduciary duty, aided and abetted by Green, in contriving the merger to advance their interests at the shareholders\u2019 expense. The circuit court granted motions to dismiss filed by the SP Defendants and the Green Defendants (together as \u201cAppellees\u201d), finding that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the SP Directors and Green, and that, although the court had jurisdiction over SP and Searchlight, Appellants failed to state a claim against them.</p> <p id=\"b636-5\" pgmap=\"636\">Appellants noted an appeal to this Court presenting four questions, which we have rephrased as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <blockquote id=\"b636-6\" pgmap=\"636\">1. By forming Searchlight in Maryland for the purpose of consummating a merger, did Green subject itself to personal jurisdiction in Maryland?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-7\" pgmap=\"636\">2. Are the SP Directors subject to personal jurisdiction in Maryland because the Articles of Merger were filed in Maryland?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-4\" pgmap=\"637\">3. Were SP and Searchlight necessary parties under Maryland Rule 2-211(a)?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-5\" pgmap=\"637\">4. Does the Complaint state a claim for relief against each of the Appellees?</blockquote> <p id=\"b637-6\" pgmap=\"637\">We hold that Green was not subject to specific jurisdiction in Maryland because (1) the quality and quantity of its contacts in Maryland in relation to the merger did not rise to the level of \u201ctransacting any business\u201d in Maryland within the meaning of Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute; and (2) Maryland\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction would not comport with traditional notions of due process under International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), given Green\u2019s limited and attenuated contacts in Maryland. In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions delimiting the authority of state courts to exercise general jurisdiction over nonresident corporations and corporate directors, we also conclude Green was not \u201cat home\u201d in Maryland for purposes of general personal jurisdiction. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., S.F. Cty., - U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1773, 198 L.Ed.2d 395 (2017) [hereinafter \u201cBristol-Myers\"]; BNSF Ry. Co. v. Tyrrell, - U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1549, 198 L.Ed.2d 36 (2017); Daimler AG v. Bauman, - U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 746, 187 L.Ed.2d 624 (2014); Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 131 S.Ct. 2846, 180 L.Ed.2d 796 (2011), Consistent with Daimler, we hold that a nonresident parent corporation is not subject to general jurisdiction in Maryland based solely on its incorporation of a subsidiary within Maryland. We also decline to impute SP\u2019s contacts to its directors, and hold that the SP Directors\u2014all nonresidents who never entered Maryland in connection with SP business\u2014 did not purposefully avail themselves of the privileges and protections of Maryland law.</p> <p id=\"b637-12\" pgmap=\"637\">In light of these holdings, we do not reach Appellants\u2019 third and fourth questions.</p> <p id=\"b637-13\" pgmap=\"637\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b637-14\" pgmap=\"637(18) 638(77)\">Back in October 2010, SP converted its business structure from a mutually-owned thrift to a stock-based ownership bank holding company. This conversion triggered federal regulations prohibiting the sale of SP for the next three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SP was incorporated in Maryland and served as the holding company and parent of SharePlus Bank, a Texas-chartered state bank. SP\u2019s principal place of business was in Texas, and the company did not have any offices or employees in Maryland. Indeed, according to the record on appeal, none of the SP Directors resided or were employed in Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638\">By mid-2012, the SP Directors began entertaining the idea of a possible merger with Green. On August 2, 2012, Mr. Jeffrey L. Weaver, SP\u2019s President, and Mr. Paul M. Zmigro-sky, the Chairman of SP\u2019s Board of Directors, met in Dallas, Texas with representatives from Green, \u201cduring which the representatives of Green initiated a high level discussion of a potential reverse merger with SP Bancorp following expiration of the three year restriction.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b638-6\" pgmap=\"638\">A. Preliminary Negotiations</p> <p id=\"b638-7\" pgmap=\"638(108) 639(15)\">In July of 2013, SP hired Commerce Street Capital (\u201cCSC\u201d), an investment banking firm, to help find potential candidates to merge with SP. The next month, representatives from SP and Green met again in Texas to discuss a potential merger. On September 14, 2013, CSC presented SP with an analysis of a merger of equals, using Green as the basis for a merger partner. At this presentation, CSC advised the SP Directors on different growth strategies, including the purchase of a smaller financial institution, a merger of equals, or acquisition by a larger financial institution. Over the next few months, Mr. Zmigrosky and Mr. Weaver held preliminary discussions with several candidates, including a larger bank that the parties referred to as \u201cParty A.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b639-4\" pgmap=\"639\">On January 9, 2014, from its headquarters in Texas, Green submitted a letter of intent to purchase SP for $43 million, representing approximately $25.91 per share. In the letter, Green proposed retention agreements for certain members of SP\u2019s senior management and non-compete covenants for the remaining SP Directors. The SP Directors met the next day at their headquarters in Texas to discuss Green\u2019s offer as well as the preliminary negotiations with Party A. At the meeting, the SP Directors decided to form a mergers and acquisitions subcommittee (\u201cCommittee\u201d), composed of Chairman Zmigro-sky and Directors Carl Forsythe, P. Stan Keith, and Jeff Williams. The Committee, in part, served to shield Mr. Weaver from merger negotiations due to the concern that, as President, Mr. Weaver was likely to be offered continued employment post-merger.</p> <p id=\"b639-5\" pgmap=\"639\">Throughout February, the Committee negotiated with and considered offers from Party A and a third entity. The most valuable offer came from Party A for approximately $23.78 per share comprised of cash and Party A stock. After learning of Party A\u2019s offer, Green revised its own offer, and increased the original offer price by approximately 21%. Ultimately, the Committee determined that Green\u2019s second offer was the best option, and on February 27, 2014, the Committee recommended that the full board of SP Directors accept Green\u2019s offer. In response, the SP Directors instructed the Committee to terminate negotiations with Party A and execute Green\u2019s non-binding letter of intent.</p> <p id=\"b639-6\" pgmap=\"639\">B. SP and Green Negotiate the Merger</p> <p id=\"b639-7\" pgmap=\"639(72) 640(47)\">Green and SP, through outside counsel, continued negotiations and conducted due diligence in Texas and in New York over the course of the next month. Then, on March 28, 2014, Mr. Weaver met with representatives from Green in Dallas to discuss the possibility of his post-merger employment with Green. Three days later, CSC disclosed to SP that it owned a 3% share in Green. The Committee met with its legal counsel to discuss CSC\u2019s potential conflict of interest and determined that CSC had no existing commercial relationship with Green but, to avoid any potential impropriety, the Committee decided to engage Mercer Capital Management, Inc. as an independent advisor to render a fairness opinion on the merger.</p> <p id=\"b640-5\" pgmap=\"640\">On April 24, 2014, the SP Directors met with counsel, CSC, and Mercer to discuss Green\u2019s proposal. At this meeting, Mercer offered its preliminary conclusions from its fairness inquiry, indicating a \u201cstrong comfort level\u201d that the merger met or exceeded SP\u2019s fair market value. Then, on May 1 and 5, 2014, the SP Directors met in Texas with legal counsel and the two financial advising firms to consider the merger. On May 1, the Committee provided the SP Directors with their recommendation to approve the merger. On May 5, Mercer issued its opinion that the merger was fair. Using multiple measures, Mercer valued SP in a range between $16.20 and $32.05 per share. Green\u2019s final proposed offer would pay $29.55 per share, which put the purchase price in the 96th percentile of Mercer\u2019s valuation\u2014a 24,26% increase from Green\u2019s initial offer and approximately 40% over the price at which SP\u2019s shares closed the day prior, This 40% difference between purchase price and market price of the shares represented the approximate cash payout for shareholders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mercer concluded that the merger with Green was \u201cfair, from a financial point of view, to [SP\u2019s] shareholders.\u201d At the meeting\u2019s conclusion, on May 5, the SP Directors voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement,</p> <p id=\"b640-6\" pgmap=\"640(70) 641(17)\">SP announced the merger agreement that same day and set August 15, 2014, as the record date for its special meeting, at which point then-current owners of SP common stock would be entitled to a vote at the special meeting. The special meeting, scheduled for October 8, 2014, in Plano, Texas, required a quorum of eligible voters, in person or by proxy, representing a majority of SP\u2019s 1,602,313 outstanding shares of common stock. Of those voting shareholders, the merger agreement required a bare majority for its approval.</p> <p id=\"b641-5\" pgmap=\"641\">C. Shareholders Institute a Class Action</p> <p id=\"b641-6\" pgmap=\"641\">Following SP\u2019s announcement, Mr. Stisser and Fundamental Partners filed class actions on June 10 and 12, 2014, respectively, on their own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated, against the Appellees and CSC in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circuit court thereafter granted the Appellants joint motion to consolidate their claims into a single action.</p> <p id=\"b641-7\" pgmap=\"641\">On August 25, 2014, SP filed its definitive proxy statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and sent copies of the statement from Texas to its shareholders, informing them it would hold a special shareholder meeting in Texas. Just over two weeks later, on September 10, the Appellants filed a motion for preliminary injunction in Baltimore, asking the circuit court to enjoin the merger. Meanwhile, in Texas, Green offered Mr. Weaver a position post-merger.</p> <p id=\"b641-8\" pgmap=\"641(117) 642(100)\">On October 3, 2014, SP filed a supplement to its original proxy, which it sent to the SEC and all shareholders. The supplement disclosed, among other things, that in 2013, SP \u201csold certain market rate loans made by SP [ ] to certain of its directors and officers to Green.\u201d It also explained that, as early as March 28, 2014, Green\u2019s President and CEO, Mr. Geoffrey D. Greenwade, expressed his intention to employ Mr. Weaver post-merger. For this reason, the supplement explained, Mr. Weaver \u201cwas expressly excluded\u201d from the Committee. Additionally, it disclosed the basis and methodology of Mercer\u2019s fairness opinion, including the factors Mercer considered in predicting SP\u2019s potential growth rate. Additionally, it explained the basis of the approximately 21% increase in Green\u2019s proposal, that Party A had expressed difficulty competing with a cash offer, and that Party A\u2019s second offer was \u201csubstantially equivalent to [its] prior proposal.\u201d Accordingly, the Committee believed Party A\u2019s offer would be \u201ceconomically dilutive to [SP] stockholders and subject to significant execution risk[,]\u201d and the Committee broke off negotiations with Party A because Green\u2019s offer \u201cpresented more value to [SP] stockholders^]\u201d SP postponed its special shareholder meeting from October 8 to October 15 \u201cin order to provide stockholders with additional time to consider the supplemental disclosures.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b642-5\" pgmap=\"642\">Back in Maryland, three days after SP supplemented its proxy statement, the circuit court held a conference call with the parties to discuss the status of the Appellants\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction. Following that call, Appellants sent the court a letter stating that they believed their claims were still viable, but conceding that it would \u201cbe difficult, if not impossible to demonstrate the requisite irreparable harm and balancing of the equities[]\u201d necessary to support a preliminary injunction. Consequently, Appellants asked the court to remove the next day\u2019s oral argument from the court calendar.</p> <p id=\"b642-6\" pgmap=\"642\">SP convened its special meeting in Texas on October 15, 2014, and 99.5% of the SP shareholders who voted cast their votes in favor of the merger, with 75.8% of the total outstanding shares voting in favor of the merger. SP, along with Searchlight, Green\u2019s newly formed subsidiary in Maryland, filed articles of merger with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation on October 17, 2014 (\u201cArticles of Merger\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As explained in the proxy statement,</p> <blockquote id=\"b642-7\" pgmap=\"642(46) 643(12)\">Searchlight Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Green, [was] a newly formed Maryland corporation created solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and ha[d] not carried on any activities other than in connection with the merger. The address of the Merger Sub [wa]s 4000 Greenbriar St., Houston, Texas[.]</blockquote> <p id=\"b643-5\" pgmap=\"643\">When SP and Searchlight effected the merger, Searchlight merged into and was subsumed by SP.</p> <p id=\"b643-6\" pgmap=\"643\">D. The Underlying Complaint</p> <p id=\"b643-7\" pgmap=\"643\">On November 7, 2014, Appellants filed an amended consolidated complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Complaint stated that the circuit court had jurisdiction over each SP Director for the following reasons:</p> <blockquote id=\"b643-8\" pgmap=\"643\">(a) [each Director] created continuing obligations invoking the benefits and protections of Maryland law between [himself/herself] and SP Bancorp, which was incorporated in, and hence a resident of, this State at the time of the actions challenged herein; and (b) [each Director\u2019s] improper conduct alleged in this Complaint occurred in substantial part, was directed at, intended to have its primary effect in, and/or culminated in purposeful actions in, this State.</blockquote> <p id=\"b643-9\" pgmap=\"643\">The Complaint alleged that collectively, the SP Directors,</p> <blockquote id=\"b643-10\" pgmap=\"643\">acting deliberately, dishonestly, breached their fiduciary duties to SP Bancorp\u2019s public shareholders by acting to cause or facilitate the [Merger] Agreement[.] ... The [Merger] Agreement was not in the best interests of SP Bancorp\u2019s shareholders, but was, and is, in the best interests of the Individual Defendants. This is particularly true of Mr. Weaver, who received significant personal profits as a result of the [Merger] Agreement and fully expected to be employed by the surviving company following consummation of the [Merger] Agreement.</blockquote> <p id=\"b643-11\" pgmap=\"643\">The Complaint also asserted that to \u201cexert influence\u201d over the SP Directors, Green purchased SP\u2019s outstanding loans to Directors Williams, Forsythe, and Cozby during the summer of 2013. Additionally, Appellants suggested that the SP Directors were self-interested in the merger agreement because it entitled them to cash payments for unvested stock options as well as a \u201cchange in control\u201d severance payment.</p> <p id=\"b644-4\" pgmap=\"644\">Counts I\u2014III alleged that the SP Directors breached their fiduciary duties; aided and abetted Mr. Weaver\u2019s breaches of loyalty, fair dealing, and due care;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and breached their duty to disclose all material facts in the proxy statement. In Count IV, Appellants alleged that Green aided and abetted the SP Directors\u2019 alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by (1) promising Mr. Weaver post-merger employment; (2) discussing the merger within the three-year period following SP\u2019s conversion from a mutually-owned thrift, during which federal regulations prohibited SP from negotiating a merger; (3) purchasing loans owed by the SP Directors to exert undue influence over them; (4) concealing from the SP Directors that CSC was a shareholder in Green; (5) soliciting a No Solicitation Clause; (6) negotiating the merger with an intent to exploit the SP Directors\u2019 conflicts of interest; (7) negotiating a termination fee should the merger break down; and (8) agreeing to indemnify the SP Directors. Finally, in Count V, the Complaint asserted a claim against CSC for aiding and abetting the SP Directors\u2019 alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.</p> <p id=\"b644-5\" pgmap=\"644\">E. Motions to Dismiss</p> <p id=\"b644-6\" pgmap=\"644\">On December 19, 2014, the SP Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint against them, arguing that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the SP Directors and that the Complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted against the SP Defendants. The motion included an affidavit of Director Williams, in which he attested that he was an SP Director prior to the merger and:</p> <blockquote id=\"b644-7\" pgmap=\"644\">3. SP Bancorp, Inc. has at all times since its formation had its corporate offices in Plano, Texas. SP Bancorp, Inc., has not had any branch or office in Maryland, and has not conducted any corporate business in Maryland.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-3\" pgmap=\"645\">4. The banks previously owned and operated by SP Ban-corp, Inc. were all located in the greater Dallas, Texas area, Louisville, Kentucky and Irvine, California.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-4\" pgmap=\"645\">5. The meetings of the SP Directors took place in Plano, Texas or sometimes by phone from Plano, Texas.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-5\" pgmap=\"645\">6. The SP directors all live in Texas. Paul Zmigrosky also has a residence in Michigan. Carl Forsythe also has a residence in Massachusetts.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-6\" pgmap=\"645\">7. On January 10, 2014, the SP Directors formed a Strategic Review Committee ... to consider potential strategic transactions involving SP Bancorp. I was a member of that committee. The [ ] committee held its meetings in Texas, or by phone from Texas.</blockquote> <p id=\"b645-7\" pgmap=\"645\">The SP Defendants refuted Appellants\u2019 claim that SP was sold under value by pointing out that the merger was approved unanimously by all ten SP Directors, and that each owned substantial stock in the company and, therefore, had a personal interest in achieving the maximum sale price for the sale of SP. They also contended that other than Mr. Weaver, none of the remaining nine Directors were alleged to have any potential role in the surviving bank and, \u201clike the other SP Bancorp shareholders, the SP Directors\u2019 ownership interest was completely extinguished by the cash-out Merger.\u201d Therefore, the Appellants based their Complaint \u201con the implausible assertion that all nine of the disinterested SP directors approved a merger that was contrary to each of their financial interests solely because Mr. Weaver might obtain a job with the surviving bank.\u201d Regardless, they argued, the SP Directors were not subject to jurisdiction in Maryland because SP is a \u201cphantom\u201d corporation, with none of its operations taking place in Maryland\u2014it\u2019s headquartered in Texas and operates in Texas, Kentucky, and California.</p> <p id=\"b645-8\" pgmap=\"645(49) 646(217)\">The Green Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the claims against Green for lack of personal jurisdiction, and to dismiss the claims against both Green Defendants for failure to state a claim. They asserted that Maryland lacked personal jurisdiction over Green because all of the conduct on which Appellants based their claims occurred outside of Maryland and Green had no other connection to the forum. Additionally, they argued that Appellants failed to state a claim against Searchlight, because they \u201cd[id] not make a single allegation about any conduct, let alone wrongful conduct,\u201d by Searchlight. Included with their motion was an affidavit by Mr. Greenwade, who attested that Green was incorporated and headquartered in Texas with \u201cno offices or employees in Maryland.\u201d He further attested that Green does not solicit business in Maryland, \u201chas no local address or local telephone number[,]\u201d and \u201cno agent to accept service in Maryland.\u201d In regard to the merger, he specified that no merger negotiations occurred in Maryland; that Green sent the letter of intent from Texas to the SP Directors in Texas; that SP responded by sending a letter to Green in Texas; that the parties negotiated in Texas and through counsel in New York; that Green conducted due diligence at SP\u2019s offices in Texas; that Green offered employment to Mr. Weaver by telephone in Texas; that Green signed the merger agreement in Texas and that he (Greenwade) believed that SP did as well; that the SP shareholders voted at a meeting in Texas; and that Green purchased the loans of several SP Directors from its offices in Texas.</p> <p id=\"b646-4\" pgmap=\"646(136) 647(33)\">Appellants countered that the SP Directors were subject to jurisdiction in Maryland because they \u201ctransacted business\u201d in the forum by causing the merger between SP and Searchlight to be consummated in Maryland with the filing of the Articles of Merger. Appellants also contended that the SP Directors were subject to jurisdiction because the alleged tortious conduct\u2014breaching their fiduciary duties\u2014was not complete until the merger was consummated in Maryland. Exercising jurisdiction would satisfy due process, Appellants argued, because the SP Directors chose to consummate the merger in Maryland and chose Maryland law to govern the merger. Appellants insisted that \u201cthe formation of a Maryland corporation to acquire another Maryland corporation and the consummation of that acquisition in Maryland is precisely the sort of \u2018significant activity\u2019 in Maryland that supports long arm jurisdiction.\u201d Jurisdiction would comport with due process, according to Appellants, because Green purposefully availed itself of Maryland law by choosing to organize Searchlight under Maryland law rather than the law of another state.</p> <p id=\"b647-4\" pgmap=\"647\">The circuit court held a hearing on Appellees\u2019 motions on March 27, 2015. Subsequently, in a Memorandum Opinion and Order issued on April 8, 2015, the court dismissed the actions against Green and the SP Directors for lack of personal jurisdiction and/or failure to state a claim, and dismissed the actions against Searchlight and SP for failure to state a claim. The court began with some general observations: neither SP nor Green had offices in Maryland or solicited business within the state; none of the SP Directors resided in Maryland; Green initiated merger negotiations in Texas; Green sent the letter of intent from Texas to SP in Texas; SP responded by sending its own letter to Green within Texas and negotiations continued in Texas and New York; and Green conducted due diligence in Texas.</p> <p id=\"b647-5\" pgmap=\"647(175) 648(11)\">The court ruled that Green was not subject to general jurisdiction in Maryland based on its incorporation of Searchlight in the state and that the Appellants otherwise \u201cfailed to show a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between Green and Maryland, as they have not demonstrated that Green engaged in \u2018significant activities\u2019 or \u2018created continuing obligations\u2019 in Maryland.\u201d Appellants, according to the court, provided no substantive support for their \u201cprincipal-agent\u201d theory between Green and Searchlight, only \u201cvaguely allud[ing]\u201d that Green was Searchlight\u2019s alter ego. Further, the filing of the Articles of Merger, which incorporated Searchlight, was not a \u201cpurposeful tortious act\u201d under Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute, and no injury was felt in Maryland because Searchlight\u2019s incorporation was not central to the case. The court noted that \u201cSearchlight did not exist until after the parties agreed to the Merger.\u201d Green did not \u201cinvoke\u201d the benefits of Maryland law, the court continued; instead, it selected Delaware law to govern the merger and purchased a business that did not operate within Maryland. The court concluded that Maryland has neither general nor specific personal jurisdiction over Green, after observing the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b648-4\" pgmap=\"648\">Plaintiffs have provided no support for their argument that forming a subsidiary is a \u201csignificant activity\u201d that supports long-arm jurisdiction. Green has not engaged in \u201csignificant activities\u201d or \u201ccreated continuing obligations\u201d in Maryland, Green is incorporated in Texas and has its headquarters in Houston. All of its branches are in Texas, except a branch in Kentuckyt,] which was established subsequent to the Merger. Green has no local offices in Maryland nor does it conduct, transact, or solicit business in Maryland.

No merger negotiations occurred in Maryland, and all of the meetings between Green and SP [] occurred in Texas, except for negotiations by counsel in New York.</blockquote> <p id=\"b648-5\" pgmap=\"648\">Turning to the SP Directors, the court ruled that Appellants failed to prove that the Directors purposefully availed themselves of the laws of Maryland. The court ruled that mere acceptance of a directorship is not enough to subject the SP Directors to personal jurisdiction, reasoning that, unlike states such as Delaware, Maryland has not adopted a statute subjecting corporate directors to personal jurisdiction based on their acceptance of a directorship. Further, the court held, SP\u2019s conduct was not attributable to its Directors. It was SP\u2014not the SP Directors\u2014that signed and filed the Articles of Merger in Maryland. All of the SP Directors\u2019 conduct\u2014the directors\u2019 meetings, shareholder meetings, and merger negotiations\u2014 occurred in Texas and New York. Consequently, the court concluded, the SP Directors lacked minimum contacts in Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b648-6\" pgmap=\"648\">The court then dismissed the claims against Searchlight and SP, ruling that Appellants failed to state a claim against those defendants because the Complaint asserted no allegations against either Searchlight or SP.</p> <p id=\"b648-7\" pgmap=\"648(16) 649(26)\">For about six months following Appellees\u2019 dismissal from the action, Appellants\u2019 litigation continued against CSC until Appellants agreed to dismiss with prejudice their claim against CSC.

Id. at 464, 983 A.2d 492. The Supreme Court has long held that the Fourteenth Amendment limits the power of state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants. Int'l Shoe, supra, 326 U.S. at 311, 321, 66 S.Ct. 154; Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 733, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1877). In the seminal case of International Shoe, the Supreme Court ruled that the Due Process Clause limits a state\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign or out-of-state defendant to circumstances in which a defendant has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154 (quoting Milliken v.

This burden includes not just the practical and logistical aspects of litigation but \u201cthe more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a state that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.\u201d Id. In this way, \u201crestrictions on personal jurisdiction \u2018are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective states.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)). Still, following International Shoe, \u201c \u2018the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually exclusive sovereignty of the States ... became the central concern of the inquiry into personal jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d Daimler, supra, 134 S.Ct. at 754 (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977)). Thereafter, courts applying the concept of \u201cfair play and substantial justice\u201d developed two categories of personal jurisdiction in cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants: general (or all-purpose) jurisdiction and specific (or case-linked) jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court has recently explained general jurisdiction by way of analogy to an individual defendant\u2019s domicile: general jurisdiction exists when a corporation is \u201cat home\u201d in the forum state.

Several months ago, the Supreme Court reiterated this point. In Bristol-Myers, the Court held that the \u201csettled principles\u201d of specific jurisdiction \u201cprovide no support\u201d for a \u201csliding scale\u201d approach that treats personal jurisdiction as if it exists on a continuum, permitting states to exercise specific jurisdiction over corporations not at home in the state based off of the volume of general forum contacts the corporation has unrelated to the claim at issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 137 S.Ct. at 1780.</p> <p id=\"b653-4\" pgmap=\"653\">II.</p> <p id=\"b653-3\" pgmap=\"653\">Green</p> <p id=\"At6V\" pgmap=\"653(16) 654(63)\">Appellants contend that Maryland has jurisdiction over Green based on both modalities of personal jurisdiction. First, they maintain that Green is subject to general jurisdiction in Maryland because of Searchlight\u2019s presence in the state, given that Searchlight is Green\u2019s mere instrumentality. Second, they claim Maryland can exercise specific jurisdiction over Green by way of its long-arm statute because the company \u201ctransacted business\u201d in the state when it formed Searchlight under Maryland law and consummated the merger in Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654\">A. General Jurisdiction</p> <p id=\"b654-6\" pgmap=\"654\">Appellants do not contend that Green is \u201cat home\u201d in Maryland. Instead, they claim that Green is subject to general jurisdiction in Maryland by virtue of its ownership of Searchlight. According to Appellants, Green formed Searchlight as an instrumentality, or alter ego, for the sole purpose of engaging in the merger, and exercised complete control over Searchlight until the merger was completed, at which point Searchlight ceased to exist. Appellants maintain that Maryland law permits courts to attribute a subsidiary\u2019s actions to its foreign parent corporation when the parent is \u201cclosely allied\u201d with the subsidiary and exercised \u201cactual supervision and control\u201d over its activities. Harris v. Arlen Props., Inc., 256 Md. 185, 199-200, 260 A.2d 22 (1969); Thomas v.

First, Green contends that its formation of a subsidiary in Maryland is insufficient under Daimler, 134 S.Ct. at 759-60, to subject it to general jurisdiction here. Second, Green observes that Appellants failed to allege any facts that would have allowed the court to pierce the corporate veil between Searchlight and Green. And, citing to Daimler again, Green points out that even if we were to impute Searchlight\u2019s contacts to Green, such contacts alone are still insufficient to establish general jurisdiction over it.</p> <p id=\"b655-5\" pgmap=\"655\">Until recently, the Supreme Court addressed general jurisdiction infrequently. In fact, from 1952 to 2011, the Court issued only two opinions in which general jurisdiction was the central issue. See Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 418, 104 S.Ct. 1868 (holding that \u201cmere purchases [made in the forum state], even if occurring at regular intervals, are not enough to warrant a State\u2019s assertion of [general] jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions\u201d (footnote omitted)); Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 447-48, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952) (holding that a foreign corporation was subject to general jurisdiction in Ohio, its principal, albeit a limited-wartime place of business, and that it did not violate due process for Ohio to adjudicate a controversy that did not arise in that forum).</p> <p id=\"b655-6\" pgmap=\"655(124) 656(125)\">In the intervening 60 years, the Court of Appeals of Maryland and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, consistent with International Shoe, Perkins, and Helicopteros, examined Maryland\u2019s ability to exercise general personal jurisdiction over corporations based on the companies\u2019 \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts in the state. See, e.g., Carefirst of Md., Inc. v. Carefirst Pregnancy Ctrs., Inc., 334 F.3d 390, 397 (4th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted); CSR, Ltd., 411 Md. at 477-78, 983 A.2d 492 (further explaining that the defendant must have also \u201cpurposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the State,\u201d and then once minimum contacts are established within the forum state, those contacts must be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction comports with \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u201d (citations omitted)). Then, in 2011, 2014, and again just this year, the Supreme Court revisited the general jurisdiction doctrine. See BNSF By. Co., 137 S.Ct. at 1558-59; Daimler, 134 S.Ct. at 760-62; Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 923-29, 131 S.Ct. 2846. The Court in Daimler explained that the proper \u201cinquiry under Goodyear is not whether a foreign corporation\u2019s in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense \u2018continuous and systematic[;]\u2019 it is whether that corporation\u2019s \u2018affiliations with the State are so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Daimler, 134 S.Ct. at 761 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919, 131 S.Ct. 2846).</p> <p id=\"b656-5\" pgmap=\"656\">The plaintiffs in Daimler were 22 residents of Argentina who brought suit in federal district court in California against DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (\u201cDaimler\u201d), a German company. Id. at 750-51. Plaintiffs alleged that Daimler\u2019s subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argentina (\u201cMB Argentina\u201d), collaborated with State security forces during Argentina\u2019s 1976-1983 \u201cDirty War\u201d to \u201ckidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs.\u201d Id. The plaintiffs predicated jurisdiction on a theory of general jurisdiction based on the California contacts of another Daimler subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (\u201cMBUSA\u201d), which was incorporated in Delaware and principally located in New Jersey but did business in California. Id. at 751.</p> <p id=\"b656-6\" pgmap=\"656(65) 657(133)\">The federal district court granted Daimler\u2019s motion to dismiss, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the theory that a state can exercise jurisdiction over a parent corporation if its subsidiary performed \u201csufficiently important\u201d services within the forum state. Id. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit \u201clooked to whether the parent enjoys \u2018the right to substantially control\u2019 the subsidiary\u2019s activities.\u201d Id. at 760 n.15 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court, however, rejected both the \u201csufficiently important\u201d and \u201csubstantial control\u201d test. Id. at 769-60 &amp; n.15. The Court explained that \u201cin no event\u201d could the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis be sustained because it would \u201csubject foreign corporations to general jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond even the \u2018sprawling view of general jurisdiction\u2019 [the Court] rejected in Goodyear.\u201d Id. at 759-60 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 929, 131 S.Ct. 2846), The Court disapproved of the exercise of general jurisdiction over a corporation \u201cin every State in which a corporation engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business\u201d reasoning that such a formulation was \u201cunacceptably grasping.\u201d Id. at 760-61 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b657-4\" pgmap=\"657(71) 658(65)\">Daimler expressly rejected an approach that would subject a foreign corporation to general jurisdiction based on its control of a subsidiary resident in the forum state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id. at 759-60; see also Vitro Elecs. v.

And in BNSF Ry. Co., the Supreme Court underscored that \u201cin-state business, as we clarified in Daimler and Goodyear, does not suffice to permit the assertion of general jurisdiction over claims ... that are unrelated to any activity occurring\u201d in the forum state. BNSF Ry. Co., 137 S.Ct. at 1559.</p> <p id=\"b658-5\" pgmap=\"658\"> Applying the foregoing legal precepts to the facts before us, we hold that Green cannot be said to be \u201cat home\u201d in Maryland with no contact in Maryland save for the fleeting existence of its merger subsidiary, Searchlight. See Daimler, 134 S.Ct. at 760 (citing Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 923, 131 S.Ct. 2846). Consistent with Daimler, we hold that a nonresident parent corporation is not subject to general jurisdiction in Maryland based solely on its incorporation of a subsidiary within Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b658-6\" pgmap=\"658(139) 659(141)\"> Appellants seek to distinguish Daimler by pointing to the fact that they allege Searchlight is an alter ego, while the plaintiffs in Daimler made no similar allegation. On this limited point, Appellants are correct\u2014they have, in fact, alleged Searchlight is an alter ego, but they have failed to establish either the validity or the relevance of that allegation. They make no showing (or argument), for example, that Searchlight was fraudulently incorporated<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or that Green and Searchlight failed to keep \u201cseparate records, separate and distinct accounting procedures, separate corporate books, and held separate directors\u2019 meetings.\u201d See Vitro, 255 Md. at 504-06, 258 A.2d 749 (refusing to pierce the corporate veil and \u201cadopt a doctrine which ... would have the effect of breaking down observed distinctions between parent and subsidiary corporations, where fraud or deception is not present\u201d). More importantly, however, regardless of whether Searchlight was Green\u2019s alter ego, Appellants\u2019 general jurisdiction argument would still fail under Daimler. Appellants urge us to pierce the corporate veil of Searchlight to reach Green. Were we to do that, we would be back to examining Green\u2019s jurisdictional contacts in Maryland\u2014of which its incorporation of Searchlight is the only one. Even if Green created a Maryland corporation as its alter ego, Green would remain subject to general jurisdiction only where it is \u201cat home,\u201d which is normally its \u201cplace of incorporation and its principal place of business.\u201d BNSF Ry. Co., 137 S.Ct. at 1552 (citation omitted). Appellants\u2019 concession that \u201cSearchlight ceased to exist after the merger\u201d only underscores the point that the evanescent existence of Searchlight in Maryland could not have created even one continuing contact or affiliation by Green in Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b659-5\" pgmap=\"659\">B. Specific Jurisdiction</p> <p id=\"b659-6\" pgmap=\"659\"> Appellants argue that forming a Maryland corporation to acquire another Maryland corporation and consummating that merger in Maryland is \u201csignificant activity\u201d bringing Green within reach of Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute. To support the point that Green invoked the protection of Maryland law by creating Searchlight, Appellants rely mainly on Delaware cases, such as Sternberg v. O\u2019Neil, 550 A.2d 1105, 1123 (Del. 1988), which they contend are consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Sleph v. Radtke, 76 Md.App. 418, 429, 545 A.2d 111 (1988). Appellants claim that the fact that Green was a party to the merger agreement, which called for the filing of the Articles of Merger in Maryland, is controlling and that it is irrelevant that the merger was negotiated outside of Maryland and that Green did not sign the Articles of Merger.</p> <p id=\"b659-7\" pgmap=\"659(56) 660(97)\">Appellants assert that Maryland has a substantial and legitimate interest in providing a forum to resolve claims involving the corporate fiduciaries of Maryland corporations. Although Appellants again cite Delaware case law to support this proposition, Parfi Holding AB v. Mirror Image Internet, 794 A.2d 1211, 1230 (Del. Ch. 2001), they seek to incorporate Maryland law by contending that this interest is consistent with the \u201cinternal affairs\u201d doctrine, which dictates that Maryland corporation law is the province of Maryland courts. Storetrax.com, Inc. v. Gurland, 397 Md. 37, 52, 915 A.2d 991 (2007) (\u201c \u2018[Ojnly one State should have the authority to regulate a corporation\u2019s internal affairs\u2014matters peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers, directors, and shareholders\u2014because otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edgar v.

Relying in large part on Vitro, supra, Green asserts that Appellants do not and cannot claim that the act of incorporating Searchlight or the filing of the Articles of Merger were themselves wrongful or that these were the acts giving rise to their substantive claims.</p> <p id=\"b660-5\" pgmap=\"660\">It is telling, Green suggests, that Appellants rely on unpublished Delaware decisions rather than the rules the Supreme Court has enumerated. For example, Green contends that applying the Burger King analysis, Appellants \u201chave not, and cannot, show a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between Green and Maryland, because Green has not engaged in \u2018significant activities\u2019 or \u2018created continuing obligations\u2019 in Maryland.\u2019 \u201d Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475-76, 105 S.Ct. 2174. Green contends, citing Aphena Pharma Solutions-Md. LLC v. BioZone Labs. Inc., 912 F.Supp.2d 309, 315 (D.

In CSR, Ltd., the defendant-petitioner, Colonial Sugar Refining Co., Ltd. (\u201cCSR\u201d), was an Australian company that acted as the exclusive U.S. distributor for its wholly-owned subsidiary, which was also an Australian company. Id. at 465, 983 A.2d 492. CSR sold asbestos to customers outside of Maryland, but some of its product passed through the Port of Baltimore. Id. The plaintiff-respondents were the personal representatives of two men who worked as stevedores at the Port and eventually died from mesothelioma, which they contended was caused by asbestos exposure at the Port. Id. at 464, 983 A.2d 492. CSR challenged whether its conduct fell within the scope of Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute, arguing that it never purposefully directed its goods toward the state; it \u201cnever conducted or solicited any business in Maryland;\u201d it was \u201cnever incorporated or licensed to do business in Maryland;\u201d it \u201cnever appointed an agent for the purpose of accepting service of process in Maryland;\u201d and it \u201cnever maintained an office, telephone listing, mailing address, or bank account in Maryland, nor did it own, lease, or possess an interest in property in the State.\u201d Id. at 466-67, 983 A.2d 492. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, insisted that CSR transacted business in Maryland by utilizing the Port of Baltimore, and specified that at least three CSR shipments that went through the Port were \u201cCost, Insurance, Freight\u201d arrangements, meaning that CSR retained responsibility for the cargo until it was unloaded in Baltimore. Id. at 468-69, 983 A.2d 492 &amp; n.5 Plaintiffs also noted that CSR advertised its product regularly in a trade magazine that was distributed in Maryland. Id. at 469, 983 A.2d 492.

Id. at 469-70, 983 A.2d 492.</p> <p id=\"b665-5\" pgmap=\"665(113) 666(120)\">The Court of Appeals granted CSR\u2019s petition for certiorari and reversed this Court\u2019s interim decision in which we concluded that the shipment of asbestos to Maryland established minimum contacts. Id. at 470-71, 983 A.2d 492. The Court of Appeals held that the exercise of jurisdiction over CSR would have offended the Due Process Clause, reasoning that CSR\u2019s shipments through Baltimore \u201cd[id] not satisfy the \u2018purposeful availment\u2019 requirement because CSR neither engaged in significant activities in Maryland nor created continuing obligations with the residents of the State.\u201d Id. at 476, 486, 983 A.2d 492. The Court observed that CSR had no customers in Maryland and no professional relationship with the Maryland stevedores; that Maryland\u2019s port was merely a conduit, not where CSR directed its sales; that the sales were directed through Maryland at the direction of CSR\u2019s customers, not CSR; and that CSR likely would not need to use Maryland courts to sue buyers because buyers pay CSR before it ships its goods, making the port-state an unlikely venue for CSR to bring suit. Id. at 487-91 &amp; n.12, 983 A.2d 492. In regard to the magazine advertisements, the Court concluded that CSR did not target its advertising specifically to Maryland customers, and it was insufficient for purposes of conferring jurisdiction that it may have been foreseeable that the advertisements would reach Maryland.

Vitro, a Delaware corporation qualified to do business in Maryland, purchased certain electronic parts from Milgray/Washington, Inc., a Maryland corporation. Id. at 499-500, 258 A.2d 749. Vitro\u2019s contract had conditioned the sale on the parts\u2019 compliance with certain government specifications. Id. In completing the sale, Milgray/Washington, Inc. obtained the necessary parts from its parent company\u2014Milgray Electronic Inc., a New York corporation. Id. at 500, 258 A.2d 749. The parent company sent the parts to its subsidiary, which in turn sent them to Vitro. Id. Vitro became concerned that the parts were non-compliant and requested a certificate of compliance to which it was entitled under its contract with the subsidiary. Id. The parent company drafted a certification in response, sent it to the subsidiary, which in turn sent it to Vitro. Id. The government rejected the parts as non-compliant. Id.</p> <p id=\"b666-6\" pgmap=\"666(32) 667(146)\">Vitro filed suit in Maryland against both the parent and its subsidiary, and the parent moved the court to dismiss the claim against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. Id. The circuit court held a hearing to consider the motion and found the following facts: the parent owned 100% of the subsidiary\u2019s common stock; the two corporations had the same officers; the same accountant handled the books for both corporations out of the same office; the parent listed a Maryland address in the local telephone book; and the subsidiary stocked a supply of the parent\u2019s products in its inventory; but, the two corporations maintained separate books, records, minutes, directors\u2019 meetings, and accounting procedures. Id. Additionally, the court found that Vitro and the subsidiary executed their contract in New York, but it was unclear where the parties executed the compliance certificate or how it was delivered to the subsidiary. Id. at 500-01, 258 A.2d 749. Based on these findings, the circuit court dismissed the claim against the parent corporation for want of personal jurisdiction, and Vitro appealed. Id.</p> <p id=\"b667-5\" pgmap=\"667\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the weakness in Vitro\u2019s ease was that the parent corporation did not engage in any activities that could add up to persistent contacts with Maryland, such as \u201cdirect solicitation by sales representatives in the state, the sending of price lists to customers through the mails, general mail advertising combined with advertising in periodicals circulated in the state, participation with the locally franchised dealer in promoting sales, and the presence in the state of service and maintenance representatives.\u201d Id. at 505-06, 258 A.2d 749 (citation and quotation marks omitted). In addition to the parent corporation\u2019s lack of direct contacts with Maryland, the Court observed that the parent and subsidiary \u201ctook pains to maintain separate records, separate and distinct accounting procedures, separate corporate books, and held separate directors\u2019 meetings\u201d and concluded that it could not, \u201cout of hand, brush aside these observed distinctions.\u201d Id. at 506, 258 A.2d 749.</p> <p id=\"b667-6\" pgmap=\"667(48) 668(101)\">Ultimately, however, the Court remanded the case. Id. at 507-08, 258 A.2d 749. In considering whether the parent company was subject to specific personal jurisdiction in Maryland by issuing the certificate, the Court reasoned that it could have been, \u201cif the certificate had been fraudulently or negligently executed, causing tortious injury to the [plaintiff].\u201d Id. at 506, 258 A.2d 749 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). Thus, the Court determined that it was not enough that the parent company executed a letter on behalf of its Maryland subsidiary\u2014it must have done so tortiously, and that tort must have occurred in the state in order for Maryland to exercise personal jurisdiction based on that contact. Id. at 507, 258 A.2d 749. But because the record on appeal was insufficient to determine how or where the certificate was executed, the Court left that issue to be determined on remand. Id.</p> <p id=\"b668-5\" pgmap=\"668\">In another case, this Court held that entering into a single, one-time contract for the purchase of two packaging machines amounted to purposeful availment. Jason Pharm., Inc. v. Jianas Bros. Packaging Co., Inc., 94 Md.App. at 428, 435, 617 A.2d 1125 (1993), The defendant, Jianas Brothers Packaging Co. (\u201cJianas\u201d), a Missouri company, initiated contact with a corporation based in Maryland, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cJason\u201d), for the purchase of the machines. Id. at 428, 617 A.2d 1125. Over several months, Jianas negotiated a contract by making about 40 telephone calls to Jason\u2019s business in Maryland. Id. at 429, 617 A.2d 1125. Once the parties agreed to terms, Jianas counter-signed the proposal for the machines at a sale price of $700,000, and sent the contract along with a $35,000 down payment to Jason in Maryland, which Jason then deposited the payment in a Maryland bank. Id. Prior to the sale, Jason stored the machines in Ohio until they were sent to Kentucky so that a third party could test them. Id. The third party refused to sign the warranty as it appeared in the proposal but signed a modification of the warranty. Id. When Jianas failed to complete the sale, Jason brought suit in Maryland. Id. at 428-29, 617 A.2d 1125.</p> <p id=\"b668-6\" pgmap=\"668(68) 669(17)\">At the outset, Judge Rosalyn Bell, writing for this Court, determined that the case turned on the question of specific (rather than general) jurisdiction because it involved a contractual dispute, and applied Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute to the facts presented. Id. at 430, 617 A.2d 1125. This Court held that a person negotiating with a company located in Maryland and then sending a down payment to Maryland constituted \u201ctransacting business\u201d within the meaning of the long-arm statute, CJP 6-103(b)(1). Id. at 433, 617 A.2d 1125.</p> <p id=\"b669-4\" pgmap=\"669\">We later distinguished Jason in Zavian v. Fondy, 130 Md. App. 689, 701-02, 747 A.2d 764 (2000). In Zavian, a Maryland attorney brought suit against three nonresident athletes on the United States Women\u2019s National Soccer Team after the women refused to pay the attorney\u2019s fees allegedly due under a management contract that the attorney had terminated. Id. at 691-92, 747 A.2d 764. The parties\u2019 relationships began when each defendant contacted the attorney in Maryland after finding her name on a list of attorneys willing to provide discounted or pro bono legal services to female athletes. Id. &amp; n.l. The attorney negotiated the contracts by phone and mail from her Maryland office, where she also drafted the contracts and sent them along with payment invoices to the athletes. Id. at 691-92, 747 A.2d 764. Then, pursuant to the contracts, the attorney engaged in substantive negotiations from her Maryland office with a number of apparel companies on the athletes\u2019 behalf. Id. at 692, 747 A.2d 764.</p> <p id=\"b669-5\" pgmap=\"669(192) 670(59)\">We affirmed the circuit court\u2019s grant of the athletes\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Id. We reasoned that the actions and negotiations the attorney made in her capacity as the athletes\u2019 manager could not be imputed to the athletes for the purpose of establishing minimum contacts by the athletes. Id. at 699, 747 A.2d 764. We concluded that \u201cappellees did not purposely seek a Maryland agent, endorsements of Maryland companies, or advertisements directed to Maryland soccer fans.\u201d Id. at 702, 747 A.2d 764. The athletes contacted the attorney because her name was on the list of attorneys willing to represent athletes, not because she was a Maryland lawyer. Id. Distinguishing the facts in Zavian from those in Jason, we noted that unlike the \u201c \u2018extensive negotiations\u2019 \u201d in Jason, the athletes engaged in little to no negotiations over the terms of the management contracts, they never visited Maryland, and the claim for unpaid fees suggests they never sent a check to Maryland. Id. at 701-02, 747 A.2d 764. Therefore, we concluded, the athletes\u2019 contacts did not amount to \u201ctransacting business\u201d in Maryland pursuant to the state\u2019s long-arm statute. Id. Although the contracting parties in Zavi-an intended to create an ongoing relationship, as compared to the single purchase contract in Jason, we focused on the quality of the athletes\u2019 purposeful contacts with the forum to determine whether they were such that they intended to avail themselves of the benefits and protections of Maryland law. Id.</p> <p id=\"b670-5\" pgmap=\"670\">The Fourth Circuit considered the minimum contacts necessary to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign corporation that contracted with a Maryland corporation in Ellicott Machine Corp., Inc. v. John Holland Party Ltd., 995 F.2d 474 (4th Cir. 1993). In that case, Ellicott, a Maryland corporation, brought a declaratory judgment action against Holland, an Australian corporation, arising out of a subcontract between the two parties. Id. at 475-76. The two parties began negotiations in Australia at the behest of the general contractor, which owned a 10% interest in Holland, but Ellicott rejected Holland\u2019s bid. Id. at 476. Holland then contacted Ellicott in Maryland and faxed to Maryland a revised bid on the subcontract. Id. The parties revised and exchanged copies of a draft purchase agreement between Australia and Maryland over a month and a half, negotiating along the way via letter, fax, and telephone. Id. Ellicott eventually accepted Holland\u2019s terms and Holland began performing the contract in Australia until unforeseen costs caused it to demand more money than the subcontract called for, at which point Ellicott filed for a declaratory judgment in Maryland. Id. The federal district court granted Holland\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction because of its insufficient forum contacts, and Ellicott appealed. Id. at 476-77.</p> <p id=\"b670-6\" pgmap=\"670(27) 671(74)\">The Fourth Circuit affirmed on appeal, holding that Maryland\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Holland would violate the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id. at 479-80. Although Holland initiated the business relationship and pursued Ellicott to Maryland, the Court determined that these contacts were fairly insubstantial and mitigated by the fact that Holland had no other contacts with Maryland, the contract did not have a \u201c \u2018substantial connection\u2019 \u201d to Maryland, because it was performed in Australia, and the parties did not have a longstanding relationship. Id. at 478-79 (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 481, 105 S.Ct. 2174).</p> <p id=\"b671-5\" pgmap=\"671(244) 672(19)\">Appellants in this appeal rely principally on Harris and Sleph. In Harris, a Maryland real estate broker, Harris, allegedly entered into a \u201c \u2018co-op\u2019 sales arrangement with another real estate broker\u201d for the sale of a specific property. 256 Md. at 187, 260 A.2d 22. After that property sold without his knowledge, Harris brought an action for lost commissions against the broker, the sellers, and the purchasers, many of which were nonresidents, including Arlen, a developer incorporated in New York. Id. at 186, 190, 260 A.2d 22. The circuit court dismissed the action against several of those defendants, including Arlen, for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Harris appealed. Id. at 191-94, 260 A.2d 22. The case made its way to the Court of Appeals, where, in considering whether Arlen\u2019s forum contacts brought it within the scope of Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute, the Court found it \u201cof no material consequence\u201d that Arlen had negotiated and executed the sales contract in the District of Columbia. Id. at 198, 260 A.2d 22. The Court focused instead on other acts that Arlen and its agents purposefully conducted in Maryland, including: its agents\u2019 persistent site visits, Arlen\u2019s engineers filing a building permit with Prince George\u2019s County, negotiations with the telephone company for an easement to run cables, and its engineers arranging for the installation of storm drains. Id. at 196-98, 260 A.2d 22. The Court imputed to Arlen these forum contacts by its agents and held that they amounted to \u201ctransacting business\u201d as the term is used under Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute. Id.</p> <p id=\"b672-5\" pgmap=\"672\">The defendants in Sleph were a husband and wife, both residents of Virginia, who negotiated and purchased a 79% interest in five commercial properties in Maryland, and thereafter visited those properties on numerous occasions to check on their investment. 76 Md.App. at 421-22, 545 A.2d 111. This Court held that \u201c[t]heir activities within this State, before and after the execution of their mortgage, performed directly and through their co-venturers, constituted sufficient purposeful activity to satisfy the [long-aim] statute.\u201d Id. at 427, 545 A.2d 111. We reasoned that their commercial real estate venture \u201ccreat[ed] a \u2018continuing obligation\u2019 between [the defendants] and a Maryland resident which invoked the benefits and protections of Maryland law.\u201d Id. at 429, 545 A.2d 111. \u201cOf the relevant considerations, we deem[ed] none more compelling than the interest of this State, as well as the interest of the interstate judicial system, in providing a single forum for the litigation of disputes that arise from interests in land located within the forum.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b672-6\" pgmap=\"672\">The Sleph Court did not rule\u2014as Appellants suggest\u2014that the filing of a legal instrument in Maryland automatically subjects a defendant to specific jurisdiction.

That interest is absent in the case sub judice.</p> <p id=\"b672-7\" pgmap=\"672(93) 673(129)\">Applying the principles rendered in the foregoing decisions, we hold that Green has not \u201ctransacted business\u201d in Maryland within the meaning of our long-arm statute. Maryland\u2019s specific jurisdiction over Green is necessarily limited to Appellants\u2019 causes of action arising from Green\u2019s forum contacts. At the outset we can discard Appellants\u2019 contention that Green\u2019s ownership of a subsidiary in Maryland subjects it to specific jurisdiction here. To the extent this claim bleeds into general jurisdiction (i.e., Green is subject to jurisdiction based solely on its ownership interest in a subsidiary corporation in Maryland), we have already addressed that argument.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellants urge, however, that it was Green\u2019s act of filing Searchlight\u2019s Articles of Incorporation in.Maryland that establishes specific jurisdiction over Green in Maryland. Appellants do not allege\u2014nor is there any indication\u2014that Green was negligent, fraudulent, or otherwise tortious by its incorporation of Searchlight.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather, Appellants appear to allege that Green, by a number of acts that took place in Texas, exerted improper influence over the SP Directors to aid and abet the Directors\u2019 alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, culminating in their self-serving decision to merge with Green and Green\u2019s incorporation of Searchlight in Maryland. But against these facts, the mere act of filing Searchlight\u2019s Articles of Incorporation in Maryland falls short of the grip of Maryland\u2019s long arm.</p> <p id=\"b673-5\" pgmap=\"673(112) 674(99)\"> First, the facts do not demonstrate that Green purposefully availed itself of doing business in Maryland, We do not say that the act of forming a subsidiary in Maryland cannot subject a parent company to personal jurisdiction in Maryland, but \u201c[t]he quality and quantity of contacts required to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction will depend upon the nature of the action brought and the nexus of the contacts to the subject matter of the action.\u201d Camelback II, 312 Md. at 338, 539 A.2d 1107; Sleph, 76 Md.App. at 428, 545 A.2d 111. Here, the subsidiary formed by Green was not intended to do business in Maryland and nothing about the formation of the subsidiary was directed at residents of Maryland. Green has no offices in Maryland, does not solicit business in Maryland, and has no registered agent in Maryland. Even Searchlight was given a Texas address. In Maryland, a substantial connection will be established if the defendant \u201ceither engaged in significant activities in the State, or created continuing obligations with the State\u2019s residents, thus taking advantage of the benefits and protections of Maryland law.\u201d CSR, Ltd., 411 Md. at 464-65, 983 A.2d 492. Clearly, Green did not intend to establish continuing obligations in Maryland by forming Searchlight.</p> <p id=\"b674-5\" pgmap=\"674(264) 675(27)\"> The second failing in Appellants\u2019 argument is that the filing of Searchlight\u2019s articles of incorporation was\u2014at best\u2014only tangentially related to Appellants\u2019 claim for aiding and abetting. The power of Maryland courts to exercise specific jurisdiction is confined to \u201c \u2018issues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919, 131 S.Ct. 2846 (citation omitted). It is not the mere filing of a legal instrument in Maryland that gives rise to specific jurisdiction, but the execution of an instrument that is fraudulent or causes a tortious injury within Maryland. See Vitro, 255 Md. at 506-07, 258 A.2d 749 (remanding the case so that the trial court could determine where the parent executed the allegedly faulty certificate of compliance and whether its execution was negligent or fraudulent); Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Greeley, 264 Md. 105, 110, 285 A.2d 632 (1972) (placing no jurisdictional significance on the trustee\u2019s mailing from Pennsylvania to Maryland a letter to the plaintiff denying his pension benefits absent any indication that the trustee played any role in the decision to deny the plaintiffs benefits claim); see also Christian Book Distrib., Inc. v. Great Christian Books, Inc., 137 Md.App. 367, 395, 768 A.2d 719 (2001) (holding that it would violate the Due Process Clause to exercise jurisdiction based on the defendant faxing a closing document (containing an alleged negligent misrepresentation) to Maryland absent any allegation of fraud when the defendant was never physically present in the forum state and had no other connection to that State); cf. Harris, 256 Md. at 196-97, 260 A.2d 22 (reasoning that the defendant\u2019s persistent conduct in Maryland \u201cmay have been tortious, thus, rendering him, individually, subject to suit in Maryland\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b675-5\" pgmap=\"675\">Appellants offer that the successful negotiation of a merger with a Maryland corporation culminating in the filing of the Articles of Merger in Maryland constituted transacting business in Maryland. As Appellants acknowledge, however, Green was not a signatory to the Articles of Merger, and Searchlight, not Green, filed the Articles of Merger in Maryland. To impute to Green the specific jurisdictional contacts of its subsidiary (absent a showing of fraud or a clear disregard of the corporate fiction) would run counter to the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in Daimler, 134 S.Ct. at 759-60, Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 929, 131 S.Ct. 2846, and World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295-99, 100 S.Ct. 580, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). In Greeley and Zavian, the Court of Appeals and this Court, respectively, held that we will not impute to a defendant the jurisdictional contacts of a third party. See Greeley, 264 Md. at 110, 285 A.2d 632; Zavian, 130 Md.App. at 699, 747 A.2d 764. Clearly, Searchlight\u2019s filing of the Articles of Merger is not, by itself, sufficient to confer jurisdiction over Green in Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b675-6\" pgmap=\"675(120) 676(171)\">Once we remove Green\u2019s filing of Searchlight\u2019s Articles of Incorporation from our jurisdictional equation, there are no alleged activities by Green in Maryland\u2014or directed at Maryland\u2014left to consider. In what seems to be an implicit concession, Appellants place no emphasis on the jurisdictional relevance of the actual merger negotiations, despite their prominence in the aiding and abetting claims against Green. Presumably, this is because all the actions relevant to Appellants\u2019 allegations of aiding and abetting occurred outside of Maryland.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Green, a Texas corporation, engaged SP in negotiations in Texas\u2014the place where SP is principally located. Green offered continued employment to Mr. Weaver in Texas, where he was employed at the time of the offer. The parties executed the merger agreement in Texas, and it included a Delaware choice-of-law provision. Green acquired SP\u2019s branches in Texas and Kentucky. SP sent its shareholders the allegedly misleading proxy statement from Texas to notify them that it would hold a special shareholder meeting in Texas, and the shareholders\u2014many of them Texans\u2014 voted in Texas to approve the merger. There is no allegation that SP or Green did any banking business in Maryland, or had any plans to, or that any of the Directors or parties\u2014 including Appellants\u2014had any business or residences in Maryland. There is no indication that Green sought out SP because of its place of incorporation, nor any indication that Green, through its negotiations, sought to create a continuing obligation with the citizens of Maryland. See CSR, Ltd., 411 Md. at 463, 983 A.2d 492. Moreover, Appellants do not identify in the underlying direct shareholder class action any shareholders who were Maryland residents or that any alleged harm would be felt in this state.</p> <p id=\"b676-4\" pgmap=\"676(184) 677(10)\"> As we stated earlier, this Court and the Court of Appeals have made clear that there is a difference between soliciting a transaction from a Maryland resident and actually soliciting a transaction in Maryland. See, e.g., Camelback II, 312 Md. at 340, 539 A.2d 1107; Zavian, 130 Md.App. at 701-02, 747 A.2d 764. During the negotiations, when the acts that form the basis of Appellants\u2019 complaint occurred (before Searchlight was formed and before the Articles of Merger were filed), Green had no contacts in Maryland, and we will not impute SP\u2019s incorporation in Maryland to Green. Equally, as in CSR Ltd., Maryland was merely a conduit through which Green completed a transaction that was directed at and principally impacted another forum. See 411 Md. at 488-90, 983 A.2d 492. All of the merger negotiations and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties took place in Texas, and none were directed at residents in Maryland. Accordingly, we hold that Appellants failed to establish a nexus between Green\u2019s only true contact in Maryland\u2014filing the articles for Searchlight, a transitory merger subsidiary with a Texas address\u2014and Appellants\u2019 cause of action sufficient to satisfy Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b678-11\" pgmap=\"678\">III.</p> <p id=\"b678-2\" pgmap=\"678\">SP Directors</p> <p id=\"b678-3\" pgmap=\"678\">Appellants allege that the SP Directors are subject to personal jurisdiction in Maryland by virtue of their seat on the SP\u2019s Board of Directors and because they \u201ccaused\u201d SP to file articles of merger in Maryland.</p> <p id=\"b678-4\" pgmap=\"678\">A. SP Directors\u2019 Contacts as Directors of a Maryland Corporation</p> <p id=\"b678-5\" pgmap=\"678\"> Appellants argue that the SP Directors are subject to specific jurisdiction in Maryland based on their acceptance of a directorship in a Maryland corporation. They urge us to adopt Delaware\u2019s approach, which, in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner, acted to permit jurisdiction based on a directorship alone.</p> <p id=\"b678-6\" pgmap=\"678\">The Shaffer Court addressed the constitutionality of a Delaware statute allowing a court of that state to take jurisdiction of a lawsuit by sequestering property in Delaware that belonged to the defendants. 438 U.S. at 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569. As part of the case, the Court considered the issue of personal jurisdiction based solely on an individual\u2019s directorship in a Delaware corporation.</p> <p id=\"b678-7\" pgmap=\"678(61) 679(177)\">Heitner, a nonresident of Delaware, filed a shareholder derivative action in Delaware against Greyhound Corporation, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in Phoenix, Arizona; Greyhound Lines, Inc., its wholly owned, out-of-state subsidiary; and several of the company\u2019s officers and directors, none of whom were Delaware residents. 433 U.S. at 189-90, 97 S.Ct. 2569. Heitner alleged that the officers and directors breached their duties to the company, causing Greyhound to engage in conduct that ultimately made the company liable for damages. Id. at 190, 97 S.Ct. 2569. The activities that led to the imposition of damages took place in Oregon. Id. The officers and directors asked the court to dismiss the suit against them, asserting that they lacked sufficient contacts with Delaware. Id. at 192-93, 97 S.Ct. 2569. Heitner opposed their dismissal, arguing that \u201cby accepting positions as officers or directors of a Delaware corporation,\u201d the defendants had accepted the substantial benefits the state provides to corporate officers and directors, and thereby subjected themselves to jurisdiction in Delaware. Id. at 215-16, 97 S.Ct. 2569. The Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the directors, determining that the proceeding was quasi in rem based on the presence in Delaware of the stock shares that the directors owned.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id. at 193-95, 97 S.Ct. 2569. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari and reversed. Id. at 195, 97 S.Ct. 2569.</p> <p id=\"b679-5\" pgmap=\"679(66) 680(152)\">After concluding that quasi in rem proceedings must be evaluated under the standards of International Shoe, just like in personam proceedings, the Court determined that the statutory presence of the directors\u2019 stock was unrelated to the cause of action and not grounds for jurisdiction. Id. at 212-13, 97 S.Ct. 2569. The Court then considered whether the directors could be subject to personal jurisdiction based solely on their position on the board of a Delaware corporation. Id. at 215-16, 97 S.Ct. 2569. The appellants argued that Delaware had an interest in supervising the management of a Delaware corporation. Id. at 214, 97 S.Ct. 2569. But the Court noted that under Delaware law, the exercise of jurisdiction was based on stock holdings, not board membership, demonstrating that the Delaware legislature had not displayed a strong interest in securing jurisdiction over corporate fiduciaries. Id. at 214-15, 97 S.Ct. 2569. The Court reasoned that Delaware\u2019s failure to enact a jurisdictional statute that treated the acceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction left the directors with \u201cno reason to expect to be haled before a Delaware court.\u201d Id. at 216, 97 S.Ct. 2569. For these reasons, the Court held that Delaware\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction based on an individual\u2019s corporate directorship violated the Due Process Clause. Id. at 216-17, 97 S.Ct. 2569.</p> <p id=\"b680-5\" pgmap=\"680(213) 681(37)\">Just thirteen days after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Shaffer, the Delaware legislature responded directly. Del. Code Ann. Tit. 10 \u00a7 3114; see Armstrong v. Pomerance, 423 A.2d 174, 179 n.8 (Del. 1980); Verity Winship, Jurisdiction Over Corporate Officers and the Incoherence of Implied Consent, 2013 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1171, 1177 (2013). The State enacted new legislation notifying \u201c[e]very nonresident of [Delaware] who ... accepts election or appointment as a director, trustee or member of the governing body of a corporation organized under the laws of [Delaware]\u201d that, in so doing, they were consenting to jurisdiction in Delaware in all actions against their corporation in which they are a necessary party and in all actions alleging a violation of duty to the corporation. Del. Code Ann. Tit. 10 \u00a7 3114; Armstrong, 423 A.2d at 175 n.l. Consequently, Delaware now asserts jurisdiction over the nonresident directors of Delaware corporations in actions based on an alleged breach of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties or where the corporation is a proper and necessary party. Armstrong, 423 A.2d at 176 n.5. The Court in Armstrong explained that the legislature authorized personal jurisdiction in these categories of cases because they are cases it deemed to be \u201cinextricably bound up in Delaware law and where Delaware has a strong interest in providing a forum for redress of injuries inflicted upon or by a Delaware domiciliary, i.e,, a Delaware corporation.\u201d Id. The Maryland General Assembly has not enacted a similar law.</p> <p id=\"b681-4\" pgmap=\"681\">Other state and federal courts considering the issue, in light of Shaffer, have held that these so-called \u201cdirector consent\u201d statutes are necessary to provide the directors with notice sufficient to permit the state\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them without running afoul of the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Am. Freedom Train Found. v. Spurney, 747 F.2d 1069, 1074-75 (1st Cir. 1984) (holding that nonresident directors lacked the requisite nexus to Massachusetts, in significant part, because \u201cMassachusetts, unlike some states, has not enacted a statute that treats acceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction in the state of incorporation\u201d (citation omitted)); Behm v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., 555 N.W.2d 801, 306-07 (Minn. Ct. App. 1996) (ruling that \u201c[a] state may assert jurisdiction over its corporate officers and directors by statute,\u201d but holding that because \u201cMinnesota has no such statute ... nonresident directors and officers cannot fairly be held to have consented to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota courts\u201d); Consipio Holding, BV v. Carlberg, 282 P.3d 751, 756 (Nev. 2012) (distinguishing Shaffer based on a Nevada statute authorizing suit against corporate directors and \u201cproviding] notice to officers and directors that they are subject to derivative suits for violation of their authority\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b681-5\" pgmap=\"681(110) 682(154)\">Appellants point to the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in Pittsburgh Terminal Corp. v. Mid Allegheny Corp., 831 F.2d 522, 527-30 (4th Cir. 1987), which they insist distinguishes Shaffer and permits jurisdiction, without a director-consent statute, based on a foreign defendant\u2019s position on an in-state corporation\u2019s board of directors. In Pittsburgh Terminal, the Fourth Circuit considered whether a federal district court in West Virginia erred by dismissing an action for lack of personal jurisdiction against two nonresident corporate directors of a company incorporated and principally located in West Virginia. Id. at 524. Relying on Justice Brennan\u2019s partial dissent in Shaffer, the Court reasoned that West Virginia had a strong interest in resolving suits involving its corporate directors, despite the lack of a legislative statement to that effect. Id. at 528 &amp; n.9 (citing Shaffer, 433 U.S. at 222, 97 S.Ct. 2569 (Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting)). The Fourth Circuit ruled that a forum may exercise personal jurisdiction based on a corporate officer\u2019s acceptance of a directorship even without a director-consent statute because Shaffer did not require long-arm statutes to use \u201cword[s] of art\u201d such as \u201cdirector\u201d to bring nonresident directors within the state\u2019s jurisdiction. 831 F.2d at 527. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the term \u201ctransacting business\u201d was a sufficient catchall. Id. &amp; n.7; but see Shaffer, 433 U.S. at 216, 97 S.Ct. 2569 (\u201c[Ajppellants had no reason to expect to be haled before a Delaware court. Delaware, unlike some states[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] has not enacted a statute that treats acceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction in the State.\u201d (emphasis added; footnote omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b682-4\" pgmap=\"682\">To the extent Pittsburgh Terminal is persuasive authority, we note the case is distinguishable on the facts. The Fourth Circuit noted that the corporation at issue was not a \u201cphantom\u201d corporation (registered to do business in a state with no other presence or connection to that state) like the corporation at issue in Shaffer and like SP in the present case. See 831 F.2d at 528. Moreover, the directors were directors of a West Virginia corporation that did business in West Virginia, and approved the transaction through a telephone call to West Virginia. Id. at 524.</p> <p id=\"b682-5\" pgmap=\"682(80) 683(172)\">In Maryland, the Court of Appeals has made plain that a party\u2019s reasonable expectation of being haled into court is central in determining whether that court has personal jurisdiction over a party. CSR, Ltd., 411 Md. at 479-80, 983 A.2d 492; Camelback II, 312 Md. at 342-43, 539 A.2d 1107. The Supreme Court stated clearly in Shaffer that Delaware\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in that case violated due process because Delaware lacked a statute notifying the directors that they consented to jurisdiction by accepting their positions as directors. 433 U.S. at 216 &amp; n.47, 97 S.Ct. 2669. Accordingly, we conclude that it would violate the due process rights of nonresident defendants to subject them to personal jurisdiction in Maryland based solely on their directorship in a company incorporated in Maryland. Without a director-consent statute, the out-of-state SP Directors had \u201cno reason to expect to be haled before a [Maryland] court\u201d when their only contact with Maryland was their directorship in a company that, although incorporated in Maryland, was headquartered in Texas and conducted all of its business outside Maryland. See Shaffer, 433 U.S. at 216, 97 S.Ct. 2569. We believe that this result furthers the aim of the Due Process Clause by \u201cgiv[ing] a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurances as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, 444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. 580.</p> <p id=\"b683-4\" pgmap=\"683\">B. SP Directors\u2019 Forum Contacts in Causing the Merger</p> <p id=\"b683-5\" pgmap=\"683\"> Appellants contend, however, that this is not a case in which jurisdiction would be predicated based solely on the defendants\u2019 acceptance of a directorship because the SP Directors personally availed themselves of Maryland law by causing the Articles of Merger to be filed in this state. Appellants argue that the SP Directors are subject to personal jurisdiction in Maryland based on their \u201cclear and substantial\u201d purposeful activity in the state\u2014namely, merging two Maryland corporations in Maryland. This is consistent with Maryland law, according to Appellants, because Maryland does not require a defendant\u2019s physical presence in the state to permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction. The SP Directors respond that they are not subject to jurisdiction despite their seats on SP\u2019s board because all activities relevant to the underlying shareholder class action took place outside Maryland and none of the SP Directors have entered Maryland in connection with SP\u2019s business.</p> <p id=\"b684-3\" pgmap=\"684\">Appellants and the SP Directors refer us to the federal district court\u2019s decision in Topik v. Catalyst Research Corp., 339 F.Supp. 1102, 1105-06 (D. Md. 1972) in support of their arguments. Topik was a shareholder derivative suit filed against the nonresident directors of a Maryland corporation following its merger with an out-of-state corporation. Id. at 1103-04. The individual directors in Topik were residents of Pennsylvania but attended annual board meetings in Maryland. Id. at 1104-05. In assessing Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute, the federal district court held that, because the decisions concerning the merger were made in Pennsylvania, the \u201ccause of action against the individual defendants d[id] not arise from their transacting any business in this state[.]\u201d Id. at 1106. Similarly, the court held that jurisdiction could not exist based on tortious injury in the state because any acts or omissions in Maryland were committed by agents of the corporation itself and not agents of the individual directors. Id. (citing CJP \u00a7 6-103(b)(3)). The court instructed that \u201c[i]t is the action of the individual defendants themselves in formulating a policy for the corporation to follow which forms the basis of the tort alleged and not the action of the corporation in following that policy. The corporate employees who acted in Maryland were agents of the corporation and not agents of the individual directors under these circumstances.\u201d Id. at 1106.</p> <p id=\"b684-4\" pgmap=\"684(137) 685(52)\">The court then turned to whether it could exercise jurisdiction over the directors by their causing tortious injury through acts committed outside of Maryland, as long as they had a sufficient nexus with Maryland based on the solicitation of business, receipt of substantial revenue from goods or services manufactured or consumed in Maryland, or any other persistent conduct in the state. Id. at 1106-07 (citing CJP \u00a7 6-103(b)(4)). The court held that, based on the directors\u2019 attendance at annual stockholder meetings and annual board of directors meetings in Maryland, the directors satisfied subsection (4) by establishing a persistent course of conduct in Maryland, even though they were not regularly doing business in the state. Id. at 1107-08. The court explained, \u201c \u2018Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019 would seem to allow the stockholders of a corporation to sue the directors for breach of fiduciary duty in the home state of a corporation, at least as long as the directors regularly come into that state to meet with and to deal with the stockholders at annual meetings.\u201d Id. at 1108 (emphasis supplied).</p> <p id=\"b685-5\" pgmap=\"685\">Insofar as the Topik court recognized that it could not exercise jurisdiction under the \u201ctransacting business\u201d prong of the Maryland long-arm statute (CJP \u00a7 6-103(b)(1)), the case supports Appellees\u2019 position. Appellants must rely on the court\u2019s holding that the directors could be sued in Maryland for their alleged breaches of fiduciary duty outside Maryland under CJP \u00a7 6-103(b)(4) based on their regular attendance at directors\u2019 and stockholders\u2019 meetings in Maryland. There are several problems with Appellants\u2019 argument, starting with the fact that they do not rely on CJP \u00a7 6-103(b)(4) as conferring personal jurisdiction over the Directors in this case, Moreover, Appellants rely on SP\u2019s filing of the Articles of Merger in Maryland as the operative jurisdictional contact; yet, they do not allege that the Articles of Merger were fraudulent or even that they caused a tortious injury in Maryland. See id.; see also Vitro, 255 Md. at 506, 258 A.2d 749. Further, as Topik instructs, the allegation falls short as there is no indication that any of the SP Directors filed this instrument personally or did more than merely participate in SP\u2019s decision to merge with Green. See 339 F.Supp. at 1106.</p> <p id=\"b685-6\" pgmap=\"685\">The contacts that the Topik Court found determinative were the annual trips that the directors made into Maryland for shareholder meetings and directors meetings. Id. at 1107. The SP Directors in this case made no such visits to Maryland. Because Appellants have not alleged that the SP Directors personally and purposefully directed any contact toward Maryland with respect to the merger agreement, we need not delve into the due process analysis. See CSR, Ltd., 411 Md. at 493, 983 A.2d 492.</p> <p id=\"b685-7\" pgmap=\"685(25) 686(98)\">We determine that the SP Directors\u2014all nonresidents\u2014 who never entered Maryland in connection with SP business, did not purposefully avail themselves of the privileges and protections of Maryland law by negotiating a merger m Texas with Green, a Texas corporation, or by sending its shareholders a proxy statement and notice of shareholder meeting from Texas, because all of the relevant activity occurred outside of Maryland. The only act that occurred in Maryland was SP\u2019s filing of the Articles of Merger in Maryland\u2014an act, as we have explained, we will not impute to the corporation\u2019s directors for jurisdictional purposes under the facts presented. Thus, we hold the circuit court did not err in dismissing the SP Directors for want of personal jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b686-4\" pgmap=\"686\">IV.</p> <p id=\"A97I\" pgmap=\"686\">Our resolution of Appellants first and second questions disposes of Appellants\u2019 contentions that SP and Searchlight were necessary parties under Maryland Rule 2-211(a), and that their complaint stated a claim for relief against each of the Appellees. Although the circuit court below acknowledged that it had personal jurisdiction over SP and Searchlight, Appellants\u2019 sole contention below and on appeal is that SP and Searchlight were necessary parties in the litigation of their claims against Green and the SP Directions. Having held that Appellants may not maintain their action in Maryland against Green and the SP Directors, there is no longer a cause of action to which SP and Searchlight are necessary parties. Although Appellants maintain that they stated a claim for relief against each of the Appellees\u2014including SP and Searchlight\u2014the 27 pages of briefing they dedicate to this issue refer to only the SP Directors and Green. In fact, Appellants concede that their \u201ccomplaint does not specifically allege a claim against [SP and Searchlight].\u201d Therefore, we uphold the circuit court\u2019s d\u00e9cisions dismissing SP and Searchlight from the underlying action.</p> <p id=\"b686-5\" pgmap=\"686\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

After the parties briefed and argued the instant appeal, the Supreme Court heard Bristol-Myers and BNSF Ry. Co. Anticipating these decisions, we held this opinion back in the event that either case were to alter the applicable jurisdictional analysis (and, if so, to permit the parties to file additional briefing). We determine, however, that both opinions reaffirm the Court\u2019s contemporary \u2018clarification\u2019 of general and specific jurisdiction as articulated in Goodyear and Daimler.</p> <p id=\"b653-6\" pgmap=\"653\">In BNSF Ry. Co., the Supreme Court considered the cases of two injured workers who brought suit in Montana against the defendant railroad company that had thousands of miles of track in Montana and employed thousands of workers in the state, but was incorporated in Delaware and principally located in Texas. 137 S.Ct. at 1554. In holding that the defendant railroad was not \"at home\u201d in Montana for purposes of general personal jurisdiction, Justice Ginsburg reiterated: \"The Fourteenth Amendment due process constraint described in Daimler ... applies to all state-court assertions of general jurisdiction over nonresident defendants; the constraint does not vary with tire type of claim asserted or business enterprise sued.\" Id. at 1558-59.</p> <p id=\"b653-7\" pgmap=\"653\">Bristol-Myers involved a California State court mass action against Bristol-Myers, a drug company and resident of Delaware and New York, for alleged injuries caused to the plaintiffs by the drug Plavix, 137 S.Ct. at 1778. The plaintiffs were 86 California residents and 592 residents from 33 other states. Id. Bristol-Myers challenged the California court's personal jurisdiction over it in regard to the claims asserted by the out-of-state plaintiffs. Id. at 1777-78. The Court held that the Due Process Clause did not permit California\u2019s exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over the out-of-state consumers, and noted that \u201d[o]ur settled principles regarding specific jurisdiction control this case.\u201d Id. at 1781, 1783; but see id. at 1789 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (\"The effect of the Court\u2019s opinion today is to eliminate nationwide mass actions in any State other than those in which a defendant is \u2018essentially at home' \u201d (internal quotations omitted)). We note that the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the California Supreme Court's \"sliding scale\u201d approach in Bristol-Myers calls into question the conception the Court of Appeals articulated in Camelback Ski Corp. v. Behning\u2014that where personal jurisdiction does not \"fit neatly\u201d into the categories of specific and general jurisdiction \"the proper approach is to identify the approximate position of the case on the continuum that exists between the two extremes, and apply the corresponding standard, recognizing that the quantum of required contacts increases as the nexus between the contacts and the cause of action decreases.\u201d 312 Md. 330, 339, 539 A.2d 1107 (1988). Given that in the instant case Appellants allege that Green had only one contact in Maryland\u2014the incorporation of Searchlight\u2014we do not need to examine the viability of the sliding scale approach in this appeal.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"9\"> <p id=\"b654-8\" pgmap=\"654\">. Green claims that Appellants waived the argument that Green was subject to general jurisdiction in Maryland. Our review of the record, however, establishes that the argument was sufficiently preserved below. During argument before the circuit court, Appellants pressed their allegation that there was no legal distinction between Green and Searchlight, and the Green Defendants responded preemptively to that argument, maintaining that Appellants failed to allege facts sufficient to support piercing the corporate veil. Moreover, the circuit court specifically found that ''[t]here is no general jurisdiction, as the only possible connection with Maryland is with Green\u2019s subsidiary, Searchlight, which is incorporated in Maryland.\u201d</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"10\"> <p id=\"b656-7\" pgmap=\"656\">.

Appellants rely on Harris v. Arlen Props., Inc. and Thomas v. Hudson Sales Corp. for the proposition that Maryland may exercise general jurisdiction over a foreign corporation for the actions of a \u201cclosely allied\u201d subsidiary in Maryland over which the foreign company had \u201cactual supervision and control.\u201d Appellants' reliance on these cases is misguided. The Harris case involved application of Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute and centered on the question of specific jurisdiction. See 256 Md. at 186, 260 A.2d 22. And Thomas is distinguishable on the facts. Thomas was a garnishment action, 204 Md. at 453, 105 A.2d 225. It is true that the Court of Appeals imputed to the parent company its subsidiary's forum contacts, reasoning that the corporate structure resembled a principal/agent relationship and the subsidiary, through its Maryland representatives, acted as if it were the parent company\u2019s sale\u2019s department. Id. at 463, 105 A.2d 225. But in Thomas, both the parent and subsidiary were Michigan companies, and the Court considered, for the purposes of garnishment, whether the extensive contacts by the subsidiary\u2019s agents in Maryland\u2014to include a district manager and sales manager living in Maryland and soliciting business in Maryland\u2014were sufficient for Maryland to exercise jurisdiction over the parent.

Green states in its brief that, although the parties agreed that Delaware law would govern the merger agreement and any disputes thereunder, Maryland law still governs to the extent that it is \"manda-torily applicable.\u201d We agree with Green. The question of whether Maryland may exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation is not a question of Delaware substantive law, but a dual consideration of this state\u2019s long-arm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.

The Fourth Circuit explained that it need not analyze whether Holland \u201ctransacted business\u201d within the meaning of Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute separately from the minimum contacts inquiry under the Due Process Clause, \"[bjecause the Maryland legislature designed its long-arm statute to extend personal jurisdiction to the limits allowed by federal due process, our normal two-step inquiry merges into one.\u201d Ellicott, 995 F.2d at 477 (citing Mohamed, 279 Md. at 657, 370 A.2d 551 (1977).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"17\"> <p id=\"b673-6\" pgmap=\"673\">. Appellants relied on the Supreme Court of Delaware\u2019s decision in Sternberg v. O'Neil, 550 A.2d 1105, 1123 (Del. 1988), to support jurisdiction on these grounds. In Sternberg, the Court sustained the exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign parent cotporation in a suit based on the alleged wrongdoing of its subsidiary, which the parent corporation registered as a Delaware corporation. Id. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Daimler, however, the Supreme Court of Delaware ruled recently that its decision in Sternberg is too broad to be consistent with Daimler.

As the Court of Appeals explained in CSR Ltd., once we have determined that the defendant\u2019s contacts with Maryland do not satisfy the \" \u2018purposeful availment\u2019 requirement, thus attaining sufficient minimum contacts with the State,\u201d we need not move on to the third prong of the analysis to \"consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable[.]\u201d 411 Md. at 493, 983 A.2d 492; cf. Daimler, 134 S.Ct. at 762 n.20 (\"When a coiporation is genuinely at home in the forum State, ... any second-set inquiry would be superfluous,\u201d), Nevertheless, in this case, applying the fundamental fairness factors that the Supreme Court delineated to ensure that the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process, Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 292, 100 S.Ct. 580), only bolsters our analysis under Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute against exercising personal jurisdiction over Green. See Ellicott, 995 F.2d at 479-80 (holding that Maryland's exercise of personal jurisdiction \u201cwould not comport with traditional notions of 'fair play and substantial justice[,]\u2019 in part, because litigating in Maryland would \"impose a heavy burden\u201d on the Australian defendant and witnesses who were located primarily in Australia, and because \"[njearly all aspects of the contract took place in Australia and principally affected Australian interests\u201d (citations omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b677-5\" pgmap=\"677(281) 678(97)\">The first factor (burden on the defendant) weighs heavily in Green\u2019s favor. Green\u2014a Texas corporation that negotiated in Texas with SP's Directors, who resided in Texas, for the merger of SP's banks in Texas and Kentucky\u2014had a legitimate interest in and expectation of not being haled into court in Maryland. See Camelback II, 312 Md. at 343, 539 A.2d 1107. The second factor (Maryland\u2019s interest in the dispute) weighs weakly in Appellants\u2019 favor. Although Maryland has some interest in resolving disputes arising from the management and merger decisions of businesses incorporated in the state, the direct shareholder class action underlying this appeal is attenuated from Maryland and the impact of the merger will be felt in Texas, where both Green and SP are principally located and where nearly all of the merged banks operate. Additionally, this is not a derivative action in which the plaintiffs allege harm to the corporation itself; Appellants allege no harm in Maryland aside from asserting generally and without specific knowledge that SP, as a publicly-traded coiporation, presumably has a shareholder who resides in Maryland and would qualify as a class member. The third factor (Appellants\u2019 interest in obtaining effective relief) also does not weigh in favor of Maryland exercising jurisdiction. Appellants have not alleged any personal connection to Maryland, nor have they indicated why litigating this dispute in Maryland would be more convenient or effective than if they did so in Texas. Finally, the fourth and fifth factors (the interstate judicial system's interest in effective relief and the states\u2019 shared interest in furthering substantive social policies) weighs against exercising jurisdiction in Maryland. Appellants' claims arose out of merger negotiations conducted in Texas by Texans concerning one Texas bank\u2019s acquisition of another bank\u2019s branches located principally in Texas. The witnesses and all of the relevant facts are located in Texas. The interstate judicial system is best served by resolving disputes in the forum more closely related to the cause of action. A contrary result would incentivize forum shopping\u2014a practice that both Maryland and Texas consider to be inefficient and injurious to the interstate judicial system. See, e.g., Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. ARTRA Grp., Inc., 338 Md. 560, 578, 659 A.2d 1295 (1995); In re AutoNation, Inc., 228 S.W.3d 663, 668 (Tex. 2007).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"21\"> <p id=\"b679-6\" pgmap=\"679\">.
