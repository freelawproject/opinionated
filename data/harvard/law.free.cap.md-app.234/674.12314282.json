Code (1992, 2015 Repl. Vol.), Business Regulation (\u201cBR\u201d) Article, \u00a7 16\u2014210(a)(2), which authorizes discipline of a licensee that \u201cfraudulently or deceptively uses a license.\u201d For reasons that follow, we conclude that the Comptroller has implied power\u2014legislatively-recognized\u2014to suspend a license for unlawful sales of tobacco products to a minor. Under these circumstances, the licensee is acting outside the scope of the license conferred by Title 16 of the BR Article. However, the authority to suspend is not derived from BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2). Because the administrative adjudication here was premised on the latter provision, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County correctly held that the suspension in this case cannot stand.</p> <p id=\"b711-5\" pgmap=\"711\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b711-6\" pgmap=\"711\">Two Farms is the operator of retail chain stores that are licensed to sell, among other things, cigarettes and tobacco products. On May 20, 2015, the Baltimore County Department of Health (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) warned Two Farms about making sales to minors and not asking for identification in violation of local ordinances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b711-7\" pgmap=\"711(28) 712(129)\">In August 2015, the Department cited Two Farms for selling tobacco to minors on three separate occasions. All three violations occurred at the same location. On August 6, 2015, a minor purchased a Black and Mild cigar. On August 10, 2015, a minor bought a tin of chewing tobacco and was not asked for identification. On August 11, 2015, a minor purchased a Black and Mild cigar from the retailer. In each instance, a Department officer brought the minor to the store to attempt to purchase tobacco. Each time, Two Farms was issued a citation proposing a civil penalty for selling tobacco to a minor and, in one instance, for failing to ask for identification in violation of \u00a7 13-12-103.1 of the Baltimore County Code. These citations were adjudicated at a hearing before a county administrative law judge\u2014a hearing that Two Farms did not attend. The retailer was found liable and civil penalties were imposed.</p> <p id=\"b712-5\" pgmap=\"712\">The County Department notified the Comptroller about Two Farms\u2019s violations. On November 2, 2015, the Comptroller sent the retailer a Notice of Hearing directing the licensee to show cause why its license should not be suspended for violations of BR \u00a7 16\u2014210(a)(2). On November 19, 2015, a hearing was held at the Comptroller\u2019s office. Two officials from the County Department appeared as witnesses; however, Two Farms did not attend. One of the Department\u2019s witnesses testified to the events described at the County adjudicative hearing. At that point, the hearing officer issued his ruling, finding:</p> <blockquote id=\"b712-6\" pgmap=\"712\">Well, in light of the fact that [Two Farms] has failed to appear, the evidence is sufficient to substantiate a finding here of guilty, and as a result, since the Comptroller has the authority to impose a suspension or revocation of a license, this is a first offense for [Two Farms] on the State level, so they will be suspended for a period of ten days and their cigarette and tobacco licenses will be suspended for a period of ten days.</blockquote> <p id=\"b712-7\" pgmap=\"712\">On December 10, 2015, the Comptroller sent Two Farms a Notice of Final Determination, informing the business that its license to sell tobacco products would be suspended for ten days, pursuant to BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2) for \u201cfraudulently or deceptively us[ing] a license.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b713-3\" pgmap=\"713\"> On January 7, 2016, Two Farms sought judicial review of the Comptroller\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. At a June 10, 2016 hearing, the business claimed that it was not aware of the proceeding before the Comptroller\u2019s office because the citations had been served on store employees, and not on the company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Two Farms argued that there was no evidence of fraudulent or deceptive use of a tobacco license, as required under BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2). The retailer asserted that the minors were not being deceived when they bought the tobacco products. The Comptroller countered that an unlawful action in and of itself proves fraud or deceit. The circuit court observed that there was no evidence of any misrepresentations made by the store. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that the evidence did not show a fraudulent or deceptive use of the license and vacated the order suspending Two Farms\u2019s license. The Comptroller appealed from that decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b713-4\" pgmap=\"713\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p> <p id=\"b713-5\" pgmap=\"713(17) 714(49)\"> The Comptroller frames the issue in this case as whether there was \u201csubstantial evidence that Two Farms fraudulently or deceptively used its license.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, in our view, this is not a substantial evidence case, but one presenting a purely legal issue of statutory interpretation\u2014a question that we review de novo. Matthews v. Horn. Auth. of Baltimore City, 216 Md.App. 572, 582, 88 A.3d 852 (2014).</p> <p id=\"b714-5\" pgmap=\"714\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b714-6\" pgmap=\"714\">1. Introduction</p> <p id=\"b714-7\" pgmap=\"714\">The facts in the instant case are not complicated. Two Farms received three citations for selling tobacco products to minors. Based on that evidence, the Comptroller suspended Two Farms\u2019s license to sell tobacco products for ten days. In his order, the Comptroller stated that the license was being suspended pursuant to BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2) for \u201cfraudulently or deceptively use[ing] a license.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Two Farms challenged that finding and the circuit court agreed, ruling that the facts did not support a fraudulent or deceptive use of the license. Therefore, the primary issue we must decide is whether the act of selling tobacco products to a minor constitutes a fraudulent or deceptive use of a license to sell tobacco products. However, given the Comptroller\u2019s reliance on BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1)\u2019s purported recognition of the power to suspend or revoke a license for illegal sales of tobacco, we also consider whether Title 16 or any part of it supports such authority.</p> <p id=\"b714-8\" pgmap=\"714\">BR \u00a7 16-210(a) provides grounds upon which the Comptroller can suspend or revoke a license. Specifically, the Comptroller can suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:</p> <blockquote id=\"b715-4\" pgmap=\"715\">(1) fraudulently or deceptively obtains or attempts to obtain a license for the applicant or licensee or for another person;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-5\" pgmap=\"715\">(2) fraudulently or deceptively uses a license;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-6\" pgmap=\"715\">(3) fails to comply with the Maryland Cigarette Sales Below Cost Act or regulations adopted under that Act;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-7\" pgmap=\"715\">(4) fails to comply with the provisions of Title 11, Subtitle 5A of the Commercial Law Article;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-8\" pgmap=\"715\">(5) buys cigarettes for resale:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-9\" pgmap=\"715\">(i) in violation of a license; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-10\" pgmap=\"715\">(ii) from a person who is not a licensed cigarette manufacturer, licensed subwholesaler, licensed vending machine operator, or licensed wholesaler;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-11\" pgmap=\"715\">(6) is convicted, under the laws of the United States or of any other state, of:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-12\" pgmap=\"715\">(i) a felony; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-13\" pgmap=\"715\">(ii) a misdemeanor that is a crime of moral turpitude and is directly related to the fitness and qualification of the applicant or licensee; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b715-14\" pgmap=\"715\">(7) has not paid a tax due before October 1 of the year after the tax became due.</blockquote> <p id=\"b715-15\" pgmap=\"715\">BR \u00a7 16-210(a) (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b715-16\" pgmap=\"715(18) 716(56)\">Furthermore, BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1) provides that \u201cExcept for a violation of \u00a7 10-107 of the Criminal Law Article,[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] whenever any license issued under the provisions of this subtitle is suspended or revoked by the Comptroller, the licensee may, before .the effective date of the suspension or revocation, petition the Comptroller for permission to make an offer of compromise consisting of a sum of money in lieu of serving the suspension or revocation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b716-5\" pgmap=\"716(58) 717(153)\">The Comptroller argues that the language of BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1) makes it clear that he can suspend or revoke a license when a licensee distributes tobacco products to a minor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the Comptroller, the only paragraph this could fall under is BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2); therefore, a licensee\u2019s unlawful distribution of tobacco to a minor constitutes a deceptive or fraudulent use of that license subject to discipline under BR \u00a7 16\u2014210(a)(2). Two Farms argues that a suspension for violating CL \u00a7 10-107 is authorized under BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(6)(h), which allows the Comptroller to suspend or revoke a license when the licensee is convicted of certain misdemeanors that are crimes of moral turpitude. The retailer also contends that simply selling a tobacco product to a minor is not a deceptive or fraudulent act by itself. Two Farms also argues that there must be some fraudulent scheme involved in the sale to a minor in order for BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2) to apply. In addition, the business points to the failure of 2016 legislation, which among other things, would have expressly authorized the Comptroller to suspend or revoke a license for illegal sales to minors; and argues that this demonstrates a legislative intent to deny the Comptroller this authority.</p> <p id=\"b717-5\" pgmap=\"717\">2. Relevant Principles of Statutory Construction</p> <p id=\"b717-6\" pgmap=\"717\"> In addition to the text, the purpose and legislative history of the relevant statutes and the consequences of the proffered constructions are critical to resolving these contentions. Also, of special importance here are three precepts of statutory construction. The first is when interpreting a statute, we should \u201cgive effect to all of the language and avoid a construction that renders any portion superfluous.\u201d Alston v. State, 433 Md. 275, 283, 71 A.3d 13 (2013) (quoting Stanley v. State, 390 Md. 175, 183-84, 887 A.2d 1078 (2005)). Second, although a court is not authorized to ignore the text, it is free to explore \u201cwhat is below the surface of the statute and yet fairly part of it.\u201d Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 533 (1947). Finally, of particular relevance to the Comptroller\u2019s arguments, is the principle that \u201ca subsequent legislative amendment of a statute is not controlling as to the meaning of the prior law [but] ... can be considered helpful to determine legislative intent.\u201d Chesek v. Jones, 406 Md. 446, 462, 959 A.2d 795 (2008).</p> <p id=\"b717-8\" pgmap=\"717\">3. History and Purpose of the Relevant Statutes</p> <p id=\"b717-9\" pgmap=\"717(21) 718(149)\">We focus on the relationship between three provisions: (1) CL \u00a7 10-107; (2) BR \u00a7 16-210(a); and (3) BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> CL \u00a7 10-107 began life as Chapter 371, Laws of 1886, which according to its title, was designed \u201cto protect the health and morals of minors in the State of Maryland.\u201d More than a century later, Judge Rodowsky, in his dissenting opinion in Allied Vending, Inc. v. Cty. of Bowie, 332 Md. 279, 631 A.2d 77 (1993) described this criminal statute as creating a \u201cclass of ineligible purchasers.\u201d Id. at 327, 631 A.2d 77.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a 1994 enactment, the General Assembly reinforced this conclusion by prohibiting a minor from possessing any tobacco product. CL \u00a7 10-108. Chapter 110, Laws of 1994. This statute also expressly subjected \u201cpersons licensed under Title 16 of the Business Regulation Article\u201d to its prohibitions. CL \u00a7 10-107(b)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As introduced, the legislation would have mandated a license suspension for businesses convicted of violating \u00a7 10-107. That language was deleted from the bill.</p> <p id=\"b718-5\" pgmap=\"718(109) 719(17)\">The licensing provisions of Title 16 are almost as old as CL \u00a7 10-107. They became law in 1890. Chapter 91, Laws of 1890. This statute was two sentences long: the first required a trader\u2019s license to sell tobacco to be obtained from the clerk of the circuit court for each county and Baltimore City; the second directed an applicant for a license to state under oath that cigarettes sold \u201ccontain no injurious drug.\u201d The latter requirement was deleted six years later. Chapter 439, Laws of 1896. If such a provision had remained in the law, in light of our present knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking, no retailer could have taken such an oath, and the sale of tobacco products would have been outlawed.</p> <p id=\"b719-4\" pgmap=\"719\">The licensing provisions remained skeletal, even after the Comptroller was made an administrator/enforcer of the law and a few grounds were added as a basis for suspension or revocation, such as selling cigarettes below cost and unlawfully-buying cigarettes for resale. Most significantly, in the 1988 non-substantive code revision of the Tax\u2014General Article, Chapter 2, Laws of 1988, fraudulent or deceptive use of the license was added as a ground for suspension or revocation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Revisor\u2019s Note for the change noted:</p> <blockquote id=\"b719-5\" pgmap=\"719\">Subsection (a)(1) and (2) of this section is new language added to conform to almost all of the occupational licensing acts adopted by the General Assembly in the past several years. See, e.g., the comparable sections on disciplinary actions in the various titles of the Health Occupations Article. The General Assembly expressly decided that the language of these items was to be included in each of those sections as a fundamental ground for disciplining a licensee.</blockquote> <p id=\"b719-6\" pgmap=\"719\">(Emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b719-7\" pgmap=\"719\">The Revisor\u2019s Note is consistent with the Commission to Revise the Annotated Code of Maryland\u2019s Model Guide for Drafting Board, Commission, and Licensing Provisions (Jan. 1979). That Guide states that \u201cin most instances there must be source law provisions in each subtitle to support the adoption of the uniform language ....\u201d Id. at 1. The Guide goes on to note:</p> <blockquote id=\"b719-8\" pgmap=\"719(48) 720(18)\">However, the [Guide] does propose in certain sections the adoption of uniform provisions even if the source law of a given statute does not expressly support the provision. The proposals are made only when the additional language does nothing more than state a provision that is inherent or fundamental to the scheme of things for all of the regulatory boards with which we are concerned.</blockquote> <p id=\"b720-5\" pgmap=\"720\">Id.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b720-6\" pgmap=\"720\">In 1992, the tobacco licensing provisions were moved to the new Business Regulations Article. Chapter 4, Laws of 1992. Subtitle 1 of Title 16 of the new article contains definitions, most notably \u00a7 16\u2014101(e), which defines \u201cSell cigarettes at retail\u201d as selling cigarettes \u201cto a consumer,\u201d Subtitle 2 regulates a host of tobacco business licenses; some of the provisions apply to retailers, some do not, An anomaly of the code revision organization of Title 16 is that there are two separate provisions governing the suspension or revocation of a retailer\u2019s license; BR \u00a7 16-210 and BR \u00a7 16-306.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 16-210\u2014'the more expansive of the two\u2014seems to have been the \u201cgo-to\u201d statute for subsequent amendments. See Sanchez v. Potomac Abatement, Inc., 198 Md.App. 436, 449, 18 A.3d 100 (2011), aff'd, 424 Md. 701, 37 A.3d 972 (2012) (discussing this legislative phenomenon).</p> <p id=\"b720-7\" pgmap=\"720(122) 721(62)\">We now fast-forward to 1994\u2014the same year the General Assembly made major changes to CL \u00a7 10-107. The Legislature passed Chapter 464, Laws of 1994, a departmental bill that augmented the Comptroller\u2019s authority over tobacco licensees. One significant change provided that the Comptroller could suspend or revoke a license if the licensee violates \u201cTitle 16 of the Business Regulation Article or regulations adopted under that title.\u201d See BR \u00a7 16\u2014210(b)(2). A more controversial addition authorized a licensee facing suspension or revocation of its license to petition the Comptroller to permit a monetary offer of compromise. Anti-tobacco advocates opposed this provision. See Written Testimony of the Maryland Coalition to Stop Illegal Sales of Tobacco to Minors (\u201cIf illegal sales make money, why would the seller stop selling to children even with a fine?\u201d) (Mar. 25, 1994). To head-off this attack, the Governor\u2019s Legislative Office and the Comptroller offered an amendment that exempted violations of CL \u00a7 10-107 from the Comptroller\u2019s proposed compromise authority.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The amendment was adopted and the legislation passed. The compromise authority was codified as BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1).</p> <p id=\"b721-5\" pgmap=\"721\">One additional legislative development is worthy of note. In 2000, another departmental bill, HB 95, was introduced to require the Comptroller to investigate applicants for tobacco licenses and deny a license and or renewal for, among other reasons, if the applicant \u201cis not a fit person to receive the license\u201d or if \u201cthere are other reasons in the discretion of the Comptroller why the license should not be issued.\u201d This language was deleted from the bill by the House Economic Matters Committee. Instead, the Committee amended BR \u00a7 16-210(a) to add certain convictions as an additional ground for suspension, revocation and reprimand. See pp. 680-81, 174 A.3d at 457-58, supra. A floor amendment in the House further limited a portion of this provision to certain misdemeanors that were \u201ccrime[s] of moral turpitude.\u201d This measure was enacted as Chapter 97, Laws of 2000.</p> <p id=\"b721-6\" pgmap=\"721\">4. Impact of Failed Legislation</p> <p id=\"b721-7\" pgmap=\"721\">To support the circuit court decision, Two Farms relies in part on the \u201camendment-rejection theory.\u201d It points to the failure in committee of HB 1015 in 2015. This bill, among other things, would have expressly authorized the Comptroller to suspend or revoke a license if the licensee failed to comply with laws regulating the sale of tobacco products to minors. In addition, language was deleted from what became Chapter 464, Laws of 1994 that would have mandated a license suspension for persons convicted of violating CL \u00a7 10-107.</p> <p id=\"b722-3\" pgmap=\"722\">Court of Appeals decisions on the amendment-rejection theory are not uniform. Compare Allied, 332 Md. at 304, 631 A.2d 77 (The failure to enact legislation prohibiting minors access to cigarette vending machines strongly suggests that there was no intent to allow local governments to enact such legislation) with Goldstein v. State, 339 Md. 563, 570, 664 A.2d 375 (1995) (Courts are reluctant to infer legislative intent from legislative inaction where there are several possible reasons for defeat).</p> <p id=\"b722-4\" pgmap=\"722\">The amendments \u201crejected\u201d here show that there can be no easy reliance on the amendment-rejection theory. The 2015 legislation was largely a revenue measure that would have raised $4.4 million in annual tobacco licensing fees by 2020. Fiscal &amp; Policy Note on HB 1015 (March 10, 2015). To think the bill was killed in a single committee because of a provision authorizing license suspension/revocation would be blinking reality.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The same would be true of the 1994 legislation that would have mandated license suspension for convictions of CL \u00a7 10-107. Such a rejection tells us nothing about the General Assembly\u2019s views on authorizing suspension, particularly where, at the same session, the Legislature enacted, as an exception to the Comptroller\u2019s compromise authority, language that assumed that he had the power to suspend or revoke for illegal sales to minors. For these reasons, we will look to enacted, not rejected, legislation to resolve this case.</p> <p id=\"b722-5\" pgmap=\"722\">5. Are Illegal Tobacco Sales to Minors \u201cFraudulent or Deceptive Use\u201d of a License?</p> <p id=\"b722-6\" pgmap=\"722\"> Despite the widespread use in the Maryland Code of \u201cfraudulent or deceptive use of a license,\u201d there is no Maryland case that explains the meaning of these terms.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, out-of-state authorities, while not plentiful, are helpful.</p> <p id=\"b723-4\" pgmap=\"723\">Relevant caselaw does not mandate that the terms, \u201cfraud or deceit,\u201d in a licensing statute be given their common law meaning. Tompkins v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of New York, 299 N.Y. 469, 87 N.E.2d 517, 521 (1949) (\u201cSince the [physician licensing] statute is not concerned with private rights, it should not be construed to require that anyone actually has been misled so long as the intent is present.\u201d); and Hughes v. Bd. of Architectural Examiners, 68 Cal. App.4th 685, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 322 (1998) (\u201cThere is nothing in the law or logic that requires the existence of a victim ... before the Board may order a license revoked as part its efforts to protect the people of California from unscrupulous conduct\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See generally, Brian Rubens, Common Law Versus Regulatory Fraud: Parsing the Intent Requirement of the Felony Penalty Provision of Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 724: U. Chic. L. Rev. 507 (2005).</p> <p id=\"b723-5\" pgmap=\"723\">This Court expressed similar views in Stidwell v. Md. State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners, 144 Md.App. 613, 799 A.2d 444 (2002). There, we upheld the denial of certification of a massage therapist with respect to an applicant previously convicted of solicitation of prostitution. One ground for the denial was Stidwell\u2019s conviction for a \u201ccrime of moral turpitude.\u201d Rejecting her assertion that the statute embraced the common law definition, we said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b723-6\" pgmap=\"723(51) 724(77)\">Stidwell would benefit if our analysis ended with these criminal cases, ... Her conviction, however, surfaced in the field of administrative law, where \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d has evolved from its common law trappings into an even more fluid descriptive tool. Indeed, while Maryland\u2019s administrative and regulatory statutes repeatedly use the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d that use is variable and inconsistent. Our review of theses [sic] statutory provisions reveals that, whereas for trials, the expression \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d speaks primarily to truthfulness, for the business of professional licensing and public appointments, the expression strikes the broader chord of public confidence in the administration of government. That is, a person who has credibility to testify may not have the public\u2019s confidence to practice certain professions or to serve on a governmental board.</blockquote> <p id=\"ALB\" pgmap=\"724\">Id. at 618-19, 799 A.2d 444.</p> <p id=\"b724-5\" pgmap=\"724\">Caselaw aside, there is another reason why BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2) does not lock into place common law understandings of fraud and deceit. We know from the 1988 Tax\u2014General revision, see p. 686, 174 A.3d at 460, supra, that when the \u201cfraud or deceit\u201d language was enacted, the General Assembly was codifying so-called inherent agency authority derived from statutory source law, not from the common law.</p> <p id=\"b724-6\" pgmap=\"724\">Does freedom from the confines of the common law advance the Comptroller\u2019s case past the goal line? Not if just the text of \u00a7 16-210(a)(2) is our focus.</p> <p id=\"b724-7\" pgmap=\"724\">Highly instructive is the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in Tompkins, 87 N.E.2d 517. At issue was the proper interpretation of the words \u201cfraud or deceit in the practice of medicine\u201d as grounds for discipline in a physician licensing statute. Doctor Tompkins issued prescriptions for morphine to three persons\u2014one, who was an agent and another, an informant for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Tompkins believed that each was an addict, but on the prescription, he noted that they were diagnosed with renal colic. Although the Board contended that the physician\u2019s action violated federal and state law, the court said it would only consider whether the \u201cfraud or deceit charge\u201d had been demonstrated. Id. at 520-21. The appellate court went on to note:</p> <blockquote id=\"b724-8\" pgmap=\"724(42) 725(52)\">[I]t is urged that there is no proof of respondent\u2019s intent to defraud any one. The board insists that the terms \u201cfraud or deceit in the practice of medicine\u201d are equivalent in meaning to \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d, which is a ground for discipline in other professions than medicine .... Both contentions are wide of the mark. The words \u201cfraud or deceit\u201d must be read in light of their traditional meaning in the law .... and cannot be synonymous with \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d a term which may signify activity quite unlike fraud in the customary sense.</blockquote> <p id=\"b725-5\" pgmap=\"725\">Id. at 521.</p> <p id=\"b725-6\" pgmap=\"725\">Addressing the question of what persons were misled, the Court of Appeals said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b725-7\" pgmap=\"725\">The issuance of a prescription for narcotic drugs to an addict without proper medical basis is clearly an act which is calculated to deceive those whose legitimate concern is the enforcement of the laws controlling trade in and consumption of narcotics. Such a prescription is more than a direction to the pharmacist. It plays an integral part of the system of control and, if not a true prescription, may throw that system awry. It is clear that respondent was conscious of those facts, and therefore we must hold that his conduct constituted \u201cfraud and deceit\u201d \u2019 under section 6514.</blockquote> <p id=\"b725-8\" pgmap=\"725\">Id. (Emphasis added). The Tompkins court identified the parties hypothetically deceived\u2014law enforcement officers who enforce the narcotics laws\u2014even though the federal government, through the use of an agent and an informant, was not in fact deceived by the doctor\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b726-4\" pgmap=\"726\">Although much in Tompkins is helpful to the Comptroller\u2019s case, one critical fact appears there and not here: Dr. Tompkins falsified his prescriptions. From a purely textual analysis, the Tompkins case takes the terms \u201cfraudulent or deceptive\u201d use of a license about as far as they can go.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, the Comptroller has another arrow in his quiver\u2014BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1).</p> <p id=\"b726-5\" pgmap=\"726\">6. What effect should be given to \u00a7 16-212(e)(1)?</p> <p id=\"b726-6\" pgmap=\"726\">The most perplexing issue in this case is what meaning we should ascribe to BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1)\u2019s exception to the Comptroller\u2019s power to compromise a license suspension or revocation if the licensee violates CL \u00a7 10-107\u2019s prohibition on the sale of tobacco products to a minor. It seems obvious that when the General Assembly enacted this provision in 1994, it thought the Comptroller already had the power to suspend or revoke a license for such violations.</p> <p id=\"b726-7\" pgmap=\"726(50) 727(163)\">The Comptroller argues that the only language the Legislature must have had in mind is BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2)\u2019s authority to sanction a licensee for fraudulent or deceptive use of its license\u2014an interpretation we have previously noted does damage to the text.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Two Farms contends that the reference in \u00a7 16\u2014212(e)(1) must be to \u00a7 16-210(a)(6)(ii)\u2019s power to suspend or revoke if a licensee is convicted of \u201ca misdemeanor that is a crime of moral turpitude .... \u201d However, this proffered construction is extremely doubtful, because the quoted language was not added to the law until 2000\u2014six years after \u00a7 16-212(e)(1).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The hardest alternative to accept is that the General Assembly was simply mistaken when it thought the Comptroller had the power to suspend or revoke a license for illegal tobacco sales to minors. While the 1994 change is not controlling as to the meaning of preexisting law, it is some indication of legislative intent. Moreover, we strive to give effect to all of the language in a statute and to avoid a construction that would render BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1) superfluous or illusory. See pp. 682-83, 174 A.3d at 458-59, supra. In light of this principle, we consider one more alternative construction of the 1994 exception.</p> <p id=\"b727-5\" pgmap=\"727\">7. Does the Comptroller have the \u201cimplied\u201d or \u201cinherent\u201d authority to suspend or revoke a license for illegal sales of tobacco products to minors?</p> <p id=\"b727-6\" pgmap=\"727(75) 728(54)\">As Justice Frankfurter has suggested, we now explore \u201cwhat is below the surface of the statute and yet fairly part of it.\u201d Frankfurter, supra, 47 Colum. L. Rev. at 533. The text and legislative history of the relevant statutes make it clear that CL \u00a7 10-107 and Title 16 of the Business Regulations Article are joined at the hip.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In 1994, the General Assembly expressly included Title 16 licensees within the prohibition of CL \u00a7 10-107.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> At the same session, the Legislature amended BR \u00a7 16-210(a) to include violations of Title 16 as a ground for suspension or revocation of a license. And the same legislation included the troublesome exception to BR \u00a7 16-212(e) for CL \u00a7 10-107 violations\u2014a further indication that the two statutes are tied together.</p> <p id=\"b728-4\" pgmap=\"728\">The 1994 amendments to CL \u00a7 10-107 reinforce Judge Rodowsky\u2019s conclusion that this provision creates a \u201cclass of ineligible purchasers.\u201d Allied Vending, 382 Md. at 327, 631 A.2d 77. Because licensees may only sell tobacco products to a lawful \u201cconsumer,\u201d BR \u00a7 16-101(e), a licensed retailer illegally making such a sale to a minor is acting outside the scope of its license and thus, violates Title 16. Does the law leave the licensing agency, and the Comptroller, powerless to discipline a licensee under such circumstances? We think not.</p> <p id=\"b728-5\" pgmap=\"728\">According to 61 Am. Jur. 2d Licenses &lt;&amp; Permits at \u00a7 66, \u201c[i]n the absence of constitutional limitations, the ultimate authority from which a license to carry on as a particular activity derives[,] has inherent power to withdraw the license.\u201d See also State ex rel.

See also Advice Letter of Special Assistant Trest-man, supra at n. 18 (\u201cThe Comptroller\u2019s issuance of a license to sell cigarettes at retail contemplates that the licensees will sell cigarettes in a lawful manner.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b728-6\" pgmap=\"728(21) 729(175)\">At one time\u2014more than 70 years ago\u2014Maryland courts would not have subscribed to such a rule. In 1943, in Burley v. Cty. of Annapolis, 182 Md. 307, 34 A.2d 603 (1943), a divided Court of Appeals overturned a municipality\u2019s revocation of a billiards license. The revocation was premised on the fact that gambling was occurring on the premises, a cause not specified in the licensing ordinance. Citing American Jurisprudence and other authorities, the majority said: \u201cWhere a statute or ordinance authorized the revocation for causes enumerated, such licenses cannot be revoked on any ground other than the cause specified.\u201d Id. at 311, 34 A.2d 603 (Internal quotation omitted). In the last 70 years, no Maryland case has cited Burley for this proposition. In 1991, West Virginia\u2019s highest court suggested that the Maryland case was contrary to the rule recognized by the majority of jurisdictions for certain implied grounds for licensee discipline. Mounts v. Chafin, 186 W.Va. 156, 411 S.E.2d 481, 487 (1991). And as noted earlier, p. 694, 174 A.3d at 465 supra, 51 Am. Jur. 2d Licenses &amp; Permits at \u00a7 56 now recognizes the inherent power of a licensing agency to withdraw a license.</p> <p id=\"b729-5\" pgmap=\"729\">More importantly, the Court of Appeals has broadly affirmed the implied authority of licensing agencies in Lussier v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, 343 Md. 681, 684 A.2d 804 (1996). There, the Court upheld the Commission\u2019s authority to impose a monetary penalty of up to $5000 for violations of an agency regulation, despite the lack of express statutory authorization. See also Thanner Enterprises, LLC v. Baltimore Cnty., 414 Md. 265, 276-77, 995 A.2d 257 (2013) (citing Lussier for the proposition that a sanction imposed by a licensing agency may be \u201cimpliedly authorized\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b729-6\" pgmap=\"729(35) 730(32)\">Whether Burley is still good law is an issue for the Court of Appeals. We need not decide it here. The text and history of the relevant statutes in this case manifest a legislative intent not present in Burley\u2014that aside from the express statutory-grounds for suspension or removal of a retailer\u2019s license\u2014an implied cause exists for illegal sales to minors that would violate CL \u00a7 10-107.</p> <p id=\"b730-4\" pgmap=\"730\">First, in Title 16 of the BR Article\u2014and 56 other licensing statutes rewritten during the code revision process\u2014the General Assembly itself made it clear that licensing authorities have an implied, if not \u201cinherent,\u201d power to suspend or revoke a license for certain \u201cfundamental\u201d reasons. See pp. 684-86, 174 A.3d at 460, supra.</p> <p id=\"b730-5\" pgmap=\"730\"> Second, like a fraudulent application for or use of a license, acting outside the scope of a license is a fundamental ground for suspending or revoking a license.</p> <p id=\"b730-6\" pgmap=\"730\">Third, a retail licensee acts outside the scope of its license when it illegally sells tobacco products to a minor, an ineligible purchaser, in express violation of CL \u00a7 10-107.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Such misconduct impliedly violates Title 16 of the BR Article, a specific ground for license suspension or revocation under the 1994 amendment to BR \u00a7 16-210(b)(2).</p> <p id=\"b730-7\" pgmap=\"730\">Fourth, CL \u00a7 10-107 expressly embraces retail licensees and BR \u00a7 16\u2014212(e)(1) ties licensee discipline to violations of CL \u00a7 10-107.</p> <p id=\"b730-8\" pgmap=\"730(85) 731(12)\">In short, the Comptroller has not pulled this ground for suspension out of thin air. Suspension for illegal tobacco sales to minors is consistent with the text and history of the relevant statutes and the express assumption of the General Assembly. To conclude otherwise would lead to an absurd and unreasonable result that the holder of a retail license is immune from administrative sanction for harmful conduct, despite the Legislature\u2019s efforts to tie both together. Finally, our interpretation does not render BR \u00a7 16-212(e)(1) ineffectual or surplusage or run counter to the language of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b731-4\" pgmap=\"731\"> Thus, we conclude that a retailer that illegally sells tobacco products to a minor may have its license suspended under BR \u00a7 16-210(b)(2) for violating \u201cTitle 16 of the Business Regulations Article.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b731-5\" pgmap=\"731\">8. Who Wins? Who loses?</p> <p id=\"b731-6\" pgmap=\"731\"> The Comptroller may have won the war in this case; but he has lost this battle. A court may not uphold an agency decision on any basis other than the findings or reasons stated by the agency. Johnson v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Bd., 145 Md.App. 96, 106, 801 A.2d 1092 (2002).

We cannot affirm the Comptroller\u2019s decision on this basis and, in fact, reject that administrative determination. Because the agency here is not right for the right reason, we must uphold the circuit court\u2019s decision in favor of Two Farms.</p> <p id=\"b731-8\" pgmap=\"731\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We note that BR \u00a7 16-207(a) provides that \"[ujnless a license is renewed for a one-year term as provided in this section, the license expires on the first April 30 after its effective date\u201d and that BR \u00a7 16-304 states that \"[a] county license expires on the first anniversary of its effective date.\u201d In light of these provisions, it is likely that the license, which is the subject of the suspension in this case, has expired and may have been renewed. Nevertheless, we believe this case is not moot, because in the future, the Comptroller could use the existence of Two Farms's unlawful sales to minors against the retailer in future proceedings, see Thana v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019r for Charles Cnty., 226 Md.App. 555, 568, 130 A.3d 1103 (2016), most notably in the Comptroller's consideration of a license renewal.

Under the federal Synar Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-26, as a condition of receiving certain substance abuse grants from the federal government, Maryland must have a law that prohibits the sale of tobacco products to minors. CL \u00a7 10-107 is that law. In addition, the Synar Amendment requires the states to enforce their laws on the sale of tobacco products to minors in a matter that can reasonably be expected to reduce availability and to annually conduct random, unannounced inspections to ensure compliance with those laws.

If the \u201cunlawful\u201d language appeared in BR \u00a7 16-210(a)(2), this case would be extremely relevant, but it does not.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"22\"> <p id=\"b726-10\" pgmap=\"726(25) 727(15)\">. On the other hand, we reject as unreasonable the notion that the Legislature in \u00a7 16-212(e)(1), had in mind only those rare or hypothetical cases of illegal sales to minors perpetuated by the actual fraud of retail licensees.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"23\"> <p id=\"b727-8\" pgmap=\"727\">. Aside from the fact that one provision uses the terms, \u201cviolation,\u201d while the other uses \"conviction,\u201d there might be other difficulties with Two Farms's argument. At common law, a violation of CL \u00a7 10-107 probably would not have been a crime of moral turpitude, although it might qualify under the more liberal interpretation we have given to \"moral turpitude\u201d in licensing statutes. See Stidwell, 144 Md.App. 613, 799 A.2d 444. This is a question we need not decide, because this case does not involve a conviction for violating \u00a7 10-107.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"24\"> <p id=\"b727-9\" pgmap=\"727\">. The Latin term for this aid to statutory construction is in pari materia\u2014statutes on the same subject are construed together.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"25\"> <p id=\"b728-7\" pgmap=\"728\">. No doubt, such licensees were already covered by the statute. However, the express inclusion is not without significance.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"26\"> <p id=\"b729-7\" pgmap=\"729\">. Burley also represented a rote application of the canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius (The expression of one is the exclusion of the other). More modern Court of Appeals decisions state that this canon should be used with \"extreme caution\u201d so that it is not applied to override the intention of the Legislature. Breslin v. Powell, 421 Md. 266, 294, 26 A.3d 878 (2011); and Potomac Abatement, Inc. v. Sanchez, 424 Md. 701, 112-13, 37 A.3d 972 (2012).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"27\"> <p id=\"b730-9\" pgmap=\"730\">. Because the Legislature has so forcefully expressed its intent in linking the licensing provisions and CL \u00a7 10-107, we conclude that an illegal sale to a minor is an act outside the scope of the license. We express no view on what other actions, if any, by a licensee would fit that description or would constitute an implied ground for disciplinary action.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"28\"> <p id=\"b731-9\" pgmap=\"731\">. Subsection (b)(2) also authorizes licensee discipline for violations of regulations adopted under Title 16. If the Comptroller exercises the disciplinary authority that we recognize here, it may be wise for the office to adopt a regulation expressly specifying violation of a statute or ordinance barring illegal sales of tobacco products to minors as a ground for license suspension or revocation. Such a regulation would obviate any fair notice issues.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
