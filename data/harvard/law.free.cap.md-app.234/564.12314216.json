Grandison v. State, 305 Md. 685, 697, 506 A.2d 580, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 873, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174, and reh\u2019g denied, 479 U.S. 1001, 107 S.Ct. 611, 93 L.Ed.2d 609 (1986). Pursuant to their unlawful agreement, Evans succeeded in murdering Scott Pieehowicz but failed in killing Cheryl Pie-ehowicz, instead murdering her sister, Susan Kennedy, by mistake.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id.</p> <p id=\"b604-4\" pgmap=\"604\">Later that year, Grandison, Evans, and two others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were tried in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, and witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512. United States v. Grandison, 780 F.2d 425, 428 (4th Cir. 1985), vacated sub nom. Kelly v. United States, 479 U.S. 1076, 107 S.Ct. 1270, 94 L.Ed.2d 132 (1987), aff'd on remand, 885 F.2d 143 (4th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 934, 110 S.Ct. 2178, 109 L.Ed.2d 507 (1990). All four defendants were convicted of both charges, id., and Grandison, in particular, was sentenced to life imprisonment and a consecutive term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Grandison, 305 Md. at 698, 506 A.2d 580.</p> <p id=\"b604-5\" pgmap=\"604\"> The following year, after removal of the Maryland case to Somerset County at Grandison\u2019s request,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was convicted, by a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, of conspiracy to murder, two counts of first-degree murder, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Id. He was thereafter sentenced, by the jury, to death sentences for both first-degree murders, and the court imposed a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and twenty years for the handgun violation consecutive to the life sentence.\u201d Id. Both of the latter sentences \u201cwere imposed to run consecutively to the life plus ten years sentence previously imposed in the federal case.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b605-3\" pgmap=\"605\">Grandison subsequently filed a post-conviction petition, in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, and, in 1992, that court, relying upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> vacated his death sentences but otherwise denied his claims. Grandison v. State, 341 Md. 175, 194, 670 A.2d 398 (1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996), and reh\u2019g denied, 519 U.S. 1143, 117 S.Ct. 1021, 136 L.Ed.2d 897 (1997). At resentencing, a jury in Somerset County reimposed the two death sentences for the murders of Scott Piechowicz and Susan Kennedy. Id.</p> <p id=\"b605-4\" pgmap=\"605\">Grandison thereafter lodged repeated challenges, in both state and federal court, to those sentences, finally gaining a temporary reprieve when, in 2006, the Court of Appeals enjoined the State from carrying out the death penalty against his co-defendant, Evans, because the protocols governing the method of administering that penalty, lethal injection, had been adopted, held the Court, in a manner that violated the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act. Evans v. State, 396 Md. 256, 344-46, 350, 914 A.2d 25 (2006), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 835, 128 S.Ct. 65, 169 L.Ed.2d 53 (2007).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b605-5\" pgmap=\"605(49) 606(154) 607(11)\">That injunction was to remain in effect until new protocols were promulgated in accordance with the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, id. at 350, 914 A.2d 25, but such new protocols were never promulgated. See Fiscal and Policy Note (Revised), S.B. 276, at 3-5 (2013), Instead, the General Assembly repealed the death penalty in 2013. 2013 Md. Laws, eh. 156, \u00a7 3. Meanwhile, on June 6, 2013, Grandison filed, in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, the first of two motions to correct an illegal sentence (which he supplemented several times) that are the subject of the present appeals. Following two hearings, the circuit court, on November 13, 2014, issued a memorandum opinion and order granting relief, at the State\u2019s own concession, on a single claim\u2014that the twenty-year sentence imposed for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence was illegal, because, at the time Grandison committed that offense, its maximum penalty was fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court vacated Grandison\u2019s twenty-year sentence for that crime and imposed a fifteen-year term of imprisonment, consecutive to his life sentence for conspiracy as well as to Grandison\u2019s federal sentences. But it denied all of his other claims. Grandison noted a timely appeal from that order, raising the following questions:</p> <blockquote id=\"b607-4\" pgmap=\"607\">I. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in ruling appellant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder did not merge with his conviction for use of a handgun in the commission of [ ] a felony or crime of violence under the required evidence test?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b607-5\" pgmap=\"607\">II. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in holding a motion to correct illegal sentence is not the appropriate forum to consider appellant\u2019s allegations his sentences are illegal under the Bartkus exception to dual sovereignty?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b607-6\" pgmap=\"607\">III. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in holding the jury was properly hearkened since a mere hearkening of counts of an indictment without specifying the offense does not constitute a hearkening of the verdict as to first degree murder or any other offense?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b607-7\" pgmap=\"607\">IV. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in ruling after vacating sentence under Mills the court had the authority to resentence and there was no legal requirement the resentencing jury announce their findings in open court or requirement to poll or hearken their findings?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b607-8\" pgmap=\"607\">V. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in imposing the fifteen year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence consecutive to Grandison\u2019s federal sentences of life plus ten years after the federal authorities made those sentences run concurrent with the State sentences?</blockquote> <p id=\"b607-9\" pgmap=\"607(69) 608(14)\">Then, in 2015, Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, exercising his pardon power, commuted Grandison\u2019s death sentences to sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Executive Order 01.01.2015.05 (Jan. 20, 2015). Thereafter, Grandison filed, in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, a second motion to correct an illegal sentence. The circuit court subsequently issued a written memorandum opinion and order denying that motion. Grandison noted a timely appeal from that order, raising two question for review, which we have slightly rephrased as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b608-5\" pgmap=\"608\">I. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to correct illegal sentence in holding that the former Governor had authority under Maryland Constitution, Art, II, \u00a7 20 to sua sponte exercise executive powers to commute Grandison\u2019s death sentences to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole without an application having been made seeking commutation?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b608-6\" pgmap=\"608\">II, Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in holding that the former Governor\u2019s commutation of his sentences of death to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole did not violate Art, 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which prohibits ex post facto laws in criminal cases?</blockquote> <p id=\"b608-7\" pgmap=\"608\">On this Court\u2019s own motion, we consolidated these appeals.</p> <p id=\"b608-8\" pgmap=\"608\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b608-9\" pgmap=\"608\">I, Appeal No. 2039</p> <p id=\"b608-10\" pgmap=\"608\">A.</p> <p id=\"b608-11\" pgmap=\"608\"> Grandison claims that the circuit abused its discretion in ruling that his convictions for first-degree murder did not merge with his conviction for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence under the required evidence test. This claim is without merit.</p> <p id=\"b608-12\" pgmap=\"608\">Although the Court of Appeals held, in State v. Ferrell, 313 Md. 291, 297, 545 A.2d 653 (1988), that use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence and the predicate felony or crime of violence are the same offense under the required evidence test, that holding addressed a different circumstance\u2014-whether the predicate offense and the handgun offense could be tried in successive prosecutions. Ferrell held that they could not be tried in successive prosecutions. Id. Ferrell said nothing about whether separate sentences may be imposed for those crimes if they are brought in the same trial.</p> <p id=\"b609-4\" pgmap=\"609\">The question before us was squarely addressed by the Supreme Court in Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). There, the Court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b609-5\" pgmap=\"609\">Where, as here, a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the \u201csame\u201d conduct under Blockburger,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.</blockquote> <p id=\"b609-6\" pgmap=\"609\">Id. at 368-39, 103 S.Ct. 673.</p> <p id=\"b609-7\" pgmap=\"609\">At the time the offenses at issue were committed, the statute proscribing unlawful use of a handgun stated as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b609-8\" pgmap=\"609\">Unlawful use of handgun in commission of crime.\u2014Any person who shall use a handgun in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article, shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall, in addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor ... be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction[.]</blockquote> <p id=\"b609-9\" pgmap=\"609\">Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol., Supp. 1982), Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b609-10\" pgmap=\"609(50) 610(78)\"> It is manifest that the General Assembly intended that a separate sentence be imposed upon any person convicted of a violation of Section 36B(d), \u201cin addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., Whack v. State, 288 Md. 137, 145-49, 416 A.2d 265 (1980) (holding that separate sentences may be imposed for a violation of Section 36B(d) and the predicate offense, where both convictions were the result of the same act, so long as the charges are brought in a single trial), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981). Given that unambiguous expression of legislative intent, and the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction in Missouri v. Hunter, it is clear that Grandison\u2019s claim fails.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b610-5\" pgmap=\"610\">B.</p> <p id=\"b610-6\" pgmap=\"610\"> As noted earlier, Grandison was prosecuted in both federal and Maryland courts, in the former for conspiracy to murder the witnesses in a prior federal narcotics trial and in the latter for, among other things, first-degree murder of those same witnesses. He now complains that the Maryland prosecution was a \u201csham,\u201d essentially indistinguishable from the federal prosecution, and that, therefore, his Maryland sentences are illegal, under the purported Bartkus<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine. From that premise, Grandi-son concludes that the circuit court abused its discretion in ruling that this claim was not cognizable in a motion to correct an illegal sentence. To understand this claim requires a brief digression into the Supreme Court decision upon which Grandison relies, Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684, reh\u2019g denied, 360 U.S. 907, 79 S.Ct. 1283, 3 L.Ed.2d 1258 (1959).</p> <p id=\"b611-4\" pgmap=\"611\">In Bartkus, the defendant had been acquitted, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, of robbery of a federally insured savings and loan association. Id. at 121-22, 79 S.Ct. 676. Bartkus was thereafter charged, in the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois, with violation of a state robbery statute. Id. at 122, 79 S.Ct. 676. \u201cThe facts recited in the Illinois indictment were substantially identical to those contained in the prior federal indictment.\u201d Id. Bartkus moved to dismiss based upon double jeopardy, but the Illinois court rejected that claim. Id. He was thereafter convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment as a repeat offender. Id. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed, as did the United States Supreme Court, the latter holding that a defendant may be prosecuted in both federal and state courts for the same act without violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because, under the \u201cdual sovereignty\u201d doctrine,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> an act may be an offense against both the state where it was committed as well as against the federal government.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id. at 122, 136-39, 79 S.Ct. 676.</p> <p id=\"b612-4\" pgmap=\"612\">In dictum, the Court observed that the record did not \u201csustain a conclusion that the state prosecution was a sham and a cover for a federal prosecution, and thereby in essential fact another federal prosecution[,]\u201d id. at 124, 79 S.Ct. 676, which would have been barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See id. at 123, 79 S.Ct. 676. Thereafter, some courts interpreted that statement as expressing a narrow so-called \u201cBartkus exception\u201d to the dual sovereignty doctrine, which bars a successive \u201csham prosecution.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Guzman, 85 F.3d 823, 826 (1st Cir.) (observing that \u201cunder very limited circumstances[,] successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns might transgress the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d), cert. denied, 619 U.S. 1020, 117 S.Ct. 537, 136 L.Ed.2d 422 (1996); In re Kunstler, 914 F.2d 505, 517 (4th Cir. 1990) (noting that \u201ca \u2018tool of the same authorities\u2019 exception is possible in some circumstances,\u201d which \u201cmay only be established by proof that State officials had little or no independent volition in their proceedings\u201d), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 969, 111 S.Ct, 1607, 113 L.Ed.2d 669 (1991); United States v. Aboumoussallem, 726 F.2d 906, 910 (2d Cir. 1984) (noting that \u201ca narrow exception to the \u2018dual sovereignty\u2019 doctrine, carved out in Bartkus v. Illinois, bars a second prosecution where one prosecuting sovereign can be said to be acting as a \u2018tool\u2019 of the other, or where the second prosecution amounts to a \u2018sham and a cover\u2019 for the first\u201d (internal citations omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b612-5\" pgmap=\"612(73) 613(83)\">Other courts, however, have questioned whether there even is such an exception. See, e.g., United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1994) (declining to decide whether the \u201csham prosecution\u201d exception exists); United States v. Brocksmith, 991 F.2d 1363, 1366 (7th Cir.) (stating that \u201c[w]e have questioned whether Bartkus truly meant to create such an exception, and we have uniformly rejected such claims\u201d), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 999, 114 S.Ct. 569, 126 L.Ed.2d 468 (1993), and reh\u2019g denied, 510 U.S. 1159, 114 S.Ct. 1143, 127 L.Ed.2d 452 (1994); United States v. Raymer, 941 F.2d 1031, 1037 (10th Cir. 1991) (observing that \u201c[a] possible exception might exist\u201d); United States v. Harrison, 918 F.2d 469, 474 (5th Cir. 1990) (noting that, although \u201cBartkus does suggest that a state prosecution may not be used as a cover and a tool for a federal prosecution[,]\u201d the Court \u201cdid not define a clear exception in that ease\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b613-5\" pgmap=\"613\">In any event, even if we assume, arguendo, that the Bart-kus exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine exists, the circuit court correctly concluded that such a claim may not be raised in a Rule 4-345(a) motion. In United States v. Liddy, 542 F.2d 76, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1976), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit observed that the defendant\u2019s burden \u201cof establishing that federal officials are controlling or manipulating the state processes is substantial[,]\u201d namely, that he \u201cmust demonstrate that the state officials had little or no independent volition in the state proceedings.\u201d To prevail on such a claim would likely require far more than Grandison\u2019s bald allegation and, in the absence of an affidavit from the prosecution admitting to such a scheme (a most unlikely occurrence), would require an eviden-tiary hearing. But that would be entirely contrary to the nature of a Rule 4-345(a) motion, which is focused on the \u201cnarrow\u201d category of sentences that are \u201cintrinsically and substantively unlawful,\u201d not those that may be beset by \u201csome arguable procedural flaw.\u201d Colvin v. State, 450 Md. 718, 725, 150 A.3d 850 (2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, \u201ca motion to correct an illegal sentence is not[,]\u201d as Grandison would have it, \u201can alternative method of obtaining belated appellate review of the proceedings that led to the imposition of judgment and sentence in a criminal case.\u201d State v. Wilkins, 393 Md. 269, 273, 900 A.2d 765 (2006).</p> <p id=\"b613-6\" pgmap=\"613(41) 614(116)\"> Even if such a claim were cognizable in a Rule 4-345(a) motion, we would conclude that it is barred by the law of the case doctrine. Prior to Evans\u2019s and Grandison\u2019s separate 1984 trials, both defendants filed motions to dismiss, contending that Benton v. Maryland, 895 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), which held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was applicable to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, had effectively abrogated the dual sovereignty doctrine, as articulated in Bartkus. Evans v. State, 301 Md. 45, 49-50, 481 A.2d 1135 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1034, 105 S.Ct. 1411, 84 L.Ed.2d 795 (1985). The Court of Appeals rejected that assertion and remanded for trials, which resulted in convictions and sentences, which Grandison now challenges. See id. at 51, 58, 481 A.2d 1135. Here, however, instead of disparaging Bartkus, Grandison relies upon it as the basis for his claim.</p> <p id=\"b614-5\" pgmap=\"614\"> Under the law of the case doctrine, \u201conce an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be the law of the case.\u201d Scott v. State, 379 Md. 170, 183, 840 A.2d 715 (2004). Moreover, \u201c \u2018[decisions rendered by a prior appellate panel will generally govern the second appeal\u2019 at the same appellate level as well, unless the previous decision is incorrect because it is out of keeping with controlling principles announced by a higher court and following the decision would result in manifest injustice.\u201d Id. at 184, 840 A.2d 715 (quoting Hawes v. Liberty Homes, 100 Md.App. 222, 231, 640 A.2d 743 (1994)). And, more recently, in Holloway v. State, 232 Md.App. 272, 282, 157 A.3d 356 (2017), we observed that the law of the case doctrine applies, not only to a claim that was actually decided in a prior appeal, but also to any claim \u201cthat could have been raised and decided.\u201d Furthermore, the Court of Appeals has expressly rejected the notion that \u201cthe doctrine of law of the case [is] inapplicable to motions to correct an illegal sentence.\u201d Scott, 379 Md. at 183, 840 A.2d 715.</p> <p id=\"b614-6\" pgmap=\"614(43) 615(14)\">Nothing prevented Grandison, in his 1984 double jeopardy challenge, from raising the same claim that he raises before us now. Were this issue properly before us, we would hold that, as it \u201ccould have been raised and decided,\u201d it is barred by the law of the case doctrine. See Holloway, 232 Md.App. at 282, 157 A.3d 356.</p> <p id=\"b615-4\" pgmap=\"615\">C.</p> <p id=\"b615-5\" pgmap=\"615\"> Grandison contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in holding that the jury was properly hearkened. Not only is this claim utterly without merit, it is foreclosed by Colvin v. State, 450 Md. 718, 727, 150 A.3d 850 (2016). There, the Court of Appeals held that a claim, alleging that the jury had not been properly polled, thereby rendering the sentences imposed on its verdict illegal, was not cognizable under Rule 4-345(a). Id. The Court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b615-6\" pgmap=\"615\">Under Maryland law, procedural challenges to a verdict ought be done by contemporaneous objection and, if not corrected, presented through the direct appeal process. Such claims do not come within the purview of Rule 4-345(a).</blockquote> <p id=\"b615-7\" pgmap=\"615\">Id. at 728, 150 A.3d 850. Likewise, Grandison\u2019s claim of an improperly hearkened jury is a procedural challenge to his verdict and is therefore not cognizable in a motion to correct an illegal sentence.</p> <p id=\"b615-8\" pgmap=\"615\">We note that Grandison does not claim that the jury was not polled or hearkened at all, a defect that, if proven, would fall outside of the holding of Colvin. See id at 727-28, 150 A.3d 850. In any event, the circuit court, as it did not have the benefit of Colvin at the time it rendered its decision, painstakingly examined the record and, at pages 16-19 of its memorandum opinion, demonstrated the falsity of Grandison\u2019s claim as to whether the jury had been properly hearkened. We need not repeat here what the circuit court wrote, except to point out that it was correct. Thus, even if Grandison\u2019s claim were cognizable in a Rule 4-345(a) motion, it would fail nonetheless.</p> <p id=\"b615-9\" pgmap=\"615\">D.</p> <p id=\"b615-10\" pgmap=\"615(27) 616(41)\"> Grandison maintains that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his claims that the resentencing court lacked the authority to impose sentence and that the resen-teneing violated the prohibition against double jeopardy, because both the original sentencing jury and the resentencing jury failed to announce their findings in open court, nor were they polled or hearkened to their findings. These claims are utterly without merit.</p> <p id=\"b616-5\" pgmap=\"616\">When the post-conviction court vacated Grandison\u2019s original death sentences, under Mills v. Maryland, it is obvious that resentencing, with the possibility of new death sentences, was permitted and did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. See Twigg v. State, 447 Md. 1, 21, 133 A.3d 1125 (2016) (noting that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has made clear that resentencing does not offend double jeopardy principles\u201d). As for Grandison\u2019s complaints regarding the procedures followed during the resentencing, those matters are not cognizable in a Rule 4-345(a) motion. See Colvin, 450 Md. at 728, 150 A.3d 850. But, in any event, as the circuit court explained in its memorandum opinion, the procedures followed fully comported with the then-extant applicable Maryland rule.</p> <p id=\"b616-6\" pgmap=\"616\">E.</p> <p id=\"b616-7\" pgmap=\"616\"> Finally, Grandison complains that the circuit court abused its discretion in imposing the (new) fifteen-year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence consecutive to his federal sentences. He does not (and cannot) complain that the newly imposed sentence constituted an illegal increase in his sentence, as it merely replaced a former twenty-year sentence that had also been made consecutive to his state and federal sentences.</p> <p id=\"b616-8\" pgmap=\"616(91) 617(87)\"> The short answer to this complaint is that it is not cognizable in a motion to correct an illegal sentence, which encompasses only claims of substantively illegal sentences. Colvin, 450 Md. at 728, 150 A.3d 850. \u201cAn illegal sentence, for purposes of Rule 4-345(a), is one in which the illegality \u2018inheres in the sentence itself; i.e., there either has been no conviction warranting any sentence for the particular offense or the sentence is not a permitted one for the conviction upon which it was imposed and, for either reason, is intrinsically and substantively unlawful.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 725, 150 A.3d 850 (quoting Chaney v. State, 397 Md. 460, 466, 918 A.2d 506 (2007)). Here, the fifteen-year sentence was provided by statute, see Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol., 1982 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), and is not \u201cintrinsically and substantively unlawful[,]\u201d whether imposed concurrently with or consecutively to any other sentence Grandison may be serving, so long as the resulting sentence does not constitute an increase of his previous sentence (which it does not). See id.</p> <p id=\"b617-5\" pgmap=\"617\">II. Appeal No. 2822</p> <p id=\"b617-6\" pgmap=\"617\">In Appeal No. 2822, Grandison, apparently ungrateful that he has been spared from the death penalty, challenges the legality of former Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s commutation of his death sentences to sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. We shall first address the constitutional basis for a governor\u2019s pardon power and then address Grandi-son\u2019s claims, concluding that none of them has any merit.</p> <p id=\"b617-7\" pgmap=\"617\">A.</p> <p id=\"b617-8\" pgmap=\"617\">The Governor of Maryland has had the power to grant reprieves and pardons under every version of the Maryland Constitution, dating back to 1776. See Md. Const., Art. XXXIII (1776) (providing that the Governor \u201cmay alone exercise all other [of] the executive powers of government,\u201d including the power to \u201cgrant reprieves or pardons for any crime, except in such cases where the law shall otherwise direct\u201d). Under the present 1867 Maryland Constitution, the Governor possesses the power to \u201cgrant reprieves and pardons,\u201d as provided under Article II, \u00a7 20:</p> <blockquote id=\"b617-9\" pgmap=\"617(70) 618(58)\">He shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons, except in cases of impeachment, and in cases, in which he is prohibited by other Articles of this Constitution; and to remit fines and forfeitures for offences against the State; but shall not remit the principal or interest of any debt due the State, except, in cases of fines and forfeitures; and before granting a nolle prosequi, or pardon, he shall give notice, in one or more newspapers, of the application made for it, and of the day on, or after which, his decision will be given; and in every case, in which he exercises this power, he shall report to either Branch of the Legislature, whenever required, the petitions, recommendations and reasons, which influenced his decision.</blockquote> <p id=\"b618-4\" pgmap=\"618(170) 619(20)\">Alfred S. Niles, the author of a treatise on Maryland constitutional law, stated that \u201cthere is practically no restriction upon\u201d a Governor\u2019s \u201cpardoning any offence against the state, except in the case of an impeachment.\u201d Alfred S. Niles, Maryland Constitutional Law 122 (1915). More recently, Judge Dan Friedman, a member of this Court and the author of another treatise on the subject, wrote that \u201cthe pardon power is broad\u201d and that, except in cases of impeachment and, perhaps, bribery of public officials, see Md. Const., Art. Ill, \u00a7 50,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there is \u201cno other provision that limits the Governor\u2019s pardon power[.]\u201d Dan Friedman, The Maryland State Constitution 119 (2011). Moreover, the Court of Appeals has recognized that the gubernatorial pardon power encompasses the power to commute a sentence, Jones v. State, 247 Md. 530, 534, 233 A.2d 791 (1967), reh\u2019g denied, 259 Md. 146, 268 A.2d 493 (1970),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that is, to \u201csubstitute[ ] a lesser penalty for the grantee\u2019s offense for the penalty imposed by the court in which the grantee was convicted.\u201d Md. Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2017 Supp.), Correctional Services Article (\u201cCS\u201d), \u00a7 7-101(d).</p> <p id=\"b619-4\" pgmap=\"619(178) 620(26)\"> Indeed, the gubernatorial pardon power is derived from the Maryland Constitution itself, not from any legislative enactment, and it therefore may be exercised independently of legislative control, so long as the Governor, in exercising that power, does not violate federal constitutional provisions or their Maryland cognates. See Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256, 266, 95 S.Ct. 379, 42 L.Ed.2d 430 (1974) (concluding that the analogous presidential pardon power<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cflows from the Constitution alone, not from any legislative enactments, and that it cannot be modified, abridged, or diminished by the Congress\u201d). That is especially true in Maryland, in light of Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which provides for the separation of powers. We conclude that the gubernatorial pardon power is plenary, although, undoubtedly, in commuting a prisoner\u2019s sentence, the Governor may not impose a reduced sentence that, itself, constitutes \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See Schick, 419 U.S. at 266, 95 S.Ct. 379 (stating that the presidential pardon provision allows \u201cplenary authority in the President to \u2018forgive\u2019 the convicted person in part or entirely, to reduce a penalty in terms of a specified number of years, or to alter it with conditions which are in themselves constitutionally unobj ectionable\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b620-5\" pgmap=\"620\">Having set forth the Governor\u2019s broad pardon power, we turn next to address Grandison\u2019s claims that former Governor O\u2019Malley exceeded that power in commuting his death sentences to sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p> <p id=\"b620-6\" pgmap=\"620\">B.</p> <p id=\"b620-7\" pgmap=\"620\"> Grandison claims that the former Governor had no authority under Maryland Constitution, Article II, \u00a7 20, to sua sponte exercise his executive power to commute his death sentences to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole because he did not apply for commutation. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b620-8\" pgmap=\"620\">The passage on which Grandison relies provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"ASl\" pgmap=\"620\">and before granting a nolle prosequi, or pardon, he shall give notice, in one or more newspapers, of the application made for it, and of the day on, or after which, his decision will be given;</blockquote> <p id=\"b620-9\" pgmap=\"620\">Md. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 20 (emphasis added). Grandison maintains that the bolded language must be interpreted as imposing a condition precedent upon the grant of a gubernatorial pardon, namely, that the grantee must first have applied for a pardon.</p> <p id=\"b620-10\" pgmap=\"620(136) 621(83)\"> As we have just explained, the gubernatorial pardon power is plenary. Specifically, it does not depend upon a request by the grantee. The only substantive limitations on that power are that it may not be exercised \u201cin cases of impeachment, and in cases, in which [the Governor] is prohibited by other Articles of this Constitution.\u201d Md. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 20. We interpret the procedural limitation, on which Grandison relies, that \u201cbefore granting a nolle prosequi, or pardon, [the Governor] shall give notice, in one or more newspapers, of the application made for it, and of the day on, or after which, his decision will be given[,]\u201d as merely a notice requirement and not a condition precedent. Md. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 20. As the State aptly puts it in its brief, \u201cthe most logical interpretation of the \u2018application\u2019 language is that the Governor will be required to give notice of any application received, but only in the event that one was actually received.\u201d In any event, Grandison acknowledges that former Governor O\u2019Malley gave the required notice of \u201cthe day on, or after which, his decision [would] be given.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the fact that Grandison did not apply for a commutation of sentence does not render the actions of the former Governor illegal.</p> <p id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">C.</p> <p id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621\">1.</p> <p id=\"b621-7\" pgmap=\"621\"> Finally, we turn to Grandison\u2019s assertion that the former Governor, in commuting his death sentences to sentences of life without the possibility of parole, imposed illegal sentences, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. That Article provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b621-8\" pgmap=\"621\">That retrospective Laws, punishing acts committed before the existence of such Laws, and by them only declared criminal are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore, no ex post facto Law ought to be made; nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed, or required.</blockquote> <p id=\"b621-9\" pgmap=\"621\">Md. Const. Declaration of Rights, art. 17.</p> <p id=\"b621-10\" pgmap=\"621(61) 622(57)\"> This provision is generally construed in pari materia with its federal counterpart, Article I, Section 10, of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Doe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., 430 Md. 535, 548, 62 A.3d 123 (2013) (plurality opinion); id. at 577 n.1, 62 A.3d 123 (McDonald, J., concurring); id. at 578-79, 62 A.3d 123 (Barbera, J., dissenting). On its face, the Ex Post Facto Clause arguably applies only to the retroactive application of a statute, not to the purportedly retroactive application of an executive action, as took place here. But even if we were to assume that executive actions are included within the strictures of Article 17, Grandison\u2019s claim must fail, as we next explain.</p> <p id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">In light of recent decisional law, the test to be applied, in determining whether there has been a violation of Article 17, is unclear, as the Court of Appeals has been sharply divided over that question. But, under either of the tests applied in the most recent decisions by our State\u2019s highest Court, there was no ex post facto violation in the instant case.</p> <p id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">The Doe plurality opinion applied the following test, derived from Kring v. Missouri, 107 U.S. 221, 235, 2 S.Ct. 443, 27 L.Ed. 506 (1883), and Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 33-34, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981), and previously adopted by the Court of Appeals, in Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, 310 Md. 217, 224, 226-27, 528 A.2d 904 (1987): \u201c[T]wo critical elements must be present for a criminal or penal law to be ex post facto: it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.\u201d Doe, 430 Md. at 551, 556, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Under that test, it is clear that Grandison cannot demonstrate that Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s commutation of his death sentences to sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole resulted in an ex post facto violation, because he obviously did not suffer a disadvantage as a consequence of that commutation of sentence. See id. at 556, 62 A.3d 123; Woods v. State, 315 Md. 591, 606-07, 556 A.2d 236 (1989) (rejecting \u201cthe notion that a life sentence without the possibility of parole is, even relatively, the equivalent of death itself\u2019).</p> <p id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622(53) 623(99)\">The Doe dissent would have applied a different test, derived from Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 49-50, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990) (overruling Kring), and Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798): The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits \u201c[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u201d Doe, 430 Md. at 582, 62 A.3d 123 (Barbera, J., dissenting) (emphasis added) (quoting Calder, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) at 390).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under that alternative test, Grandison\u2019s claim would still fail, as it is clear that Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s commutation of his sentences obviously did not result in a \u201cgreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u201d See id. (emphasis added). Indeed, the result of Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s action was to reduce Grandison\u2019s sentences. See Woods, 315 Md. at 606-07, 556 A.2d 236.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b623-5\" pgmap=\"623\">2.</p> <p id=\"b623-6\" pgmap=\"623(16) 624(20)\"> Grandison also contends that the former Governor\u2019s commutation of his death sentences was an illegal retroactive application of a statute, CS \u00a7 7-601. That contention, like all of the others in these appeals, is without merit.</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\">Notwithstanding the independent constitutional basis for the gubernatorial pardon power, Md. Const., Art II, \u00a7 20, that power is also set forth in statutes. The pertinent statutes, for our purposes, are Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. VoL), Article 41, \u00a7\u00a7 118 and 119, and their modern-day counterparts, CS \u00a7\u00a7 7-601 and 7-602. Article 41, \u00a7 118, the statute in effect at the time Grandison committed the murders at issue, provided:</p> <blockquote id=\"Ay6\" pgmap=\"624\">The Governor upon giving the notice required by the Constitution may commute or change any sentence of death into penal confinement for such period as he shall think expedient. And, on giving such a notice, he may pardon any person, convicted of crime, on such conditions as he may prescribe, or he may upon like notice remit any part of the time for which any person may be sentenced to imprisonment on such like conditions without such remission operating as a full pardon to any such person.</blockquote> <p id=\"b624-6\" pgmap=\"624\">Article 41, \u00a7 119, also in effect at the time Grandison committed the murders at issue, further emphasized the plenary nature of the gubernatorial pardon power. It provided:</p> <blockquote id=\"A7m\" pgmap=\"624\">In any case in which the Governor may issue a conditional pardon to any person, the Governor, in the absence of any provision to the contrary expressed therein, shall be the sole judge of whether or not the conditions of said pardon have been breached, and the determination by the Governor, that the conditions of such pardon have been violated by the person receiving the same, shall be final and not subject to review by any court of this State.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote> <p id=\"b624-7\" pgmap=\"624(29) 625(103)\">Plainly, under Section 118, the Governor was authorized to \u201ccommute or change any sentence of death into penal confinement for such period as he shall think expedient.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such a period would obviously include life without the possibility of parole. That point is further confirmed by the provision that the Governor could \u201cremit any part of the time for which any person may be sentenced to imprisonment on such like conditions,\u201d that is, \u201csuch conditions as he may prescribe,\u201d \u201cwithout such remission operating as a full pardon to any such person.\u201d Art. 41, \u00a7 118 (emphasis added). Clearly, among \u201csuch conditions\u201d as the Governor \u201cmay prescribe\u201d would have included the condition that a prisoner, like Grandi-son, being granted commutation of his death sentences, would not be eligible for parole.</p> <p id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">Further underscoring the Governor\u2019s plenary authority to impose conditions on any pardon he may grant was Section 119. That section, consistent with the Governor\u2019s plenary pardon power under Article II, \u00a7 20, made clear that the Governor alone is the judge of whether a condition of a pardon has been breached and that such a determination, by the Governor, \u201cshall be final and not subject to review by any court of this State.\u201d Art. 41, \u00a7 119. In this respect, the instant case is indistinguishable from Schick, supra, which is highly persuasive authority in interpreting the scope of the Maryland counterpart to the federal constitutional provision interpreted in that case. The Schick Court observed that \u201cthe pardoning power was intended to include the power to commute sentences on conditions which do not in themselves offend the Constitution, but which are not specifically provided for by statute!!,]\u201d 419 U.S. at 264, 95 S.Ct. 879, and it held that the President was authorized to commute a death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment, on condition that the grantee not be eligible to seek parole, although, at the time that pardon was granted, no such condition was expressly authorized by law. Id. at 260, 267-68, 95 S.Ct. 379.</p> <p id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">The modern-day counterpart to Article 41, \u00a7 118, is CS \u00a7 7-601, which, effective October 1, 2013, provides in pertinent part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">(a) In general.\u2014On giving the notice required by the Maryland Constitution, the Governor may:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b626-4\" pgmap=\"626\">(1) change a sentence of death into a sentence of life without the possibility of parole;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">(2) pardon an individual convicted of a crime subject to any conditions the Governor requires; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">(3) remit any part of a sentence of imprisonment subject to any conditions the Governor requires, without the remission operating as a full pardon.</blockquote> <p id=\"b626-7\" pgmap=\"626\">The modern-day counterpart to Article 41, \u00a7 119, is CS \u00a7 7-602, which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b626-8\" pgmap=\"626\">(a) Governor as sole judge.\u2014Unless the order granting a pardon provides otherwise, the Governor is the sole judge of whether a condition of a conditional pardon has been violated.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b626-9\" pgmap=\"626\">(b) Determination not subject to judicial review.\u2014A determination by the Governor that a condition of a conditional pardon has been violated by the grantee is final and not subject to review by any court of the State.</blockquote> <p id=\"b626-10\" pgmap=\"626\">Plainly, it is substantially the same as its 1983 counterpart, Article 41, \u00a7 119.</p> <p id=\"b626-11\" pgmap=\"626\">Under the plain language of the statutes, the Governor, both under the current statutes and their 1983 versions, was authorized to commute a sentence of death to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, although the current versions state this proposition more plainly.

Vol., Supp. 1982), Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d) read as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b606-6\" pgmap=\"606\">(d) Any person who shall use a handgun in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article, shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall, in addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b606-7\" pgmap=\"606\">(1) For a first offense, be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than 5 nor more than 20 years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than the minimum sentence of 5 years.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b606-8\" pgmap=\"606\">(2) For a second or subsequent offense, be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for a term of not less than 5 nor more than 15 years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than a minimum consecutive sentence of 5 years which shall be served consecutively and not concurrently to any other sentence imposed by virtue of the commission of said felony or misdemeanor.</blockquote> <p id=\"b606-9\" pgmap=\"606\">The record does not indicate whether Grandison was charged and convicted under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d)(1) or (d)(2). Because the State conceded below that Grandison was subject to a maximum penalty of fifteen years, we need not resolve whether he was sentenced under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d)(1) or (d)(2). Instead, we accept the State\u2019s concession and proceed by resolving the ambiguity in favor of Grandison.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"7\"> <p id=\"b609-11\" pgmap=\"609\">. Blockburger v.
