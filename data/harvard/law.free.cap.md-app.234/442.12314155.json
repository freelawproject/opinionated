At trial, the parties stipulated that, due to Ivy Realty\u2019s negligence, Mr. Liles was exposed to deteriorating paint at the Property, and his exposure to lead paint substantially contributed to two documented elevated blood lead levels. The only remaining questions for the jury, therefore, were whether Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure caused injury, and if so, what, if any, damages were incurred.</p> <p id=\"b479-4\" pgmap=\"479\">Mr. Liles presented four expert witnesses at trial to testify to his alleged injury and damages. At the close of his case, and again at the close of all evidence, Ivy Realty moved for judgment, asserting that the expert testimony was speculative and lacked a factual basis to support the causation and damages opinions, and the evidence was insufficient to establish that Mr. Liles had suffered a legally compensable injury. The court denied the motions. The jury ruled in favor of Mr. Liles, and judgment was entered against Ivy Realty in the amount of $1,277,61o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b479-5\" pgmap=\"479\">On appeal, appellant presents three questions for this Court\u2019s review, which we have rephrased and consolidated, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b479-6\" pgmap=\"479\">1. Was there sufficient evidence for the trial court to submit the case to the jury on the issue whether Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure caused injury?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b479-7\" pgmap=\"479\">2. Was there sufficient evidence for the trial court to submit the case to the jury on the issue whether any injury caused by the lead exposure resulted in damages?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b479-8\" pgmap=\"479\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</blockquote> <p id=\"b479-9\" pgmap=\"479\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b479-10\" pgmap=\"479\">I.</p> <p id=\"b479-11\" pgmap=\"479\">Mr. Liles\u2019 Medical and Educational History</p> <p id=\"b479-12\" pgmap=\"479(25) 480(67)\">Mr. Liles was born on February 17, 1998. When Mr. Liles was two and one-half years old, he had a blood lead level of 11 mcg/dL, and at age three, it was 10 mcg/dL.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Liles\u2019 medical records indicate that, at two years old, he suffered a seizure due to appendicitis. He had an emergency appendectomy and was hospitalized for two weeks, but he made a full recovery. In high school, Mr. Liles suffered a broken thumb. The thumb healed completely, and he suffered no long term effects from that injury.</p> <p id=\"b480-4\" pgmap=\"480\">When Mr. Liles was nine years old, several close family members died within a one-year time period. Mr. Liles experienced grief and anxiety, for which he received counseling. No developmental concerns were documented within his medical records. The records indicated that Mr. Liles was \u201cbright, cooperative and ... functioning at the appropriate grade level (3rd).\u201d His level of academic performance was assessed at \u201cabove average.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b480-5\" pgmap=\"480\">In elementary school, Mr. Liles performed consistently at or above grade level until his 4th and 5th grade school years, when he had increased absences following the death of his family members and his treatment for anxiety. As a result of his performance, Mr. Liles attended summer school, and he received academic support, including \u201cone on one support,\u201d \u201csmall grouping,\u201d \u201cindividualized help on his math skills and test taking practice,\u201d \u201cextra response time,\u201d \u201cextended time to complete assignments,\u201d and \u201crepetition of directions.\u201d In middle school, Mr. Liles raised his grades into the \u201c70s, 80s, and 90s.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b480-6\" pgmap=\"480\">In May 2016, Mr. Liles graduated from Baltimore City College High School (\u201cCity College\u201d), a prestigious college preparatory school that requires admittees to pass an entrance examination. Mr. Liles described his grades at City College as terrible, stating that he had \u201ca mid-C average,\u201d and the \u201conly A\u2019s\u201d he received were in foreign language, \u201cweight training, gym class, anything physical.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b481-4\" pgmap=\"481\">Mr. Liles blamed his poor grades in high school on his inability to focus, stating that he gets distracted a lot, does not like sitting still, and \u201cjust can\u2019t grasp things as fast as other people do.\u201d These issues started when he was young, but \u201cas the work got harder, [he] couldn\u2019t get it.\u201d He stated that his parents had both done well in school, and they encouraged him to do well, which was his goal, but he \u201ccouldn\u2019t.\u201d His weighted Grade Point Average (\u201cGPA\u201d) upon graduation from City College was 3.3, although his unweighted GPA was 2.1, He was ranked 194 out of 301 students.</p> <p id=\"b481-5\" pgmap=\"481\">Mr. Liles tested at or above grade level on all Maryland School Assessment testing and passed his High School Assessment tests. His scores on the PSAT were in the 20th, 24th, and 54th percentiles during his 9th, 10th, and 11th grade years, respectively.</p> <p id=\"b481-6\" pgmap=\"481\">Following high school, Mr. Liles was accepted to West Virginia University (\u201cWVU\u201d) and Bowie State University (\u201cBSU\u201d). He decided to attend BSU because it was less expensive and closer to home. Mr. Liles stated that he would \u201cnot be able to focus\u201d at WVU and would be easily distracted away from his family, without supervision.</p> <p id=\"b481-7\" pgmap=\"481(48) 482(21)\">With respect to Mr. Liles\u2019 family members, his mother, Daronda Liles, is a high school graduate, with some college experience. His father, Chauncey Liles, Sr., is a high school graduate employed as a truck driver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Liles has four siblings. The oldest three siblings all completed high school, and one is enrolled at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore studying pre-med. His youngest sibling is still in grade school.</p> <p id=\"b482-4\" pgmap=\"482\">II.</p> <p id=\"ATr\" pgmap=\"482\">Mr. Liles\u2019 Expert Witnesses</p> <p id=\"AtN\" pgmap=\"482\">A.</p> <p id=\"b482-5\" pgmap=\"482\">Robert Kraft, Ph.D.</p> <p id=\"b482-6\" pgmap=\"482\">Dr. Robert Kraft, a licensed psychologist, testified as an expert in neuropsychology, the \u201crelationship between behavior and the central nervous system functioning.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A clinical neu-ropsychology assessment is performed on an individual to \u201cdetermine an individual\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in their brain functioning ... to determine if they have any sort of neurodevelopmental disorder or brain-related impairments that may impact them, and to identify what those are.\u201d Brain-related impairments are not physically visible through neu-roimaging, and it requires \u201cspecialized assessments in order to identify them.\u201d The assessment involves observing the individual, taking a history, and giving a \u201cbattery of tests that are designed to be presented under specific conditions and that an individual is expected to display specific behavior in response to these tests.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b482-7\" pgmap=\"482(94) 483(137)\">Dr. Kraft\u2019s neuropsychological examination of Mr. Liles consisted of an interview, as well as a number of neuropsycho-logical tests that Dr. Kraft administered to assess intelligence, memory, learning, academic achievement, executive functioning, attention, language, visual-spatial and perceptual motor functioning, and effort. Mr. Liles has a \u201cfull scale IQ of 94,\u201d which \u201cfalls into an average range,\u201d and his \u201cperformance on math was in the solid average range of the 61st percentile.\u201d Dr. Kraft stated, however, that having an average range IQ score does not mean that there is no evidence of brain impairment, and that Mr. Liles\u2019 \u201ctwo index scores that are most sensitive to attention and concentration\u201d were \u201csignificantly lower than his performance in perceptual reasoning,\u201d which indicated the presence of \u201cmild impairment.\u201d Specifically, Dr. Kraft stated that Mr. Liles had mild deficits \u201cwith respect to auditory encoding of information in the working memory, and information processing speed,\u201d both of which \u201care factors of attention.\u201d In regard to both of these factors, Mr. Liles scored 86, which is statistically in the 18th percentile, and was \u201csignificantly lower than his performance in perceptual reasoning,\u201d which was 104.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The discrepancy between the index scores and the IQ test was wide enough that it \u201cis not considered to happen by chance alone,\u201d but rather, it suggests \u201cthat there is some process that is responsible for the discrepancy.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b483-5\" pgmap=\"483\">Dr. Kraft explained that auditory encoding is a person\u2019s \u201cability to hold information in mind for immediate manipulation and to make some sort of output with that information that you\u2019re holding in memory.\u201d For example, a waiter or waitress who takes orders without writing the orders down is using auditory encoding. Individuals \u201cuse auditory encoding in every aspect of life,\u201d and that information is stored until the individual has completed the task, and then the information can be forgotten.</p> <p id=\"b483-6\" pgmap=\"483\">Processing speed is an individual\u2019s \u201cability to independently focus and complete a task in a self-directed manner.\u201d For example, a student who sits down to study, or an adult who sits down to read a book or complete a writing task, requires information processing speed. Mr. Liles\u2019 ability \u201cto do that independently ... is lower than it should be based on his intellectual functioning and suggests a mild impairment in that area.\u201d Dr. Kraft suggested that Mr. Liles\u2019 mild deficit could be accommodated, stating that, although Mr. Liles \u201cmay take a little longer than the average peer,\u201d he typically completes tasks \u201cwith accuracy and not a lot of compulsive errors.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b484-4\" pgmap=\"484\">Dr. Kraft agreed that Mr. Liles did not suffer from any deficits in IQ, executive function, the visual-spatial realm, speech and language, or fine and gross motor skills. Mr. Liles scored high average to average on another test for auditory attention, scoring higher than 75% of the general population on one subtest and in the 50th percentile on another. Dr. Kraft described the tests on which Mr. Liles scored the highest as \u201clogical memory tasks and visual reproduction tasks,\u201d both of which \u201cinvolve[ ] learning the information and storing it.\u201d Dr. Kraft further described Mr. Liles\u2019 \u201clanguage skills [as] average or better,\u201d and his \u201ccomprehension of instructions, which is a receptive language kind of task,\u201d as \u201cin the average range.\u201d Mr. Liles\u2019 \u201c[v]erbal fluency was high average.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b484-5\" pgmap=\"484\">As part of his evaluation, Dr. Kraft reviewed Mr. Liles\u2019 school records. Mr. Liles began to show some mild educational problems in fourth grade, and he was provided with math tutoring. In fifth grade, Mr. Liles \u201cperformed more poorly,\u201d and the teacher\u2019s notes indicated that Mr. Liles was provided with accommodations, including \u201cone-on-one teacher supports,\u201d \u201cextra response time,\u201d and \u201cextended time to complete assignments,\u201d which Dr. Kraft thought was significant \u201cbecause those are the exact accommodations that would be afforded to an individual who\u2019s having attention problems, particularly involving their ability to process information in a timely manner,\u201d which was \u201cconsistent with\u201d Dr. Kraft\u2019s findings during the evaluation. Dr. Kraft was aware that Mr. Liles had suffered deaths in his family during the fourth and fifth grades, and had been receiving counseling, but he opined that Mr. Liles would have needed accommodations regardless of this family circumstance.</p> <p id=\"b484-6\" pgmap=\"484(84) 485(14)\">Dr. Kraft noted that Mr. Liles could have obtained B\u2019s in school because the \u201cdeficits are mild, and they may not always show up in every school year.\u201d In that regard, he stated that Mr. Liles may have had \u201ccourses that are easier than others, teachers that he click[ed] with better than others, and not necessarily need[ed] accommodations or [had] to struggle to adapt to the deficits.\u201d In other words, Mr. Liles\u2019 \u201cdeficits aren\u2019t always apparent in terms of how he would function at school .... if he\u2019s able to adapt and accommodate in some way for them.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b485-4\" pgmap=\"485\">B.</p> <p id=\"b485-5\" pgmap=\"485\">Jacalyn Blackwell-White, MD</p> <p id=\"b485-6\" pgmap=\"485\">Dr. Blackwell-White, who was admitted as an expert in pediatrics and childhood lead poisoning, had seen hundreds of children in her practice that had elevated blood lead levels.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She explained that lead is a ne\u00fcrotoxin, \u201ca substance which causes damage to the central nervous system,\u201d i.e., the \u201cbrain and the way the brain functions.\u201d Children are more susceptible to brain injuries from neurotoxins because their brain is rapidly developing, and lead exposure interferes with the neurotransmitter which transmits messages from \u201cone neuron to another\u201d through the myelin sheath. The \u201clearning pathways\u201d are disrupted, which \u201cin real-speak [means] that \u201cattention is going to be affected. You\u2019re not going to have a nice message go from one neuron to another.\u201d The damage that happens to a child\u2019s brain from lead poisoning is permanent.</p> <p id=\"b485-7\" pgmap=\"485\">Dr. Blackwell-White stated that the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d), which \u201cissue[s] standards and protocols for diagnosis and treatment of children who have elevated blood lead levels,\u201d has set the current reference level at five micrograms per deciliter of blood-lead, i.e., 5 mcg/dL. Previously, in the \u201cearly 80s,\u201d the reference level was 25 mcg/dL. It was lowered to 15 mcg/dL, then to 10 mcg/dL, and most recently, in 2012, it was lowered to 5 mcg/dL. The reference level was lowered based on medical literature and many studies indicating that blood lead levels under 10 mcg/dL were damaging to children.</p> <p id=\"b485-8\" pgmap=\"485\">Dr. Blackwell-White reviewed Mr. Liles\u2019 medical records, which indicated that his blood lead levels around the year 2000 were 10 mcg/dL and 11 mcg/dL. The reference level for the CDC at that time was less than 10 mcg/dL.</p> <p id=\"b486-4\" pgmap=\"486\">Dr. Blackwell-White also discussed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) Integrated Science Assessment (\u201cEPA-ISA\u201d) on lead.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The EPA is a regulatory agency that surveys the impact of health concerns to the population, and it reviewed years of literature regarding \u201cthe impact of lead on the environment and on the population.\u201d Dr. Blackwell-White testified that the EPA-ISA found that there is a causal relationship between childhood lead exposure and certain cognitive problems, including \u201cattentional problems in children\u2014 impulse control .... and hyperactivity.\u201d She explained that these problems were found in children with lead levels between 7 mcg/dL and 14 mcg/dL, and \u201ccognitive IQ point loss was caused by early lead exposure.\u201d Mr. Liles\u2019 blood lead levels were 10 and 11, \u201cwithin the range.\u201d Dr. Blackwell-White testified that \u201cmany studies\u201d link lead exposure in childhood to loss of IQ points, citing two leading studies that \u201clooked at the impact of IQ loss in children for lead levels under 10.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b486-5\" pgmap=\"486\">In reaching her opinion in this case, Dr. Blackwell-White relied, in part, on the EPA-ISA\u2019s determination of a causal relationship between lead exposure and cognitive defects. After reviewing Mr. Liles\u2019 medical records, Dr. Blackwell-White opined that Mr. Liles suffered lead poisoning as a child. The basis for that opinion was Mr. Liles\u2019 two elevated lead levels at ages two and one-half and three.</p> <p id=\"b486-6\" pgmap=\"486(16) 487(57)\">Dr. Blackwell-White also reviewed Dr. Kraft\u2019s neuropsycho-logical evaluation reports, on which she relied heavily. Dr. Kraft\u2019s report indicated that Mr. Liles had cognitive impairments in processing speed and auditory encoding, measures of attention. Dr. Blackwell-White testified that, in her opinion, Mr. Liles \u201csuffered brain damage as a result of his early lead exposure,\u201d and the cognitive deficits identified by Dr. Kraft were permanent and caused by Mr. Liles\u2019 exposure to lead.</p> <p id=\"b487-5\" pgmap=\"487\">Dr. Blackwell-White noted that one of the other leading studies, \u201cthe International Pooled Analysis by Dr. Bruce Lanphear\u201d (the \u201cLanphear Study\u201d), concluded that lead, independently of \u201cother things going on in these children\u2019s lives,\u201d was responsible for IQ loss. Based on the Lanphear Study, Dr. Blackwell-White opined that Mr. Liles had lost four IQ points as a result of his elevated blood lead levels.</p> <p id=\"b487-6\" pgmap=\"487\">On cross-examination, Dr. Blackwell-White agreed that a history of emotional distress potentially could put a child at risk for cognitive difficulties. She further testified that the EPA-ISA is not typically relied upon by pediatricians in their clinical practice, and she \u201ccame across it through her work as an expert in litigation.\u201d She acknowledged that the CDC had also reviewed the epidemiological literature that was available in 2012, but it did not make any statements of causality. Indeed, the CDC stated in 1991 \u201cthat adverse effects of blood levels of 10 to 14 are subtle and are not likely to be recognized or measurable in the individual child.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b487-7\" pgmap=\"487\">When asked whether the causal connection found by EPA-ISA between lead and attention included the specific attention deficits found by Dr. Kraft, i.e., \u201cauditory encoding and processing speed,\u201d Dr. Blackwell-White stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b487-8\" pgmap=\"487\">Not only the EPA, but a good much of the lead literature involving children speaks to attention. They don\u2019t parse it out as to what kind of attention. They are using the umbrella term \u201cattention\u201d. And so it is in my opinion that the deficits that Dr. Kraft found are part of that umbrella term \u201cattention\u201d.</blockquote> <p id=\"b487-9\" pgmap=\"487(29) 488(22)\">Dr. Blackwell-White opined that every child exposed to lead loses IQ points. This opinion was based completely on the epidemiological literature, which is \u201call we have.\u201d She cited the Lanphear Study, concluding that exposure to up to 10 mcg/dL could result in a loss of IQ of two to five points.</p> <p id=\"b488-5\" pgmap=\"488\">Dr. Blackwell-White agreed that a significant amount of cognitive ability is inherited. In response to the question whether she agreed that not every child exposed to 10 meg/dL would lose four IQ points, Dr. Blackwell-White stated that they would lose IQ points, but she conceded that she could not \u201ccalculate exactly the number.\u201d She also agreed with a study stating that the impact of lead is difficult to isolate from socio-environmental variables.</p> <p id=\"b488-6\" pgmap=\"488\">C.</p> <p id=\"b488-7\" pgmap=\"488\">Mark Lieberman</p> <p id=\"b488-8\" pgmap=\"488\">Mark Lieberman, Mr. Liles\u2019 expert in vocational rehabilitation, testified that a vocational rehabilitation expert assesses</p> <blockquote id=\"A9A\" pgmap=\"488\">how the person is now, what they\u2019re likely to be able to do in terms of learning new skills, what types of jobs they\u2019re going to be likely able to get, how much income can they earn, as compared to what they would have been capable of achieving had they not had the issues that they experience[d].</blockquote> <p id=\"b488-9\" pgmap=\"488\">In conducting vocational rehabilitation assessments, Mr. Lieberman used a standard methodology called the \u201cRAPEL\u201d method, which assesses a person\u2019s vocational prospects based on an evaluation of: \u201cRehabilitation\u201d recommendations; \u201cAccess\u201d to the labor market; \u201cPlaceability\u201d of an individual in the labor market; \u201cEarning capacity\u201d; and any Labor force participation.</p> <p id=\"b488-10\" pgmap=\"488\">As part of the assessment, Mr. Lieberman conducted an interview of Mr. Liles and his mother, and he reviewed documents, including school records and Dr. Kraft\u2019s neuropsy-chological evaluation. For purposes of his assessment, however, he did not put \u201ca whole lot of stock on how\u201d Mr. Liles performed in his early years of school, because \u201c[tjhat\u2019s not really a vocational issue.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b488-11\" pgmap=\"488(29) 489(78)\">With respect to Dr. Kraft\u2019s evaluation, Mr. Lieberman stated that there were \u201cthree main things [he was] looking for: IQ, academic functioning, and any issues that might affect the person\u2019s maximum ability to use their intelligence.\u201d In terms of IQ, Mr. Liles was \u201cright around a 94. 100 is dead-set average. So right in the range we typically expect the person to be able to graduate high school.\u201d Mr. Lieberman opined that, based on that number alone, Mr. Liles could probably get an Associate degree, noting that \u201cabout 100 is what we expect for an Associate.\u201d Mr. Lieberman\u2019s assessment of Mr. Liles\u2019 testing results was as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b489-5\" pgmap=\"489\">Spelling was great. Spelling was 108. So reading\u2014spelling a little bit better than average. And math was dead-set average. Those were pretty good. But what I saw was, although we had average IQ and a little bit lower academics, but pretty close, there were major cognitive issues that affects his ability [t]o learn.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-6\" pgmap=\"489\">And that comes down to problems with attention\u2014and I\u2019m reading right off my notes\u2014auditory encoding, and information processing speed.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-7\" pgmap=\"489\">***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-8\" pgmap=\"489\">When you have these types of issues, it affects your ability to learn when you\u2019re sitting, listening to a lecture.

I think his reading\u2019s okay.\u201d Mr. Lieberman testified that, overall, Mr. Liles \u201chad the academic skills of a high school graduate,\u201d and he expected that, after high school graduation, Mr. Liles would go to college, but problems would occur then because \u201c[c]ollege relies on your ability to listen to a lecture, understand what you read in the textbooks, put them together to understand the concept.\u201d It requires \u201cmore in-depth ability to understand what you\u2019re hearing, to go to a lecture hall -with 50 to a couple 100 people, and being able to quickly process information that you hear.\u201d He saw Mr. Liles \u201cbeing able to pass some classes, but eventually hitting that brick wall\u2014the point where he\u2019s not going to be able to get the Associate degree.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">Mr. Lieberman opined that, given his deficits, Mr. Liles would have the earnings potential of an individual with a high school diploma and \u201csome college,\u201d and without his deficits, he would have the earnings of an individual with an Associate\u2019s degree. He further opined that Mr. Liles fits the definition of a cognitively disabled person, and as a result, he will have a \u201cmuch harder time\u201d attaining arid maintaining work, and he will earn less than an individual that does not have these issues.</p> <p id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">D.</p> <p id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490\">Michael Conte, Ph.D.</p> <p id=\"b490-8\" pgmap=\"490\">Michael Conte, Ph.D., Mr. Liles\u2019 expert in economics, explained that, to understand the likelihood of an individual he is evaluating competing in the labor market, he must rely on the opinions \u201coffered by someone qualified in the area of vocational rehabilitation,\u201d such as Mr. Lieberman. If a vocational expert identifies a cognitive disability, he will \u201ctake that into consideration in terms of evaluating how long that person is likely to actually work over the balance of their lifetime,\u201d as \u201ccognitive ability has a demonstrable impact on what\u2019s called work-life expectancy.\u201d To formulate his opinions, Dr. Conte factors in certain assumptions, including sex, educational attainment, i.e., \u201cthe highest level of education that you\u2019ve been certified to achieve,\u201d and work-life expectancy. In Mr. Liles\u2019 case, Dr. Conte\u2019s assumptions, based on Mr. Lieberman\u2019s report and opinions, were as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b491-9\" pgmap=\"491\">Mr. Liles suffers from a cognitive disability, and ... on the basis of Mr. Lieberman\u2019s opinions, that he would most likely have been able to compete in the labor market as an Associate\u2019s degree holder, absent the severity of his current deficits.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-10\" pgmap=\"491\">That at this point in time, however, he manages to proceed in the course of obtaining additional educational credits, that when he decides to enter the competitive labor market, he will most likely be able to compete at the level of a high school graduate with some college.</blockquote> <p id=\"b491-11\" pgmap=\"491\">Dr. Conte testified that Mr. Liles\u2019 loss of earnings was the difference between the average wages for individuals with the educational attainment of an Associate\u2019s degree (earning potential absent injury), i.e., $3,456,127, and the average wages of individuals with the educational attainment of high school plus some college (earning potential assuming four-point IQ loss and cognitive deficits), i.e., $1,757,320. He opined that Mr. Liles sustained a loss of earnings due to his injuries in the amount of $1,698,808.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Conte subsequently testified that educational attainment was not important to his analysis, stating that the part of Mr. Lieberman\u2019s opinions on which he relied was that, \u201cirrespective of his actual educational attainment, [Mr. Liles] will most likely be able to command a wage commensurate with that of an individual with high school plus some college.</p> <p id=\"b491-4\" pgmap=\"491\">III.</p> <p id=\"Ank\" pgmap=\"491\">Ivy Realty\u2019s Expert Witnesses</p> <p id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">A.</p> <p id=\"b491-6\" pgmap=\"491\">David Nelson, MD</p> <p id=\"b491-7\" pgmap=\"491(16) 492(109)\">Dr. David Nelson, an expert in pediatrics, epidemiology, and childhood lead exposure, testified that epidemiological studies are \u201cdesigned to determine ... risk factors for various conditions.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For example, an epidemiologic study on smoking showed that there is a strong association between smoking and lung cancer. Epidemiologic studies, however, do not show that a person who is at risk for an injury has suffered that injury. Rather, the studies \u201ctalk about risk ... for the population\u201d as a whole. Thus, because epidemiologic studies show that there is a very high risk of lung cancer if a person smokes, a clinician with a patient who smokes \u201ccan make certain assumptions about whether the smoking is actually [a] contributing ... cause to the lung cancer.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b492-4\" pgmap=\"492\">Epidemiological literature does not determine relative risk between lead exposure and certain outcomes. To \u201cdetermine relative risk, you have to have a ... before and after,\u201d i.e., \u201c[a] person\u2019s healthy, is exposed to something, and then develops into disease.\u201d None of the lead studies, however, measured a child before and after exposure to lead and saw a drop in IQ.</p> <p id=\"AXa\" pgmap=\"492\">With respect to causation, Dr. Nelson explained that:</p> <blockquote id=\"b492-5\" pgmap=\"492\">The epidemiologic studies do not determine causation per se. They determine our associations. They are determinations made by the individual, groups of individuals, regulatory by whomever to determine whether the weight of the evidence in the literature is sufficient to say it\u2019s not just an association, but actually is causation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b492-6\" pgmap=\"492\">And there\u2019s no definition of what determines absolute causation. And, it\u2019s to some degree, it can even be the eye of the beholder. One group can look at something and say well I think there\u2019s enough evidence to say that those associations reached the level of causation, and another group may not because there\u2019s nothing definitive that you ... can rely [on] and say this is absolutely the case.</blockquote> <p id=\"b492-7\" pgmap=\"492\">Aside from the EPA, Dr. Nelson was aware of no other group that had determined a causative association between lead exposure and IQ loss.</p> <p id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\">Dr. Nelson explained that, with low blood lead levels, it is \u201cvery difficult ... to apply\u201d causation to an individual. Although, on a population basis, \u201cyou can make a statement [that] .... cognitive function is affected by lead at lower levels,\u201d it is difficult to apply that to an individual \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if that individual really had an effect or not.\u201d When the EPA, or anyone else, makes a conclusion that epidemiological evidence establishes a causative relationship, they mean it is a risk factor. In other words, \u201ccausative associations in epidemiological studies mean that an exposure can cause an outcome, rather than that an exposure causes the outcome.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b493-5\" pgmap=\"493\">With respect to blood lead levels, Dr. Nelson opined that, based on the epidemiological literature, as the blood lead levels get significantly higher, \u201cyou get more comfortable with your judgment that the risk factor may actually be causing the problem in the individual.\u201d At low levels, however, \u201cbecause it contributes so little and has such little effect, if it has any,\u201d it is difficult to make a determination of cause for the individual. Dr. Nelson stated that a blood lead level of 10 mcg/dL would not be significant in making a determination of causation, but a blood lead level of 20 mcg/dL or higher would be \u201cmore likely to cause a problem than is lead at lower levels.\u201d Maryland 2016 guidelines, in fact, do not make any recommendations for clinical intervention for children with blood lead levels under 20 mcg/dL that are different from those for any well child, nor did the CDC\u2019s 2012 statement.</p> <p id=\"b493-6\" pgmap=\"493\">Dr. Nelson did not evaluate Mr. Liles because \u201cit would be unlikely that [he] would find anything from an actual discussion with him and a physical exam that would really enlighten [his] opinion, change anything.\u201d Instead, he reviewed Mr. Liles\u2019 medical and school records, including the evaluations and conclusions of Dr. Kraft and Dr. Blackwell-White.</p> <p id=\"b493-7\" pgmap=\"493(35) 494(78)\">Dr. Nelson pointed out that Mr. Liles\u2019 pediatrician had performed developmental screenings throughout his childhood, and had not identified any developmental problems or detected any health effect caused by exposure to lead, including any attention, learning, or behavior problems. There was no evidence in Mr. Liles\u2019 school record of academic difficulties due to cognitive impairment, and the only two occasions where Mr. Liles had academic difficulties were in fifth grade, when he was suffering from anxiety issues and absenteeism, and in high school, when he fractured his thumb on his dominant hand. Dr. Nelson noted that Mr. Liles performed well in school, i.e., at or above grade level, until fifth grade.</p> <p id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494\">Dr. Nelson also reviewed Mr. Liles\u2019 standardized tests, including the PSATs, stating that \u201che did generally quite well and he did particularly well on his PSAT test.\u201d Mr. Liles\u2019 PSAT scores were impressive because Mr. Liles scored on or above the 50th percentile relative to other college bound students, and there was no indication that Mr. Liles had any accommodations or extra time to take the test.</p> <p id=\"b494-6\" pgmap=\"494\">In sum, Dr. Nelson concluded that Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure did not cause him \u201cany issues at all,\u201d and he did not suffer from \u201cany cognitive damage from any cause.\u201d He opined that, if Mr. Liles had never been exposed to lead, he would not have been \u201cany different whatsoever.\u201d Mr. Liles\u2019 academic performance did not reflect any difficulties due to his cognitive abilities, because poor performance due to cognitive deficits is consistent, not transient. In that regard, he stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b494-7\" pgmap=\"494\">[I]f it\u2019s due to cognitive usually that\u2019s consistent. He\u2019s got ups and downs. And when I see a child ... who is performing well now that didn\u2019t perform well before, now does better again, something\u2019s going on and it\u2019s probably not cognitive. Something is going on with him personally ... emotionally. So I see this all the time. It\u2019s not an infrequent thing, but I see this kind of variability in students and they can do the work, but the question is why aren\u2019t they doing the work?\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">B.</p> <p id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">Scott Beveridge, Ph.D.</p> <p id=\"b494-10\" pgmap=\"494(19) 495(201)\">Scott Beveridge, Ph.D., is a vocational rehabilitation counselor who helps people with disabilities go back to work. Dr. Beveridge did a vocational evaluation on Mr. Liles \u201cto determine if there was any impact on his ability to work and maintain competitive employment.\u201d Although the RAPEL methodology is the most peer reviewed methodology to determine vocational abilities, Dr. Beveridge used another methodology, PEEDS-RAPEL, which is appropriate to use on younger individuals. Dr. Beveridge determined Mr. Liles\u2019 likely pre-lead exposure capacity based on his parental and other family members\u2019 educational attainment and work history. After asking Mr. Liles which family members were important in his life, including role models and mentors, Dr. Beveridge evaluated each family member\u2019s education and vocational experience. He then applied the Specific Vocational Preparation (\u201cSVP\u201d) rating scale to determine the training level required for each family member\u2019s employment. The scale ranks the training requirements for each job, i.e., an SVP of \u201c3\u201d means the job requires 1-3 months of training, an SVP of \u201c4\u201d requires 3-6 months of training, and the highest, an SVP of \u201c8,\u201d requires 4-10 years of training. Most of Mr. Liles\u2019 family members had an SVP of 3-4, with the exception of his brother, who was enrolled in a pre-med program, whieh is an SVP of 7-8.</p> <p id=\"b495-4\" pgmap=\"495\">After doing this evaluation, Dr. Beveridge determined that Mr. Liles, who expressed a career interest in medicine and nursing, has the capacity to obtain his Associate\u2019s Degree, but not likely a medical degree. He explained that Mr. Liles is \u201cessentially an average person,\u201d when \u201clooking at the testing.\u201d Most physicians have an above-average IQ.</p> <p id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495(96) 496(52)\">To determine Mr. Liles\u2019 vocational capacity, Dr. Beveridge also reviewed the neuropsychological evaluations, and he performed his own IQ and Wide-Range Academic Achievement Tests, along with a Self-Directed Search, a test to determine the best major or job fit for high school and college students. The results of the testing were consistent with those obtained by Dr. Kraft; they showed average IQ and Academic Achievement Scores. The Self-Directed Search identified a personality fit with Mr. Liles\u2019 expressed field of interest, nursing. Dr. Beveridge also relied on the \u201ctwo best predictors of if someone\u2019s going to do well in college,\u201d GPA and SAT (or, here, PSAT) scores. He opined that Mr. Liles can complete his Associate\u2019s degree and work as a nurse throughout his normal life, and Mr. Liles\u2019 likely educational and vocational capacity was the same as it was prior to his lead exposure.</p> <p id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496\">!&gt; &gt;\u2014I</p> <p id=\"b496-1\" pgmap=\"496\">Motions for Judgment</p> <p id=\"b496-2\" pgmap=\"496\">At the conclusion of Mr. Liles\u2019 case, Ivy Realty made a motion for judgment, arguing that the evidence presented by Mr. Liles fell \u201cshort of speculation,\u201d with regard to damages and causation of injury. With respect to causation of injury, counsel argued that Dr. Blackwell-White was the sole causation expert, and her testimony was based solely on epidemiological literature without any \u201cidentification of measurement for the individual to support her opinions that there has been cognitive loss caused by lead exposure.\u201d Counsel stated that Dr. Blackwell-White had no basis to say that Mr. Liles suffered a four-point IQ loss, noting that she conceded that this number was extrapolated from epidemiological literature, but not every child exposed to lead up to 10 mcg/dL loses four IQ points. Counsel argued that the evidence was insufficient to support a compensable injury, i.e., \u201can injury that was a measurable injury caused by the lead exposure that has caused damages.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b496-3\" pgmap=\"496\">Counsel for Mr. Liles responded that Dr. Kraft \u201cclearly stated what the cognitive deficits and injuries are to Mr. Liles,\u201d i.e., he has deficits in auditory encoding, working memory, processing speed, and has an IQ in the range of 94 full-scale IQ.\u201d Dr. Blackwell-White \u201cdescribed what lead poisoning does and how it impedes a child\u2019s brain development,\u201d and Mr. Liles testified about \u201chis problems with attention and focus and concentration through school.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b496-4\" pgmap=\"496\">In denying the motion, which the court characterized as arguing that Dr. Blackwell-White could not quantify the injury, the court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b497-4\" pgmap=\"497\">The testimony of the expert in giving her opinion is that there was injury, immeasurable based on those in terms of the studies that she studied and reviewed and that which is relied upon, and that review by her, as well as that which was relied upon by her of the other experts in the case itself.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b497-5\" pgmap=\"497\">That, under the circumstances, the cognitive deficits are measurable and [ ] based on the information received that was reviewed by the witness as well as the studies as to the impact of lead and the correlation going back to the lead injury itself.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b497-6\" pgmap=\"497\">Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances, that direct evidence and circumstantial evidence is to be taken into consideration by the jury, the motion is denied.</blockquote> <p id=\"AKK\" pgmap=\"497(238) 498(29)\">At the close of all evidence, Ivy Realty made another motion for judgment, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove both injury and damages. With respect to damages, counsel argued that neither Dr. Conte nor Mr. Lieberman offered an opinion of loss due to lead exposure, but rather, they offered opinions as to loss \u201cdue to everything in this young man\u2019s life that may have formulated his cognitive development.\u201d Counsel continued that the medical experts \u201cnever tied the bow,\u201d as they never offered any actual opinion that any deficits were evidence of brain injury. Furthermore, Dr. Blackwell-White did not testify or offer an opinion that Mr. Liles was injured because of lead, as there is nothing to support a conclusion that every child who is exposed to lead has a measurable injury. Indeed, Dr. Nelson testified that a conclusion cannot be drawn from epidemiological studies, which were relied on exclusively by Dr. Blackwell-White, that an individual was injured due to lead exposure. Counsel argued that other testimony, including that of Dr, Beveridge, indicated that \u201ca proper way to measure whether or not there\u2019s been injury would be to evaluate the family,\u201d and if there is a \u201csignificant difference between the functioning of the child and the functioning of the family, you can more reliably say that there\u2019s been injury due to the lead exposure to the child.\u201d In this case, counsel argued, there is no factual basis to support that Mr. Liles would be functioning any differently than he would have had he not been exposed to lead, which relates to both causation and damages.</p> <p id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">Counsel for Mr. Liles argued that Dr. Kraft\u2019s testimony that Mr. Liles had cognitive deficits, which were not due to chance, coupled with Dr. Blaekwell-White\u2019s testimony that those deficits were caused by lead, proved causation. With respect to damages, counsel argued that Mr. Lieberman\u2019s testimony regarding the difference between Mr. Liles\u2019 vocational marketability, both \u201cas-is and ... absent deficits,\u201d coupled with Dr. Conte\u2019s monetary value on the difference between the two\u2014$1,698,808\u2014was evidence of damages.</p> <p id=\"b498-6\" pgmap=\"498\">The court denied the motion. It stated that the issues presented, whether exposure to lead paint and elevated blood lead levels caused injury to Mr. Liles, and if so, what amount of damages should be awarded, were factual disputes.</p> <p id=\"b498-7\" pgmap=\"498\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p> <p id=\"b498-8\" pgmap=\"498\"> Maryland Rule 2-519 provides that \u201c[a] party may move for judgment on any or all of the issues in any action at the close of the evidence offered by an opposing party, and in a jury trial at the close of all the evidence.\u201d The standard for reviewing a circuit court\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment is well settled:</p> <blockquote id=\"b498-9\" pgmap=\"498\">[W]e ask whether on the evidence adduced, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, any reasonable trier of fact could find the elements of the tort by a preponderance of the evidence....

In Booker, this Court held that, where proof of causation relied on expert testimony, and that expert testimony lacked a sufficient factual basis to support the expert\u2019s conclusions, the circuit court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Id. at 189-90, 831 A.2d 481. The issue before us, therefore, is whether Dr. Blackwell-White had a sufficient factual basis to support her conclusions. If so, then the circuit court properly submitted the issue of causation to the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b500-5\" pgmap=\"500\">Here, Dr. Blackwell-White testified that the EPA-ISA and other studies showed that there is a causal relationship between childhood lead exposure and cognitive IQ loss and problems of attention.

Clearly, general attention deficits and ADHD are not one and the same.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b501-7\" pgmap=\"501\">**#</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-4\" pgmap=\"502\">In equating attention deficits and hyperactivity with a clinical ADHD diagnosis, Dr. Hall-Carrington painted an inaccurate picture of the scientific research regarding lead poisoning\u2014she overstated the known effects of lead exposure. Her testimony suffers from the same \u201canalytical gap\u201d described in Joiner.</blockquote> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">Id. at 290-91, 164 A.3d 254 (citations omitted).</p> <p id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502\">Ivy Realty argues that there is a similar \u201canalytical gap\u201d here because, although the EPA-ISA describes a causal relationship between lead exposure and \u201cattention decrements,\u201d it does not show that lead causes the cognitive deficits identified by Dr. Kraft, impairments in processing speed and auditory encoding. Dr. Kraft, however, testified that both auditory encoding of information in the working memory and informational processing speed are \u201cfactors of attention.\u201d Dr. Blackwell-White similarly testified that these deficits were \u201cmeasures of attention\u201d and were part of the \u201cumbrella term \u2018attention\u2019 \u201d used in the EPA-ISA. Thus, unlike in Stevenson, where the studies did not support a causal relationship between lead and the specific diagnosis of ADHD, the studies here did show a causal link between Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure and his attention deficits. Accordingly, there was not an \u201canalytical gap\u201d between the data and Dr. Blackwell-White\u2019s ultimate opinion that lead exposure caused Mr. Liles\u2019 attention deficits.</p> <p id=\"b502-7\" pgmap=\"502\">Other courts have recognized that epidemiological studies are an accepted source to demonstrate a causal relation between a chemical and an injury. See Rains v. PPG Indus., Inc., 361 F.Supp.2d 829, 834 (S.D. Ill. 2004) (\u201cEpidemiologic studies are the primary, generally accepted methodology for demonstrating a causal relation between a chemical and the set of symptoms or a disease.\u201d); Castellow v. Chevron USA, 97 F.Supp.2d 780, 786 (S.D. Tex. 2000) (\u201cIt is accepted that, in evaluating a purported causal link between a chemical agent and a particular disease, epidemiological studies are the most informative.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b503-4\" pgmap=\"503\">We hold that, based on the epidemiological studies showing a causal relationship between childhood lead exposure and problems with attention, and Mr. Liles\u2019 medical and neuropsy-chological records, there was a sufficient factual basis for Dr. Blackwell-White\u2019s opinion that the cognitive deficits identified by Dr. Kraft, impairments that fall within the umbrella term \u201cattention,\u201d were caused by Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure. Although Ivy Realty\u2019s experts testified differently, the circuit court properly determined that the weight and credibility of this evidence was an issue for the jury to resolve.</p> <p id=\"b503-5\" pgmap=\"503\">We turn next to Dr. Blackwell-White\u2019s opinion that Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure caused a loss of four IQ points. In support of that conclusion, Dr. Blackwell-White relied upon the Lan-phear Study, which found a range of two to five IQ points lost based on lead levels up to 10 meg/dL.</p> <p id=\"b503-6\" pgmap=\"503\">As Mr. Liles notes, the Maryland appellate courts have upheld the use of the Lanphear Study as the basis for calculating IQ loss for plaintiffs in lead paint cases. In Rochkind v. Stevenson, 229 Md.App. 422, 469, 145 A.3d 570 (2016), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 454 Md. 277, 164 A.3d 254 (2017), this Court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b503-7\" pgmap=\"503\">Because, as Mr. Rochkind acknowledges, there is a scientific consensus that lead poisoning causes IQ loss, the only issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that Ms. Stevenson sustained a specific IQ loss of between five and six points. Dr. Hall-Carrington formed her opinion by extrapolating from epidemiological studies quantifying IQ loss resulting from lead exposure in the general population to estimate the range of IQ loss in an individual. The court accepted this methodology as sound. This was not an abuse of discretion.</blockquote> <p id=\"b503-8\" pgmap=\"503(53) 504(12)\">More recently, the Court of Appeals held that there was a sufficient factual basis for expert opinion, based on the Lanphear Study, that lead exposure caused the plaintiff a loss of 7.4 to 9.4 IQ points. Levitas v. Christian, 454 Md. 233, 240, 247-48, 164 A.3d 228 (2017). Similarly, here, Dr. Blackwell-White\u2019s opinion, based on the Lanphear Study, had a sufficient factual basis.</p> <p id=\"b504-4\" pgmap=\"504\">Dr. Blackwell-White\u2019s testimony satisfied Mr. Liles\u2019 burden of providing evidence, which the jury could accept or reject, that Mr. Liles\u2019 lead exposure caused cognitive deficits. Accordingly, Ivy Realty\u2019s claim, that the circuit court erred in denying the motions for judgment and judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Mr. Liles failed to show lead exposure caused injury, is without merit.</p> <p id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504\">II.</p> <p id=\"b504-6\" pgmap=\"504\">Damages</p> <p id=\"b504-7\" pgmap=\"504\"> Ivy Realty next contends that the circuit court erred in submitting the case to the jury because, even if Mr. Liles produced sufficient evidence to show that lead exposure caused injury, he failed to produce sufficient evidence that he incurred damages. Specifically, they contend that there was insufficient evidence of loss of earning capacity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b504-8\" pgmap=\"504\">Mr. Liles contends that he produced sufficient evidence of damages. He points to Mr. Lieberman\u2019s testimony that, although Mr. Liles\u2019 IQ indicated that he would be able to earn an Associate\u2019s Degree, due to his attention deficits, Mr. Liles would not be able to achieve that goal. Mr. Liles asserts that this opinion \u201cwas based on a sound methodology and had a solid factual basis.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b505-4\" pgmap=\"505\"> Ivy Realty is correct that \u201ccompensatory damages are not to be awarded in negligence ... actions absent evidence that the plaintiff suffered a loss or detriment.\u201d Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, 87 Md.App. 699, 735, 591 A.2d 544 (1991), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992). Here, the loss claimed is an impairment of earning capacity. In that regard, this Court has explained that the proper measure in determining damages for impairment of earning capacity \u201cis the difference between the amount that the plaintiff was capable of earning before his injury and that which he is capable of earning,\u201d i.e., the plaintiff essentially \u201c \u2018must establish the disparity between the market value of his services before and after the injury.\u2019 \u201d Lewin Realty III, Inc. v. Brooks, 138 Md.App. 244, 281, 771 A.2d 446 (2001) (quoting Anderson v. Litzenberg, 115 Md.App. 549, 573, 694 A.2d 150 (1997)), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 378 Md. 70, 835 A.2d 616 (2003), and abrogated on other grounds by Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Maryland, Inc. v. Gasper, 418 Md. 594, 17 A.3d 676 (2011).</p> <p id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">Here, Mr. Lieberman testified that, without deficits, i.e., without the problems caused by lead exposure, Mr. Liles would have been able to obtain an Associate\u2019s Degree, and with deficits, which Mr. Lieberman described as \u201cmajor cognitive issues,\u201d Mr. Liles would have the earning potential of an individual with a high school diploma and \u201csome college.\u201d In making that determination, Mr. Lieberman employed the primary methodology used in the field of vocational rehabilitation counseling.</p> <p id=\"b505-6\" pgmap=\"505\">Dr. Conte testified that, based on Mr. Lieberman\u2019s assessment, Mr. Liles suffered a loss of earnings of $1,698,808. That number represented the difference between the average wages for individuals with the educational attainment of an Associate\u2019s degree (earning potential absent injury), i.e., $3,456,127, and the average wages of individuals with the educational attainment of high school plus some college (earning potential with cognitive deficits), i.e., $1,757,320.</p> <p id=\"b505-7\" pgmap=\"505(21) 506(73)\">This evidence was sufficient to present the issue of damages to the jury. Ivy Realty argues that the opinions were insufficient because: (1) Dr. Lieberman should have used a different methodology to assess Mr. Liles and considered his parents\u2019 educational and vocational attainment; and (2) Dr. Conte gave \u201cconfusing\u201d testimony in response to a question on cross-examination. Those arguments, however, go to the weight of the evidence, an issue to be assessed by the jury. The circuit court properly denied Ivy Realty\u2019s motions for judgment and submitted the case to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b506-5\" pgmap=\"506\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Although Ivy Realty asserts that there was insufficient evidence that Mr, Liles incurred any injury \u201cthat caused any functional change upon which a jury could determine non-economic or economic damages beyond speculation,\u201d the argument presented is limited to a failure to show economic damages of \"change in vocational capacity and loss of earning capacity resulting from his lead exposure.\u201d Because Ivy Realty limited its argument to economic damages, we will confine our analysis to that issue as well.
