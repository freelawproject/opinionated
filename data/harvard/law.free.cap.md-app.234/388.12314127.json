Appellant and cross-appellee, Greater Towson Council of Community Associations (\u201cGTC\u201d)\u2014an \u201cumbrella group\u201d that represents more than 30 neighborhoods in Towson, Maryland\u2014opposed the approval of the PUD before the Board in one case (the \u201cPUD approval case\u201d), and the County Council\u2019s grant of a waiver of local \u201copen space\u201d requirements in the other case (the \u201copen space waiver ease\u201d). The Board ruled in favor of the developer of the 101 York PUD, appellee and cross-appellant, DMS Development, LLC (\u201cDMS\u201d) in both cases. The cases were consolidated before the circuit court, and DMS moved to dismiss GTC\u2019s petition based on its assertion that GTC lacked standing. Multiple parties have been involved at varying points during the ascent to this Court of both cases. Nevertheless, only GTC timely filed and continued to maintain its petitions for judicial review before the circuit court at the decisive point in the proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b429-7\" pgmap=\"429\">In both appeals from the circuit court affirming the Board\u2019s decisions on the merits in both cases, GTC presents several issues for our review. Many aspects of the issues are overlapping as GTC had averred in the PUD approval case that the PUD should not be approved because the open space waiver was not properly granted. We list the issues on the merits of each case in turn. In the open space waiver case, GTC asks us to decide the following questions, which we have reworded as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b430-3\" pgmap=\"430\">1. Whether the circuit court erred when it affirmed the ruling of the Board to grant the open space waiver, even though the County\u2019s original approval of the waiver was granted by the Deputy Administrative Officer and Director of Permits Approvals and Inspections (\u201cDeputy Director\u201d), rather than the Director of Recreation and Parks.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b430-4\" pgmap=\"430\">2. Whether the circuit court erred when it determined that the PUD constituted a \u201cdormitory\u201d and affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to approve the open space waiver, which was based on its finding that the PUD was located in a \u201cRAE\u201d district.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b430-5\" pgmap=\"430\">3. Whether the circuit court erred when it affirmed the ruling of the Board that the open space waiver fee of \u201czero\u201d was not appealable.</blockquote> <p id=\"b430-6\" pgmap=\"430\">In GTC\u2019s appeal of the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision in the PUD approval case, GTC presents us with the following issues:</p> <blockquote id=\"b430-7\" pgmap=\"430\">1. Whether the Board and the circuit court erred when each ruled that the Administrative Law Judge had no statutory authority to condition approval of the PUD on the payment of an open space waiver fee.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b430-8\" pgmap=\"430\">2. Whether the circuit court erred when it found that the Deputy Director\u2019s approval of an open space waiver did not render the waiver invalid and, therefore, that the Board erred when it affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision to approve the PUD.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b430-9\" pgmap=\"430\">3. Whether the circuit court erred when it affirmed the Board\u2019s decision affirming the decision of the Administrative Law Judge to approve the PUD, the Board\u2019s decision in the open space waiver case to grant the waiver on the basis of the PUD\u2019s zoning district, without determining whether the PUD constituted a \u201cdormitory.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b430-10\" pgmap=\"430(28) 431(11)\">4. Whether the circuit court erred when it affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to affirm the ruling of the Administrative Law Judge, which found that the zoning density permitted on the property was properly amended by the County Council.</blockquote> <p id=\"b431-4\" pgmap=\"431\">DMS has noted cross-appeals in both cases, arguing that the GTC does not have standing to maintain an appeal. In that context, DMS presents us with primarily three issues, which we have reworded as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b431-5\" pgmap=\"431\">I. Whether the circuit court erred when it denied DMS\u2019s motion to dismiss GTC\u2019s petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the open space waiver case based on GTC\u2019s lack of standing before the circuit court.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b431-6\" pgmap=\"431\">II. Whether the circuit court erred when it denied DMS\u2019s motion to dismiss GTC\u2019s petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the PUD approval case based on GTC\u2019s lack of standing before the circuit court.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b431-7\" pgmap=\"431\">III. Whether the circuit court erred when it granted motions to intervene in the PUD approval case after the limitations period for filing an appeal of the Board\u2019s decision had expired, DMS had filed a motion to dismiss GTC\u2019s petition for judicial review, and where the intervenors were not parties in the proceedings before the Board.</blockquote> <p id=\"b431-8\" pgmap=\"431\">Because of the similarity of the standing issues in both cases, and because GTC\u2019s standing to appeal the Board\u2019s decisions to the circuit court is determinative in both the PUD approval case and the open space waiver case, we have consolidated our opinions in both cases below. In our view, the issues presented by DMS in its cross-appeals are dispositive in both cases. We hold that GTC did not have standing to petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decisions in either of the two cases, and therefore, the circuit court erred when it denied DMS\u2019s motion to dismiss and reached the merits of the case.</p> <p id=\"b431-9\" pgmap=\"431\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p> <p id=\"b431-10\" pgmap=\"431(22) 432(113)\">DMS is the developer of property which is the subject of a proposed PUD, known as the 101 York PUD. The proposed PUD\u2019s location is in the heart of urban Towson, Maryland, just north of the intersection of York Road and Burke Avenue. The PUD will contain a \u201cmixed residential dormitory and commercial project.\u201d On July 7, 2014 the Baltimore County Council (\u201cCounty Council\u201d) passed Resolution 40-14, which made the PUD eligible for review by Baltimore County agencies. Pursuant to BCC \u00a7 32-6-108(c), new developments are required to provide a certain amount of recreational \u201copen space\u201d depending on the number of residential units. DMS was granted a waiver of the local open space requirement, and the County set the fee to be paid in lieu of meeting the open space requirements at \u201czero\u201d dollars.</p> <p id=\"b432-4\" pgmap=\"432\">On October 7, 2013 the PUD application was submitted to the County Council. The Post-Submission Community Input Meeting was held on October 30, 2013, On April 24, the Baltimore County Council resolved Resolution 40-14, which provided that the 101 York PUD was eligible for continued review, pursuant to BCC \u00a7 32-4-241 et. seq. The Pre-Concept Meeting was held on July 21, 2014, followed by a Community Input Meeting on September 9, 2014 and two more Community Input Meetings on October 6 and 28 of 2014. A Concept Plan Conference was held on August 8, 2014 and a Development Plan Conference was held on December 10, 2014.</p> <p id=\"b432-5\" pgmap=\"432(120) 433(2)\">On January 9, 2015 Arnold Jablon, Deputy Administrative Officer and Director of Permits Approvals and Inspections, recommended that the Council approve DMS\u2019s request for a waiver of the local open space requirements. The recommendation was based on several factors including DMS\u2019s representation that it was exempt from satisfying the open space requirements because: (1) the \u201c[pjroject is located in a RAE zone or CT district;\u201d and (2) the \u201c[pjroject is... dormitories for the housing of not less than 50 students attending an accredited higher education institution.\u201d Additionally, the Department of Recreation and Parks determined that \u201cthere is no suitable land to meet the open space requirements\u201d and confirmed that \u201c[tjhere is no Master Plan and/or other County plan conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b433-4\" pgmap=\"433\">On December 10, 2014, the Zoning Review Board issued an additional comment to its final recommendations noting,</p> <blockquote id=\"b433-5\" pgmap=\"433\">The dormitory rooms shall be occupied as temporary housing by matriculating Towson University students only. A Special Hearing shall be required prior to any such rooms being rented or otherwise occupied as permanent or temporary housing to non matriculating Towson University Students.</blockquote> <p id=\"b433-6\" pgmap=\"433\">According to Resolution 63-00, the fee-in-lieu for a local open space waiver for this project was set at \u201czero\u201d dollars. The Council approved Resolution 40-14 at its July 7, 2014 meeting, which approved the continued review of the proposed PUD. Resolution 40-14 provides the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b433-7\" pgmap=\"433\">WHEREAS, the site fronts York Road and is zoned B.M. and R.A.E.2, and the PUD proposes the development of a high quality mixed residential dormitory and commercial project containing 611 beds, 495 parking spaces, and approximately 10,000 square feet of commercial spaces, and provides for two means of access, one via York Road and one via an easement to Burke Avenue which involves access to commercial parking over an adjacent parcel through a residential zone R.A.E.2;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b433-8\" pgmap=\"433\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b433-9\" pgmap=\"433\">WHEREAS, prior to the submission of its application the developer DMS held extensive community meetings with surrounding homeowners\u2019 associations and interested stakeholders, including the Greater Towson Council of Community Associations and the Towson Triangle Committee created by the office of Councilman Marks;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b433-10\" pgmap=\"433\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b433-11\" pgmap=\"433(24) 434(21)\">BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNTY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND that the proposed site for the general development PUD filed by DMS and known as \u201c101 York\u201d is eligible for continued County review in accordance with Section 32-4-241, et seq. of the County Code.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b434-4\" pgmap=\"434\">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that due to the public policy and community benefits that stem from the PUD, the County Council approves the proposed density for the proposed PUD to permit a total of 611 dormitory beds on the property, 495 parking spaces, and the inclusion of approximately 10,000 square feet of commercial space on the site; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b434-5\" pgmap=\"434\">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Council approves the use of two means of access for the PUD, one via York Road and one via an easement to Burke Avenue which involves access to commercial parking over an adjacent parcel through a residential zone (R.A.E.2).</blockquote> <p id=\"b434-6\" pgmap=\"434\">After the three Community Input Meetings and the County\u2019s approval of the PUD, GTC and the American Legion, an adjacent property owner, opposed the approval before the Hearing Examiner, also referred to in the proceedings below as the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The proceedings before the ALJ on the approval of the PUD began on January 12, 2015. The ALJ approved the PUD on May 12, 2015, subject to certain conditions including that DMS pay a waiver fee of $1,358,084.00, rather than the zero dollar waiver fee set by the County Council in Resolution 63-00. GTC appealed the ALJ\u2019s approval of the waiver to the Board, and DMS appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to make approval of the PUD subject to the payment of a $1,358,084.00 fee.</p> <p id=\"b434-7\" pgmap=\"434\">On October 5, 2015, the Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to approve the PUD, but reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision to make approval subject to the fee set by the ALJ. The Board based its decision on its conclusion that the ALJ did not have authority or jurisdiction over the decision to grant the open space waiver. That authority, the Board found, was given to the Board under the Baltimore County Charter, \u00a7\u00a7 602 and 603. Indeed, the open space waiver issue was pending before the Board in a separate case when the ALJ issued his findings on that issue.</p> <p id=\"b435-3\" pgmap=\"435\">Unlike the PUD approval ease, which first went before the AL J only on the issue of the PUD\u2019s approval, the first decision to be made and contested in the open space waiver case was the decision of the Director of Permits Approvals and Inspections to approve the open space waiver on January 9, 2015. GTC appealed the County\u2019s grant of an open space waiver to the Board of Appeals directly. The Board of Appeals reviewed the decision to grant the open space waiver de novo. See Md. Code (2013, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-305, Local Government Art. (permitting original jurisdiction for local county boards of appeals or jurisdiction to review the action of an administrative officer or unit of county government.). On September 17, 2015, the Board of Appeals in the open space waiver case approved the waiver for the 101 York PUD, including the County Council\u2019s designation of a zero dollar waiver fee.</p> <p id=\"b435-4\" pgmap=\"435\">Two separate petitions for judicial review were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of the Board\u2019s October 5, 2015 decision, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to approve the PUD but reversed the ALJ\u2019s ruling making approval of the PUD subject to a $1,358,084.00 fee for the open space waiver. The first petition was filed by GTC on October 16, 2015, and the second petition was filed on October 29, 2015 by the American Legion, Post No. 22, Inc. (\u201cAmerican Legion\u201d), along with the following individuals: Frederick Hofferbert, Jr., James Rebbert, Paul Moran, John Adair, and Kraig Dean, all of 125 York Road.</p> <p id=\"b435-5\" pgmap=\"435\">On January 21, 2016, after previously attempting to file a dismissal of their petition on January 15, 2016, the American Legion and all of the individual petitioners, as well as DMS, filed a Stipulation of Partial Dismissal in the PUD approval case. After the stipulated dismissal, the only remaining petitioner in both the PUD approval case and the open space waiver case was GTC. DMS filed motions to dismiss in both the PUD approval case as well as the open space waiver case based on GTC\u2019s lack of standing.</p> <p id=\"b435-6\" pgmap=\"435(27) 436(48)\">On or around February 16, 2016, after DMS filed its motions to dismiss, Towson Lubrication, LLC (doing business as Jiffy Lube) (\u201cTowson Lubrication\u201d), Helen Keplinger (\u201cKep-linger\u201d), Ed Kilcullen (\u201cKilcullen\u201d) and two others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed motions to intervene in the petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the PUD approval case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of the intervenors were parties before the Board proceedings in the PUD approval case. DMS opposed the motion to intervene.</p> <p id=\"b436-4\" pgmap=\"436\">Both the PUD approval and the open space waiver cases were consolidated for the proceedings before the circuit court. At the June 1, 2016 hearing, the circuit court denied DMS\u2019s motions to dismiss based on GTC\u2019s lack of standing in both cases. The circuit court further granted the motion to intervene filed by Towson Lubrication, Keplinger, and Kilcullen in the PUD approval case, despite acknowledging that the inter-venors were not parties in the case before the Board. The circuit court\u2019s decision to grant the motions to intervene was based, in part, on its determination that GTC\u2014the only remaining petitioner in the case\u2014had standing to petition for judicial review.</p> <p id=\"b436-5\" pgmap=\"436\">By the end of the proceedings on June 1, 2016, however, the circuit court affirmed both of the Board\u2019s decisions\u2014the September 17, 2015 decision to approve the open space waiver for the 101 York PUD and the Board\u2019s October 5, 2015 decision to affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision to approve the PUD. Additional facts will be provided below as they become relevant.</p> <p id=\"b436-6\" pgmap=\"436\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"AU5\" pgmap=\"436\">I. Statutory Framework</p> <p id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436(22) 437(102)\">There are two paths by which a land use decision made by the County may reach the Board. Counties are permitted to create local Boards of Appeals under the authority of Md. Code (2013, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-305 of the Local Government Article (\u201cLG\u201d). Under that authority, a Board of Appeals \u201cmay have original jurisdiction or jurisdiction to review the action of an administrative officer or unit of county government.\u201d LG \u00a7 10-305(b). The Court of Appeals provided in Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v. DCW Dutchship Island, LLC, that a county has the \u201cability to set reasonable conditions precedent to access to its Board of Appeals [as] an exercise of its Home Rule.\u201d 439 Md. 588, 604, 97 A.3d 135 (2014).</p> <p id=\"b437-4\" pgmap=\"437\">The final approval of a PUD, after the Council approves its continued review, is made by a Hearing Officer (the ALJ), which is subject to review by the Board, if an appeal of the ALJ\u2019s decision is filed. The Baltimore County Code (\u201cBCC\u201d) provides certain procedures and design requirements for the approval of a PUD. Among other requirements, \u201c[a]n application for approval for a [PUD] shall be submitted to the\u201d appropriate County Council member and include certain content, such as \u201can explanation of how the site and acreage meet the criteria for the type of [PUD] that is proposed.\u201d BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(a) &amp; (b). \u201c[Community residents and organizations may provide written input and comments regarding the proposed development to the Council member\u201d before the Council adopts \u201ca resolution approving the continued review of the [PUD],\u201d assuming all other preliminary community meetings, public postings and notices, and reviews conducted by county agencies are met.

Further, \u201c[t]he Council may amend or modify the densities or uses in the proposed [PUD] and shall include such amendments or modifications in the resolution adopted under this subsection.\u201d BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(d)(2).</p> <p id=\"b438-3\" pgmap=\"438\">Next, an ALJ, &lt;(conduct[s] a hearing on the PUD development plan in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 32-4-227 and 32-4-228.\u201d BCC \u00a7 32-4-245; see also \u00a7 32-4-227(a) (providing that \u201cfinal action on a Development Plan may not be taken until after a public quasi-judicial hearing before a Hearing Officer\u201d). The ALJ must \u201cissue a written decision that approves or denies the PUD development plan and may condition approval on comments contained in the Director\u2019s report or otherwise.\u201d BCC \u00a7 32-4-245(a)(2). The scope of the ALJ\u2019s review of the proposed PUD encompasses the PUD\u2019s \u201ccompliance with the requirements of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations and the development regulations,\u201d including \u201c[t]he height, area, setback, parking, open space, sign and other development and zoning requirements of the underlying zone or district that apply in that portion of the proposed [PUD].\u201d BCC \u00a7 32-4-245(b).

Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, 344 Md. 271, 286, 686 A.2d 605 (1996) noted, liberal standing requirements are afforded to those who seek to challenge a county agency\u2019s decision before the Board of Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals has previously explained,</p> <blockquote id=\"b440-5\" pgmap=\"440\">Bearing in mind that the format for proceedings before administrative agencies is intentionally designed to be informal so as to encourage citizen participation, we think that absent a reasonable agency or other regulation providing for a more formal method of becoming a party, anyone clearly identifying himself to the agency for the record as having an interest in the outcome of a matter being considered by the agency, thereby becomes a party to the proceedings.</blockquote> <p id=\"b441-3\" pgmap=\"441\">Med.

Council of Baltimore (hereinafter \u201c25th Street\u201d), we explained that \u201cthe requirements for administrative standing are such that one may have administrative standing, but lack standing to seek judicial review.\u201d 137 Md.App. 60, 71, 767 A.2d 906 (2001) (citing Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019Ass\u2019n, supra, 344 Md. at 285-86, 686 A.2d 605). Because the threshold for standing before the Board is relatively low compared to standing requirements to bring a case before the circuit court, we explained that \u201ca concerned citizen or group of citizens may be allowed to argue against a zoning decision before the Board but not be sufficiently aggrieved to seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b441-5\" pgmap=\"441\">In Sugarloaf, the Court of Appeals articulated the policy underlying administrative standing requirements in Maryland permitting wide latitude to persons aggrieved or \u201cfeeling aggrieved\u201d by county zoning decisions: \u201cThe requirements for administrative standing under Maryland law are not very strict. Absent a statute or a reasonable regulation specifying criteria for administrative standing, one may become a party to an administrative proceeding rather easily.\u201d Id. at 286, 686 A.2d 605. Although the Baltimore County Code provides standing requirements for persons who may challenge final decisions of the ALJ, those provisions actually extend, rather than restrict, \u201cperson[s] aggrieved or feeling aggrieved\u201d to community associations where the development plan \u201cspecially aggrieves\u201d its members. BCC \u00a7 32-4-281(a)(2); see also \u00a7 32-4-281 (b) (permitting \u201cperson[s] aggrieved ... by final action on a Development Plan\u201d to appeal the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Board \u201cwithin 30 days after the date of the final decision of the [ALJ] \u201d). Thus, like the petitioner in 25th Street, a petitioner may find itself with standing to appeal an ALJ\u2019s approval of a PUD to the Board of Appeals, but without the requisite standing to petition for judicial review before the circuit court.</p> <p id=\"b442-3\" pgmap=\"442\">II.

Because of the requirement that a person\u2019s interests must be specially affected, \u201cstanding issues are \u2018determined by the courts on a case by case basis, and the decision in each case rests upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case under review.\u2019 \u201d Ray v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, 430 Md. 74, 90, 59 A.3d 545 (2013) (quoting Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d 289).</p> <p id=\"b444-4\" pgmap=\"444\"> Depending on the circumstances, we typically examine the proximity of a person\u2019s property to the site for which the zoning decision was made in determining whether an individual is \u201caggrieved.\u201d See Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d 289; see also Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 83, 59 A.3d 546. Indeed, the weight attributed to a petitioner\u2019s \u201caggrievement\u201d is most often evaluated by \u201chow close the affected property is to the re-zoned property.\u201d Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 83, 69 A.3d 545. Generally, therefore, \u201cproximity is the most important factor to be considered\u201d in determining whether a protestant is per se aggrieved, \u201cwhere standing to challenge a rezoning action [is] at issue.\u201d Id. at 82-83, 59 A.3d 545.</p> <p id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444\"> In Ray, following Bryniarski, the Court of Appeals reviewed primarily two categories of property owners who have standing to petition for judicial review in zoning cases. Id. at 81-83, 59 A.3d 545. First, a party is deemed to be \u201cspecially damaged,\u201d and therefore \u201cprima facie aggrieved,\u201d if the petitioner owns property that is \u201cadjoining, confronting, or nearby\u201d the rezoned property. Id. at 85, 59 A.3d 545. A second category includes \u201ca protestant [who] is almost prima facie aggrieved when \u2018she is farther away than an adjoining, confronting, or nearby property owner, but is still close enough to the site of the rezoning action ... and offers \u2018plus factors\u2019 supporting injury.\u2019 \u201d Bell, supra, 442 Md. at 559, 113 A.3d 639 (quoting Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 86, 59 A.3d at 551-52). Importantly, this additional factor must establish that the petitioner\u2019s personal or property rights are \u201cpersonally and specially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.\u201d Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 81, 59 A.3d 545. As the Court of Appeals explained in Ray, however,</p> <blockquote id=\"b445-3\" pgmap=\"445\">[tjhere is ... no bright-line rule for exactly how close a property must be in order to show special aggrievement. Instead, this Court has maintained a flexible standard, finding standing in cases that do not quite satisfy the \u201cadjoining, confronting or nearby\u201d standard of prima facie aggrievement, but are nudging up against that line. Protestants in such cases will be considered to pass the standing threshold if they allege specific facts of their injury. In other words, once sufficient proximity is shown, some typical allegations of harm acquire legal significance that would otherwise be discounted. But in the absence of proximity, much more is needed.</blockquote> <p id=\"b445-4\" pgmap=\"445\">Id. at 83, 59 A.3d 545 (emphasis added). In spite of the absence of any \u201cbright-line rule\u201d of proximity, \u201c[t]he category of almost prima facie aggrieved protestants has been found in our cases to apply only to those who have lived between 200 to 1000 feet away from the subject property.\u201d Bell, supra, 442 Md. at 559, 113 A.3d 639.</p> <p id=\"b445-5\" pgmap=\"445\"> Although some have suggested that we recognize \u201ca third, poorly-defined category of protestants,\u201d Ray, supra, 480 Md. at 85, 59 A.3d 545, \u201c[a] person whose property is far removed from the subject property ordinarily will not be considered a person aggrieved.\u201d 25th Street, supra, 137 Md. App. at 86, 767 A.2d 906 (quoting Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 144-45, 230 A.2d 289); see also Bell, supra, 442 Md. at 576, 113 A.3d 639 (noting that, outside of the two primary categories of aggrieved property owners, \u201cprotestants are \u2018generally aggrieved\u2019 and do not have standing\u201d). Put differently, to show that one is \u201caggrieved\u201d and therefore satisfies the second prong of the standing analysis in a judicial review of a land use decision, every petitioner, no matter the proximity, must demonstrate that he or she is \u201cspecially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.\u201d Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 143, 230 A.2d 289.</p> <p id=\"b445-6\" pgmap=\"445(26) 446(82)\"> A person or entity who owns property that is \u201cadjoining, confronting, or nearby\u201d the rezoned property, however, may establish its prima facie aggrievement by putting forth evidence of the property\u2019s proximity to the site in question. Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 85, 59 A.3d 545. All other petitioners have the burden\u2014which varies in degree based on proximity\u2014to articulate what sets them apart from the general public. See Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 89, 59 A.3d 545. Notably, \u201c[w]ith the exception of those protestants who are prima facie aggrieved, the requirement that an individual prove special aggrievement has been well-established for more than half a century.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b446-4\" pgmap=\"446\"> Particularly important in this case is Maryland\u2019s policy relating to \u201cassociation standing\u201d in land use actions. To have standing to appeal a zoning and land use decision of the Board, a neighborhood or community association itself must be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the decision of the Board regardless of its members\u2019 property ownership. See Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., 205 Md.App. 636, 658, 46 A.3d 473 (2012). We have previously articulated that an \u201cassociation lacks standing to sue where it has no property interest of its own\u2014separate and apart from that of its members.\u201d Id. (quoting Citizens Planning &amp; Hous. Ass\u2019n v. Cnty. Exec. of Baltimore Cnty., 273 Md. 333, 345, 329 A.2d 681 (1974)).</p> <p id=\"b446-5\" pgmap=\"446(157) 447(135)\"> GTC averred during oral argument and in its briefs that Long Green Valley and Citizens Planning do not apply to this case because those cases involved \u201coriginal,\u201d equitable actions filed in the circuit court, rather than petitions for judicial review of an administrative decision. Putting aside the parties\u2019 academic debate over whether a petition for judicial review is an \u201cappeal\u201d or an \u201coriginal action,\u201d the more important point is that these cases examined the \u201caggrievement\u201d of associations seeking relief from the circuit court in land use actions. Id. at 683-84, 46 A.3d 473 (\u201cAppellants argue that they have standing because ... some of LGVA\u2019s members reside in the area of Bellevale Farm. Thus, appellants will be \u201cspecially harmed\u201d by the creamery operation in a manner different from the public.\u201d). We have already explained that due to the liberal standing criteria before the Board, a party may have standing before the Board but lack standing to petition for judicial review in the circuit court. See 25th Street, supra, 137 Md.App. at 71, 767 A.2d 906. Additionally, we explained supra that principles in Bryniarski apply to determine standing in challenges to \u201cland use decisions.\u201d See State Center, supra, 438 Md. at 624, 92 A.3d 400. \u201c[A] land use decision is a decision (typically an ordinance or regulation) enacted or promulgated by a legislative or administrative body for the purpose of directing the development of real estate.\u201d State Center, supra, 438 Md. at 624, 92 A.3d 400 (citation omitted). We, therefore, apply Bryniarski principles of property owner standing to determine whether GTC is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s land use decisions \u201cseparate and apart from that of its members.\u201d Long Green Valley, supra, 205 Md.App. at 658, 46 A.3d 473.</p> <p id=\"b447-4\" pgmap=\"447\">This very concept underlies the similar policy that an individual member of a neighborhood association is not \u2018aggrieved\u2019 for the purposes of standing before the circuit court simply because another member of the same neighborhood owns property that \u201cadjoin[s], confronts], [is] nearby\u201d the property at issue. Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 81, 59 A.3d 545. The Court in Ray addressed this principle specifically\u2014that residents of a neighborhood generally cannot assert standing by virtue of the aggrievement of the neighborhood\u2019s other members\u2014providing the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b447-5\" pgmap=\"447\">Creating a bright-line rule, under which each person in the entire neighborhood qualifies as a member of the specially aggrieved class in every PUD case, as Petitioners propose, would be tantamount to abandoning the Bryniarski rule that the facts and circumstances of each case would govern.</blockquote> <p id=\"b447-6\" pgmap=\"447\">Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 90, 59 A.3d 545.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court elaborated this concept in the following passage:</p> <blockquote id=\"b448-3\" pgmap=\"448\">We agree with Respondents that the creation of a class of aggrieved persons is done on an individual scale and not based on delineations of city neighborhoods.

See Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d 289; Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 89, 59 A.3d 545. As we noted above, the Baltimore County Code and general administrative standing policy in Maryland may afford standing before the Board to associations in some circumstances, even when its own property ownership interests are not at stake. Med. Waste, supra, 327 Md. at 611, 612 A.2d 241. Before the circuit court, however, a neighborhood or community association, itself, must own property that is \u201cadjoining, confronting, or nearby\u201d the subject property to be \u201cprima facie aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision. Long Green Valley, supra, 205 Md.App. at 658, 46 A.3d 473; Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 85, 59 A.3d 545.</p> <p id=\"b448-6\" pgmap=\"448(90) 449(69)\"> If not \u201cprima facie aggrieved,\u201d the association must, therefore, allege and prove special circumstances or \u201cplus factors\u201d demonstrating that the association will be harmed differently from the general public. See Bell, supra, 442 Md. at 558, 113 A.3d 639 (citations omitted) (discussing the additional criteria for \u201calmost prima facie aggrieved\u201d property owners). An association with no property interests near the subject property, or an association that owns property verging on that standard of proximity but is not \u201caggrieved\u201d differently than the general public, lacks standing to appeal a zoning decision made by the Board. See Long Green Valley, supra, 205 Md.App. at 658, 46 A.3d 473; Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d 289. When a case reaches such a procedural posture, therefore, the property interests of an association\u2019s members have no bearing on the standing of the larger association. Our task is to now apply these well-established principles to the circumstances of the case sub judice.</p> <p id=\"b449-4\" pgmap=\"449\">A. As a Community Association Not \u201cAggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s Decisions, GTC Did Not Have Standing To Petition the Circuit Court for Judicial Review.</p> <p id=\"b449-5\" pgmap=\"449\"> At the consolidated hearing, before denying DMS\u2019s motions to dismiss GTC\u2019s petition for judicial review and reviewing the merits of both the PUD approval case and the open space waiver case, the circuit court found that GTC had standing to petition for judicial review in both cases. The court\u2019s decision was based, in part, on GTC\u2019s participation as a party before the Board in both cases. Additionally, the circuit circuit considered, secondarily, that one of GTC\u2019s member neighborhood association members owned a community park and garden somewhat near the 101 York PUD. With respect to the open space waiver case specifically, the circuit court found that GTC had a strong interest in DMS\u2019s payment of a higher waiver fee because of the benefits it could bring to GTC\u2019s member neighborhoods in Baltimore County.</p> <p id=\"b449-6\" pgmap=\"449(127) 450(55)\">With respect to GTC\u2019s standing in the open space waiver case, the circuit court\u2019s assumption of GTC\u2019s standing due to its interest in the benefits that payment of a waiver fee would bring to its neighborhood association members throughout the Towson area overlooks the central requirement that the petitioner\u2019s interests must be affected differently than the general public. See Ray, supra, 430 Md. at 90, 59 A.3d 545 (reiterating the principle that the appellate court \u201cexamine[s] the specific facts alleged to show aggrievement ... and compare[s] that injury to harm suffered by the general public\u201d). Without having any property ownership of its own, GTC, was required to overcome the difficult burden alleging and proving how the Board\u2019s decision in the open space waiver case harmed GTC differently than others in the community. See Bell, supra, 442 Md. at 570, 113 A.3d 639 (citations omitted). There is no evidence in the record, however, that GTC was \u201cspecially aggrieved\u201d by the decision to permit the zero dollar waiver fee any more than the general public\u2014including all resident property owners in Baltimore County.</p> <p id=\"b450-4\" pgmap=\"450\">Next, we address the circuit court\u2019s attribution of standing to GTC in both eases due to GTC\u2019s participation as a party before the Board. As the circuit court recognized in this case, once a petitioner\u2019s status as a party before the Board is established, the court should inquire into whether the petitioner is an \u201caggrieved\u201d person. As we have already explained, typically, the court accomplishes this by examining the petitioner\u2019s property ownership and its proximity to the site in question. GTC, however, does not own any property near the 101 York PUD; indeed, GTC does not own any property in Maryland. Moreover, GTC is a combination of various neighborhood associations, rather than a neighborhood or community association with individual resident members. Thus, GTC is even further removed from any aggrievement caused by the Board\u2019s decision to individual resident property owners than in other cases involving neighborhood associations. GTC, therefore, was not an \u201caggrieved\u201d party based on the property interests of any of the individual resident members of the neighborhoods, which were, in turn, members of GTC.</p> <p id=\"b450-5\" pgmap=\"450\">GTC did provide evidence, through the testimony of GTC\u2019s President, that one of its several neighborhood association members owns a community park and garden approximately 200 to 300 feet away from the PUD. Nevertheless, that neighborhood association member is no different than an individual residential member of a community association who owns property within the same proximity. In both situations, to have standing, the association must, itself, be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision and cannot rely on its members\u2019 property ownership or interests. Put simply, the ownership interests of the members of an organization and those of the broader organization are not one in the same.</p> <p id=\"b451-3\" pgmap=\"451\">Maryland\u2019s traditional standing requirements to challenge a land use decision in the circuit court are purposefully specific\u2014the party challenging the decision must have been a party before the Board and must, itself, be \u201caggrieved\u201d and affected differently than the general public. See Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 143-44, 230 A.2d 289. These principles ensure that, if anyone chooses to do so, only persons or entities with interests at stake in the outcome may challenge the Board\u2019s land use decision before the circuit court. Because GTC did not put forth any evidence of its own property ownership, nor that it was specially aggrieved in some other way consistent with Bryniarski, the circuit court erred in denying DMS\u2019s motions to dismiss GTC\u2019s petitions for judicial review in both cases.</p> <p id=\"b451-4\" pgmap=\"451\">The circuit court in this case attempted to permit GTC to pursue its challenge to the Board\u2019s zoning decisions based on its sense of the fundamental fairness implications at stake. Although we appreciate the circuit court\u2019s logic in finding that GTC should have had some path to review of the Board\u2019s decision because GTC was a party before the Board, the low threshold for standing before the Board in Baltimore County conflicts with the standing principles controlling a party\u2019s ability to challenge a land use decision in the circuit court. Had American Legion continued to pursue its petition for judicial review, the court would have been required to reach the merits of the case, as GTC\u2019s lack of standing before the circuit court would not have impeded its ability to participate. Unfortunately for GTC, however, its participation as a party before the Board was not enough; to have standing to petition for judicial review before the circuit court, GTC was required to show that it was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision.</p> <p id=\"b451-5\" pgmap=\"451\">B. The Circuit Court Erred in Granting Two Motions to Intervene in the PUD Approval Case.</p> <p id=\"b451-6\" pgmap=\"451(47) 452(119)\"> Next, we address whether the circuit court erred when it granted Towson Lubrication\u2019s, Keplinger\u2019s, and Kilcul-len\u2019s motions to intervene, and whether the involvement of those parties into the case provided at least one party with standing to pursue the petitions for judicial review in the PUD approval case. In most cases, we review a circuit court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to intervene based on an abuse of discretion standard. See Sipes v. Bd. of Mun. &amp; Zoning Appeals, 99 Md.App. 78, 88, 635 A.2d 86 (1994). In this case, however, we have already determined that the circuit court found incorrectly that GTC\u2014the only remaining party in the case when the motions to intervene were filed\u2014had standing to pursue the appeal before the circuit court, Importantly, whether a justiciable case exists at the time a motion to intervene is made is a significant consideration in the court\u2019s decision to allow or deny the motion. We provided the following analysis in Sipes:</p> <blockquote id=\"b452-4\" pgmap=\"452\">Although the issue of standing may not be jurisdictional in nature, ... it does go to the very heart of whether the controversy before the circuit court is justiciable .... If the controversy is nonjusticiable, it should not be before the circuit court, and therefore must be dismissed.</blockquote> <p id=\"b452-5\" pgmap=\"452\">99 Md.App. at 87-88, 635 A.2d 86 (citations omitted); see also id, at 94, 635 A.2d 86 (citing federal authority for the rule that \u201c[ijntervention presupposes the pendency of an action in a court of competent jurisdiction\u201d). We concluded, \u201c[a]s a logical extension of this rule, a party cannot intervene in an action where none of the original parties to that action has standing.\u201d Id. at 94-95, 635 A.2d 86 (citing Fuller v. Volk, 351 F.2d 323, 328 (3d Cir. 1965)).</p> <p id=\"b452-6\" pgmap=\"452(114) 453(12)\">Because the circuit court\u2019s determination of whether GTC had standing, and therefore whether a justiciable controversy existed into which the applicants could intervene, we review whether the circuit court erred as a matter of law in granting the motions to intervene. Notably, the intervenors were not parties in the Board proceedings and filed their motions more than thirty days after the Board\u2019s decision. Citing Sipes, DMS argues that the circuit court should have denied the motions to intervene because GTC\u2014the only existing petitioner when the motions were filed, did not have standing and the motions were not timely. GTC responds that Sipes is inapplicable because the organizations in that case did not dispute that they did not have standing, whereas here, GTC makes no such concession.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b453-4\" pgmap=\"453\">We agree with DMS that Sipes is determinative on the issue regarding the motion to intervene.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Sipes, environmental organizations timely appealed the decision of the zoning board, which approved a salvage company\u2019s application \u201cfor alteration of an existing conditional use of a junk yard.\u201d Id. at 80, 635 A.2d 86. Three organizations appealed the zoning board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The salvage company responded by filing a motion to dismiss. Before the circuit court ruled on the motion, and sixty-eight days after the decision of the zoning board, Sipes filed a motion to intervene and joined the organizations\u2019 amended petition for judicial review. The salvage company filed a second motion to dismiss, and the circuit court granted Sipes\u2019s motion to intervene and denied the motion to dismiss. Thereafter, the circuit court remanded the case back to the zoning board for a new hearing. Id. at 80-81, 635 A.2d 86.</p> <p id=\"b453-5\" pgmap=\"453(100) 454(147)\">Upon appeal to this Court, we considered whether the circuit court abused its discretion by granting the motion to intervene, which was filed more than thirty days after the zoning board\u2019s decision. Under these circumstances, we noted that where \u201cthe Organizations did not have standing, and as they were the only party plaintiffs, the court should have dismissed the appeal.\u201d Id. at 95, 635 A.2d 86. We held \u201cthat the circuit court erred when it entertained the appeal from the Board because the Organizations did not have standing to appeal and Sipes could not intervene after the running of the thirty day period for taking an appeal.\u201d Id. at 85, 685 A.2d 86. Further, we distinguished, specifically, other cases in which a party was permitted to intervene where either the current party on the side upon which the party sought to intervene had standing, see Department of State Planning v. Mayor of Hagerstown, 288 Md. 9, 12-18, 415 A.2d 296 (1980), or where the intervenor, herself, had standing and could have brought the petition or suit on his or her own. See Benning v. Allstate Ins. Co., 90 Md.App. 592, 598-99, 602 A.2d 233 (1992) (holding that a motion to intervene was permitted, even though the intervenor filed her motion eighteen days before trial, where the intervenor herself could have brought an independent action to seek the same relief, as she was within the two-year statute of limitations commencing on the date of her automobile accident).</p> <p id=\"b454-4\" pgmap=\"454\"> This case, however, presented even greater obstacles to intervention. First, the only existing party petitioning the circuit court for judicial review when Towson Lubrication, Keplinger, and Kilcullen sought to intervene did not have standing. In this case, the legal correctness of the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant the motions to intervene in the PUD approval case depended, in part, on whether GTC had standing to pursue the petition. Had the court\u2019s finding of standing for GTC been correct, for instance, whether the newly admitted parties had standing to appeal on their own would have been irrelevant, as the circuit court typically need not concern itself with the standing of other parties where \u201cone party qualifies as \u2018specially aggrieved.\u2019 \u201d State Center, LLC v. Lexington Charles Ltd. P\u2019ship, 438 Md. 451, 92 A.3d 400 (2014) (quoting Long Green Valley, supra, 205 Md.App. at 652, 46 A.3d 473).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b455-3\" pgmap=\"455\">We held in Sipes that one path to overcoming the only-existing petitioner\u2019s lack of standing is to show that the intervenor could have initiated a petition for review on her own. See Sipes, supra, 99 Md.App. at 99, 635 A.2d 86 (citing Benning, supra, 90 Md.App. 592, 598-99, 602 A.2d 233). In Sipes, when the motions to intervene were filed, \u201cthe period for appealing the Board\u2019s decision had already expired,\u201d and therefore, the intervenors could not have brought their own appeal at that time. Id. at 98, 635 A.2d 86. Notably, the circumstances in Sipes are similar to the situation GTC and the intervenors find themselves in here. As we explained supra, after the American Legion dismissed its appeal of the Board\u2019s decision, no party with standing remained in the PUD approval case<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to pursue the petition for judicial review. Because Towson Lubrication, Keplinger, and Kilcullen sought to intervene well after the time within which to bring an appeal of the Board\u2019s decision, and none had participated as a party before the Board, none of the three could have brought a petition before the circuit court on his or her own.</p> <p id=\"b455-4\" pgmap=\"455(104) 456(12)\">GTC argues, on behalf of Towson Lubrication, Keplinger, and Kilcullen, however, that the circuit court had the discretion to grant the motions to intervene because the motions were filed within thirty days of American Legion\u2019s voluntary dismissal of its case. Additionally, GTC argues that the motion was timely pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-214, because American Legion was the only party that could adequately represent the intervenors\u2019 interests. Indeed, GTC avers that GTC could not have adequately represented their interests because GTC \u201cis a community association that cannot, itself, suffer a loss of the value of its property or business.\u201d More importantly in this case, however, is the second obstacle for the motions to intervene.</p> <p id=\"b456-4\" pgmap=\"456\">The determinative obstacle for Towson Lubrication\u2019s, Kep-linger\u2019s, and Kilcullen\u2019s motions to intervene has implications both for the court\u2019s ability to grant the motions to intervene as well as for the permissibility of the petition to properly go forward. In addition to the fact that their motions to intervene came well after the thirty-day period for petitioning for judicial review, Towson Lubrication, Keplinger, and Kilcullen did not participate as parties in the Board proceedings in the PUD approval case. As we have explained, the first of the two requirements to establish a party\u2019s standing to petition for judicial review is participation as a party before the Board. See Bryniarski, supra, 247 Md. at 143, 230 A.2d 289; see, e.g., Shore Acres Improvement Ass\u2019n v. Anne Arundel Cnty. Bd. of Appeals, 251 Md. 310, 317-18, 247 A.2d 402 (1968) (holding that an association\u2019s President, who was not a party before the Board of Appeals, was not entitled to appeal the Board\u2019s decision granting a zoning application that his association had opposed in the Board proceedings).</p> <p id=\"b456-5\" pgmap=\"456(98) 457(36)\">Accordingly, even if we assumed arguendo that the decision to grant the motions to intervene fell within the court\u2019s discretion and the motions were properly granted, the intervention would not have authorized the filing of a petition for judicial review by a party with standing. In other words, even after the circuit court permitted Towson Lubrication, Keplinger, and Kilcullen to intervene, none of the petitioners challenging the Board\u2019s decision had standing to pursue the petition before the circuit court. The outcome, therefore, is the same.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They were not permitted to enter the proceedings at the circuit court level after the thirty-day limitations period where the only remaining petitioner in the case had no standing to pursue an appeal of the Board\u2019s decision, and the intervenors were not parties before the Board.</p> <p id=\"b457-4\" pgmap=\"457\">For all of these reasons, the circuit court erred when it granted the motions to intervene. Regardless of the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant the motions to intervene, however, no petitioner (or intervenor) had standing to pursue the petitions for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decisions when the circuit court decided the merits in both cases. Although the practical outcome of our decision is no different than the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s decisions in both cases, the circuit court erred when it denied DMS\u2019s motions to dismiss, granted the motions to intervene in the PUD approval case, and addressed the merits of both the PUD approval case and the open space waiver case.</p> <p id=\"b457-5\" pgmap=\"457\">Because of our holding on the issue of standing, we need not address the merits of either the PUD approval case or the open space waiver case. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case to the circuit court to grant DMS\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Board of Appeals\u2019 decisions, with no properly \u201caggrieved\u201d party capable of challenging its rulings, therefore, stand in both cases.</p> <p id=\"b457-6\" pgmap=\"457\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED.
