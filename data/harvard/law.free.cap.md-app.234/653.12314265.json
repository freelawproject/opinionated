The court sentenced appellant on the conviction for possession of a firearm to five years of imprisonment, all suspended but time served, and three years of imprisonment for each of the two convictions for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b692-4\" pgmap=\"692\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions for this Court\u2019s review, which we have reordered and rephrased slightly, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b692-5\" pgmap=\"692\">1. Did the circuit court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search of his person?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b692-6\" pgmap=\"692\">2. Did the circuit court err in imposing separate sentences for each of the two convictions of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun?</blockquote> <p id=\"b692-7\" pgmap=\"692\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate the sentence for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in a vehicle and otherwise affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p> <p id=\"b692-8\" pgmap=\"692\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b692-9\" pgmap=\"692\">On November 24, 2014, Detectives Brian Salmon and Jason Leventhall, members of the Baltimore City Police Department, were on patrol in a marked SUV. Detective Salmon had encountered the odor of burnt marijuana hundreds of times, and he was accepted at the suppression hearing as an expert in the \u201csale, packaging and recognition\u201d of marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b692-10\" pgmap=\"692\">Detective Salmon saw a Honda Accord with an approximately foot-long crack in the front windshield. He had stopped the same vehicle the previous month for the same violation (cracked windshield), and he gave the driver of the vehicle at that time, appellant, a verbal warning and told him to get the windshield fixed. When the officers passed the vehicle on November 24, they \u201cimmediately smelled the strong odor of marijuana.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b692-11\" pgmap=\"692(46) 693(51)\">The detectives initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle, which was occupied by three people. As the detectives exited their vehicle and approached the driver\u2019s side of the stopped vehicle, Detective Salmon detected a \u201cstrong odor\u201d of \u201cburnt marijuana\u201d emanating from the vehicle. Detective Leventhall approached the passenger side of the vehicle and asked appellant, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, if there was any marijuana in the car. Appellant \u201cfreely stated that they were smoking marijuana,\u201d and he handed Detective Levent-hall \u201ca brown hand-rolled cigar containing green plant material.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b693-5\" pgmap=\"693\">The officers asked the driver and appellant to exit the vehicle. When Detective Salmon walked over to appellant, he could smell \u201cthe strong odor of marijuana coming from [appellant] and inside the car,\u201d but he was unable to discern from the odor the quantity of suspected marijuana.</p> <p id=\"b693-6\" pgmap=\"693\">Detective Salmon then searched appellant. He recovered a loaded 9-millimeter handgun from appellant\u2019s pants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time, appellant was placed under arrest. As Sergeant John Landsman transported appellant to the police station, appellant offered \u201cto make a deal for getting an AK-47 in exchange for being released.\u201d At the station, appellant gave a recorded statement, in which he admitted that he \u201cgot caught with a handgun.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b693-7\" pgmap=\"693(102) 694(24)\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, which included evidence that the gun seized was operable and met the definition of a firearm under Maryland law, the court heard argument on the defense motion to suppress. The State argued that, based on the odor of marijuana and appellant\u2019s actions in handing the officer \u201ca blunt of some sort,\u201d Detective Salmon had the right to search, to pat-down appellant, who possibly had additional contraband on his person or in the vehicle. Defense counsel argued that appellant\u2019s \u201cadmittance of [a] civil offense\u201d of possession of less than ten grams of marijuana \u201cdoes not give rise to [] probable cause of criminal activity,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthe search should be denied and ... the statement should be suppressed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b694-5\" pgmap=\"694\">The court ultimately denied the motion to suppress. It characterized defense counsel\u2019s argument to be that, because possession of less than ten grams of marijuana was a civil offense, and the police did not have information that a greater quantity of marijuana was involved, the police did not have probable cause to search the car. The court disagreed with that argument, noting that, pursuant to Bowling v. State, 227 Md.App. 460, 134 A.3d 388, cert. denied, 448 Md. 724, 141 A.3d 135 (2016), the smell of marijuana gave the detectives probable cause to search the vehicle. The court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b694-6\" pgmap=\"694\">The issue becomes whether it\u2019s reasonable for the officer to believe that there may be additional marijuana in the car or on the person in the car. That\u2019s the analysis under [Bowling ]. And the [.Bowling ] Court says that it is reasonable. So when Officer Salmon decided to pat down Mr. Barrett to see if he had any additional marijuana on him, as the [.Bowling ] Court found with the vehicle, this Court finds that was reasonable. When he patted him down, however, he found\u2014he felt a sharp object and he recovered that object from his person. That object turned out to be a handgun.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b694-7\" pgmap=\"694\">The Court finds nothing\u2014no\u2014the Court does not find any violation of the Fourth Amendment under the facts of this case. The Court finds the testimony of the officers to be credible. So as to the suppression of the handgun, the Court denies your motion.</blockquote> <p id=\"b694-8\" pgmap=\"694\">At the conclusion of the trial, the circuit court convicted appellant of the weapons charges. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b695-8\" pgmap=\"695\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b695-1\" pgmap=\"695\">I.</p> <p id=\"AGE\" pgmap=\"695\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress the handgun recovered from his person and his subsequent statement. He argues that \u201c[t]he police had no justification for a warrantless search of [his] person,\u201d and the court erred in relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Bowling because that case addressed a warrantless search of a vehicle, whereas this case involved the search of a person. Appellant further argues that there was no independent justification for the search, asserting that it was not a search incident to arrest for two reasons: (1) \u201che had not been arrested\u201d; and (2) this was a \u201ccitation offense for which he could not be arrested\u201d because the officer could not ascertain the quantity of marijuana involved.</p> <p id=\"b695-2\" pgmap=\"695\"> In reviewing the grant or denial of a motion to suppress, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevails on the motion, and we accept the suppression court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Bowling, 227 Md.App. at 466-67, 134 A.3d 388. Accord Norman v. State, 452 Md. 373, 386, 156 A.3d 940, cert. denied, - U.S. -, 138 S.Ct. 174, 199 L.Ed.2d 42 (2017). In determining the ultimate legal conclusion regarding whether a constitutional right has been violated, however, \u201cwe make an independent, de novo, constitutional appraisal by applying the law to facts presented in a particular case.\u201d Johnson v. State, 232 Md.App. 241, 256, 157 A.3d 338 (quoting Williams v. State, 372 Md. 386, 401, 813 A.2d 231 (2002), cert. granted, 454 Md. 678, 165 A.3d 473 (2017).</p> <p id=\"b695-5\" pgmap=\"695(64) 696(37)\"> Our analysis begins with the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which protects against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend. IV. This constitutional mandate is \u201capplicable to the states, through the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Grant v. State, 449 Md. 1, 16, 141 A.3d 138 (2016). Whether a police action is reasonable \u201cis judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). Accord Sellman v. State, 449 Md. 526, 540, 144 A.3d 771 (2016).</p> <p id=\"b696-5\" pgmap=\"696\"> The general rule is that \u201csearches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment-subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 338, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)). Accord Riley v. California, - U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2482, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014). Thus, a warrantless search of a person is \u201creasonable only if it falls within a recognized exception.\u201d Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 148, 133 S.Ct. 1552, 185 L.Ed.2d 696 (2013). The Court of Appeals has listed several exceptions to the warrant requirement, including: (1) hot pursuit; (2) the plain view doctrine; (3) the Carroll doctrine; (4) stop and frisk; (5) consent; (6) exigent circumstances; and (7) search incident to arrest. Grant, 449 Md. at 16, n.3, 141 A.3d 138 (2016).</p> <p id=\"b696-8\" pgmap=\"696(102) 697(78)\"> In denying the motion to suppress here, the circuit court appeared to rely on this Court\u2019s decision in Bowling, In that case, this Court upheld a warrantless search pursuant to the automobile exception, sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Carroll doctrine,\u201d Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), which allows the police to conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle based on probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime. 227 Md.App. at 472-73, 134 A.3d 388.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We noted that the Maryland appellate courts consistently have held that the odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle provides probable cause for the police to conduct a warrantless Carroll doctrine search of a vehicle. Id. at 469, 134 A.3d 388. In Bowling, 227 Md.App. at 476, 134 A.3d 388, we determined, and the Court of Appeals subsequently held in Robinson v. State, 451 Md. 94, 137, 152 A.3d 661 (2017), that this precedent remained good law, despite recent legislation that decriminalized possession of less than ten grams of marijuana.</p> <p id=\"b697-5\" pgmap=\"697\"> As appellant notes, however, the issue here does not concern the propriety of the search of the vehicle, and therefore, the automobile exception to the warrant requirement cannot justify the search. Rather, the issue in this case involves the propriety of the search of appellant\u2019s person. In that regard, the Supreme Court has never held, unlike in the context of a search of a vehicle, that there is a \u201cprobable cause to search a person\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. For a warrantless search of a person to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the State must show an exception to the warrant requirement, such as consent, exigent circumstances, reasonable suspicion to conduct a protective frisk, or a search incident to an arrest based on probable cause.</p> <p id=\"b697-6\" pgmap=\"697(166) 698(17)\">The State argued in its brief that the search here was justified on either of the latter two grounds. With respect to a protective frisk, the Supreme Court held in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), that the police may conduct a limited frisk of a person who has been stopped based on reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous. After the briefs were filed in this case, however, the Court of Appeals held that the odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle does not, by itself, justify a frisk of an occupant of that vehicle, but rather, a frisk is proper only if, \u201cin addition to the odor of marijuana, another circumstance or other circumstances are present giving rise to the reasonable articulable suspicion that an occupant is armed and dangerous.\u201d Norman, 452 Md. at 425, 156 A.3d 940. At oral argument, the State conceded that, based on that decision, and the facts in this case, the search of appellant was not justified as a protective frisk. We agree.</p> <p id=\"b698-5\" pgmap=\"698\"> The State contends, however, that the circuit court properly denied the motion to suppress because the search was valid under the search incident to arrest exception. The United States Supreme Court has stated that it is \u201cwell accepted\u201d that a search incident to arrest is an exception to the warrant requirement, noting, however, that \u201cthe label \u2018exception\u2019 is something of a misnomer in this context, as warrantless searches incident to arrest occur with far greater frequency than searches conducted pursuant to a warrant.\u201d Riley, 134 S.Ct. at 2482. As this Court has explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b698-6\" pgmap=\"698\">[A] police officer with probable cause to believe that a suspect has or is committing a crime may arrest the suspect without a warrant. See Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949).... Once lawfully arrested, police may search \u201cthe person of the arrestee\u201d as well as \u201cthe area within the control of the arrestee\u201d to remove any weapons or evidence that could be concealed or destroyed. United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973).</blockquote> <p id=\"b698-7\" pgmap=\"698\">Conboy v. State, 155 Md.App. 353, 364, 843 A.2d 216 (2004) (parallel citations omitted).</p> <p id=\"b698-8\" pgmap=\"698\">Appellant contends that the search should not be upheld as a valid search incident to arrest. In support, he gives three reasons: (1) the State did not argue this exception below and it was not the basis for the court\u2019s ruling; (2) there was not probable cause to arrest; and (3) there was no arrest prior to the search. We will address each of these arguments, in turn.</p> <p id=\"b698-9\" pgmap=\"698\">A.</p> <p id=\"b698-10\" pgmap=\"698\">Alternative Grounds</p> <p id=\"b698-11\" pgmap=\"698(41) 699(33)\"> We begin with appellant\u2019s contention that we should not consider whether the search was proper as a search incident to arrest because the State did not raise this argument below, and the circuit court did not rely on the search incident to arrest exception in its ruling. Although appellant is correct that the search incident to arrest argument was not raised below, that does not preclude this Court from considering the issue.</p> <p id=\"b699-4\" pgmap=\"699\">The Court of Appeals has made clear that \u201can appellee is entitled to assert any ground adequately shown by the record for upholding the trial court\u2019s decision, even if the ground was not raised in the trial court,\u201d and \u201cif legally correct, the trial court\u2019s decision will be affirmed on such alternative ground.\u201d Unger v. State, 427 Md. 383, 406, 48 A.3d 242 (2012). Accord Elliott v. State, 417 Md. 413, 435, 10 A.3d 761 (2010) (\u201c \u2018[W]here the record in a case adequately demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was correct, although on a ground not relied upon by the trial court and perhaps not even raised by the parties, an appellate court will affirm.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Robeson v. State, 285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979)). Here, the record is adequately developed for us to address whether the search was valid as a search incident to arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b699-5\" pgmap=\"699\">B.</p> <p id=\"b699-6\" pgmap=\"699\">Probable Cause</p> <p id=\"b699-7\" pgmap=\"699(106) 700(50)\"> Turning next to the issue of probable cause, appellant does not dispute that the police may arrest an individual if the officer \u201c \u2018has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence.\u2019 \u201d Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, 370, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (quoting Atwater v. Logo Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001)). See also Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 2-202(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article (providing that \u201c[a] police officer who has probable cause to believe that a felony or misdemeanor is being committed in the presence or within the view of the police officer may arrest without a warrant any person whom the police officer reasonably believes to have committed the crime.\u201d). He asserts, however, that the police did not have probable cause to believe that he was committing a crime.</p> <p id=\"b700-4\" pgmap=\"700\"> Probable cause to arrest \u201cexists where the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer at the time of the arrest, or of which the officer has reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing a criminal offense.\u201d Moulden v. State, 212 Md. App. 331, 344, 69 A.3d 36 (2013) (quoting Haley v. State, 398 Md. 106, 133, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007)). The probable cause standard is \u201ca practical, nontechnical conception that deals with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d Pringle, 540 U.S. at 370, 124 S.Ct. 795 (quotation marks and citations omitted). It is \u201cnot reducible to precise definition or quantification.\u201d Robinson, 451 Md. at 110, 152 A.3d 661 (quoting Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. 237, 133 S.Ct. 1050, 1055, 185 L.Ed.2d 61 (2013)). Rather, \u201c[p]robable cause is a fluid concept\u2014turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts\u2014not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d Pringle, 540 U.S. at 370-71, 124 S.Ct. 795 (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). \u201cA finding of probable cause requires less evidence than is necessary to sustain a convic tion, but more evidence than would merely arouse suspicion.\u201d Moulden, 212 Md.App. at 344, 69 A.3d 36 (quoting Haley, 398 Md. at 133, 919 A.2d 1200). In assessing \u201cwhether an officer had probable cause to arrest an individual, we examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide \u201cwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to\u2019 probable cause.\u201d Pringle, 540 U.S. at 371, 124 S.Ct. 795 (citation omitted).</p> <p id=\"b700-5\" pgmap=\"700(18) 701(141)\"> To determine whether the police here had probable cause to arrest appellant, we must first assess whether they had probable cause to believe that he was in possession of marijuana. Maryland Code (2016 Supp.) \u00a7 5-101(v) of the Criminal Law Article defines \u201cpossess\u201d as \u201cto exercise active or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d As we noted in Bowling, 227 Md.App. at 469, 134 A.3d 388, Maryland courts have consistently held that the odor of marijuana in a vehicle gives the police probable cause to believe that marijuana is present in the vehicle. Whether the odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle provides probable cause to believe that a passenger in the vehicle exercised dominion and control over the suspected marijuana, i.e. was in possession of illegal drugs, has been viewed as a different question, which has been the subject of much discussion. See Norman, 452 Md. at 412-415, 156 A.3d 940.</p> <p id=\"b701-4\" pgmap=\"701\">This case, however, does not involve the mere odor of marijuana. Here, not only did the officers smell marijuana in a vehicle in which appellant was one of three occupants, Detective Salmon testified that he could smell the strong odor of marijuana coming from appellant. Moreover, when appellant was asked if there was marijuana in the car, he \u201cfreely admitted\u201d that \u201cthey\u201d had been smoking marijuana, and he handed Detective Leventhall a cigar.</p> <p id=\"b701-5\" pgmap=\"701\">In situations where the police have more information connecting an occupant of a vehicle to the marijuana, and there is more than merely the odor of marijuana, courts have found probable cause to arrest. See U.S. v. Humphries, 372 F.3d 653, 659 (4th Cir. 2004) (although the odor of marijuana provides probable cause to believe that marijuana is present, additional factors must be present to localize its source to a person to justify an arrest); Johnson v. State, 142 Md.App. 172, 191, 788 A.2d 678 (holding that the odor of burnt marijuana from within a vehicle, along with the observation of a marijuana bud on the gearshift cover, within arm\u2019s reach of the passenger, provided probable cause to arrest the passenger), cert. denied, 369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b701-6\" pgmap=\"701(21) 702(23)\">Here, as indicated, the police not only smelled marijuana in the vehicle, they smelled it on appellant, and he admitted to smoking marijuana and handed the officer a cigar. Based on these circumstances, the police had probable cause to believe that appellant possessed marijuana.</p> <p id=\"b702-5\" pgmap=\"702\">Appellant notes, however, that the Maryland General Assembly decriminalized the possession of less than ten grams of marijuana and made it a civil offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He argues that, because the police could not tell the quantity of marijuana involved, the police did not have probable cause to believe that he was committing a crime.</p> <p id=\"b702-6\" pgmap=\"702(147) 703(60)\">Although the Maryland appellate courts have not yet addressed the issue of probable cause to arrest an individual for possession of marijuana following the decriminalization of possession of less than ten grams, the Court of Appeals and this Court have addressed the issue of probable cause to search a vehicle and held in that context that the police are not required to determine the amount of marijuana involved. In Robinson, 451 Md. at 125, 152 A.3d 661, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[djecriminalization is not the same as legalization,\u201d and \u201c[djespite the decriminalization of possession of less than ten grams of marijuana, possession of marijuana in any amount remains illegal in Maryland.\u201d Accord Bowling, 227 Md.App. at 470, 134 A.3d 388. The Court of Appeals noted that other jurisdictions that had addressed the issue had determined that, even though possession of a small amount of marijuana had been decriminalized, it still suggested criminal activity. Robinson, 451 Md. at 122-23, 152 A.3d 661. See, e.g., People v. Zuniga, 372 P.3d 1052, 1060 (Colo. 2016) (although possession of small amount of marijuana is legal, odor of marijuana is suggestive of criminal activity and relevant to the probable cause determination). The Court agreed with that analysis and stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b703-5\" pgmap=\"703\">Despite the decriminalization of possession of less than ten grams of marijuana, the odor of marijuana remains evidence of a crime. The odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle may be just as indicative of crimes such as the possession of more than ten grams of marijuana, possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, or the operation of a vehicle under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance, as it is of possession of less than ten grams of marijuana.</blockquote> <p id=\"AQj\" pgmap=\"703\">Robinson, 451 Md. at 133-34, 152 A.3d 661. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cthe odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle provides probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of a crime, and a law enforcement officer may search the vehicle under such circumstances.\u201d Id. at 134, 152 A.3d 661.</p> <p id=\"b703-6\" pgmap=\"703(134) 704(11)\">Although the issue in Robinson addressed probable cause to search a vehicle, the same analysis applies to probable cause to arrest for possession of marijuana. In State v. Perry, 292 Neb. 708, 874 N.W.2d 36 (2016), the Supreme Court of Nebraska specifically addressed this issue. In that ease, Perry was the driver of a vehicle that was stopped for a traffic violation. Id. at 39. Police detected an odor of burnt marijuana from within the vehicle and observed the passenger holding a plastic \u201cbaggie\u201d containing a \u201cwhite rocklike substance.\u201d Id. at 39-40. The passenger was arrested, and Perry was asked to step out the vehicle. Id. Perry was searched, and the police found ecstasy pills (a controlled substance) and what appeared to be crack cocaine on his person.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id. Perry\u2019s vehicle was then searched, and police recovered a marijuana cigarette and a firearm. Id.</p> <p id=\"b704-4\" pgmap=\"704\">The Supreme Court recognized that there was no probable cause to search a person exception to the warrant requirement, noting, however, that a person could be searched incident to arrest if the arrest was based on probable cause. Id. at 41, In addressing whether the officer had probable cause to believe that Perry was involved in a crime, the court stated that it had \u201cconsistently held that the odor of marijuana, alone or in combination with other factors, creates probable cause for an officer to infer that one or all of the occupants of a vehicle had committed the crime of possessing a controlled substance,\u201d providing probable cause to arrest. Id. at 45-46.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b704-5\" pgmap=\"704\">The court then addressed Perry\u2019s argument, similar to that made by appellant here, that, in light of Nebraska\u2019s decriminalization of less than one ounce of marijuana, \u201cthe mere smell of marijuana is not sufficient probable cause that a crime is being or has been committed and does not justify an arrest.\u201d Id. at 46. The court rejected that argument, explaining:</p> <blockquote id=\"AAh\" pgmap=\"704\">Objectively, the smell of burnt marijuana tells a reasonable officer that one or more persons in the vehicle recently possessed and used the drug. The officer need not know whether the amount possessed is more than 1 ounce in order to have probable cause to suspect criminal activity in the vehicle.</blockquote> <p id=\"b704-6\" pgmap=\"704\">Id. The court noted that \u201cprobable cause does not require evidence sufficient to convict\u2014only that which would lead to a reasonable inference of guilt.\u201d Id. at 47,</p> <p id=\"b705-4\" pgmap=\"705\"> We agree with the rationale expressed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska. Pursuant to that reasoning, and the reasoning set forth in Robinson, 451 Md. at 133-34, 152 A.3d 661, we hold that a police officer who has reason to believe that an individual is in possession of marijuana has probable cause to effectuate an arrest, even if the officer is unable to identify whether the amount possessed is more than 9.99 grams.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b705-5\" pgmap=\"705\">A requirement that the police need to be absolutely sure that the amount of marijuana involved is more than 9.99 grams before they have probable cause to arrest is inconsistent with the concept of probable cause, which requires only facts \u201csufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing\u201d that an individual is committing a crime. Moulden, 212 Md.App. at 344, 69 A.3d 36. Because the odor of marijuana \u201cmay be just as indicative of crimes such as possession of more than ten grams of marijuana\u201d or possession with the intent to distribute, Robinson, 451 Md. at 133, 152 A.3d 661, the odor of marijuana here, along with appellant\u2019s admission to smoking marijuana and handing the officer a cigar, gave the police probable cause to arrest appellant.</p> <p id=\"b705-6\" pgmap=\"705\">C.</p> <p id=\"b705-7\" pgmap=\"705\">Timing of Arrest</p> <p id=\"b705-8\" pgmap=\"705(20) 706(55)\"> Once the police had probable cause to arrest appellant, they could search him incident to that arrest. Stokeling v. State, 189 Md.App. 653, 670-71, 985 A.2d 175 (2009), cert. denied, 414 Md. 332, 995 A.2d 297 (2010). The purpose of the search incident to arrest exception is to seize weapons that might be used to harm the police officers and to preserve evidence that might otherwise be destroyed. Id. at 671, 985 A.2d 175.</p> <p id=\"b706-4\" pgmap=\"706\"> Appellant contends that the search in this case, which led to the discovery of the loaded handgun in his pants, was \u201cnot a search incident to arrest, because he had not been arrested.\u201d The State does not dispute that the formal arrest here occurred after the search, but it argues that this fact is irrelevant. We agree with the State.</p> <p id=\"b706-5\" pgmap=\"706\">The United States Supreme Court has made clear that a search may qualify as a search incident to arrest even if, sequentially, the search occurs prior to the arrest. Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980). In that case, the police had probable cause to arrest Rawlings when he admitted ownership of drugs found in a woman\u2019s purse. Id. at 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556. The police arrested Rawlings, but not until after they searched him and found $4,500 in cash and a knife. Id. at 101, 100 S.Ct. 2556. The Court upheld the search as a valid search incident to arrest because \u201cthe formal arrest followed quickly on the heels of the challenged search of petitioner\u2019s person,\u201d and it was not \u201cparticularly important that the search preceded the arrest rather than vice versa.\u201d Id. at 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556.</p> <p id=\"b706-6\" pgmap=\"706\">Maryland appellate courts have recognized this precedent. See, e.g., Lee v. State, 311 Md. 642, 668-69, 537 A.2d 235 (1988); Conboy, 155 Md.App. at 367-68, 843 A.2d 216. In addressing the requisite timing between the search and arrest, this Court stated that the \u201csearch incident to an arrest\u201d exception to the warrant requirement is applicable as long as the search is \u201cessentially contemporaneous\u201d with the arrest. Wilson v. State, 150 Md.App. 658, 673, 822 A.2d 1247 (2003). Accord Lee, 311 Md. at 668-69, 537 A.2d 235 (search incident to arrest not precluded where search occurred prior to arrest where \u201cevents occurred instantly, one after the other.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b707-6\" pgmap=\"707\">Here, the record is clear that the search was essentially contemporaneous\u201d with the arrest. Detective Salmon testified that he discovered the gun, and \u201cat this time,\u201d appellant was arrested.</p> <p id=\"b707-7\" pgmap=\"707\">Because the police had probable cause to arrest appellant for possession of marijuana, and the arrest occurred right after the search, the search was valid as a search incident to arrest. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p> <p id=\"b707-4\" pgmap=\"707\">II.</p> <p id=\"A69K\" pgmap=\"707\">Appellant contends that his separate sentences for his convictions of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun on his person and in a vehicle should be merged. The State agrees, and so do we. See Clark v. State, 218 Md.App. 230, 256, 96 A.3d 901 (2014) (under the rule of lenity, defendant\u2019s conviction for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun on or about his person merged with his conviction for wearing, carrying, or knowingly transporting a handgun in a vehicle where acts were part of single transaction.)</p> <p id=\"b707-5\" pgmap=\"707\">SENTENCE IMPOSED ON COUNT 6 (WEARING, CARRYING, OR TRANSPORTING A HANDGUN IN A VEHICLE) VACATED.

The sentence for possession of a firearm was to be served concurrently to the sentence imposed for an unrelated conviction. The sentences for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun were concurrent to each other, but consecutive to a sentence imposed for a second, unrelated conviction.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b692-12\" pgmap=\"692\">. The suppression hearing in this case proceeded simultaneously with the bench trial.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b693-8\" pgmap=\"693\">, The police later determined that the cigar contained 0.37 grams of marijuana.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"4\"> <p id=\"b693-9\" pgmap=\"693\">. The officer initially stated that the gun was recovered from the \u201cfront waist area\u201d of appellant\u2019s pants. On cross-examination, he agreed with defense counsel that the gun was \"down in his underwear,\u201d \"below his private parts,\u201d and he reached in and recovered the handgun.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"5\"> <p id=\"b694-9\" pgmap=\"694\">. Defense counsel also argued that the initial traffic stop was unlawful. The circuit court rejected that argument, and appellant does not, for good reason, challenge that ruling on appeal. See Muse v. State, 146 Md.App. 395, 405, 807 A.2d 113 (2002) (stop to investigate cracked windshield of automobile reasonable under the Fourth Amendment).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"6\"> <p id=\"b696-9\" pgmap=\"696\">. The Carroll doctrine exception, which allows the warrantless search of a vehicle based on probable cause, is based on \"the exigencies associated with the mobility of a vehicle, and the diminished expectation of privacy with regard to a vehicle.\" Fair v. State, 198 Md.App. 1, 11, 16 A.3d 211 (2011) (quoting State v. Cabral, 159 Md.App. 354, 372-73, 859 A.2d 285 (2004)).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"7\"> <p id=\"b699-8\" pgmap=\"699\">. We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s contention, made for the first time at oral argument, that it would be unfairly prejudicial to him for this Court to address this argument. The issued involved is a legal issue, and there was no ambiguity regarding the timing of the arrest. Detective Salmon testified that he recovered the handgun, and \"at this time,\u201d appellant was placed under arrest.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"8\"> <p id=\"b702-7\" pgmap=\"702\">. As the Court of Appeals explained in Robinson, 451 Md. at 97-98, 152 A.3d 661:</p> <blockquote id=\"b702-8\" pgmap=\"702\">Before October 1, 2014, under Maryland law, possession of less than ten grams of marijuana was a misdemeanor that carried a maximum penalty of ninety days of incarceration and a fine of $500. See 2014 Md. Laws. 1119 (Vol. II, Ch. 158, S.B. 364); Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2013 Supp.) \u00a7 5-601(c)(2)(ii). As of October 1, 2014, under Maryland law, possession of less than ten grams of marijuana became \"a civil offense\u201d that is punishable by participation in a drug education program, an assessment for substance abuse disorder, possible substance abuse treatment, and a fine, the amount of which depends on whether the violation is a first, second, or subsequent violation of the statute. See 2014 Md. Laws. 1119, 1124 (Vol. II, Ch. 158, S.B. 364); Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2014 Supp.) \u00a7 5-601(c)(2).</blockquote> <p id=\"b702-9\" pgmap=\"702\">Appellant was arrested on November 24, 2014, shortly after the law went into effect.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"9\"> <p id=\"b703-7\" pgmap=\"703\">. The suspected crack cocaine found on Perry was later determined to be a form of \"fake crack cocaine, known as gank.\" State v. Perry, 292 Neb. 708, 874 N.W.2d 36, 40 (2016).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"10\"> <p id=\"b704-7\" pgmap=\"704\">. The court subsequently stated, however, that the odor of marijuana was a factor in determining probable cause, finding that, based on the odor of burnt marijuana, the passenger's non-compliance with police orders, and the passenger\u2019s possession of a substance that appeared to be crack cocaine, \"[a] reasonable officer with knowledge of all of these facts could conclude both occupants of the vehicle had knowledge of the presence of marijuana and the suspected cocaine and exercised dominion over both[J\u201d Id. at 46-47. Here, as explained, supra, the odor of marijuana was only one factor giving the police probable cause to believe appellant was in possession of marijuana.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"11\"> <p id=\"b705-9\" pgmap=\"705\">. As the Court of Appeals noted in Robinson, 451 Md. at 127, 152 A.3d 661, the General Assembly did not intend, in decriminalizing possession of less than ten grams of marijuana, \"to stop what would be right now a lawful search incident to arrest.\u201d Id. (quoting Crim. L. Possession of Marijuana Civ. Offense: Hearing on S.B. 364 before the Sen. Jud. Comm., 2014 Reg. Sess. (Md. Apr. 1, 2014)). At the legislative hearing, Senator Zirkin, one of the sponsors of the legislation, responded to the committee\u2019s concern that decriminalization of possession of less than ten grams of marijuana would hamper the ability of police to conduct a search incident to arrest. He stated that, even if the police could not identify the quantity of marijuana when they saw \"a joint or just smell[ed] the odor of marijuana,\u201d \"the fact that there is still a criminal amount [in the statute] permits it [search incident to arrest] to go forward.\u201d Hearing on S.B. 364.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
