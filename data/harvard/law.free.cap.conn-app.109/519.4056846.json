We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In early 2001, the defendant was under investigation by the New Britain police department for illegal drug related activities. On March 13, 2001, New Britain police officers arrested Kevin Lockery, who was known by the police as a drug user, for a narcotics offense. In an effort to gain lenient treatment, Lockery identified the defendant as a drug dealer and provided the police with information about the defendant. At the direction of the police, Lockery called the defendant on a cellular telephone and arranged to purchase five bags of heroin at a specific location in New Britain. Shortly after the defendant received Lockery\u2019s call, the defendant left his residence and drove to that location. Lockery did not meet the defendant as arranged, and, after several minutes, the defendant began to drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Police officers stopped the defendant\u2019s automobile. A search of the defendant yielded twenty-five packets of heroin, $1025 and a cellular telephone that displayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>among received calls the telephone number from which Lockeiy had called the defendant to arrange the drug purchase. A subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s residence, pursuant to a warrant, yielded 168 packets of heroin, sixteen grams of marijuana, a twelve gauge shotgun, several shotgun shells and numerous other items typically used in the sale and distribution of illegal drugs. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the evidence did not support his conviction of possession of the narcotics seized from his residence and of criminal possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201c[A]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. . . . Furthermore, [i]n [our] process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>285 Conn. 447, 454, 939 A.2d 581 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">We now turn to the specific counts at issue, which related to the heroin and firearm seized from the defendant\u2019s residence. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who possesses or has under his control any quantity of any narcotic substance\u201d is subject to the criminal penalties set forth therein. In a substitute long form information, the state alleged in count four that \u201con or about March 14, 2001, in the area of 207 Beaver Street in the [c]ity of New Britain, the [defendant] did possess narcotics, to wit: heroin . . . .\u201d At trial, the defendant admitted that he had access to the residence but denied that he possessed or had under his control the heroin or firearm seized by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u201cPursuant to our rules of law, \u00a7 21a-279 (a) requires that the state . . . establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused <em>knew </em>of the character of the drag and its presence and exercised dominion and control over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>it. . . . Where . . . the contraband is not found on the defendant\u2019s person, the state must proceed on the alternate theory of constructive possession, that is, possession without direct physical contact. . . . Where the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the [place] where the narcotics are found, it may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference. . . . Further, to convict the defendant of this crime, the state had to prove that the defendant, and not some other person, possessed a substance that was of narcotic character with <em>knowledge </em>both of its narcotic character and the fact that he possessed it.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooden, </em>89 Conn. App. 307, 315-16, 873 A.2d 243, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 918, 919, 883 A.2d 1249 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal possession of a firearm . . . when such person possesses a firearm . . . and (1) has been convicted of a felony . . . .\u201d In count five of the state\u2019s substitute long form information, the state alleged that \u201con or about March 14, 2001, in the area of 207 Beaver Street in the [c]ity of New Britain, the [defendant] did possess a firearm, to wit: one Mossberg model # 590 [twelve] gauge [shotgun], and said [defendant] was previously convicted of a felony .. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201cPossess,\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2), \u201cmeans to have physical possession or otherwise to exercise dominion or control over tangible property . . . .\u201d \u201cThe essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead it is the act of being in a position of control coupled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>requisite mental intent. In our criminal statutes involving possession, this control must be exercised intentionally and with knowledge of the character of the controlled object.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 516, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986). To prove that the defendant constructively possessed the firearm, it was the state\u2019s burden to prove that he \u201cknowingly [had] the power and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and control over [the firearm].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 513. When, as here, the doctrine of nonexclusive possession also is implicated,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the state bears the burden of proving that there were \u201cincriminating statements or circumstances\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>258 Conn. 1, 7, 778 A.2d 186 (2001) (discussing application of nonexclusive possession doctrine in prosecution under \u00a7 53a-217 [a] [1]); other than the discovery of the firearm in the residence he shared with his girlfriend, tending to buttress the inference that he knew of the firearm\u2019s presence and had control over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The defendant does not claim that the evidence did not demonstrate that the police seized 168 packets of heroin and a firearm upon executing a search warrant at his residence on March 14, 2001. The essential element that is common to both counts at issue, and which the defendant challenges on appeal, relates to possession. Specifically, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he constructively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>possessed either the heroin or the firearm found at his residence because (1) he was not present in the residence at the time those items were seized, (2) he was not in exclusive possession of the residence, and (3) he presented testimony from Michele Gross, his girlfriend with whom he shared the residence at the time of the seizure, that the heroin and firearm belonged to Gross\u2019 friend, Renee Johnson, who was at the residence at the time those items were seized by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendant\u2019s arguments are unavailing. The jury had before it ample evidence from which it could infer that the defendant was a drug seller and that his apartment was integral to that criminal enterprise. The state presented evidence that prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest, a confidential informant had provided information to the police that the defendant was a heroin dealer. Police surveillance, both at the defendant\u2019s apartment and earlier at the residence of the defendant\u2019s mother, revealed conduct consistent with the sale of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The state presented evidence that on the date of his arrest, the defendant left his apartment after receiving Lockery\u2019s telephone call and drove directly to the location where Lockery had agreed to purchase heroin from him. Incident to a patdown search, the police discovered that the defendant had hidden in his buttocks twenty-five bags of heroin. Each packet had been stamped or labeled in red ink with what an officer described as a \u201csmiley face\u201d insignia. The police also discovered $1025 and a cellular telephone that displayed the telephone number from which Lockery had arranged the heroin purchase.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">When the police executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s apartment, they discovered 168 packets of heroin that were packaged and marked in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>identical to those found on the defendant. The drugs were found in a dresser drawer in a bedroom located in the rear of the apartment. In the bedroom, the police also found marijuana as well as a scale and packaging items that, as testimony revealed, were of the type commonly used in the sale and distribution of illegal drugs. In a nightstand near a bed, the police found six twelve gauge shotgun shells. In a closet near the front door to the apartment, the police found an operable twelve gauge shotgun. A police expert in the firearms field testified that the assault variety of shotgun shells found in the apartment commonly were used by SWAT teams and could immediately subdue human targets. The officer drew a connection between the defendant\u2019s sale of drugs and possession of the firearm, opining that the firearm had been used by the defendant to \u201cdefend himself, his home, his family and his drugs and the proceeds from the sale thereof.\u201d The state also presented evidence that in the bedroom, the police found a copy of the lease to the apartment, in the defendant\u2019s and Gross\u2019 names, as well as bank receipts in the defendant\u2019s name. The police also observed that the mailbox at the residence listed the defendant\u2019s name as well as that of Gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">This evidence, viewed as a whole, amply supported a finding that the defendant had known of the character and presence of the heroin found in his residence and that he had exercised dominion and control over the heroin. Also, it was entirely reasonable for the jury to view the firearm in conjunction with the ample evidence of the defendant\u2019s drug related activities and the large quantity of heroin that was stored in the residence and conclude that it was in his possession and integral to his criminal activities. There were ample incriminating circumstances, apart from the location from which the contraband was seized, to support a finding of constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>It is not persuasive that the defendant was not present in the apartment at the time of the search or that he was not in exclusive possession of the apartment. The defendant also relies on Gross\u2019 testimony, which was that the heroin and firearm belonged to Johnson, who died prior to trial. Certainly, the jury was free to accept as true Gross\u2019 testimony and, thus, find that the defendant did not constructively possess the heroin or firearm. In construing the evidence in an effort to support the jury\u2019s verdict, however, we must conclude that the jury, as was its prerogative, did not look favorably on Gross\u2019 testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>100 Conn. App. 337, 342, 917 A.2d 1008 (noting this court\u2019s deference to jury\u2019s credibility determinations), cert. denied, 282 Conn. 919, 925 A.2d 1102 (2007). For all of these reasons, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The defendant next claims that both the court and the prosecutor violated his constitutional rights<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by commenting on matters that were not in evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The following events underlie both aspects of the defendant\u2019s claim. During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor elicited testimony from Jerry Chrostowski, one of the police officers who participated in the investigation and the defendant\u2019s arrest. Chrostowski testified about the circumstances surrounding the arrest and, specifically, that police seized $1025 from the defendant incident to a patdown search. Chrostowski discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>police procedures for recording and storing evidence and testified that those procedures were followed in this case. Absent objection, the state introduced as a full exhibit a bag used by police to store items seized from the defendant and the contents of that bag, which consisted of a cellular telephone and a set of keys. The prosecutor then asked Chrostowski to explain one of the notations that appeared on the evidence bag. The following colloquy between the prosecutor and Chrostowski then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cQ. Could you read that [notation on the bag] please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cA. Per asset forfeiture judgment, $1025 given to Detective [Daniel] McAloon on September 27, 2002, for compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. What does asset forfeiture mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201cA. It\u2019s a tool used. When money is seized from suspected drug dealers, the money is taken through asset forfeiture and percentages are given back to the police department. Percentages go toward drug education and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\u201cQ. All right. So, is it\u2014could that be an explanation as to where the money is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">\u201cQ. All right. Because the money was previously in that envelope?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">\u201cA. Yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Later, during cross-examination of Chrostowski, the following colloquy between the defendant\u2019s attorney and Chrostowski occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-15\">\u201cQ. And you\u2019ve testified in a number of trials, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u201cQ. Okay. You also said that you seized over $1000 in cash?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. But that cash wasn\u2019t here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cQ. And, again, you\u2019ve testified in a number of trials. Is that odd that the cash isn\u2019t here today?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Following an objection, the defendant\u2019s attorney rephrased the question, asking: \u201c[H]ave you ever testified at a trial where the state hadn\u2019t produced money that was seized?\u201d The prosecutor objected, and the court addressed the objection outside of the jury\u2019s presence. The defendant\u2019s attorney claimed that the line of inquiry was proper, stating: \u201c[T]he state has a burden, under the best evidence rule, to put forth the best evidence. Now, whether or not [the prosecutor\u2019s] office is responsible for this money being seized and disposed of in an in rem hearing is, I think, beside the point. I think it\u2019s the state of Connecticut versus [the defendant]. The state of Connecticut is responsible for this. [The defendant is being] prosecuted by the office of the state\u2019s attorney and, even though the state\u2019s attorney had no fault in this money disappearing, the state of Connecticut did.\u201d The prosecutor responded that the inquiry improperly suggested that the office of the state\u2019s attorney was somehow at fault, that it had lost the seized cash. Upon inquiry by the court, the prosecutor represented that following an earlier proceeding, the cash had been the subject of \u201can asset forfeiture\u201d by order of the court. The prosecutor stated that this action had occurred against her expressed wishes and that it \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney expressed his concern that there was no way for the jury to determine whether the currency at issue was real or counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The court asked the defendant\u2019s attorney to specify what he wanted to ask Chrostowski concerning the cash. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unfair question to ask a seasoned police officer whether it\u2019s odd not to have proceeds .... from the supposed drug dealer present at a trial.\u201d The court questioned whether any response to this question was relevant to the issues before the jury. The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that he was not alleging any type of misconduct on the state\u2019s part but expressed that the jury had a right to examine the cash. He stated: \u201cI think I have the right to point out [to the jury] that the state would have liked to have produced [the cash] but didn\u2019t, and whatever they draw from that they draw from that. I don\u2019t make arguments with regard to negative inferences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The court stated: \u201c[Wje\u2019re all in agreement that the money . . . was forfeited pursuant to the asset forfeiture law pursuant to an order of a Superior Court judge, which was not sought. That order was not sought by the police, nor was it sought by the state. In fact, if I understand it correctly, the state\u2019s attorney specifically noted, at an earlier proceeding, that the money should not be destroyed or should not be diverted to the asset forfeiture.\u201d The court also stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think . . . it\u2019s fair to leave ... in the minds of the jury the possible conclusion that something wrongfully occurred here either because of misconduct by the police or misconduct by the state\u2019s attorney. Now, if you are going to be asking questions about why the money isn\u2019t here, I think the state is going to argue that it\u2019s entitled to bring out the fact that there was a previous trial and the defendant was convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">After the court raised the subject of the defendant\u2019s prior trial, during which the cash was presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the state, the defendant\u2019s attorney represented that the defendant was willing to raise the subject of the earlier trial before the jury. The court stated: \u201cI\u2019m not going to inject an issue like a prior conviction and reversal and whatever other issues are going to arise from that. I\u2019m not going to inject that in this case. If you intend to bring out or argue that the money isn\u2019t here, I\u2019m going to give the jury some type of instruction which tells them that the money\u2014in a previous legal proceeding, the money was forfeited in an asset forfeiture. That\u2019s already before the jury based on the note on [the evidence bag presented by the state]. And there was no misconduct by any party. But the money will not be in the courtroom today.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney reiterated that he did not want to raise the issue of any wrongdoing by the office of the state\u2019s attorney. He stated: \u201cI truly believe [that] if the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had been in possession of the money, it would be here today. . . . That was my only comment with regard to this, Your Honor. And whatever language Your Honor instructs . . . the jury, we\u2019ll have to be comfortable with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The court stated that it would \u201cpropose some language\u201d and then stated: \u201cWhat I will instruct the jury is to this effect: In prior legal proceedings, the $1025 at issue here was ordered forfeited by the court in an asset forfeiture program. Although this forfeiture action means that the actual money, the bills themselves, will not be available in these proceedings here, you are hereby instructed that the forfeiture was conducted in accordance with law, and no party, not the state nor the defendant nor the New Britain police department acted inappropriately or engaged in any misconduct. You will be able to argue what you claim is your point to the jury, that they can\u2019t feel, see and have this money in their hands, which is [what] you tell me is the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>that you think the questioning is appropriate. And I\u2019m telling them they will not have the bills.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney immediately replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The court then continued, \u201cSo, you can argue your point, but I think in this way the jury also knows that any other inference which they might be inclined to draw is not appropriate.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with making that statement on closing arguments.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney did not object to the court\u2019s ruling or its proposed instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The court then summoned the jury to the courtroom and instructed the jury as follows: \u201cBefore the cross-examination continues, I just want to give you an instruction with regard to the $1025, which the witness testified about during direct and cross-examination. And the questions that were asked just prior to the break concerning the fact that that sum of money is not in the evidence bag [in] which the witness testified it was placed. In this regard, you\u2019re instructed as follows: in prior legal proceedings, the $1025 had been ordered forfeited by the court to an asset forfeiture program. Although the forfeiture action means that the actual money itself, that is, the bills themselves, are not available in these proceedings to be placed into evidence, yo\u00fa are hereby instructed that the forfeiture action was conducted in accordance with law. And no party, not the state\u2019s attorney nor the defendant nor the New Britain police department acted inappropriately or engaged in any misconduct whatsoever.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney did not object to the court\u2019s instruction to the jury and, thereafter, continued his cross-examination of Chrostowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">During closing argument, the prosecutor made the following comments: \u201cNow, just before I even forget this, it was mentioned that there was $1025 found on [the defendant\u2019s] person. That was not presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>you here in court, and if you can please remember an instruction or information that the court gave you regarding the $1025 that that was the subject of a prior legal proceeding, before we were here, and it went to a program called the asset forfeiture program [and] that a judge had ordered that. If that judge had not ordered that money to the asset forfeiture fund, I would have had it in court here to show you.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney did not object to this argument either at the time it was made or at the conclusion of the state\u2019s closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The defendant claims that the court violated his constitutional rights when it instructed the jury as it did concerning the cash. The defendant argues: \u201cIt is the jury and not the court that is the arbiter of the facts. . . . Had the court properly let the jury decide whether the evidence was legitimately missing or did not exist in the first place, or whether it was illegitimately missing, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cash was not recovered from [him]. . . . Had the issue of the missing cash been properly left to the jury to decide as a factual matter, it could . . . have concluded that [he] was not a drug dealer because he did not have a large amount of cash when arrested.\u201d The defendant acknowledges that his trial counsel did not object to the court\u2019s instruction and seeks review of this claim under the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The state argues that <em>Golding </em>review is inappropriate because the defendant\u2019s trial counsel agreed in substance with the court\u2019s instruction. Specifically, the state relies on counsel\u2019s statements that the cash had been forfeited through no fault of the office of the state\u2019s attorney and that the defendant did not want to raise any issue of misconduct concerning the cash. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>argues that the defendant\u2019s claim is at odds with the position that he took at trial and, thus, that he waived any objection to the instruction. The relevant inquiry, however, is not limited to whether the defendant\u2019s attorney agreed in substance with the court\u2019s instruction. Resolving the reviewability issue raised by the state also requires that we determine whether the defendant\u2019s attorney waived any objection to the court\u2019s delivering the instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Our review of the extended colloquy between the court, the defendant\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor reveals that the defendant\u2019s attorney plainly expressed his understanding that the cash, which had been present at the defendant\u2019s earlier trial, had been the subject of a forfeiture and that this had occurred through no fault of the prosecutor or the office of the state\u2019s attorney. The defendant\u2019s attorney indicated that he wanted the jury\u2019s attention drawn to the fact that the cash was not available for the jury\u2019s review. During the course of the discussion and once the court ruled that it would not permit the defense to present evidence related to the prior trial or the proceeding related to the forfeiture of the cash, the court indicated that it would formulate an instruction to address the defendant\u2019s concern. The court read aloud its proposed instruction and afforded the defendant\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor an opportunity to voice any objections. Neither party voiced any concerns, and the defendant\u2019s attorney affirmatively expressed his consent to the court\u2019s proposed instruction. Thereafter, the court delivered the instruction absent objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">This is not a situation in which counsel merely failed to object to a ruling. The court engaged in a dialogue with counsel as to how to resolve the issue raised by the defendant\u2019s attorney, thereby inviting the parties to express any concerns as to its proposed resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the issue. The defendant\u2019s counsel, acting on the defendant\u2019s behalf, had an immediate duty to object to the court\u2019s proposed instruction if he deemed it improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>64 Conn. App. 340, 352, 780 A.2d 209 (discussing role of defense counsel), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 909, 782 A.2d 1250 (2001). Under these circumstances, by failing to object and by responding affirmatively when the court read aloud its proposed instruction, the defendant\u2019s attorney indicated his agreement with the court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury as it did. By acquiescing in the ruling, the defendant has waived any claim that the court\u2019s instruction was improper. It is fundamentally unfair to both the state and the court, as well inconsistent with the position he took at trial, for the defendant to raise this claim on appeal. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>269 Conn. 442, 452, 849 A.2d 375 (2004) (holding that party\u2019s conduct represented acquiescence to court\u2019s rulings and constituted waiver of claim on appeal); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>106 Conn. App. 414, 428, 942 A.2d 440 (2008) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>104 Conn. App. 85, 88 n.4, 932 A.2d 443 (2007) (same). The defendant\u2019s recourse to <em>Golding </em>review, therefore, is unavailing; the claim fails under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>283 Conn. 352, 360, 927 A.2d 825 (2007) (\u201c \u2018unpreserved, waived claims, fail under the third prong of <em>Golding\u2019 </em>\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricator, </em>281 Conn. 469, 482, 915 A.2d 872 (2007) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>84 Conn. App. 351, 383 n.22, 854 A.2d 13 (\u201cOur appellate courts frequently have stated that a party may not pursue one course of action at trial for tactical reasons and later on appeal argue that the path he rejected should now be open to him. . . . <em>Golding </em>is not intended to give an appellant a second bite at the apple.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The defendant also claims that prosecutorial impropriety of constitutional magnitude occurred during closing argument when the prosecutor referred to the court\u2019s instruction concerning the disposition of the cash found on the defendant and commented that had the cash not been forfeited, she would have presented it as evidence. The defendant claims: \u201c[T]he prosecutor made herself a witness and personally vouched for alleged facts not in evidence by telling the jury that had a judge not. . . transferred the cash to the asset forfeiture program (an alleged fact that was not in evidence), she would have brought the cash to court to show the jury (also an alleged fact not in evidence).\u201d The defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments. Although unpreserved, the claim is nonetheless reviewable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 33, 917 A.2d 978 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u201cIn analyzing claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step process. . . . First, we must determine whether any impropriety in fact occurred; second, we must examine whether that impropriety, or the cumulative effect of multiple improprieties, deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>283 Conn. 748, 760, 931 A.2d 198 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201c[A] prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must conf\u00edne himself to the evidence in the record. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject of proper closing argument. ... A prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence. . . . The fifth amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process encompasses the requirement that a conviction be supported by sufficient proof. Due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen. . . . [0]ne accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of the evidence introduced at trial, and not on grounds of official suspicion, indictment, continued custody, or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>John B., </em>102 Conn. App. 453, 463-64, 925 A.2d 1235, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 906, 931 A.2d 267 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s comments, we recall the evidence presented by the state concerning the discovery of the $1025 and the subsequent forfeiture of the cash after it was in police custody. We also recall the court\u2019s specific instruction to the jury concerning the cash and the circumstances surrounding its absence from the trial. On the basis of this information before the jury, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments fell within the realm of fair argument. We know of no authority, and the defendant does not bring any to our attention, that forbids a prosecutor from referring in argument to a court\u2019s instruction concerning the evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s comment that she would have presented the cash in evidence if it had not been forfeited was fairly related to the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the comments were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly excluded from evidence a letter written by Lockery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Outside of the presence of the jury, the defendant\u2019s attorney made an offer of proof with regard to a letter that the defense asserted was written by Lockery. The handwritten letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cTo whom it may concern</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cI Kevin Lockery am writing this statement on my own free will due to the fact am scared of the New Britain police and I know for a fact that there is a innocent man in jail. Daniel Diaz did not sell me drugs. The police Jerry told me that if I went along with his plan to take BB<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of[f] the streets, he would help me and give me dope. Officer Jerry gave me dope and I did se[e] the police in [possession] of heroin before they even went to arrest BB it was the same heroin that was in the trial. The bags were stam[p]ed with a smil[e]y face. Every time I received dope from Jerry it was the same bags stamped with a smile. BB was [introduced] to me by a mutual friend and not of any drugs deals am scared and fear for my fife and my family\u2019s life not by BB but by the same people who are suppose to protect me as a citizen. I testified in court against Daniel Diaz BB because the police said I had no choice and they gave me heroin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201cAm doing this by my own free will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">At the top of the letter appears the date March 15, 2002. At the conclusion of the letter appears the signature of \u201cKevin Lockery\u201d in two places. Under these signatures appears the signature of \u201cAndrew Pirog, N.P.,\u201d next to the date March 18, 2002. The date \u201c1-31-2006\u201d appears immediately beneath Pirog\u2019s signature, and a raised notarial seal appears near the signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The defense called Pirog to testify in an attempt to authenticate the writing. Pirog testified that he was a notary public in good standing. Pirog testified that his signature appeared on the letter followed by the date his commission expired, January 31, 2006. Pirog did not recall any of the circumstances surrounding his notarizing the letter, whether it had been written in his presence or the person or persons who had presented it to him to be notarized. He testified, however, that it was his practice in notarizing documents to require a person or persons appearing before him to present identification, typically a valid Connecticut operator\u2019s license, and to sign in his presence the document to be notarized. Pirog testified that the area where Lockery\u2019s signature appeared, immediately above Pirog\u2019s signature on a handwritten line, was the area \u201cwhere the individual who showed [him] identification signed the paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that through the letter and Pirog\u2019s testimony, he had authenticated the letter. The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the letter fell within an exception to the hearsay rule because it was a statement against penal interest by Lockery. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the letter was written by Lockery shortly after the defendant\u2019s first trial concluded in early 2002 and that Lockeiy revealed in the letter that he had committed perjury when he testified against the defendant at that trial. To demonstrate that Lockery was unavailable, the defendant\u2019s attorney represented that he did not have a last known address for Lockery, that the New Britain police department actively was looking for Lockery to serve an outstanding warrant on him for failure to appear and that Lockery was \u201cnot in the department of correction.\u201d He further represented that Lockery was nomadic and that he could not hire an investigator to search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>for Lockery without having a starting point for such a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">With regard to the trustworthiness of the statement, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued that it was demonstrated by the fact that Lockery made disparaging statements concerning the New Britain police department that were against his penal interest. He argued: \u201c[Lockery] made the statement to a person in New Britain and, at the time the statement was made, [the defendant] was incarcerated. He was making a statement against the New Britain police department, and he gave that statement to [the defendant\u2019s] family, knowing that [it] was going to be published. . . . And, again, for somebody . . . who is at least ... a passive participant in the drug trade of New Britain, you can\u2019t expect him to throw the New Britain police department under the bus casually. He knows that once this gets out, he\u2019s never going to be able to get deals like he did before. There\u2019s no way around that. And by giving [it] to my Ghent\u2019s family, he knows this ... is going somewhere.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that Lockery\u2019s statement was corroborated by the fact that his testimony in the defendant\u2019s first trial was inconsistent with that of the police officers who testified at the first trial and at the present trial. Additionally, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued that there was a difference between the heroin found on the defendant\u2019s person and that found in his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The prosecutor objected to the admissibility of the letter on grounds of both authentication and the hearsay rule. With regard to the latter ground, she argued that the statement was not against Lockery\u2019s penal interest, that Lockery\u2019s testimony in the first trial did not differ in any material respects from that of the police officers who testified, that the statement was not corroborated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>in any relevant manner so as to demonstrate its trustworthiness and that the defense had not demonstrated, in the first instance, that Lockery was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The court ruled that the statement was inadmissible on several grounds. The court concluded that the defendant had not satisfied his burden of authenticating the letter. The court also ruled, regardless of the authentication issue, that the letter violated the rule against hearsay. First, the court concluded that counsel\u2019s representations concerning Lockery\u2019s unavailability did not constitute sufficient proof that Lockery was, in fact, unavailable. Second, the court concluded that the letter did not constitute a statement against Lockery\u2019s penal interest because none of the statements therein tended to subject Lockery to criminal liability for any crimes but were in the nature of a recantation of Lockery\u2019s prior testimony. Third, the court concluded that there had not been a sufficient showing that the statement was trustworthy. In this regard, the court commented that the statement was made approximately one year following the criminal conduct at issue. The court also deemed it noteworthy that it did not have any information as to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, such as why the declarant made the statement, whether he wrote it himself, whether he brought it to be notarized on his own and for what party did the declarant make the statement. The court also noted that the two signatures on the letter, purporting to be those of Lockery, differed in their appearance. The court further reasoned that a statement that exculpated an accused person was especially suspect and that the defendant had not presented any evidence to corroborate the statements at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The defendant now challenges every aspect of the court\u2019s ruling in an effort to persuade this court that the letter was authenticated properly and that it constituted a statement against penal interest and, thus, fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>under an exception to the hearsay rule. Leaving aside the authentication issue, we conclude that the court properly determined that the letter did not fall within the hearsay exception relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cTo the extent a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the [Connecticut] Code of Evidence, [a reviewing court\u2019s] standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. They require determinations about which reasonable minds may not differ; there is no \u2018judgment call\u2019 by the trial court, and the trial court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion. ... In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218-19, 926 A.2d 633 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The parties do not dispute that the letter constituted hearsay; see Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-1 (3); and was inadmissible unless otherwise proven admissible by an applicable rule of law. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-2. Section 8-6 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, a statement against penal interest is not excluded by the hearsay rule. Section 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence defines a \u201cstatement against penal interest\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>follows: \u201cA trustworthy statement against penal interest that, at the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. In determining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the court shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">As a preliminary matter, we address the issue of whether the defendant met his burden, as the proponent of the evidence, of demonstrating that Lockery was unavailable. \u201c[0]ur Supreme Court [has] recognized five of the most common situations in which a declarant will be deemed unavailable to testify. The situation most relevant to the present case is one in which the declarant is absent from the hearing and the proponent of his statement has been unable to procure his attendance <em>... by process or other reasonable means. </em>... In interpreting reasonable means, [our Supreme Court has] held that the proponent must exercise due diligence and, at a minimum, make a good faith effort to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance. . . . The trial court has broad discretion in determining whether the proponent has shown a declarant to be unavailable. Only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion will this court set aside on appeal rulings on evidentiary matters. . . . [I]t is within the discretion of the trial court to accept or to reject the proponent\u2019s representations regarding the unavailability of a declarant and the trial court\u2019s ruling will generally not be disturbed unless the court has abused its discretion. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u201c[D]ue diligence to procure the attendance of the absent witness [is] ... an essential . . . predicate of unavailability. ... To take advantage of the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>exceptions requiring unavailability, the proponent must show a good faith, genuine effort to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means. . . . This showing necessarily requires substantial diligence. In determining whether the proponent of the declaration has satisfied this burden of making reasonable efforts, the court must consider what steps were taken to secure the presence of the witness and the timing of efforts to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance. ... A proponent\u2019s burden is to demonstrate a diligent and reasonable effort, not to do everything conceivable, to secure the witness\u2019 presence.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>107 Conn. App. 85, 89-90, 943 A.2d 1159, cert. denied, 287 Conn. 914, 950 A.2d 1291 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney made representations concerning his efforts to locate Lockery. On the basis of these representations, the court reasonably could conclude that the defendant\u2019s attorney had made some efforts to locate Lockery but that these efforts were limited to speaking with the police, conducting some investigation of state prison records and making inquiries, to an unknown extent, at the defendant\u2019s last known address.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no basis in evidence to refute the court\u2019s determination that these efforts were not sufficiently exhaustive. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not state how much time he spent in those efforts, who, if anyone, he spoke with concerning the defendant or who, if anyone, he spoke with about the feasibility or availability of other means to locate Lockery. He did not present any evidence concerning his efforts or evidence to support a finding that any additional efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>were futile. On this record, we conclude that the court\u2019s determination that the defendant had not made a genuine and good faith effort to procure Lockery\u2019s attendance reflected a sound exercise of discretion. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 107 Conn. App. 90-92 (holding that evidence concerning efforts made to locate witness reflected due diligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We also will address whether the court properly determined that the statement was not trustworthy. The court stated that the timing of the statement, approximately one year after the defendant\u2019s arrest and two months following the defendant\u2019s first trial, weighed against its trustworthiness. \u201cIn general, declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time where a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>254 Conn. 309, 317, 757 A.2d 542 (2000). The court properly deemed it significant that the defendant had not presented any evidence concerning the person to whom the statement was made. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 70, 890 A.2d 474 (noting that relationship between declarant and person to whom statement made significant consideration in evaluating trustworthiness), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>268 Conn. 351, 369-70, 844 A.2d 191 (2004) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 699, 523 A.2d 451 (1987) (noting that \u201c[acknowledgement of criminal activity is generally made only to confidants or to persons in whom the declarant imposes trust\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Also, the court relied on its determination that the defense had not presented any persuasive evidence to corroborate the statements. Contrary to the arguments of the defendant\u2019s attorney, the statements do not constitute Lockeiy\u2019s admission of any specific crime but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>rather, portray the police as wrongdoers and the defendant, generally, as an innocent man. Most importantly, however, having presented no evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements at issue, the- defendant faced an almost insurmountable hurdle in attempting to demonstrate that the statement was trustworthy. \u201c[Our Supreme Court] has held that, it is not necessary that the trial court find that all of the factors support the trustworthiness of the statement. The trial court should consider all of the factors and determine whether the totality of the circumstances supports the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Camacho, </em>282 Conn. 328, 358-59, 924 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 956, 128 S. Ct. 388, 169 L. Ed. 2d 273 (2007). Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s determination that the statement was not trustworthy reflected a sound exercise of discretion and that the court\u2019s ruling that the statement did not fall within the hearsay exception relied on by the defendant was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Prior to the start of the trial, the defendant moved to suppress, as the fruit of unlawful seizures, the contraband seized from his person and from his residence. Following a hearing, the court denied the motion. The defendant now challenges that ruling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em>262 Conn. 179, 184, 811 A.2d 223 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In an oral ruling, the court set forth the following factual findings and legal conclusions concerning the search of the defendant\u2019s person. \u201cAfter Mr. Lockery had been arrested for his own possession of heroin, he indicated to [Officer Christopher] Brody . . . that he . . . could order up drugs from the person he knew as B.B. Actually, according to Officer Brody\u2019s testimony, Mr. Lockery also offered to order up and provide the cooperation against the person from whom he had just recently bought the narcotics for which he has been apprehended. So, actually, Mr. Lockery offered his cooperation with regard not only to this defendant, whose nickname was B.B., but also to the person who had sold Lockery the drugs with which he had been caught ....</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\u201cNow, when the police heard Lockery mention . . . that he could order drugs from the person known to him as B.B., this reference to B.B. did not fall on deaf ears. The name B.B., far from being foreign to police, was known by New Britain police [as] a nickname for [the defendant], and Officer Chrostowski had been investigating [the defendant\u2019s] involvement in narcotic activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">\u201cIn fact, [Chrostowski] had already, prior to the events of March 13, taken steps to surveil the location and had already received from other sources significant information concerning [the defendant\u2019s] narcotics involvement. Also, the police knew about Mr. Lockery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>himself [as] someone who had long been involved in the drug culture more as a buyer than as a seller .... [Lockery] was a person that police could reasonably conclude had knowledge of drug activity and would be able to reliably inform on those who were in the business of selling narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u201cNow, with all that, it was agreed that Lockery would place a call to [the defendant]. Now, it\u2019s important to note that Lockery had the telephone number himself. And prior to Lockery placing the call [which was made] on a police officer\u2019s cellular telephone . . . Chrostowski set up surveillance outside the [New Britain apartment] where he knew [the defendant] resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u201cNow, Officer Brody then heard Lockery make the call on Brody\u2019s telephone. And while [the defendant\u2019s attorney] is correct that Officer Brody only heard Lockery\u2019s side of the conversation and not the other side of the conversation, he did hear . . . Lockery engage the person on the other end in a drug purchase. And as Brody listened to Lockery\u2019s side of the conversation and after the call was completed, it was clear to Brody from what he heard . . . that a drug transaction had just been set up, that it would occur in minutes [and] that [the defendant] was going to deliver the drugs to a location in a parking lot across the street from [a restaurant in New Britain]. He also knew that that was [a] location in relative [ly] close proximity to where [the defendant] lived. So, there was quite a bit of predictive information that was received by Brody from the nature of the telephone call that was made by Lockery. This information was communicated to Chrostowski, who was outside [the defendant\u2019s] apartment . . . and within minutes of Chrostowski learning that this call had been placed, Chrostowski observed [the defendant] leave his apartment alone ... some time after 9 p.m. on March 13. He watches [the defendant] leave the apartment, get into the car\u2014and I omitted that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Lockery had indicated [that] he could call [the defendant], that Chrostowski went to what he knew to be [the defendant\u2019s] address . . . and confirmfed] that the car that Chrostowski had previously [observed] in his surveillance and investigation of [the defendant] . . . was there in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\u201cSo, here it is nine or ten at night. The defendant comes out of his house, gets into his car and drives straight from his home, stopping nowhere until he pulls into this parking lot [across the street from a restaurant and] adjacent to a business that I don\u2019t believe was even operating. The defendant sits alone for five to ten minutes in a parking lot of . . . almost an abandoned business and then leaves after sitting there for ten minutes. Now, the police then stop the defendant a short distance away after he leaves the parking lot. The defendant ... is alone in [his automobile]. There is a stop made with lights and sirens by the uniformed officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\u201cI\u2019m also going to mention . . . one other fact . . . that can be considered in my determination of probable cause. Even if one were to assume that there\u2019s only one reasonable suspicion to justify this stop. The police approaching the car . . . asked the defendant [where he was coming from] and he said, I\u2019m coming from . . . Malikowski Circle, which was untrue because Officer Chrostowski had observed him coming not from Malikowski Circle, but directly and without interruption from Beaver Street. All of that information, in the court\u2019s view, the fact that all of the predictive information came true, the information the police had beforehand, in the court\u2019s view, adds up to probable cause to arrest the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Responding to arguments advanced by the defendant during the hearing, the court stated: \u201cTo the claim that Lockeiy may have faked that he was making a call, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>[it] just doesn\u2019t add up, to me. It\u2019s not a reasonable interpretation of what took place. Lockery, by all accounts, is now in [the] custody of the New Britain police. He\u2019s trying to get consideration for himself .... The idea that he\u2019s going to now fake a telephone call on the police cell phone, yet, he\u2019s going to pretend this with the police sitting right opposite him . . . and then send the police on what could be a wild goose chase, it just doesn\u2019t interfere\u2014the fact that you can come up with an innocent explanation [for the defendant\u2019s conduct] does not defeat probable cause. And . . . the idea that it just so happened that Lockery knew that the defendant\u2019s normal schedule would put him in the parking lot, it just doesn\u2019t add up, either. The idea that the defendant had a normal schedule that on certain nights he would drive his car to an abandoned parking lot, sit for ten minutes and then leave, it just doesn\u2019t mean that probable cause doesn\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u201cWith regard to the fact that [Lockery] was a first time informant, I agree. He was not a registered confidential informant. He had not previously given information to police. But the law recognizes that first time informants can be used, and the fact that they don\u2019t have a . . . track record does not mean, in and of itself, that their information can\u2019t be used.\u201d The court discussed relevant case law and observed that factors relevant to its consideration were corroboration by the police of the information provided, declarations against penal interest by the informant and the informant\u2019s reputation and prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The court continued: \u201cCorroboration goes without saying. The police staked out the location. They watched [the defendant] leave his house minutes after the telephone call was made to him by Lockery. He went directly to this . . . location in the parking lot, stopping nowhere in between. I think that\u2019s the kind of corroboration that the courts are looking for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>that goes hand in hand with the fact that . . . Chrostowski had already been involved in investigating [the defendant] in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cI also . . . believe that [Lockery] did make [a statement against his] penal interest. . . . [He made] statements against his penal interest in the sense that he was admitting to the police that he could order up drugs from [the defendant] or he could order up drugs from [another] seller .... And I think this broader view of what is a declaration against penal interest is appropriate. He is giving police information of that nature and, thereby, implicating himself in active dmg dealing. He\u2019s also making a statement against penal interest in this sense. He is giving information to police, which, if police later prove was false, he could be exposed . . . to prosecution for making a false statement, interfering with police or the like.\u201d The court rejected the claim, advanced by the defense, that Lockery was untrustworthy because he provided information to police in an attempt to gain lenient treatment for his own wrongdoing. The court stated that \u201cone who knows the police are already in a position to charge him with a serious crime will not likely undertake to divert the police down blind alleys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The court continued: \u201cThe third factor is whether or not the police know the individual named and whether or not he could be a suspect. And, in this case, they knew the defendant . . . and knew that he had already been subject to investigation for dealing in drugs, which is another factor, which, in the court\u2019s view, proves the reliability of the information given by Lockery.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\u201cSo, the court finds that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. Because of that, the police could make a full search incident to his arrest, and that search would have been permitted under law even if it preceded in time the instance where the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>formally placed under arrest. . . . [A]s a search incident to arrest, the search can actually precede the arrest. So, I find probable cause and, therefore, the search [of the defendant] could be a full search and the discovery of the drugs was [legally] appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u201cI will add [that] [e]ven if probable cause did not exist to arrest the defendant, reasonable suspicion certainly did, and the police were justified in stopping the defendant\u2019s car on reasonable suspicion and, thereafter, the discoveiy of the drugs was proper [during] a valid patdown [search] under the plain feel doctrine.\u201d The court then addressed and rejected the defendant\u2019s claims that (1) even if a stop of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was legally permissible, a patdown search of the defendant was not and (2) even if a patdown search was legally permissible, the discovery of the drugs was beyond the scope of such a valid search. The court stated: \u201c[U]nder these circumstances, the court finds that even if there wasn\u2019t probable cause that justified a full search, there was reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant and to pat him down and [that] the drugs were, thereafter, found appropriately during the pat-down search.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied the motion to suppress insofar as it was related to the heroin seized from the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The defendant reiterates several arguments that he raised before the court in advancing his claim that the police lacked probable cause to stop his automobile. The defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s factual determinations. He argues, instead, that police did not observe anything in his operation of the automobile, which was registered to him, that gave rise to a reasonable and articulable suspicion that there was contraband in the automobile. The defendant also relies on the fact that police did not find a weapon on his person or in the automobile. The defendant also argues that any information provided by Lockery could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>supported a reasonable and articulable suspicion because he was an untested informant, there was no showing that any information provided by him was reliable, there was no showing that Lockery had a sound basis for the information he provided to police and the police neither verified nor attempted to verily the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">As set forth previously, the court concluded that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant when the police pursued and stopped his automobile. The parties do not challenge the court\u2019s determination that the defendant was seized at that time. In their briefs, the parties have analyzed the issue in terms of whether an investigatory stop was lawful, and we will, likewise, analyze the legality of the seizure on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u201c[W]hen considering the validity of a . . . stop, our threshold inquiry is twofold. . . . First, we must determine at what point, if any, did the encounter between [the police officer] and the defendant constitute an investigatory stop or seizure. . . . Next, [i]f we conclude that there was such a seizure, we must then determine whether [the police officer] possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion at the time the seizure occurred. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\u201cThe federal law of search and seizure in this area is well settled. The fourth amendment to the federal constitution, made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, provides in relevant part that [t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . . . Certain seizures are reasonable under the fourth amendment even in the absence of probable cause if there is a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>crime. . . . When a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists, the detaining officer may conduct an investigative stop of the suspect in order to confirm or dispel his suspicions. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cIn determining whether a detention is justified in a given case, a court must consider if, relying on the whole picture, the detaining officers had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity. When reviewing the legality of a stop, a court must examine the specific information available to the police officer at the time of the initial intrusion and any rational inferences to be derived therefrom.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>279 Conn. 493, 516-17, 903 A.2d 169 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The court thoroughly considered the relevant information known to the police concerning the defendant. Its analysis of these factors was legally and logically correct and amply supported its conclusion that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity at the time of the stop. Prior to the search, the police gathered information, both from an informant and as a result of their investigation of the defendant, concerning the defendant\u2019s drug related activities. The police also received information from Lockery that led to surveillance at the time in question. This surveillance corroborated Lockery\u2019s information; the officers observed firsthand the defendant\u2019s own suspicious conduct just prior to the stop. Lockery\u2019s information was corroborated by police investigation of the defendant, Lockery implicated himself in criminal activity and was well-known to the police as a person involved in the drug trade. <em>See State v. Tulli, </em>14 Conn. App. 356, 359, 541 A.2d 515 (discussing factors useful in evaluating reliability of informant\u2019s tip), cert. denied, 208 Conn. 809, 545 A.2d 1105 (1988). The fact that Lockery was not anonymous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>but in police custody, also supported a finding of reliability. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>286 Conn. 427, 438, 944 A.2d 297 (2008). It is also noteworthy that Lockery was face to face with the police and that he claimed to have had prior drug dealings with the defendant. See id. Further, Lockery provided information concerning the defendant that he garnered through a telephone conversation that occurred in the presence of one or more police officers. Thus, the police had a basis to believe that Lockery was passing on firsthand information to them, and they had a reasonable and articulable suspicion sufficient to detain the defendant. See id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Orellana, </em>89 Conn. App. 71, 82, 872 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 910, 876 A.2d 1202 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly denied the motion to suppress insofar as it related to the search of his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The court found that shortly after detaining and arresting the defendant, Chrostowski and New Britain police Sergeant William Steck went to the defendant\u2019s residence, which was nearby. Upon knocking at the door to the defendant\u2019s apartment, the officers spoke with Gross. They informed Gross that the defendant had been arrested and that the police were in the process of obtaining a warrant to search the residence. \u201cThe police then conducted what they described as a protective sweep of the apartment, lasting less than two minutes, and they observed in plain view in the apartment on top of a dresser in the bedroom a packet of heroin, which bore the same logo, two smiling faces ... as the narcotics that were taken from [the defendant] . . . .\u201d The parties disagreed over the constitutional propriety of this entry, but the court concluded that it did not need to resolve that issue in ruling on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The officers subsequently conducted a search of the residence pursuant to a warrant. The court concluded that regardless of whether the initial search of the residence was proper, the subsequent search of the apartment and seizure of items from the apartment pursuant to a warrant was valid under the independent source doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court concluded that the warrant was supported by probable cause derived from sources that were independent of anything observed by the police during the initial entry. Thus, the court concluded that probable cause existed in the search warrant application without considering the information in the application related to the initial entry. The court also concluded that the decision to apply for the warrant was unrelated to any information learned by police during the initial entry. The court found that \u201cthe decision to get the warrant was not prompted by the observation of the drugs in any way, shape or form . . . [a]nd there is no basis to conclude that the police were not going to get the warrant [before they initially entered the residence].</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We carefully have reviewed the claim briefed by the defendant. He argues that his right against unreasonable search and seizure was violated by the initial entry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>search of his apartment by Chrostowski and Steck. He argues that this entry and search occurred without consent or probable cause and was not justified in law. He also posits that as a result of this initial search, \u201c[the] police found the drugs that led to the issuance of [the] search warrant,\u201d and, thus, the contraband found in the apartment should have been suppressed as the fruit of police illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">As set forth previously, the court assumed for purposes of its analysis that the initial search of the apartment was illegal and determined, in fact and law, that the contraband seized pursuant to a warrant was untainted by any illegality related to the earlier search. The defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s thorough analysis under the independent source doctrine but, instead, focuses exclusively on the legality of the initial search. We need not review the issue raised because in light of the court\u2019s analysis, it is irrelevant to the judgment from which the defendant appeals. See, e.g., <em>Ingels </em>v. <em>Saldana, </em>103 Conn. App. 724, 728-29, 930 A.2d 774 (2007). Even were we to agree that the initial search was illegal, our determination would be of no benefit to the defendant. He has not challenged the basis of the court\u2019s judgment, and, thus, we do not have occasion to review the actual basis on which the court\u2019s judgment rests. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>282 Conn. 709, 715, 924 A.2d 809 (2007) (appellate court may not decide appeal on ground parties have neither raised nor briefed).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of one count of possession of narcotics with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent.

Our Supreme Court reversed that judgment; <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>274 Conn. 818, 878 A.2d 1078 (2005); and the present appeal follows the new trial that was ordered on remand by our Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\"> At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal with regard to all counts of the state\u2019s case.

When the doctrine applies, an instruction [concerning the doctrine] focuses the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent to possess, precluding it from inferring possession from the mere fact that the defendant, along with others, occupied or had access to the premises wherein the contraband was found.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>258 Conn. 1, 7-8, 778 A.2d 186 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\"> In part IV, we address the defendant\u2019s claims concerning the legality of the search of his person and his residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> Although the defendant refers to his rights to a fair trial and to a jury trial under the federal and state constitutions, he has not provided a separate analysis of this claim under the state constitution or asserted, as relevant to this claim or otherwise, that the state constitution affords him greater constitutional safeguards than its federal counterpart.
