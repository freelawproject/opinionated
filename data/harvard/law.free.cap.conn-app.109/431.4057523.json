On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court made four improper evidentiary rulings and should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the sexual assault conviction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Between July 5, 2003, and July 4, 2004, the victim, J, spent one to three mornings each week at the house of her grandmother and her grandfather, the defendant, while her parents worked. During this time, J was approximately four years old. Several times, while J was at the defendant\u2019s home, the defendant and J engaged in a \u201cgame called break-it.\u201d The game occurred both in the defendant\u2019s bedroom and in the basement, and required that J take off her shirt, pants and underwear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defendant would remove his shirt and pants and would then take his \u201cpeanut,\u201d which J described as \u201clong\u201d with a \u201ccircle\u201d and a \u201chole,\u201d out \u201cfrom a little hole in his pajama pants.\u201d Then J would lie on top of the defendant or he would lie on top of her and they would both start \u201cjumping on each other.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant \u201cput his peanut in [J\u2019s] tolin\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and got \u201cwhite gooey stuff\u2019 inside of J\u2019s genitalia. After the game was over, the defendant cleaned J\u2019s genitalia with a towel and told her to keep the game a secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">At trial, both J and the defendant testified. Additionally, a significant amount of testimony was provided through the admission of the videotaped diagnostic and forensic interview that was conducted at the children\u2019s advocacy center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center (advocacy center) after J complained about the sexual assault. At the trial\u2019s conclusion, the jury found the defendant guilty on both charges, and the court sentenced him to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a total effective term of twenty years, suspended after ten years, with twenty years of probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting the examining pediatrician\u2019s report into evidence. Specifically, the defendant claims that the pediatrician\u2019s report contained a statement that impermissibly vouched for J\u2019s credibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>At trial, Frederick K. Berrien, a physician, testified for the state that, prior to conducting J\u2019s physical examination, he had read a report, prepared by Annabella Agudelo, summarizing J\u2019s interview at the advocacy center. Berrien relied on Agudelo\u2019s report for J\u2019s medical history and to tailor his examination to J\u2019s allegations. Although the physical examination of J was normal, Berrien testified that a lack of physical findings does not disprove sexual abuse. Berrien explained that since the assault allegedly took place approximately one month before the examination, there would have been time for damage to J\u2019s genitalia to heal. Furthermore, Berrien testified that penetration of the genitalia can occur without entrance as far as the hymen. In the course of Berrien\u2019s testimony, the state moved to admit a copy of the report of J\u2019s physical examination pursuant to the business record exception to the rule against hearsay. The state established, and the defendant did not dispute, that Berrien prepared the report, that it was prepared in the ordinary course of business and that it was completed at or near the time of the examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the following line in the report: \u201cA normal exam can be found with sexual contact as revealed in the interview.\u201d The defendant claimed that this sentence amounted to an illegal opinion on an ultimate issue in the case and impermissibly vouched for J\u2019s credibility. The report was admitted over the defendant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . The trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>103 Conn. App. 383, 401, 930 A.2d 27, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 928, 934 A.2d 244 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u201c[A]n expert witness may not testify regarding the credibility of a particular victim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>257 Conn. 797, 806, 778 A.2d 159 (2001). Our Supreme Court has \u201cfound expert testimony stating that a victim\u2019s behavior was generally consistent with that of a victim of sexual or physical abuse to be admissible, and ha[s] distinguished such statements from expert testimony providing an opinion as to whether a particular victim had in fact suffered sexual abuse. . . . [E]ven indirect assertions by an expert witness regarding the ultimate issue in a case can serve inappropriately to validate the truthfulness of a victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>275 Conn. 624, 635, 881 A.2d 1005 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Here, the defendant asserts that the phrase, \u201cas revealed in the interview,\u201d constitutes Berrien\u2019s opinion that J\u2019s interview statements alleging sexual assault were true. In making his argument, the defendant asserts that the phrase at issue in Berrien\u2019s report falls into the category of expert opinions deemed to be improper bolstering in <em>Iban C. </em>and <em>Grenier. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The statement in question here is distinctly different from the expert testimony found inadmissible in <em>Iban C. </em>and <em>Grenier. </em>In <em>Iban C., </em>the defendant objected to the written report and the direct testimony of the state\u2019s expert witness, a pediatrician, who diagnosed the victim in that case as having been sexually abused despite a normal physical examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 632-33. On appeal, the Supreme Court found that the testimony under scrutiny usurped the role of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>jury by impermissibly bolstering the victim\u2019s credibility. Id., 636-37. In this case, unlike in <em>Iban C., </em>Berrien did not opine that J had been sexually abused; rather, he made the general statement that a normal physical examination is not necessarily inconsistent with sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><em>Grenier </em>is likewise distinguishable from the case at hand. In <em>Grenier, </em>a counselor\u2019s testimony that the victim\u2019s \u201c \u2018statements were very credible\u2019 \u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 802; was inadmissible because it amounted to \u201ca direct assertion that validated the truthfulness of [the victim\u2019s] testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 806. Additionally, a clinical psychologist\u2019s testimony that she treated the victim for \u201c \u2018the trauma of the abuse that [she] experienced\u2019 \u201d; id., 804; was inadmissible because it \u201cconstituted an indirect assertion that validated the truthfulness of [the victim\u2019s] testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 806. In this case, Berrien did not directly or indirectly validate the truthfulness of J\u2019s testimony. He simply indicated that a normal examination does not belie the occurrence of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We agree with the court that the segment of the report at issue did not improperly bolster J\u2019s credibility. The statement at issue in Berrien\u2019s report was merely a caveat to his conclusion that J\u2019s physical examination was normal. It did not validate or credit the statements J made in her interview with Agudelo. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Berrien\u2019s report.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Next, the defendant claims that the court improperly permitted the state to bolster J\u2019s credibility on direct examination. Specifically, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s question, \u201cDid you know you were supposed to tell the truth to [Agudelo]?\u201d and J\u2019s affirmative response vouched for her credibility before the defendant had put her credibility at issue on cross-examination. We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Because the defendant is challenging an evidentiary ruling, our standard of review is whether the court abused its discretion in permitting the testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>supra, 103 Conn. App. 401. Evidence that bolsters a witness\u2019 credibility before it has come under attack is prohibited. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (a); C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (4th Ed. 2008) \u00a7 6.27.2 (a), p. 342 (discussing prohibition of \u201c[e]vidence accrediting or supporting a witness\u2019s honesty or integrity [before] the witness\u2019s credibility has first been attacked\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The following additional facts from the trial are pertinent to this issue. At the beginning of the direct examination of J, the state asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201cQ. Do you remember going to a hospital and talking to a lady named [Agudelo]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\u201cQ. And did you tell her things that happened also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201cQ. And the things that you told her, were they true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The defendant objected to the final question and answer on the ground that the state was improperly attempting to bolster the witness\u2019 credibility. The court agreed to strike the question and answer from the record. Thereafter, as the direct examination of J continued, she related many of the details of the alleged assault; however, some details differed, in particular regarding the issue of penetration, from statements she had made during her videotaped interview with Agudelo at the advocacy center. The following exchange, which is the heart of this claim, ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201cQ. And you talked to [Agudelo] about what happened. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cA. Yes. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cQ. And when you were\u2014when you were telling [Agudelo] those things, did you know that you were supposed to tell the truth then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. It improperly seeks to bolster the credibility of an unimpeached witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No. I\u2019m seeking to lay a foundation in the terms of a six year old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">\u201cQ. Did you know that you were supposed to tell the truth to [Agudelo]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">The court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to ask J whether she knew she was supposed to tell the truth during her interview with Agudelo because it is reasonable to conclude that the state was attempting to lay a proper foundation for admissibility of the videotape. Shortly after the court permitted the question at issue, the state concluded its direct examination of J and informed the court that it was going to seek to introduce portions of the videotaped interview under the Whelan<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and past recollection recorded exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Both of these exceptions to the rule against hearsay require the moving party to show that the out-of-court statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>reliable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that the state\u2019s question was not intended to bolster the veracity of J but, instead, was part of the state\u2019s effort to lay the requisite foundation for admissibility of the videotaped interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Furthermore, the state\u2019s question about whether J knew she was supposed to tell the truth during the interview is readily distinguishable from the impermissible and previously stricken question of whether she was, in fact, telling the truth. The latter is an improper invasion of the province of the jury, as it seeks to bolster J\u2019s credibility before it has come under attack. In contrast, the former seeks to discern the state of mind of the witness during the interview as a prelude to the admissibility of the videotaped interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting portions of the videotaped interview of J pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). Specifically, the defendant claims that the state failed to prove that J had personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>knowledge of the contents of the videotape, and, therefore, her availability for cross-examination was meaningless. The defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim. After J reported being sexually assaulted by the defendant, she provided a detailed account of the assaults in a videotaped interview with Agudelo at the advocacy center. J related many of the details of the sexual assaults in her testimony at trial; however, when asked, \u201c[D]id his front private go inside or outside your front private?\u201d she replied, \u201cOutside.\u201d Additionally, when asked, \u201cDid his front private go in your front private?\u201d J responded, \u201cNo.\u201d These assertions were inconsistent with the details J provided in the videotaped interview. As a result, the state sought to admit segments of the interview that were inconsistent with her trial testimony under the <em>Whelan </em>exception to the rule against hearsay. The defendant objected, arguing that because J could not recall the substance of her prior videotaped statements, she had no personal knowledge of them; and her lack of memory would deny the defendant meaningful cross-examination. The court overruled the objection and permitted segments of the interview into evidence pursuant to <em>Whelan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>is a matter within the . . . discretion of the trial court. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. . . . On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 56, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>207, 217-18, 926 A.2d 633 (2007) (en banc) (adopting \u201chybrid\u201d approach to review of hearsay claims and concluding that \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law ... for an abuse of discretion\u201d). In <em>Whelan, </em>our Supreme Court adopted \u201ca rule allowing the substantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cAs with any statement that is admitted into evidence under a hearsay exception, a statement that satisfies the <em>Whelan </em>criteria may or may not be true in fact. But, as with any other statement that qualifies under a hearsay exception, it nevertheless is admissible to establish the truth of the matter asserted because it falls within a class of hearsay evidence that has been deemed sufficiently trustworthy to merit such treatment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>72 Conn. App. 804, 810, 806 A.2d 1072 (2002), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 923, 823 A.2d 1216 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The defendant does not contest that the admitted portions of the videotaped interview were inconsistent with J\u2019s trial testimony or that the process of videotaping satisfied the writing requirement. Rather, the defendant asserts that the witness lacked personal knowledge at the time of trial of the accuracy of her videotaped statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u201cIn evaluating whether a declarant has personal knowledge of the facts contained within a prior inconsistent statement, we look to the statement itself. If the statement itself indicates that the basis of the information contained in that statement is the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge, that is sufficient to satisfy the criteria of personal knowledge established by Whelan.\u201d Id., 812. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>In this case, through an interview, J related events that happened directly to her. This interview was captured on a videotape. The jury was shown the actual tape. Despite the obvious demonstration that J had personal knowledge of the facts that she related in the videotaped interview, the defendant argues that her inability to remember some of the interview at trial rendered her lacking in personal knowledge. Whether a witness repudiates a prior inconsistent statement has no bearing on the reliability of such statement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 21, 629 A.2d 386 (1993). Furthermore, \u201c[allowing a party to circumvent the exception to the hearsay rule established by <em>Whelan </em>merely by repudiating the foundation for his knowledge when that foundation is an element of the statement itself would eviscerate the <em>Whelan </em>exception, potentially leaving no statement admissible under the pertinent rule.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s claim that J\u2019s faulty memory deprived him of meaningful cross-examination, we are unpersuaded. J was in court, testified as to her ability to distinguish between the truth and a he, and was available to respond to the defendant\u2019s questions. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 561, 108 S. Ct. 838, 98 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1988). The defendant was able to avail himself fully of the opportunity to cross-examine J about the inconsistencies between her testimony and the videotaped interview. Her inability at trial to remember certain details about the interview does not render her unavailable for cross-examination. \u201c[Meaningless cross-examination] is not produced by the witness\u2019 assertion of memory loss\u2014which ... is often the very result sought to be produced by cross-examination, and can be effective in destroying the force of the prior statement.\u201d Id., 562; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 81. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting segments of the videotaped interview pursuant to <em>Whelan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The defendant also asserts that the entire videotaped interview was admitted improperly by the court under the medical treatment exception to the rule against hearsay. The defendant contends that because J was not suffering from any physical symptoms, the state failed to prove that J knew that she was providing a statement for the purpose of medical treatment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s claim. After J reported the alleged sexual abuse to her parents, her father consulted with members of his church about her complaints. Thereafter, the police received a report of the sexual abuse and sent an officer and an investigator from the department of children and families to speak with J. On May 24, 2004, J was brought to the advocacy center for a diagnostic and forensic interview with the social worker, Agudelo.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> J was shown the interview room as well as an adjoining room, and she was told that there would be people, including a police officer, in the adjoining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">After the interview, Agudelo made recommendations to J\u2019s family concerning J\u2019s future care and provided details of the interview for the examining pediatrician, Berrien. Berrien testified that the purpose of his examination was to determine if J needed further medical treatment. In addition, he relied on the details provided by Agudelo in order to understand J\u2019s medical history and to inform his physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">At trial, portions of the videotaped interview were admitted under the <em>Whelan </em>exception to the rule against hearsay, but the state sought to introduce the entire videotape pursuant to the medical treatment exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>to the rule against hearsay. To this end, the state elicited testimony from J that she knew that the interview with Agudelo occurred at a hospital and that she thought Agudelo was a physician. J testified that she had been examined by two physicians, Agudelo and a man, who both \u201cchecked me [to see] if there was anything wrong.\u201d The defendant objected, inter alia, to the state\u2019s offer on the ground that the state had failed to prove that the statements were made by J for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. The court admitted the entire videotape over the defendant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">To the extent that a court admits evidence relying on an interpretation of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, our review is plenary; but here, where the court\u2019s decision was an application of the facts to the law, we afford the trial court\u2019s ruling deference and will only reverse for an abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 218-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Section 8-3 (5) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence (2000) contains an exception to the hearsay rule for \u201c[a] statement made for purposes of obtaining medical treatment or advice pertaining thereto and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof, insofar as reasonably pertinent to the medical treatment or advice.\u201d \u201cRegardless of whether the statements were made to a physician, they must all have been made in furtherance of medical treatment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>285 Conn. 162, 186, 939 A.2d 1105, cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1085, 128 S. Ct. 2885, 171 L. Ed. 2d 822 (2008). In fact, the medical treatment exception is not limited to physicians and has been extended to include social workers, as long as the social worker is found to have been \u201cacting within the chain of medical care . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>260 Conn. 1, 10, 792 A.2d 823 (2002). \u201cAlthough [t]he medical treatment exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the hearsay rule requires that the statements be both pertinent to treatment and motivated by a desire for treatment ... in cases involving juveniles, our cases have permitted this requirement to be satisfied inferentially.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Telford, </em>108 Conn.

If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u201cMoreover, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . .

On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.

In fact, on recross-examination she confirmed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>defendant ejaculated in her and that she thought she felt something inside of her genitalia. Furthermore, to the extent that the jury chose to believe J\u2019s videotaped statements rather than her testimony at trial, \u201c[i]t is well settled that [w]hether [a witness\u2019] testimony [is] believable [is] a question solely for the jury.

As to the former, the dissent asserts that the written report by Berrien states: \u201cA normal exam can be found with sexual contact <em>as revealed in the interview </em>[with Agudelo],\u201d followed by the notation, \u201c(Emphasis added.).\u201d The dissent fails to acknowledge that the bracketed phrase, \u201c[with Agudelo],\u201d is a creation solely of the dissent and can be found nowhere in the record. This point is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>significant because the addition of the phrase, \u201c[with Agudelo],\u201d lends support to the defendant\u2019s claim that Berrien\u2019s comment was not a general statement that a normal examination can be consistent with sexual abuse as revealed in the interview that usually precedes his physical examination but, rather, that Berrien was speaking, not in general terms, but specifically about his interview of the victim in this case and was affirming that sexual abuse did, in fact, take place in this instance. The inclusion of the comment, \u201c[with Agudelo],\u201d within the quotation from Berrien\u2019s report effectively changes the witness\u2019 testimony from a general statement to a specific one. That conflation is not supported by the record. Our task on appeal is not to create the record at trial but, rather, to make legal and just determinations on the basis of the record as it comes to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">A variation of this problem arises in footnote three of the dissent in which Judge Berdon comments: \u201cIt is obvious that because the state relied on this interview to prosecute the defendant, and Agudelo\u2019s employer, the advocacy center, was financed in part by the office of the chief state\u2019s attorney, Agudelo acted, at least in part, in the role of a prosecutor in the interview.\u201d Aside from the obvious impediment that we ought not to be engaging in fact-finding on review, the record is devoid of any support for this factual leap. To the contrary, the record reveals that Agudelo, as a clinical child interview specialist, acted as part of an interdisciplinary team to interview the victim and that her purpose in doing so was to \u201cgather as much accurate information as possible to make decisions for medical and other mental health services.\u201d Additionally, the record is clear that the victim, who was aware that she was in the hospital when the interview took place, thought Agudelo was a physician and was there to help her. Although our colleague may be troubled by the notion of a multidisciplinary team approach to the interviewing of a child, one that may have both criminal investigative as well as medical care purposes, the record in this case lends no support to the notion that everyone who participates in such an interview must be an agent of the prosecution simply because this team approach is financially supported, in part, by the prosecutorial arm of the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\"> The state argues that this claim was inadequately briefed and that we should decline to afford it review.

Although the medical treatment exception explicitly requires that the interviewee have the puipose of obtaining medical treatment, we also believe it is implicit in this rule that the interviewer must also have the purpose of providing medical treatment. In this instance, regardless of whatever other purposes this interview protocol may have served, it met the parameters of the exception; J went to the advocacy center for medical treatment, and Agudelo interviewed her to assess her health care needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b476-18\"> We note that Bemen, the examining physician, testified that J\u2019s normal physical examination and intact hymen did not disprove the possibility of sexual abuse.

In <em>Aponte, </em>the court concluded that the defendant was deprived of due process because the prosecutor gave the complaining witness a doll prior to testifying and because the court limited the defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine the witness about this impropriety. Id., 737.

But we are a nation of laws, and a jury must decide the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of legally admissible evidence. In such cases, it is the duty of this court to rule on claimed errors even when its decision would result in a new trial. In the present case, I believe that the trial court committed error, that the defendant\u2019s conviction of sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child should be reversed and that a new trial should be ordered on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">After the allegations with respect to the sexual abuse of J came to the attention of the East Hartford police department, a police officer brought J to the Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center\u2019s children\u2019s advocacy center (advocacy center), a program that is partially funded by the office of the chief state\u2019s attorney. At the advocacy center, J was interviewed by Annabella Agudelo, a \u201cclinical child interview specialist.\u201d The police officer recorded and observed the interview through a one-way mirror. Although J, in her courtroom testimony, denied penetration, a necessary element of sexual assault in the first degree pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> during this interview, in response to leading questions by Agudelo,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a statement was elicited indicating that there was penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Shortly thereafter, Frederick K. Berrien, a pediatrician and the director of the advocacy center, examined J. At trial, Berrien testified that his examination of J revealed no abnormal findings, and the state offered into evidence his written report, which included the following statements under the heading of \u201cAssessment\u201d: \u201cThe anogenital exam on [J] is normal. A normal exam can be found with sexual contact <em>as revealed in the interview </em>[with Agudelo].\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant timely objected to the admission of the italicized portion of that statement and sought its redaction, arguing that the language improperly vouched for J\u2019s credibility. In fact, during the limited argument that counsel was forced to make in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>presence of the jury,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> counsel was able to refer the court to a Connecticut Supreme Court case that supported his position.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>I recognize that the \u201ctrial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . The trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. . . .

He wrote of the \u201csexual contact as revealed in the interview\u201d with Agudelo, which, at the very least, was an indirect assertion that J was telling the truth in her interview and should be believed. Our Supreme Court has \u201cnoted that even <em>indirect assertions </em>by an expert witness regarding the ultimate issue in a case can serve inappropriately to validate the truthfulness of a victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 635; see also <em>State </em>v. Grenier, 257 Conn. 797, 806, 778 A.2d 159 (2001). The error of allowing this statement into evidence was compounded by the fact that it was in writing and also was made available to the jury as a full exhibit during its deliberations. To make matters worse, the court forced defense counsel to argue his objection regarding the admissibility of Berrien\u2019s statement without first excusing the jury. This must have underscored for the jury its importance in this case. The error of bolstering the credibility of J\u2019s statements made during the interview was further exacerbated when the court permitted the state to elicit from J, over the timely objection of the defendant, that she knew that she had to tell the truth to Agudelo during the interview.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>It is clear that \u201c[w]hen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ritrovato, 280 Conn. 36, 56, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006). This requirement is satisfied by showing that \u201cit is more probable than not that the erroneous evidentiary ruling affected the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Sawyer, 279 Conn. 331, 353, 904 A.2d 101 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">I come to the conclusion that the error was harmful because of the admission of Berrien\u2019s report into evidence as a full exhibit, because the court required defense counsel to argue the statement\u2019s admissibility in the presence of the jury and because the court allowed the state to elicit from J that she knew that she was required to tell the truth during the interview. Furthermore, because there was no physical evidence of sexual assault or abuse and the only evidence was from J, the case must be characterized as \u201cnot particularly strong, especially when the victim is a minor.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 57. There was no curative instruction given by the court. Under these circumstances, the admission of Berrien\u2019s statement was harmful. Just as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>supra, 57, because \u201cthere was no independent physical evidence of the assault [and abuse] and no other witnesses to corroborate [the victim\u2019s] testimony, her credibility was crucial to successful prosecution of the case.\u201d Berrien\u2019s suggestion that there was \u201csexual contact as revealed in the interview [with Agudelo]\u201d must have played a significant role in the jury\u2019s determination of guilt. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and order a new trial on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> See footnote 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Its meaning is limited to persons not married to each other. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, or fellatio and does not require emission of semen. Penetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> J was given a stuffed animal by Agudelo immediately before the interview commenced, and J was allowed to keep it. It is obvious that because the state relied on this interview to prosecute the defendant, and Agudelo\u2019s employer, the advocacy center, was financed in part by the office of the chief state\u2019s attorney, Agudelo acted, at least in part, in the role of a prosecutor in the interview. \u201c[T]he principle is well established that serious prosecutorial misconduct, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s intention, may so pollute a criminal prosecution as to require a new trial, even without regard to prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 251, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S.

First, Berrien referred clearly to \u201cthe interview.\u201d He did not state \u201cin an interview.\u201d I hope that we can all agree that J was interviewed only once at the advocacy center and that this interview was conducted by Agudelo. Second, it is clearly indicated to the reader that I added \u201cwith Agudelo\u201d by placing that phrase in brackets. No matter how the phrase is read, Berrien was in essence writing that J\u2019s statement in the interview was credible. By doing so, Berrien overstepped the limits imposed on expert testimony and invaded the fact-finding province of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\"> The defendant does not raise the claim that the court abused its discretion by failing to excuse the jury from the courtroom, notwithstanding that the court\u2019s actions requiring counsel to argue his reasons in front of the jury that such statement be redacted was patently unreasonable and constituted a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> The following colloquy occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Berrien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Dr. Berrien, did you perform\u2014I mean, did you write a report in connection with your physical examination of the child in court\u2019s exhibit one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Prepare a report, is what I was trying to say.
