Wysocki and Old Lot No. 30, LLC (Old Lot),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the judgments in favor of the defendant, the town of Ellington, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 tax appeals, brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the assessment of their properties for the grand list of October 1, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>plaintiffs claim that the court improperly (1) concluded that they had failed to raise adequately a claim of equitable estoppel and (2) determined that the municipal tax assessor (assessor) properly had assessed the subject properties according to their highest and best use or, in the alternative, that procedural irregularities relating to the Ellington board of assessment appeals\u2019 (board) decision to increase the assessor\u2019s assessment rendered the increase illegal. We agree with the plaintiffs only as to their claim regarding the validity of the board\u2019s decision to increase the assessment. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The record reveals the following undisputed factual and procedural history. In 1991, Wysocki, who owned approximately thirty-four acres consisting of four contiguous parcels of 10.7, 8.08, 4.83 and 13.63 acres, filed an application with the assessor seeking to classify these four parcels as forest land. In accordance with the provisions of the property tax assessment scheme set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107athroughl2-107e, on September 5, 1991, the state forester designated the parcels as forest land. As a result of this designation, the assessor classified the land as forest land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 20, 1999, Wysocki transferred the 13.63 acre parcel to Old Lot, a limited liability company that he had formed. The conveyance was not recorded immediately in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Ellington land records. Instead, Wysocki sought advice from the assessor as to whether he could transfer the 13.63 acre parcel to Old Lot without compromising the favorable tax treatment that he was receiving by virtue of the forest land classification. In response to Wysocki\u2019s inquiry, on January 12, 2000, the assessor sent a letter to Wysocki erroneously informing him that the transfer of the 13.63 acre parcel would have no adverse effect on the parcel\u2019s forest land designation, provided that Wysocki was the sole member of Old Lot. Wysocki subsequently recorded the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On January 12, 2000, Wysocki filed an application with the assessor seeking to maintain the 13.63 acre parcel\u2019s forest land classification, listing the owner of the parcel as Old Lot. The assessor approved the application. On January 31, 2000, Wysocki and the assessor submitted an amended application to the department of environmental protection, division of forestry, seeking to designate the 13.63 acre parcel as forest land and to amend the existing forest land certificate to reflect the change of ownership. On February 22, 2000, the division of forestry informed Wysocki that a parcel must be at least twenty-five acres to qualify as forest land under General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 12-107b (b) and that because neither Wysocki nor Old Lot individually owned twenty-five acres, the forest land designation would be cancelled on April 25, 2000, unless further documentation was provided to the state forester demonstrating that cancellation was not warranted. On May 1,2000, the state forester cancelled the forest land designation as to all four parcels of land.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record reveals that the plaintiffs did not appeal from the state forester\u2019s decision as they were permitted to do under General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The assessor subsequently issued a certificate of declassification, and the properties were assessed according to their highest and best use for the grand list of October 1, 2000. The plaintiffs appealed to the board from the assessor\u2019s decision to declassify the properties as forest land for the 2000 grand list. A hearing was scheduled for March 17, 2001. The board rendered a decision in which it further increased the assessment for the 13.63 acre parcel. The board made no changes to the assessor\u2019s assessments for the 10.7, 8.08 and 4.83 acre parcels but determined that the 13.63 acre parcel, which had frontage on Elderberry Lane, a roadway, was taxable as a building lot</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-119 claiming, on various grounds, that the imposition of the tax was illegal. After a one day trial, the court issued a memorandum of decision dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals on January 12, 2006. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly concluded that they had failed to set forth adequately a claim of equitable estoppel. They argue that they raised a claim of equitable estoppel at trial by arguing that they had relied on representations made by the assessor that the transfer of the 13.63 acre parcel to Old Lot would not jeopardize the designation of the four parcels as forest land. We conclude that the record is inadequate to review the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The following additional procedural history is relevant to our review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. In its February 9, 2006 memorandum of decision, in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reargue, the court determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the plaintiffs had abandoned any claim of equitable estoppel. The court concluded that \u201c[e]ven if an estoppel claim had been sufficiently raised, it would not have had a controlling effect on [the] court\u2019s original decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Our Supreme Court recently has reiterated the fundamental point that \u201c [i]t is incumbent upon the [appellant] to take the necessary steps to sustain [his] burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. . . . Our role is not to guess at possibilities . . . but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the appellant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>285 Conn. 716, 731-32, 941 A.2d 309 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In the present case, it is unclear from the court\u2019s February 9, 2006 memorandum of decision why it concluded that even if the plaintiffs adequately had raised a claim of equitable estoppel, the assertion of that claim would not have had an effect on the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the plaintiffs should have filed a motion for articulation to preserve an adequate record for review. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-10 and 66-5. \u201cIt is well established that [a]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification. . . . [P]roper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, 285 Conn. 732-33. Because the plaintiffs failed to seek an articulation from the court, we are unable to determine the legal or factual basis for the court\u2019s decisions. The record, therefore, is not adequate to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly failed to conclude that the assessment of the subject parcels, according to their highest and best use, was manifestly excessive and illegal under \u00a7 12-119. Alternatively, the plaintiffs argue that even if the assessor properly declassified the properties, procedural irregularities rendered the board\u2019s decision to increase the assessment illegal. We agree as to the latter claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u201cThe principles that govern a complaint filed pursuant to \u00a7 12-119 are not in dispute. In contrast to \u00a7 12-117a . . . which allows a taxpayer to challenge the assessor\u2019s valuation of his property, \u00a7 12-119 allows a taxpayer to bring a claim that the tax was imposed by a town that had no authority to tax the subject property, or that the assessment was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of [the real] property .... Our case law makes clear that a claim that an assessment is excessive is not enough to support an action under this statute. Instead, \u00a7 12-119 requires an allegation that something more than mere valuation is at issue.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tyler\u2019s Cove Assn., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Middlebury, </em>44 Conn. App. 517, 526, 690 A.2d 412 (1997).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are premised on the second category of \u00a7 12-119, which authorizes \u201cclaims that assessments are (a) manifestly excessive and (b) . . . could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of the property. . . . Cases in this category must contain allegations beyond the mere claim that the assessor overvalued the property. [The] plaintiff . . . must satisfy the trier that [a] far more exacting test has been met: either there was misfeasance or nonfeasance by the taxing authorities, or the assessment was arbitrary or so excessive or discriminatory as in itself to show a disregard of duty on their part. . . . Only if the plaintiff is able to meet this exacting test by establishing that the action of the assessors would result in illegality can the plaintiff prevail in an action under \u00a7 12-119. The focus of \u00a7 12-119 is whether the assessment is illegal. . . . The statute applies only to an assessment that establishes a disregard of duty by the assessors.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">At the outset, we set forth our standard of review. In concluding that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the assessment was manifestly excessive under \u00a7 12-119, the court drew legal conclusions on the basis of its interpretation of appellate case law and provisions of the General Statutes. Therefore, our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>286 Conn. 454, 464, 944 A.2d 315 (2008); <em>Waterbury Hotel Equity, LLC </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>85 Conn. App. 480, 488, 858 A.2d 259, cert. denied, 272 Conn. 901, 863 A.2d 696 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The plaintiffs claim that their property was assessed wrongfully according to its highest and best use, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>opposed to forest land and, accordingly, that the resulting assessment was manifestly excessive. More specifically, the plaintiffs appear to argue that in concluding that the assessor correctly declassified the properties, the court improperly applied General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-96, 12-99, 12-107b, 12-107d and 12-504h.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the plaintiffs\u2019 claim relates to the propriety of the decision to cancel the property\u2019s forest land designation, a decision that was made by the state forester on May 1, 2000, and which is solely within his jurisdiction, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. In its January 12, 2006 memorandum of decision, the court determined that \u201cthe tax assessor declassified the plaintiffs\u2019 property on October 2, 2000, as a result of the cancellation of the forest land designation on May 1, 2000, by the state forestry division, and not because of the conveyance between Wysocki and Old Lot.\u201d Relying on our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 130-34, 848 A.2d 451 (2004), the court concluded that \u201c[o]nce the state forester determined that the forest land certification was cancelled on May 1, 2000, the tax assessor was statutorily required to issue a notice of this cancellation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In the present case, because this claim relates to a decision that was made by the state forester on May 1, 2000, we conclude that the court did not, nor under the circumstances of this case was it required to, apply or construe \u00a7\u00a7 12-96, 12-99, 12-107b, 12-107d or 12-504h. Rather, the court correctly determined that the assessor was required to declassify the land on the basis of the earlier, unchallenged decision rendered by the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>forester. See <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 130-34. Because <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>clearly establishes that an assessor has no discretionary authority with respect to the classification of property as forest land; id., 137 (\u201cstate forester\u2019s actions are not reviewable by local authorities\u201d); we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the court\u2019s purported application of these statutory provisions must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims relate to the validity of the board\u2019s decision to increase the assessment for the 13.63 acre parcel abutting Elderberry Lane. More specifically, the plaintiffs claim that even if the court correctly determined that the assessor properly declassified the properties, the assessment was illegal because the board failed to comply with the notice provisions contained in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-111 and 12-60. Additionally, the plaintiffs argue that the court improperly took judicial notice of the Ellington zoning regulations and improperly concluded that the Elderberry Lane parcel was taxable as a building lot. We agree with the plaintiffs that the board disregarded its mandatory duty to provide notice to the plaintiffs of its intention to increase the assessment at least one week before holding a hearing. Indeed, in its brief, the defendant concedes that \u201cthe board of assessment appeals did not notify [the] plaintiffs and invite them to appear at least one week before adding to [the] plaintiffs\u2019 assessment as required by \u00a7 12-111.\u201d Because this defect operates to invalidate the board\u2019s decision to increase the assessment, we decline to consider the remaining claims raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">A review of the record reveals the following additional factual and procedural history. On February 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>2001, the plaintiffs appealed to the board from the assessor\u2019s valuation of their properties. A hearing was scheduled for March 17, 2001. On May 2, 2001, the board released its decision designating the 13.63 acre parcel as a building lot abutting Elderberry Lane and increased the assessment without first providing notice as set forth in \u00a7 12-111 to the plaintiffs to show cause why the increase should not have been made. The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the board\u2019s failure to provide notice rendered the increase manifestly excessive and illegal, concluding that the notice provision contained in \u00a7 12-111 was directory, rather than mandatory, and that, in any event, the plaintiffs were provided with an opportunity to be heard on March 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Under \u00a7 12-111 (a), a municipal board of assessment appeals is vested with the authority to \u201cincrease or decrease the assessment of any taxable property . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 (a). Before a municipal board of assessment appeals proceeds \u201cto increase the assessment of any person ... it shall mail to such person ... at least one week before making such increase ... a written or printed notice ... to appear before such board and show cause why such increase . . . should not be made.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In resolving this matter, we begin by setting forth the legal principles relevant to our discussion. \u201cIn order to determine whether a statute\u2019s provisions are mandatory we have traditionally looked beyond the use of the word shall and examined the statute\u2019s essential purpose. . . . The test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 465, 692 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>A.2d 742 (1997). Moreover, our Supreme Court also has concluded that in the context of statutes relating to property tax assessment, when the statutory \u201cprovision is for the benefit and protection of the individual taxpayer . . . the provision is mandatory. ... If the provision is mandatory it must be followed or the assessment will be invalid. ... All provisions designed to give [the taxpayer] an opportunity of a review of the assessment, whether by the assessors themselves or on appeal from their conclusions, are exclusively in his interest.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rocky Hill Inc. District </em>v. <em>Hartford Rayon Corp., </em>122 Conn. 392, 403, 190 A. 264 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Applying these principles in the present case, we conclude that the notice required by \u00a7 12-111 is a mandatory condition precedent to a municipal board\u2019s decision to increase a property tax assessment. The clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 12-111 suggests that its notice provision was intended to provide a taxpayer with notice of the board\u2019s intention to increase a taxpayer\u2019s assessment and an opportunity to be heard on that particular issue before the board acts to implement the increase. Although the record reveals that the board scheduled a hearing for March 17, 2001, the defendant concedes that the plaintiffs were not provided with any notice of the board\u2019s intention to increase the assessment prior to this hearing. Even if the plaintiffs participated in a hearing on March 17, 2001,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the board\u2019s failure to provide the plaintiffs with notice prevented the plaintiffs from preparing any objections relating to the propriety of the board\u2019s intention to increase the assessment. Moreover, the record reveals that the board received a memorandum prepared by the town planner that was dated April 4, 2001. In this memorandum, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>town planner opined that the 13.63 acre Elderberry Lane parcel constituted a building lot under the Ellington zoning regulations. To the extent that the receipt of this memorandum prompted the increase of the assessment, under \u00a7 12-111, an additional hearing was necessary to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to be heard on this issue. Accordingly, we conclude that the notice by the board under \u00a7 12-111 is mandatory, rather than directory, and because notice was not provided, the board\u2019s decision to increase the assessment of the 13.63 acre parcel was illegal within the meaning of \u00a7 12-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The judgments are reversed only as to the board\u2019s increase of the assessment for the 13.63 acre parcel and the case is remanded with direction to render judgments sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals as to that particular claim. The judgments are affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> Although Wysocki and Old Lot brought separate appeals, we address these appeals in one opinion because both plaintiffs presented identical issues, submitted identical briefs and conceded at oral argument that the arguments as to Wysocki also would apply to Old Lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen it is claimed that ... a tax laid on property was computed on an assessment which, under all the circumstances, was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property, the owner thereof . . . prior to the payment of such tax, may, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, make application for relief to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated. ... In all such actions, the Superior Court shall have power to grant such relief upon such terms and in such manner and form as to justice and equity appertains, and costs may be taxed at the discretion of the court. If such assessment is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes in accordance with the judgment of said court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\"> The court considered the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under \u00a7 12-119, entitled \u201cRemedy when property wrongfully assessed.\u201d On appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claim that they also sought to advance claims under General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a. \u201cThere is a distinction between an excessive assessment and an illegal, unlawful or wrongful assessment. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a, formerly General Statutes \u00a7 12-118, is the avenue to review the amount of an assessment, and \u00a7 12-119 is the way to contest the taxability itself.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Sun Valley Camping Cooperative, Inc. </em>v <em>Stafford, </em>94 Conn. App. 696, 710 n.17, 894 A.2d 349 (2006). To the extent that the court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not address these claims under \u00a7 12-117a, they were either not presented or, if presented, were not decided. If the claims were presented to the court but not decided, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to request an articulation renders the record inadequate for review. See <em>JCV Investment Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manjoney, </em>56 Conn. App. 320, 322 n.1, 742 A.2d 438 (2000).
