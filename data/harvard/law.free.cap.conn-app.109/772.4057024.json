On appeal, she claims that the court improperly concluded that the orders of temporary custody should be sustained pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the respondent\u2019s appeal is moot, we dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>The record contains the following facts and procedural history. On October 23, 2007, the department of children and families received an anonymous call concerning the respondent and her two children, who were living in a room at the Stratford Inn Motel. The caller mentioned deplorable living conditions, a lack of financial means and suspicions about substance abuse. Jennifer Pandera, the social worker assigned to investigate the case, visited the family shortly thereafter and conversed with the respondent for approximately two hours. On the basis of the condition of the children, the respondent\u2019s lack of supervision over them, the squalor of the room, the family\u2019s transience and the family\u2019s absence of resources, Pandera determined that the children were in an unsafe environment. The petitioner then invoked a ninety-six hour administrative hold. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">On October 26, 2007, the petitioner filed ex parte motions for orders of temporary custody as well as neglect petitions. Finding that the children were in immediate physical danger from their surroundings and that continuation in the respondent\u2019s custody was contrary to their welfare, the court, <em>Wolven, J., </em>granted the motions, pending the preliminary hearing. The respondent contested the orders of temporary custody. A trial was held on November 8 and 9, 2007, at the conclusion of which, the court, <em>Wilson, J., </em>sustained the orders by way of an oral decision. It is from these judgments that the respondent appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">On January 22, 2008, a hearing on the underlying neglect petitions was held. The respondent failed to attend the hearing, and the court defaulted her for failure to appear. On May 21, 2008, the neglect petitions were resolved as to both parents. Concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>children were neglected, the court committed both children to the custody of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On May 23, 2008, the petitioner, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-10,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> submitted to us a memorandum of law citing <em>In re Carl O., </em>10 Conn. App. 428, 523 A.2d 1339, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 802, 525 A.2d 964 (1987), in which this court ruled that an appeal from an order of temporary custody was rendered moot when the children were adjudicated to be neglected. Id., 434. At oral argument on May 27, 2008, the petitioner asserted that because the respondent\u2019s children would not be returned to her custody even if she were to prevail on appeal, this court cannot provide her any practical relief. Conceding that the issue is moot, the respondent contends that the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine applies to her appeal. We do not agree with the respondent\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201cWhen, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">\u201cWe note that an otherwise moot question may qualify for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception. To do so, however, it must meet three requirements. First, <em>the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number><em>a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. </em>Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Steven M., </em>264 Conn. 747, 754-55, 826 A.2d 156 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Our case law specifically conceives of appeals from temporary custody orders as moot when the children involved are adjudicated neglected. See <em>In re Carl O., </em>supra, 10 Conn. App. 434; see also <em>Pamela B. </em>v. <em>Ment, </em>244 Conn. 296, 321, 709 A.2d 1089 (1998) (\u201ccommitment of the child to the [commissioner] legally supersedes the temporary custody order\u201d). In support of her argument that the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception applies to her case, the respondent has offered no evidence that most cases challenging a temporary custody order are, by their very nature, of such a limited duration that there is a strong likelihood that they will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. See <em>Drabik </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>97 Conn. App. 142, 146, 902 A.2d 727 (2006). In failing to establish that the substantial majority of temporary custody orders evades review, the respondent has foundered on the first required criterion of the exception. See <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 387-88, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). We thus reject the respondent\u2019s claim that the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception applies to her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\"> The respondent father is not a party to this appeal.
