Specifically, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) found the value of the premarital property owned by the plaintiff, James R. Radcliffe, and (2) abused its discretion by ordering time limited alimony. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>parties were married on December 24, 1992. There is one minor child of the marriage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the marriage, the plaintiff owned a parcel of real estate known as 1 Maplewood Avenue, located in Westport. The court found the equity in the Maplewood property at the time of the dissolution to be $395,000. The court further found that the plaintiff had always maintained this as a rental property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the defendant had not made any contributions to the Maplewood property.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">During the marriage, the defendant went \u201cfrom sophisticated, high level employment with . . . nationally and internationally renowned corporations ... to being barely able to hold a job selling mortgages for more than a thirty day period.\u201d This decline stemmed, in part, from the rigors of the divorce litigation, as well as the \u201cdysfunctional and deleterious nature of the plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s relationship over the past several years.\u201d The court opined, however, that \u201conce this litigation and all its ramifications are behind the defendant, she will be better able to regain her focus and provide for herself a reasonable income, although not anywhere near the equivalence of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and entered the following relevant financial orders. The plaintiff was instructed to pay weekly alimony in the amount of $250 for a period of two years. The court ordered that the term of alimony was nonmodifiable. The court divided the real and personal properties and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant $275,000. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly found the value of the premarital property owned by the plaintiff. Specifically, the defendant argues, in her principal brief, that the court\u2019s finding that $395,000 of the marital estate was the plaintiffs premarital property was clearly erroneous. She further argues, <em>in her reply brief, </em>that the court failed to include her nonmonetary contributions, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81, that helped the Maplewood property appreciate during the marriage. We conclude that with respect to the former argument, the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous and that, with respect to the latter, the defendant impermissibly raised an argument for the first time in her reply brief. Thus, we decline to review the latter argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. The plaintiff presented the testimony of Ginger Chick, a real estate appraiser. Counsel for the defendant stipulated to her qualifications as a competent real estate appraiser. Chick testified that she performed an appraisal of the Maplewood property. Chick concluded that the fair market value of the Maplewood property was $545,000. The plaintiffs financial affidavit indicated a mortgage in the amount of $150,000 on the Maplewood property. Using these two figures, the court found the plaintiffs equity in the Maplewood property to equal $395,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">In her principal brief, the defendant argued that neither party presented evidence as to the value of the plaintiffs assets at the time of the marriage. She further contended that the court\u2019s finding was inconsistent with the plaintiffs bankruptcy filing a few years after the marriage and with the plaintiffs financial affidavit prepared in connection with the parties\u2019 prior dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the defendant maintained that even if the court intended to refer to the plaintiffs gross assets, rather than his net assets, his prior affidavits show such assets in the amount of approximately $220,000. The defendant concluded that the court\u2019s finding with respect to the plaintiffs premarital assets was unsupported by the record, and, therefore, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In his brief, the plaintiff responded to the defendant\u2019s arguments, claiming that the court, in its memorandum of decision, referred not to the value of the Maplewood property at the time of the marriage but, rather, to its value at the time of the dissolution. In support of this position, the plaintiff cites the following language from the court\u2019s memorandum of decision: \u201cThe <em>current </em>approximate net value of the assets of this marital estate is $1,611,000. <em>Of this, </em>approximately $395,000 can be construed as premarital property attributable to the plaintiff . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, earlier in its decision, the court specifically found that \u201cthe current fair market value of the property is $545,000. There are mortgages on the property which total $150,000. The equity in the property is $395,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chyung </em>v. <em>Chyung, </em>86 Conn. App. 665, 667-68, 862 A.2d 374 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 904, 868 A.2d 744 (2005); see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Aarestrup </em>v. <em>Harwood-Aarestrup, </em>102 Conn. App. 74, 77, 924 A.2d 873 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that the court found the value of the Maplewood property, which the court found to be a premarital asset, as of the time of dissolution, rather than its value at the time of the parties\u2019 marriage. Furthermore, on the basis of Chick\u2019s testimony and the plaintiffs financial affidavit, there was evidence in the record to support this finding. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s finding that the Maple-wood property had a value of $395,000 was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim, raised for the first time in her reply brief, that the court improperly failed to include nonmonetary contributions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as required by \u00a7 46b-81. Specifically, the defendant relies on <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>13 Conn. App. 300, 536 A.2d 978, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988), to support the claim that the court failed to consider her nonmonetary contributions, such as caring for the minor child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She argues that these contributions allowed the plaintiff to retain and to develop the Maple-wood property and, therefore, helped its value to appreciate.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The defendant failed to raise the issue of nonmonetary contributions in her principal brief. She focused solely on the fact that there was no evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding regarding the value of the Maplewood property at the time of the marriage. Only in response to the plaintiffs brief did she raise the issue of nonmonetary contributions. \u201cIt is a well established principle that arguments cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief. . . . Our practice requires an appellant to raise claims of error in his original brief, so that the issue as framed by him can be fully responded to by the appellee in its brief, and so that we can have the full benefit of that written argument. Although the function of the appellant\u2019s reply brief is to respond to the arguments and authority presented in the appellee\u2019s brief, that function does not include raising an entirely new claim of error.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 312, 699 A.2d 921 (1997); see also <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>279 Conn. 558, 566 n.9, 903 A.2d 201 (2006) (claim raised for first time in reply brief is unpreserved and appellate court will decline review); <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>257 Conn. 230, 244, 777 A.2d 633 (2001); <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Tomas, </em>66 Conn. App. 146, 163, 783 A.2d 1226 (2001). Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim that the court failed to consider her nonmonetary contributions when it found the value of the plaintiffs premarital asset.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion by ordering time limited alimony. Specifically, she argues that the record does not reveal a factual basis or rationale for a nonmodifiable award of two years of alimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. The defendant obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree, graduating summa cum laude. She further earned a master\u2019s degree in optics and a master of business administration degree. Her employment history and earnings history \u201chave shown a clear, declining trend over the last ten years.\u201d The court stated that <em>\u201cat the current time, her ability to maintain any significant employment appears to be seriously compro</em>mised..\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court further indicated that although her present prospects for steady, gainful employment appeared bleak, it was \u201cconfident, though, that once this litigation and all its ramification are behind the defendant, she will be better able to regain her focus and provide herself a reasonable income</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cAn appellate court will not disturb a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivnak </em>v. <em>Rivnak, </em>99 Conn. App. 326, 328, 913 A.2d 1096 (2007). This standard \u201creflects the sound policy that the trial court has the unique opportunity to view the parties and their testimony, and is therefore in the best position to assess all of the circumstances surrounding a dissolution action, including such factors as the demeanor and the attitude of the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">We recently have stated: \u201cTime limited alimony is often awarded. [Our Supreme Court] has dealt with challenges to an award of time limited alimony on numerous occasions. . . . The trial court does not have to make a detailed finding justifying its award of time limited alimony. . . . Although a specific finding for an award of time limited alimony is not required, the record must indicate the basis for the trial court\u2019s award. . . . There must be sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the spouse should receive time limited alimony for the particular duration established. If the time period for the periodic alimony is logically inconsistent with the facts found or the evidence, it cannot stand. ... In addition to being awarded to provide an incentive for the spouse receiving support to use diligence in procuring training or skills necessary to attain self-sufficiency, time limited alimony is also appropriately awarded to provide interim support until a future event occurs that makes such support less necessary or unnecessary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 310; <em>Nashid </em>v. <em>Andrawis, </em>83 Conn. App. 115, 122-23, 847 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>A.2d 1098, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 912, 853 A.2d 528 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In the present case, the court did not make a detailed finding with respect to the time limited alimony award. The question, therefore, is whether the record indicates a basis for this durational order. We conclude that the record does contain such a basis, and, therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The defendant testified that at the time of the trial, she was prescribed two medications for the treatment of depression and one for attention deficit disorder. She stated that she suffered from stress related dysthymia<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that her first \u201cdepressive crash\u201d was in 1994, when the plaintiff left with their minor child. She previously had been treated by a psychiatrist during dissolution proceedings with her first husband. At the conclusion of those proceedings, however, her symptoms went away. The defendant later testified that stress triggers depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The defendant described the divorce proceedings with the plaintiff as being on \u201canother order of magnitude\u201d as compared to her prior divorce. The defendant further testified that she perceived her depression as stemming from the \u201chate driven hostility\u201d of the plaintiff during the divorce. She indicated that as a result of this divorce related stress, she would not be able to complete a twenty hour work week. She acknowledged that medications benefited her condition and that she hoped to obtain employment in another field at the conclusion of the legal proceedings. She doubted, however, that in the near future, she would have the ability to work in the same capacity as her prior positions. The defendant opined that the she did not think she would be able to be employed in 2006 or 2007, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>receiving psychiatric care. Finally, the defendant stated that her court appearances were so stressful and debilitating that it would take her one week to recover from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">After a thorough review, we conclude that the record contains a sufficient basis to support the court\u2019s award of time limited alimony. We note that the defendant failed to present expert testimony regarding her medical condition. The only evidence regarding the issue of her depression came from the defendant herself.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In other words, the court was not presented with an independent evaluation of the severity of the defendant\u2019s depression. Accordingly, the court, on the basis of its observations, was free to make its own determination as to the validity of the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the severity, duration and frequency of her symptoms and illness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The court determined that the defendant\u2019s inability to maintain significant employment was a result, in part, of both the \u201crigors of [the] relentless litigation\u201d as well as the toxic nature of the parties\u2019 relationship. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s determination that the defendant, following the conclusion of the litigation, would be able to regain her focus and to provide herself with a reasonable income finds support in the record. The court issued its memorandum of decision on July 24, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and awarded alimony until July, 2008. This comports with the defendant\u2019s testimony that she would not be able to work in 2006 and 2007.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The decision affords the defendant a period of time for rest and recovery from the tumultuous period resulting from the divorce action. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s testimony reveals a pattern of increased stress related depression during the periods of divorce litigation and interactions with the plaintiff. The court reasonably expected both of these stressors or triggers to diminish and to abate following the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. See, e.g., <em>Nashid </em>v. <em>Andrawis, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 123-24 (court free to make reasonable inferences from testimony when ordering time limited alimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The defendant failed to request an articulation as to why the court ordered time limited alimony. We conclude, however, that such an order was appropriate to provide interim support until she recovered from the stress induced depression caused by the divorce proceedings. Such an order is logically consistent with the evidence and facts found and, therefore, is proper. <em>Henin </em>v. Henin, 26 Conn. App. 386, 392, 601 A.2d 550 (1992); see also <em>Szegda </em>v. <em>Szegda, </em>97 Conn. App. 426, 433, 904 A.2d 1266 (record disclosed evidence supporting reasonable rationale for award of time limited alimony), cert. denied, 280 Conn. 932, 909 A.2d 959 (2006). In other words, the rationale behind the court\u2019s award of time limited alimony is found in the record; following the completion of the divorce proceedings, the stress on the defendant will diminish and, as a result, the symptoms of her depression will subside. Although she now argues that two years is insufficient to ensure her recovery to the point of obtaining gainful employment, we cannot conclude, on the basis of this record, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the court abused its discretion in concluding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> On March 8, 2006, the parties resolved all issues of custody and visitation relative to the minor child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\"> The court found that at the time of the dissolution, the Maplewood property generated $2000 per month in rental income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\"> The court found that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and declined to attribute the cause for the breakdown to either party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\"> The parties reconciled and withdrew the first dissolution action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> We note that whether a party made a contribution to the acquisition and preservation of property presents a question of fact. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>13 Conn.

App. 311; and that \u201ca determination of each spouses\u2019 contribution within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 includes non-monetary as well as monetary contributions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 312.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> We note that the court indicated in its memorandum of decision that it had \u201cconsidered all the relevant statutory criteria, including the length of the marriage, the age, health, station, occupation, assets, amount and sources of income, skills, employability, debt, <em>nonmonetary contributions, </em>acquisition and preservation of the estate, needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income and all other criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62, 46b-81, 46b-82, 46b-84, 46b-215b, 46b-56c and the child support guidelines.\u201d (Emphasis added.)
