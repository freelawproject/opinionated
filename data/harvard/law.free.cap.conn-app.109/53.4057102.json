We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">To prevail on a nonconsensual termination of parental rights, the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that one of seven statutory grounds for termination exists. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3). The ground alleged in the present case was the respondent\u2019s failure to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>a trial court\u2019s determination that a parent has failed to rehabilitate is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>In re Jeisean M., </em>270 Conn. 382, 397, 852 A.2d 643 (2004). If, at the adjudicatory phase of the termination proceeding, the court determines that the petitioner has proven a failure to achieve rehabilitation, it must then determine if termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child as part of the dispositional phase. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2); see also <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 356-57, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). The court\u2019s findings as to both issues will be reversed on appeal only if they are clearly erroneous. See <em>In re Tricia A., </em>55 Conn. App. 111, 116, 737 A.2d 974 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgments should be affirmed. On the facts of this case, the issues properly were resolved in the court\u2019s complete and well reasoned memorandum of decision, which addresses the arguments raised in this appeal. See <em>In re Mariah P., </em>50 Conn. Sup. 594, 954 A.2d 286 (2007). We therefore adopt it as the proper statement of the relevant facts, issues and applicable law, as it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>In re Alexander C., </em>262 Conn. 308, 311, 813 A.2d 87 (2003); <em>In re Karrlo K., </em>40 Conn. App. 73, 75, 668 A.2d 1353 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\"> The parental rights of the respondent mother also were terminated. Because she has not appealed, we refer to the respondent father as the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">We also note that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-13, the attorney for the minor children filed a statement adopting the brief of the petitioner in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Superior Court . . . may grant a petition [to terminate parental rights] if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that . . . the child . . . has been found by the Superior Court ... to have been neglected ... in a prior proceeding . . . and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent . . . and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
