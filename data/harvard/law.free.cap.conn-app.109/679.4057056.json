On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jurors that they were to draw no unfavorable inferences from his decision not to testify pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues (1) that he did not request that the charge not be given, within the meaning of the statute, and (2) in the alternative, that to the extent that his counsel requested that the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge not be given, the waiver was ineffective because the statute mandates that the defendant personally waive the right to the charge. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. The defendant was charged, in a substitute information, with operating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) (1). The defendant elected a jmy trial. After the close of evidence, and after the court had charged the jury, the court raised, sua sponte, the issue of whether it should recall the jurors to charge them in conformance with \u00a7 54-84 (b). The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cThe Court: [T]here is something I would like to clear up. ... It was in the preliminary instructions twice; I didn\u2019t have a specific instruction about the fact that [the . defendant] didn\u2019t testify and that [the jurors are] not to hold it against him. You . . . want me to bring attention to that or not? I\u2019m willing to bring them out\u2014 bring them out, although I\u2019ve done that twice before, that you\u2019re not to hold it against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: <em>I think the court has addressed that issue and taken care of that problem.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201cThe Court: I just want to make sure because some people might have felt that it\u2019s something that should be said again, but I believe it has been covered twice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: <em>No, I\u2019m satisfied with that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. So, anything else?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The court then moved on to other matters, and the jurors were not provided with a charge pursuant to \u00a7 54-84 (b). Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the court rendered judgment on the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">The defendant claims first that his counsel did not request that the \u00a7 54-84 (b) charge not be given, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>therefore, the court improperly failed to charge the jury that it was to draw no adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Section 54-84 (b) provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cUnless the accused requests otherwise, </em>the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[T]his charge must be given unless the defendant requests otherwise.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 333, 438 A.2d 93 (1980). \u201c[T]he statutory right is conferred upon the defendant unconditionally, in the absence of his request that the charge not be given. . . . Our legislature has prescribed the language provided in \u00a7 54-84 (b) to be the jury instruction that <em>must </em>be given to reduce speculation to a minimum.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>10 Conn. App. 302, 309, 523 A.2d 891, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 805, 528 A.2d 1152 (1987). \u201c[T]he total omission of the no adverse inference instruction is plain error that is not subject to a harmless error analysis. The unconditional language of the statute is a legislative mandate and the failure to use that language is a pivotal aspect of the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>59 Conn. App. 426, 430, 757 A.2d 74, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 947, 762 A.2d 904 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Although it is a close case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s colloquy with the court constituted the functional equivalent of a \u201c[request] otherwise,\u201d namely, a request that the court not deliver a \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction. There is no specific talismanic language necessary to constitute such a request. The court raised the issue itself and offered to give the instruction without any further request or other action by defense counsel. Defense counsel, instead of remaining silent or simply accepting the court\u2019s offer, affirmatively spoke <em>against </em>giving the instruction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>When the court asked if defense counsel wanted it to give the instruction, defense counsel stated that he was satisfied that the substance of the instruction had been covered. The court asked a second time, and defense counsel again stated that he was satisfied with the court\u2019s prior instructions. In context, we conclude that it was reasonable for the court to interpret defense counsel\u2019s representations as. an affirmative request not to recall the jury and deliver the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge pursuant to \u00a7 54-84 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The defendant first directs the attention of this court to <em>State </em>v. Stewart, 64 Conn. App. 340, 780 A.2d 209, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 909, 782 A.2d 1250 (2001). In that case, as in this case, the defendant did not testify, and the trial court omitted the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge. Unlike the situation in this case, the parties and the court in <em>Stewart </em>discussed during a precharge conference whether to deliver the charge. The initial conference was conducted on April 16,1998. This court summarized the substance of that discussion as follows: \u201cThe court reviewed the preliminary requests to charge dining the conference. The defendant\u2019s counsel made a specific request that the court omit any reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The court reminded counsel of its obligation under [\u00a7] 54-84 (b). The court further advised that [the] no unfavorable inferences instruction was part of the court\u2019s base charge. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\u201cNonetheless, defendant\u2019s counsel persisted in asking the court not to comment on his client\u2019s failure to testify. In doing so, counsel stressed the word highlight in using the phrase, I don\u2019t want to highlight his failure to testify. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201cOn April 20, 1998, the court continued its charging conference with counsel in chambers. After disclosing to counsel the substance of its charge, the court once again inquired of the defendant\u2019s counsel whether he still wanted the court to omit the mandatoiy no unfavorable inferences charge. Defendant\u2019s counsel reiterated that he did not wish the court to highlight his client\u2019s failure to take the [witness] stand and requested the charge not be given.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 343-44 n.4. On appeal, the defendant did not refute that the representations of counsel made during the precharging conferences constituted a request not to deliver the \u00a7 54-84 (b) charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The defendant here argues that in order for a defendant to \u201crequest otherwise,\u201d the defendant must make the request as clearly as counsel had in <em>Stewart. </em>We find nothing in the statute, however, that requires the defendant to request as vigorously and repeatedly as counsel had in <em>Stewart </em>in order for the request not to charge to be effective, nor does the statute indicate that the defendant must inform the court of the reasons why the charge is unwanted, as had the <em>Stewart </em>defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Next, the defendant argues that the present appeal is controlled by <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 426. Similar to the situation in the present case, this court in <em>Cruz </em>faced the question of whether a discussion regarding whether the trial court should deliver a \u00a7 54-84 (b) charge constituted a request by the defendant not to deliver the charge. The conversation took place after the court had delivered its charge to the jury. This court reviewed the following relevant colloquy in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Isn\u2019t there a statutory requirement to instruct the [jury regarding the defendant\u2019s] not testifying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201cThe Court: If you requested\u2014I asked you if you had any requests to charge on it. I\u2019ve already given two instructions during the period of the trial. During the trial, I pointed out that he did not\u2014that they could draw no inference from his failure to testify and so forth. However, if you want a further charge on that, I\u2019ll be delighted to give it to you. Okay? I think it\u2019s\u2014I think, though, that\u2019s something you have to request if you want it, if you want anything further. But I did cover it at least two or three times, at least once during the preliminary statement and at least two or three times during the course of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201cThe Court: If you want something further, I\u2019ll be happy to give it. You don\u2019t want anything else at this stage? Anything else? Let\u2019s do the exhibits.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 429.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">This court determined that defense counsel\u2019s statement of \u201c[a]ll right\u201d and his failure to accept the court\u2019s offer to deliver the charge did not constitute a request not to deliver the charge within the meaning of \u00a7 54-84 (b). Id., 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Although we acknowledge that there are certain similarities between the circumstances presented in <em>Cruz </em>and those of the present case, we conclude that the representations made by defense counsel here are distinguishable from those made in <em>Cruz </em>and, more importantly, that the representations made here constitute the functional equivalent of a request not to charge. In <em>Cruz, </em>the trial court, incorrectly, believed that it had no obligation, absent a request, to deliver the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge. The court then offered to deliver the charge if the defendant affirmatively requested that it do so. Defense counsel failed to make such a request, but counsel\u2019s failure to request the charge did not clearly manifest a desire that the instruction not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>given. Rather, at most, it manifested an acceptance of the court\u2019s improper interpretation of the statute and an indifference to whether the charge be given or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Unlike the court in <em>Cruz, </em>the court here raised the issue itself and offered to give the instruction without any further request or other action by defense counsel. As discussed previously, rather than remaining silent or accepting the court\u2019s offer, defense counsel here twice affirmatively spoke against delivering the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">In the alternative, the defendant claims that \u00a7 54-84 (b) establishes a personal right to a \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge and that this right may not be effectively waived by counsel but only by the accused personally. The defendant acknowledges that this court previously rejected the same argument in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 340. He argues, however, that <em>Stewart </em>should be overruled. Specifically: (1) the defendant invites us to reevaluate <em>Stewart </em>in light of the subsequently enacted General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z, which codified the \u201cplain meaning rule,\u201d and overrule <em>Stewart </em>because \u00a7 54-84 (b) unambiguously requires the accused personally to request that the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d charge not be given; and (2) the defendant argues that even if the meaning of \u201caccused\u201d is not plain and unambiguous, we should overrule <em>Stewart </em>as not properly interpreting the statutory provision. We are unpersuaded that the ruling of <em>Stewart </em>must be revisited.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Initially, we note that the record does not contain any indication that the defendant requested an en banc review of this issue. We have recognized, however, that \u201cthis court\u2019s policy dictates that one panel should not, on its own, [overrule] the ruling of a previous panel. The [overruling] maybe accomplished only if the appeal is heard en banc.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Boccanfuso </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>89 Conn. App. 260, 285 n.20, 873 A.2d 208, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 905, 882 A.2d 668 (2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim implicates the doctrine of stare decisis. \u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>285 Conn. 208, 216, 939 A.2d 541 (2008); see also <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 61-62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">First, the defendant argues that we should revisit the <em>Stewart </em>determination in light of the enactment of \u00a7 1-2z. The defendant acknowledges that our Supreme Court has determined that \u00a7 l-2z does not apply retroactively; see <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>282 Conn. 477, 501, 923 A.2d 657 (2007); but argues, nonetheless, that the meaning of \u201caccused\u201d in the statute would have been interpreted differently by the <em>Stewart </em>court had the question been presented subsequent to the enactment of \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">Section l-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Our Supreme Court has clarified that the sole purpose of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 l-2z was to restore the plain meaning rule as it existed in Connecticut common law. See <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 282 Conn. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The <em>Stewart </em>court invoked the common-law plain meaning rule during its review of the statutory provision, noting: \u201cWe begin our analysis by examining the language of \u00a7 54-84 (b). As in any exercise of statutoiy interpretation, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 348. It also noted that when possible, \u201cstatutory language should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 349. The court reviewed the dictionary definition of \u201caccused\u201d and then surveyed the use of the term in Connecticut common and statutory law. Although it did not explicitly state that the term \u201caccused\u201d was ambiguous, the substance of its analysis makes clear that it found that \u201caccused\u201d reasonably could mean either the accused personally or the accused acting through counsel. See id., 349-55. Thus, because the <em>Stewart </em>court found the term to be subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, and therefore ambiguous, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 l-2z would have had an impact on the court\u2019s analysis had it been in effect at the time of the decision. Cf. <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 282 Conn. 497 n.18. Therefore, we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to revisit <em>Stewart </em>based on the subsequent enactment of \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The defendant also challenges the substance of the <em>Stewart </em>court\u2019s reasoning. Specifically, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>asserts that the <em>Stewart </em>court improperly noted that \u201cdecisions concerning the composition of a jury charge fall into the category of decisions concerning the matters of trial strategy\u201d and, therefore, because the provisions of \u00a7 54-84 (b) govern the contents of the jury charge, the decision to waive it is one that may be made by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The defendant argues that the <em>Stewart </em>court was mistaken in believing that decisions regarding the content of jury instructions are decisions appropriately made by counsel, rather than by the accused. He asserts in his appellate brief: \u201c[T]he decision of waiving a statutorily mandated jury instruction intended to preserve the fundamental constitutional right of an accused not to testify is not the same type of decision required of counsel in making a spur of the moment decision to call a subpoenaed witness to the [witness] stand when the testimony of the witness may no longer be required or helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The defendant has not, however, presented any law on this subject that was not available to this court at the time of the <em>Stewart </em>determination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>235 Conn. 595, 610, 669 A.2d 562 (1995). Instead, the defendant implies that interpreting \u201caccused\u201d to include counsel undermines the defendant\u2019s right not to testify. He does not, however, explain how it does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s argument rises to the level of the \u201cmost cogent reasons and inescapable logic\u201d necessary to overrule a prior statutory inteipretation. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to revisit <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>determination that the accused\u2019s counsel may \u201crequest otherwise\u201d and waive the right to a \u00a7 54-84 (b) instruction on behalf of the accused, and, therefore, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 provides: \u201c(a) Any person on trial for crime shall be a competent witness, and at his or her option may testify or refuse to testify upon such trial. The neglect or refusal of an accused party to testify shall not be commented upon by the court or prosecuting official, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201c(b) Unless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. In cases tried to the court, no unfavorable inferences shall be drawn by the court from the accused\u2019s silence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-14\"> We recognize that the court improperly determined that its preliminary no unfavorable inferences instruction was sufficient to satisfy the statute. See <em>State </em>v. Hicks, 97 Conn. App. 266, 277, 903 A.2d 685, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 930, 909 A.2d 958 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> The parties have not briefed the issue of whether the timing of the court\u2019s offer, after the jurors had been released for deliberation, makes a difference to the result of this case. Therefore, we do not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> The <em>Stewart </em>defendant argued, instead, that only the defendant personally could waive the right to the charge, as discussed in part II of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 70-7 (a) provides: \u201cBefore a case is assigned for oral argument, the chief justice or the chief judge may order, on the motion of a party or sua sponte, that a case be heard en banc.\u201d See <em>Boccanfuso </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 89 Conn.
