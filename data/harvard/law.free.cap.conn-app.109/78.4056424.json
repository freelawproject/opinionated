On appeal, the defendant claims that the court violated his constitutional right to due process by failing to inform him of his right to a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes error. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">On January 18, 2002, the defendant was convicted of possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (b). The court sentenced him to a term of seven years imprisonment, execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>suspended after twenty-three months, followed by four years probation pursuant to certain conditions. Following his failure to report to his probation officer and his failure of multiple urine tests, which tested positive for marijuana, a violation of probation warrant issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On October 6, 2006, the defendant appeared before the court. That proceeding commenced as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Criminal line forty-nine, Jeremy Lombra. Case has been continued for the defendant to hire counsel. He does not have counsel today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201cThe Court: Put him to plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201c[Clerk of the Court]: . . . [U]nder docket number CR 01206601, you\u2019ve been charged with violation of probation under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. Do you admit or deny?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Do I have to plead today? I haven\u2019t even gotten a chance to talk to any attorney or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201cThe Court: Sir, you were arrested on this, I believe, on August 11, 2006. It is now October 6. Do you admit or deny you violated your probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I admit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">The court thereafter rendered judgment revoking his probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that although due process does not require that a person facing probation revocation be provided the full panoply of rights afforded a defendant at a criminal trial, it does require that a hearing be held before probation is revoked. <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1973).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>17 Conn. App. 226, 232, 551 A.2d 1264 (1988), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>210 Conn. 810, 556 A.2d 609 (1989). In <em>Johnston, </em>this court explained that \u201ca defendant who desires to admit a probation violation must first be informed, on the record, of his right to have a hearing . . . . [H]e is entitled to a hearing to determine his culpability for the alleged violation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 234. The record plainly reflects that the court did not comply with that constitutional requirement. For that reason, the state concedes that \u201cthe defendant is entitled to another revocation hearing at which he is adequately informed of his right to contest the charges if he wishes to do so.\u201d We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-15\"> The defendant also contends that the court failed to canvass him regarding the waiver of counsel. We need not consider that claim in light of our conclusion that a due process violation transpired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-15\"> We note further the express mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he court shall cause the defendant to be brought before it . . . for a hearing on the violation [of probation] charges. At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>which such defendant is alleged to have violated the conditions of such defendant\u2019s probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by the court that such defendant has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in such defendant\u2019s own behalf.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
