See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101; <em>In re T.K., </em>105 Conn.. App. 502, 503-504, 939 A.2d 9, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 914, 945 A.2d 976 (2008). The statutory scheme takes into consideration, however, the fundamental precept that \u201c[p]arents have a constitutionally protected right to raise and care for their own children.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 Conn. 310, 318-19, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983). The statutory scheme consists of a number of interrelated intermediate steps on a path that eventually may lead to the termination of parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>rights. The adjudication of those intermediate steps yields factual findings and orders regarding behavior expected of parents to facilitate reunification of families, if possible, and provides a factual predicate for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, appeals from the judgments of the trial court dismissing the petitions for the termination of the parental rights of the respondent parents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with respect to their three children, a son and two daughters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner claims that when adjudicating the petitions for termination of parental rights, the trial court, <em>Crawford, J., </em>improperly disregarded the prior factual finding that the children were neglected, which was based on the father\u2019s sexual abuse of the respondents\u2019 son.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the fact that a party is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating a previous finding of neglect during a subsequent termination trial, we agree that the trial court improperly disregarded the earlier neglect finding. We therefore reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The following facts, as found by the court, <em>Trombley, J., </em>after the trial on the neglect petitions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>to the petitioner\u2019s appeal. In July, 1991, the father agreed to the termination of his parental rights in a daughter, T, who is not a subject of this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The father has a criminal record. In May, 1994, he received a suspended sentence for threatening and harassment. In 1995, he was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault in the third degree and risk of injury to a child for acts he perpetrated on T.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 21, 1996, he pleaded guilty, pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to two counts of risk of injury to a child. He received a suspended sentence and a term of probation, but he failed to cooperate with the office of adult probation (adult probation). According to his probation officer, the father was arrogant and resisted treatment at the Northeast Mental Health Sexual Offender Program and eventually was discharged from that program. He refused to discuss his relationships with significant others. Adult probation referred the respondents to the department of children and families (department) prior to the birth of their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The department investigated and urged the mother to participate in counseling services for nonoffending parents of sexual abuse victims in order to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>son, who was bom in late 1997. The respondents signed a service agreement from the department, requiring twenty-four hour a day adult supervision for their son. The mother was required to protect the boy from harm and to cooperate with the department. The father was to have no unsupervised contact with his son pursuant to the court-ordered conditions of probation. The father violated a no contact order regarding T. In 1998, he was found to be in violation of his probation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and sentenced to two years in prison. On July 17, 2002, the father was convicted of breach of the peace in the second degree for acts perpetrated against the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On August 5, 2002, the father reported to the state police that his son had disclosed to him that the son had been sexually assaulted by a neighbor, \u201cUncle Ray. \u201d Using the language of a child, the son later told the investigating state trooper, Steven Corradi, of sexual acts perpetrated on him by his father. The son also told Corradi that he had lied about Uncle Ray because he feared that his father would go to jail.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Corradi referred the matter to the department. Orders of temporary custody were filed with respect to the son and the older <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>daughter, who was two months old at the time. The orders of temporary custody were sustained by agreement. The son was evaluated by a sexual abuse expert, Rebecca Bowen, in December, 2002.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bowen concluded within a reasonable degree of clinical probability that the son had been sexually abused and that the father was the abuser. Bowen recommended that the son have no contact with the father and that the mother receive therapy. On the basis of Bowen\u2019s advice, the department stopped visits between the father and son. The father was evaluated by two sexual offender specialists, who found that he was at medium to high risk to reoffend. They recommended that the father not have unsupervised contact with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On August 22, 2002, the petitioner filed neglect petitions for the respondents\u2019 son and older daughter. The petitioner alleged that the respondents\u2019 son \u201cis being denied proper care and attention, physically, educationally, emotionally or morally, or ... is being permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to the well-being of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (9) (B) and (C). The petitioner also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>alleged that the son was abused in that he \u201cis in a condition that is the result of maltreatment such as . . . sexual molestation or exploitation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (4) (C). The petitioner alleged that the older daughter \u201cis being denied proper care and attention, physically, educationally, emotionally or morally, or ... is being permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to the well-being of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (9) (B) and (C). The respondents\u2019 younger daughter was bom in June, 2003, and agents of the department filed an order of temporary custody when she was two days old. The order of temporary custody was sustained. On June 30, 2003, the petitioner filed a neglect petition for the respondents\u2019 younger daughter on the same grounds as those alleged as to her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The neglect petitions were tried before Judge Trombley in April, 2004. In its memorandum of decision, the court identified the core question as whether the son was sexually abused by the father and whether he was an abused child within the meaning of \u00a7 46b-120 (4) (C). As to the older daughter, the court stated that the issue was whether she, as a child residing in the same household, was a neglected child as defined by \u00a7 46b-120 (9). As to the younger daughter, the question was whether the petitioner was justified in removing her from the respondents\u2019 care under the doctrine of predictive neglect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Judge Trombley found, with respect to the neglect petitions, that the petitioner had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the son was an abused child within the meaning of \u00a7 46-120 (4) (C) in that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>had been sexually molested by the father. The court based its finding on the father\u2019s conviction related to having sexually assaulted T, his lack of cooperation with adult probation, his violation of probation and the testimony of experts who opined that the father had abused the son.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court also found that the son was permitted to live under conditions, circumstances and associations injurious to his well-being. As a consequence of the sexual abuse he had sustained, the son was being denied proper care and attention, emotionally and morally.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As to the respondents\u2019 daughters, the court found that the petitionerliad proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that there was a substantial risk that harm would be perpetrated on them. The court found, moreover, that the daughters had been denied proper care and attention, emotionally and morally, and that they were or would have been living under conditions, associations and circumstances injurious to their well-being.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In light of the father\u2019s sexual abuse of the son, the risk to which the daughters would have been exposed, and the mother\u2019s continuing refusal to accept that the father\u2019s abuse was possible, if not substantially probable, the court committed all three children to the custody of the petitioner until further court order. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was no longer appropriate for the department to make efforts to reunify the father with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The court found, however, that the petitioner had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that further efforts to reunify the mother with the children were no longer appropriate. The mother\u2019s only failings were her belief, against compelling evidence to the contrary, that the father did not sexually abuse their son and her allowing the father to direct and to control her actions in this case, including her insistence that he and she be represented by the same counsel. The court ordered the mother to engage in nonoffender sexual abuse counseling and denied her permission to see her son until she complied with the order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court ordered the department to make reasonable efforts to explore the possibility of returning the three children to the mother\u2019s care without the participation of the father.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court ordered specific steps to be taken to reunite the mother with the children pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 Q). Neither respondent appealed from the judgments that their children were neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Subsequent to the neglect adjudications, the mother failed to cooperate with the department and was unwilling to participate in a family evaluation until January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>2005. The evaluation was performed by Nancy Randall, a licensed psychologist, who recommended against visits between the son and the mother. The mother insisted that despite a history of depression and drug and alcohol abuse, she did not feel the need for treatment. Randall also evaluated the father, who acknowledged problems with domestic violence in his intimate relationships but denied any problem with alcohol or drugs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He also denied any need for treatment and insisted that he would not engage in sex offender therapy. Randall concluded that the father may be willing to go through the motions but would not participate in treatment in a therapeutic way. The respondents had not seen their son since February, 2003. Randall opined to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that there was no evidence to suggest that they were likely to benefit from treatment in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The respondents continued to deny that the father had abused the son and maintained, therefore, that there was no reason for them to enter treatment. On September 20, 2004, the petitioner filed petitions to terminate the respondents\u2019 parental rights as to their three children, alleging that the respondents had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 Q) (3) (B) (ii),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and through acts of omission and commission denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the children the guidance and control necessary to their well-being under \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (C).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Each of the petitions was later amended to allege that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 CD (3) (D).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The trial on the petitions to terminate parental rights began on February 7, 2006, and continued on various dates thereafter. Judge Crawford issued a memorandum of decision in which she denied the petitions to terminate parental rights on September 13, 2006.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court found that the petitioner had not proven by clear and convincing evidence any of the three grounds for termination of parental rights alleged. The court stated, in part, that \u201cthe evidence, in many instances was loose, equivocal and contradictory, and [the department] created the situation for the claim of no ongoing parent-child relationship. The underlying basis for the removal of the children, the alleged sexual abuse by father, appears to have been a pretext to remove the children. The evidence does not support a conclusion of acts of omission/eommission.\u201d The court did not provide an explanation for its conclusion that removing the children from the respondents\u2019 care was pretextual. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>acknowledge that the trier of fact is free to evaluate expert testimony as it sees fit, but we note that in its memorandum of decision, the court did not mention observations and opinions contained in the experts\u2019 reports pointing to the father as the perpetrator of the son\u2019s sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The court also rejected the department\u2019s permanency plan finding that adoption was not in the best interests of the children, but that reunification with the respondents was in the children\u2019s best interests. The court ordered the children to remain in the custody of the petitioner and ordered the department to file a new permanency plan with the goal of reunification. The petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The petitioner\u2019s first claim is that Judge Crawford improperly concluded that the petitioner had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the respondents had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation because the court reconsidered issues that had been decided during the trial on the neglect petitions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In ruling on the petitions to terminate the respondents\u2019 parental rights, the court noted that the three children had been adjudicated neglected on July 26, 2004, and that efforts by the department to reunify the father with the children were no longer appropriate. Nonetheless, the court discounted those factual findings, concluding that \u201c[t]he underlying basis for the removal of the children, the alleged sexual abuse by the father, appears to have been a pretext to remove the children.\u201d In a footnote, the court observed that the standard of proof in a trial on a neglect petition is a fair preponderance of the evidence. \u201cThis is a trial on a petition for [termination of parental rights] where the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Judge Crawford also disagreed with Judge Trombley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>finding that the son had been abused by the father. She found it significant that the son had not reported to anyone other than Corradi that his father had sexually molested him and was concerned that service providers and evaluators relied on Corradi\u2019s report. She also found that the petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the department \u201cmade reasonable efforts to reunify [the son] with [the respondents]. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the parents are unwilling or unable to benefit from such efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The petitioner argues that it was improper for Judge Crawford to revisit the question of whether the children were neglected and, in effect, nullify the prior finding of neglect. The petitioner claims that the issue of neglect is res judicata. We agree that during the adjudication of a petition for the termination of parental rights, a trial court may not reconsider the issue of neglect if the children were found to be neglected in a prior proceeding. The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes the relitigation of the finding of neglect.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s claim that a trial court may not reconsider the issue of neglect during a termination of parental rights proceeding presents a mixed question of fact and law because it involves the application of factual determinations to the statutory scheme for the protection of the well-being of children. In such circumstances, an appellate court employs the de novo standard of review. See, e.g., <em>Friezo </em>v. Friezo, 281 Conn. 166, 180, 914 A.2d 533 (2007). \u201cTo the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Savings Bank of Manchester </em>v. <em>Ralion Financial Services, Inc., </em>91 Conn. App. 386, 389, 881 A.2d 1035 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 sets forth the parameters within which the state may terminate parental rights. The portion of the statute relevant to the termination of parental rights on the basis of a respondent\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to achieve rehabilitation provides that \u201c[t]he Superior Court . . . may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that . . . (B) the child (i) has been found by the Superior Court ... to have been neglected or uncared for <em>in a prior proceeding . . </em>. and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\u201cThe purpose of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. . . . If the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words actually used because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. . . . Common sense must be used [when construing statutes] and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. . . . We must presume that each sentence, clause and phrase in a public act has a purpose and that the legislature did not intend to enact a meaningless law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Kachainy C., </em>67 Conn. App. 401, 411, 787 A.2d 592 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Pursuant to the procedural posture of this case, under \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (B) (i), the petitioner did not have to prove at the termination hearing that the children were neglected but only that the children had been found to be neglected in a prior proceeding. Here, the petitioner placed into evidence Judge Trombley\u2019s memorandum of decision finding the children neglected and the son abused, findings that were not challenged by way of an appeal. As a matter of law, the memorandum of decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>was clear and convincing evidence that the children had been found neglected in a prior proceeding.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Judge Crawford took issue with Judge Trombley\u2019s finding and reconsidered the issue under the clear and convincing standard of proof. The father argues before us that by putting into evidence facts that were before Judge Trombley during the trial on the neglect petitions, the petitioner invited Judge Crawford to reconsider whether the children were neglected. We disagree. The petitioner properly placed into evidence the facts that led to the orders of temporary custody and findings of neglect. Such evidence was necessary to consider the respondents\u2019 rehabilitative status vis-a-vis the causes for commitment and whether the causes of the commitment continue to exist. See <em>In re Cesar G., </em>56 Conn. App. 289, 294, 742 A.2d 428 (2000); see also <em>In re Allison G., </em>276 Conn. 146, 154 n.4, 883 A.2d 1226 (2005) (psychologist\u2019s report material in future proceedings to determine permanent custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">A finding of neglect is an integral part of the statutory scheme to protect the welfare of children and the parents\u2019 right to the custody and care of their children. \u201cA neglect petition is sui generis and, unlike a complaint and answer in the usual civil case, does not lead to a judgment for or against the parties named.\u201d <em>In re David L., </em>54 Conn. App. 185, 191, 733 A.2d 897 (1999). See footnote 21 of this opinion. In a neglect proceeding, the commissioner of children and families \u201cacts not to vindicate her personal rights but, acting for the state as parens patriae, to ensure, first and foremost, the child\u2019s safety and, second, a permanent placement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the child as expeditiously as possible.\u201d <em>In re Allison G., </em>supra, 276 Conn. 158-59. An adjudication of neglect has a concomitant purpose: it requires the court to issue specific steps to facilitate the reunification of the parent and child. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j); <em>In re Allison G., </em>supra, 160-61. \u201cAlthough the specific steps provide a benchmark by which the court measures whether either reunification or termination of parental rights is appropriate, the court necessarily will consider the underlying adjudication and the attendant findings. . . . Therefore, the adjudication and findings serve a dual function\u2014they provide a context to the court for the specific steps and they provide notice to the parents of issues that may be relevant to the court in determining a permanent plan for the child\u2019s custody.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Allison G., </em>supra, 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The hypothetical provided by our Supreme Court in <em>In re Allison G. </em>is on point with the issue in this appeal. \u201cFor example, in the adjudication of a neglect petition, the trial court could find that a parent had perpetrated abuse on his or her child or had knowingly allowed the abuse to occur but nevertheless denied responsibility for the harm. The department may then propose as one of the steps that the parent undergo counseling to understand the causes and consequences of abuse. In a subsequent proceeding, whether the parent ever acknowledged responsibility for the abuse would be relevant to the court\u2019s subsequent determination as to either reunification or termination of parental rights, irrespective of whether the parent had complied with that step.\u201d Id. In the case before us, the steps proposed by the petitioner to facilitate the mother\u2019s rehabilitation so that she could be reunited with the children, therefore, were predicated on the findings of neglect.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The decisions of our appellate courts make clear that to challenge the outcome of a proceeding in the statutory scheme of our child welfare law, a party must appeal timely from the adjudication of the separate proceedings in the trial court. In <em>In re Kachainy C., </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 401, the respondent mother claimed that it was improper for the trial court adjudicating the termination of parental rights petition to have relied on a finding made during a hearing on the extension of commitment because the finding was not made by clear and convincing evidence. The respondent mother did not appeal from the extension of commitment and finding that reunification efforts were no longer appropriate. Id., 412. This court concluded that the respondent mother\u2019s claim was not reviewable because \u201c[a]n extension of commitment is an immediately appealable final judgment. . . . The issue may not be raised as a collateral attack on the judgment terminating parental rights.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. The court \u201cadjudicating the termination petition was entitled to rely on [the prior] finding.\u201d Id., 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>In re Shamika F., </em>256 Conn. 383, 773 A.2d 347 (2001), the court held that an order of temporary custody is a final judgment for purposes of appeal and that those orders may not be \u201cpostponed\u201d until the final judgment terminating parental rights is rendered. Id., 384-85. \u201c[Temporary custody orders are immediately appealable because an immediate appeal is the only reasonable method of ensuring that the important rights surrounding the parent-child relationship are adequately protected . . . and, further, that an immediate appeal is the only way to ensure the protection of the best interests of children. We conclude, therefore, that the respondent\u2019s collateral attack on the temporary custody order, after the order terminating parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>has been entered, is a procedurally impermissible substitute for an appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 385-86;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> see also <em>Pamela B. </em>v. <em>Ment, </em>244 Conn. 296, 321, 709 A.2d 1089 (1998) (commitment legally supersedes order of temporary custody); <em>In re Carl O., </em>10 Conn. App. 428, 434, 523 A.2d 1339 (order of temporary custody expires once child found neglected), cert. denied, 204 Conn. 802, 525 A.2d 964 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">There are constitutional rights and public policy interests that support the appealable nature of orders that constitute a final judgment along the path to the termination of parental rights. See footnote 24 of this opinion. Moreover, our child welfare laws are designed in such a way that subsequent proceedings are predicated on findings made and orders issued in prior proceedings. Our sister states with similarly designed comprehensive child welfare laws also require an aggrieved party to appeal to contest interlocutory findings and orders of the trial courts of those states. See, e.g., <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Services, </em>98 Ark. App. 129, 242 S.W.3d 138 (2007); <em>S.J. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health &amp; Rehabilitative </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Services, </em>700 So. 2d 71 (Fla. App. 1997); <em>In re D.D., </em>643 S.E.2d 83 (N.C. App. 2007). \u201c[C]ourts and state agencies must keep in mind the constitutional limitations imposed [upon them when they undertake] any form of coercive intervention in family affairs . . .

Id., 405. When a parent has failed to challenge timely a court\u2019s finding, \u201cthe children\u2019s strong interest in stability counsels firmly against allowing a belated appellate challenge to that temporary order.\u201d Id. \u201c[A]ppeals are obligatory so that parents may act in the best interest of their children. A grave injustice would be committed against children if a parent were permitted to appeal from a judgment of temporary custody long after they had established a stable relationship with foster parents. We therefore protect the best interest of the children by requiring parents immediately to appeal decisions that . . . interfere substantially with their family integrity. Those parents must do so in a timely fashion not only to protect themselves, but also to protect the children.\u201d Id., 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On the basis of those same constitutional rights and public policy reasons, a trial court may not, in a subsequent proceeding, disregard and permit relitigation of, a factual or legal determination made or an issue decided in a prior proceeding. Such reconsideration is fundamentally inconsistent with the relevant statutory scheme and is unfair to the petitioner, who represents the state\u2019s parens patriae interest, as well as unfair to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the respondent parents and the children. The department sets about to do its work pursuant to the findings made and steps ordered pursuant to a trial on a neglect petition. Those findings and orders place the respondent parents on notice as to what is expected of them if they are to regain custody of their children.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The best interests of children is guided by their need for permanency; see <em>In re Jonathan M., </em>255 Conn. 208, 232, 764 A.2d 739 (2001); which cannot be achieved if there is no finality to the intermediate findings made along the path to termination of parental rights. We therefore conclude that a finding that a child is neglected and abused made by a trial court when adjudicating a neglect petition constitutes an appealable final judgment. If no appeal is filed in a timely fashion, the parents may not collaterally attack those findings during a termination of parental rights trial, and the trial court adjudicating the termination of parental rights is bound by the findings made in the prior proceeding. It was therefore improper for the court to disregard Judge Trombley\u2019s finding of neglect and to conclude that \u201cthe alleged sexual abuse by the father appears to have been a pretext to remove the children.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, the court\u2019s improper redetermination of the grounds for neglect was the basis for the rest of its findings and necessarily infected those findings, which cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The petitioner\u2019s second claim is that the court failed to give preclusive effect to the finding made on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>basis of the neglect proceeding that further efforts to reunify the father with the son were inappropriate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In his memorandum of decision on the neglect petitions, Judge Trombley stated, in part, that \u201c[i]n accordance with ... \u00a7 46b-129 (k) (2), and in consideration of the best interests of these three children and their need for permanency, this court finds, as to the father, that continued efforts by the department to reunify the father with any and all of these children are no longer appropriate. That finding is made upon clear and convincing evidence.\u201d The father failed to appeal from the court\u2019s finding of neglect and abuse as to him. In her memorandum of decision, however, Judge Crawford stated that \u201c[t]his court finds that [the department] failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it made reasonable efforts to reunify [the son] with his parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 17a-lllb (a) provides: \u201cThe Commissioner of Children and Families shall make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child unless the court ... (2) has approved a permanency plan other than reunification pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129.\u201d The Superior Court may grant a petition to terminate parental rights \u201cif it finds by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent . . . except that such finding is not required if the court has determined at a hearing pursuant to section 17a-lllb . . . that such efforts are not required. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 G).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The issue presented was resolved by this court in <em>In re Kachainy C., </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 401. The language of the statute \u201cis clear: A finding that it is no longer appropriate for the department to make reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>efforts to reunite the family must be made only once .... Common sense also tells us that it would be a waste of judicial resources to require courts to make redundant findings.\u201d Id., 412. For this reason, it was inappropriate for the court to reconsider whether the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite the son with the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The petitioner claims that the court improperly determined that the department failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify the mother with her children. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The record before us discloses that the son was adjudicated neglected and abused as a consequence of the father\u2019s sexual abuse and that he was living in circumstances and associations injurious to his well-being. As to the respondents\u2019 daughters, there was a substantial risk that harm would be perpetrated on them, too. They were being denied proper care and attention, emotionally and morally, and they were or would have been living under conditions, associations and circumstances injurious to their well-being. The steps Judge Trombley ordered for the mother were predicated on those findings. In order to determine whether the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the mother with the children, the steps and services ordered had to be viewed in the context of the findings of neglect. See <em>In re Allison G., </em>supra, 276 Conn. 160-61. Judge Crawford impermissibly determined, however, that there was no evidence of sexual abuse on the part of the father because the son never reported the abuse to anyone other than Corradi. Without placing the rehabilitative services offered by the department in the context of the father\u2019s sexual abuse and the mother\u2019s need for services, the court could not evaluate properly the department\u2019s efforts to reunify. For this reason, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>court improperly found that the department failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify the mother with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The petitioner\u2019s fourth claim is that the court\u2019s finding as to the parent-child relationship between the son and the respondents was clearly erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Parental rights may be terminated \u201cif the court finds that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child .... [Termination of a noncustodial parent\u2019s rights requires a finding that the child has no present memories or feelings for the natural parent.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Ilyssa G., </em>105 Conn.

Douglas was the son\u2019s therapist and met with the boy on a weekly basis from November, 2003, until the time Douglas testified. The son appeared to have no recollection of life prior to the time he spent in foster care. He never mentioned the respondents during his therapy sessions. Douglas opined that the son\u2019s not remembering the respondents is a mechanism he uses to cope with the trauma he sustained. \u201cThe psychological testimony from professionals is rightly accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>great weight in termination proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Nicolina T., </em>9 Conn.

App. 417, 424, 787 A.2d 608 (2001), aff'd, 262 Conn. 308, 813 A.2d 87 (2003). Judge Crawford found that the department removed the son from the respondents\u2019 care in August, 2002, and suspended the respondents\u2019 visits with the son in February, 2003, on the basis of Bowen\u2019s evaluation of the son.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court, however, found the documents on which Bowen relied to be unreliable and doubted that the father had abused the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, including the reports of the numerous experts in the mental health and social services fields who have been involved with this family, we cannot discern that the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship is the fault of the department. The father created the circumstances leading to the removal of his son from the family home and the termination of visitation by sexually assaulting the boy and failing to participate in a meaningful way in sexual abuse therapy. This fact was found at the neglect hearing and may not be reconsidered in the termination of parental rights trial. See part I of this opinion. Moreover, Judge Trombley found by clear and convincing evidence that efforts to reunify the father with his son were no longer appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">As to the mother, Judge Trombley found that efforts to reunify her and her children should be made if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>mother was willing to accept services from the department. Although the mother has refused to acknowledge that the father abused the son and there was much discussion about whether she needed to acknowledge that fact in order to receive services, the mother has not accepted that regardless of who molested her son, she needs therapy and support services to understand how to protect her children. Judge Trombley conditioned the mother\u2019s right to visit with her son on her complying with his orders for an evaluation and therapy. The mother did not appeal from those orders. Moreover, she cannot continue to live with the father and be reunited with her children. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship was a direct result of the son\u2019s being in foster care. See <em>In re Alexander C., </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 424.

[Our Supreme Court] concluded that temporary custody orders did so [conclude] the rights of the parties that further proceedings [could not] affect them . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Shamika F., </em>supra, 403; see also <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>224 Conn. 749, 757, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993) (temporary custody orders immediately appealable because immediate appeal is only reasonable method of ensuring important rights surrounding parent-child relationship adequately protected).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> During a trial on the termination of parental rights, the issue to be litigated with respect to failure to achieve personal rehabilitation; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii); is whether the respondent parents can be restored to a constructive useful role as a parent within a reasonable time considering the age and needs of the child or children. See <em>In re Danuael D., </em>51 Conn. App. 829, 840, 724 A.2d 546 (1999). That issue may be decided, in part, pursuant to a parent\u2019s success in complying with the court-ordered steps. Both the petitioner and respondent may put on evidence in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> Because we remand the cases for a new trial, we need not reach the remainder of the petitioner\u2019s claims and arguments as to her allegation of failure to achieve rehabilitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> The respondents have never appealed from the suspension of their visitation with their son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\"> We need not consider the petitioner\u2019s final claim that the court failed to give appropriate weight to her evidence, as the issue is not likely to occur on retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
