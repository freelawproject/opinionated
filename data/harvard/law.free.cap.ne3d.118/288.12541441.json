The trial court ordered appellee to serve four years in prison and to pay court costs. On February 17, 2016, appellee filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion that requested the court to seal his record of conviction. He asserted \"that he is eligible for a sealing of records pursuant to R.C. 2953.32.\" Appellant filed a written objection. On April 8, 2016, the court summarily denied appellee's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 19, 2017, the trial court indicated that it had received a \"letter\" that requested the court to seal\n   appellee's record of conviction. The court directed the Chief Probation Officer to investigate and set the matter for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On November 6, 2017, appellant filed an objection. Appellant first asserted that appellee did not properly serve and file his request to seal the record of his conviction. Appellant claimed that appellee's letter that requested the sealing of his conviction had not been filed with the court, and that appellant had not received a copy of the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant also objected to the merits of appellee's request. Appellant contended that appellee has not paid restitution or court costs and that appellant \"has a compelling interest in maintaining the record to ensure that [appellee] is not again put into such a position of trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 7, 2017, appellee's letter that requested the sealing of his records was filed with the court. Appellee asserted that his \"felony conviction has prevented [him] from many jobs\" and that he \"need[s] an opportunity to obtain a real job/career.\" Appellant filed a supplemental objection that asserted the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars appellee's second application to seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 9, 2017, the trial court held a hearing to consider appellee's motion. Appellee asserted that he had served his punishment and that the victims had been made whole. He stated that he has \"done [his] best to be a good citizen.\" Appellee further alleged that his \"health is ailing and [he] would just wish to be a free man again.\" When the prosecutor asked appellee whether anything had changed since he first requested the court to seal the record of his conviction, appellee responded, \"My health.\" Also, on November 22, 2017 appellee filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   letter that requested the court to \"dismiss court costs and judgements [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On November 29, 2017, the trial court granted appellee's motion to seal the record of his conviction. The court found that appellee \"is a first time offender, that no criminal proceedings are pending against [appellee], that [appellee] has been rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the Court and that the interest of [appellee] in having the records pertaining to his arrest sealed are not outweighed by any legitimate governmental need to maintain such records.\" The court also suspended appellee's court costs. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We initially point out that appellee did not file an appellate brief in this matter. When an appellee fails to file an appellate brief, App.R. 18(C) authorizes us to accept an appellant's statement of facts and issues as correct, and then reverse a trial court's judgment as long as the appellant's brief \"reasonably appears to sustain such action.\" In other words, an appellate court may reverse a judgment based solely on consideration of an appellant's brief.\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

For ease\n   of discussion, we first consider appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In its second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to waive, suspend, or modify appellee's payment of court costs. Appellant notes that R.C. 2947.23(C) allows a sentencing court to waive, suspend, or modify the payment of court costs \"at the time of sentencing or at any time thereafter.\" Appellant points out, however, that at the time of appellee's sentence, R.C. 2947.23(C) was not in effect and that the law required a criminal defendant to request the trial court to waive court costs at the time of sentencing. Appellant asserts that because R.C. 2947.23(C) was not in effect at the time of appellee's sentencing, appellee waived the issue and costs are res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} R.C. 2947.23(A)(1) governs the imposition of costs in criminal cases and provides in relevant part: \"In all criminal cases * * * the judge * * * shall include in the sentence the costs of prosecution * * * and render a judgment against the defendant for such costs.\" A trial court must include in the sentence the costs of prosecution and render a judgment against the defendant for costs, even if the defendant is indigent.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the time of appellee's sentencing, the General Assembly had not enacted a statute that vested trial courts with jurisdiction to consider motions to waive costs \"at any time.\" Thus, when the court sentenced appellee, it could not have retained jurisdiction that had yet to be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The following year, the defendant filed a second application to seal his record. The trial court again denied the defendant's application and concluded that the defendant was not entitled to file successive motions. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and concluded that the defendant was \"not entitled to relitigate the issues by filing a second application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In\n   <em>\n    Haney,\n   </em>\n   the court likewise concluded that the defendant was not entitled to file successive motions to seal the record of his conviction. In that case, the defendant claimed in both his first and second applications \"that he is now a responsible citizen and needs the expungement to improve his employment opportunities and economic well-being.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   court determined that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precluded the defendant's second application when the defendant previously raised the same arguments in his first applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Singo\n   </em>\n   the court concluded that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precludes a successive motion for \"sealing when there has been no change of circumstances since the filing of the offender's prior motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. In\n   <em>\n    Singo\n   </em>\n   , trial court denied the defendant's first application to seal. The court determined that the state's interest in maintaining the conviction outweighed the defendant's interest in having the record sealed. The defendant did not appeal. The next year, the defendant filed a second application to seal. He did not, however, allege that any circumstances had changed since he filed his first application. The trial court denied the second application. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment to deny the defendant's second application. The court explained that allowing defendants to file successive motions to seal the record of a conviction would allow defendants to \"file repeated motions for sealing in the hopes of obtaining a different\n   outcome, based on the same set of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 30} After our review in the case at bar, we believe that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precludes appellee's second application to seal the record of his conviction. Appellee did not establish that a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred since he first requested the trial court to seal the record of his conviction. Although appellee claims that his health has declined in the year and one-half since he first requested the court to seal his record, appellee did not elaborate how his health changed in a material way during the time that elapsed since he first requested the court to seal the record of his conviction. Furthermore, appellee's second application fails to raise any arguments that he could not have raised in his first application. Indeed, at the hearing none of the arguments appellee raised were incapable of being presented when he first requested the trial court to seal his record. We therefore agree with appellant that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precludes appellee's second application to seal the record of his conviction and that the trial court erred by granting appellee's second application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant's fourth assignment of error and reverse the trial court's judgment that granted appellee's application to seal the record of his conviction. Our disposition of appellant's fourth assignment of error renders its third and fifth assignments of error moot. We therefore do not address them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   JUDGMENT REVERSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Hoover, P.J. &amp; Harsha, J.: Concur in Judgment &amp; Opinion\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Given the absence of an argument from appellee and appellant's decision not to develop the issue, we choose to follow principles of\n    <em>\n     stare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     decisis\n    </em>\n    rather than engaging in a comprehensive analysis of the import of R.C. 1.58 upon R.C. 2947.23(C).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \"In 1979, R.C. 2953.32 was amended, replacing the word 'expungement' with the word 'sealing.' \"\n    <em>\n     State v.
