Appellant contends that it is immune from suit on the counterclaim filed by Appellees, Gordon M. Jenkins and Andrea Jenkins, on the basis of sovereign immunity. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, summary judgment is entered in favor of the Village and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following facts are undisputed and taken from the affidavits of Richard Bibbo, the Village Administrator at all time relevant to the complaint and counterclaim. The Bibbo affidavits, and the attachments thereto, are the only evidence before us, as Appellees offered no evidence in support of their opposition brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Effective December 1, 2012, Appellant passed an ordinance establishing a street light utility fee of four dollars per month for all residents and businesses within the corporate limits. A street light utility fee fund was established from which Appellant pays any and all necessary costs relating to the operation of street lights. The street light utility fee is collected in conjunction with other utilities provided by the Village through a unified monthly bill, which includes fees for garbage collection, and sewer and water service. Village of Rayland Ordinance No. 12-2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellees objected to the imposition of the street light utility fee and refused to pay it. They regularly deducted the four dollar fee, as well as any past due amount based on the four dollar fee, from their monthly utility payment. A notation explaining their refusal to pay the fee was written on their remittance stub and check. Similarly, when monthly late fees of ten dollars were assessed pursuant to Village of Rayland Ordinance No. 8-95, Appellees deducted both the past due and current street light fees and late fees from their monthly remittance. (9/2/16 Bibbo Aff. \u00b6 10.) In a letter to the Village dated February 20, 2013, Appellee, Michael Jenkins stated that he had no intention of paying the street light utility fee and he \"implore[d]\" Appellant to take him to court on the matter. (2/20/13 Letter, p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In June and July of 2013, Appellant issued two separate undated delinquency notices to Appellees. The delinquency notices read, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE VILLAGE RECORDS SHOW YOUR UTILITY BILL HAS NOT BEEN PAID BEFORE THE DUE DATE. AN ADDITIONAL LATE CHARGE OF $10.00 HAS BEEN ADDED TO YOUR BILL. IF THE BILL IS NOT PAID WITH FIVE (5) DAYS, YOUR WATER WILL BE SHUT OFF. THE BILL MUST BE PAID IN FULL BEFORE YOUR WATER WILL BE TURNED BACK ON.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first delinquency notice listed a past due amount of $50.00 and a scheduled shut off date of July 1, 2013. The second delinquency notice listed a past due amount of $64.00 and a scheduled shut off date of July 29, 2013. (Undated Delinquency Notices.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant concedes that Appellees' water service was terminated for non-payment of street light fees, but there is no averment regarding the date that water services were terminated or the length of time that Appellees were without water. (8/2/16 Bibbo Aff., \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2014, Appellant filed a complaint in the small claims division of the Jefferson County Court to recover $229.00 in past due fees from Appellees and requested an Order directing Appellees to pay their street light utility fee in the future. Case No. 2014-CVI-5. Appellees filed a single counterclaim alleging that the street light utility fee ordinance is unconstitutional. Appellees further alleged that actions undertaken by Appellant's employees constituted violations of the takings, free speech, and due process clauses of the Ohio Constitution. Appellees also asserted a wrongful termination of water services claim, alleging that their water service was terminated for their continuing refusal to pay the street light utility fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In their appellate brief, Appellees allege that Appellant's employees towed Appellees' car in order to gain access to the water valve on the property and damaged their yard in the process. Appellees further allege that Appellant harassed them at public meetings and pressured their landlord into ending their tenancy. However, Appellees offered no evidence in support of their opposition brief, so we cannot consider these allegations. In their appellate brief, Appellant concedes that its employees towed Appellees' car in order to access the shut-off valve, mistakenly citing the Bibbo affidavit, which contains no averment regarding the towing of Appellees' car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellees clearly state in their counterclaim that they were not alleging any federal claims or any state claims that may be preempted by federal claims. Based on the alleged denial by Appellant of water service to Appellees for 24 days (another allegation that is not supported by facts in the record), they seek compensatory, punitive, and other damages for inconvenience and annoyance in the amount of $750,000.00, as well as attorney's fees, interest and cost. Because the counterclaim met the amount in controversy requirement for the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas, the matter was transferred from the small claims division to the common pleas court on November 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On September 2, 2016, after the close of discovery, Appellant filed two motions for summary judgment: The first requested judgment on Appellant's claim to recover the delinquent utility and late fees, as well as an injunction imposing \"an ongoing requirement to pay $4.00 per month.\" (9/2/2017 Mot. for S.J., p. 4.) The second requested judgment on Appellees' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} With respect to the counterclaim, Appellant argued that the ordinance was constitutionally sound and that the Village had the authority to terminate Appellees' water service due to nonpayment of the unified utility bill in full. Appellant further argued that it was immune from liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. Appellant asserted that, although it was engaged in a proprietary function, Appellees failed to demonstrate any negligence on the part of the Village employees who terminated Appellees' water service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In Appellees' response to the motions for summary judgment, they argued that the termination of their water service for failure to pay their street light utility fee was a due process violation. They further argued that the imposition of the late fees, which were more than three times greater than the delinquent street light utility fees, constituted cruel and unusual\n   punishment. They asserted that municipalities may be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. 1983, despite the fact that they specifically renounced any and all federal claims in their counterclaim. Finally, they argued that Appellant was engaged in a proprietary function, and therefore could not assert an immunity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court denied both motions without any legal analysis. (1/24/2017 J.E.) This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} When a trial court denies a motion in which a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, that order denies the benefit of an alleged immunity and is therefore a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\n   <em>\n    Hubbell v.

R.C. 2744.02(A) sets forth the general rule of immunity for political subdivisions, stating: \"Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\" Five exceptions are set forth in subsection (B).

R.C. 2744.09(E). At least one Ohio intermediate court has recognized that claims based upon violations of Ohio statutes or the state constitution are not exempt from the application of Chapter 2744.

The functions of a political subdivision are\n   classified, for immunity purposes, as either governmental or proprietary. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1).

No. 1487,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%2050009\">\n    1992 WL 50009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Fourth District recognized the constitutionality of a municipality's decision to terminate water service when a citizen refused to pay the garbage component of a unified utility bill. The Fourth District observed that courts had recently begun to view garbage service as being related, like sewer service, to a city's attempt to provide \"a comprehensive public health and sanitation program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10 (internal citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Based upon the foregoing case law, appellate courts in Ohio recognized a common-law duty on the part of municipalities to provide water service when a water bill is paid in full. They have also carved out exceptions to this general duty based upon the relationship between water service and an unpaid utility to determine whether a municipality acts reasonably in terminating water service for failure to pay the other unpaid utility bill. In other words, Ohio appellate courts have recognized the authority of municipalities to enforce payment of a unified utility bill through the termination of a related utility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellees assert that water and street lights are completely unrelated and that street lights are not an essential service. Appellees assert that the Village had the authority to terminate Appellees' street light service, but that it was unreasonable to terminate their water service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} At first blush, the termination of Appellees' water service appears to be unreasonable. The termination of water service to a residence is a severe penalty, particularly where the water bill for the residence is paid in full. Appellant had another option, which it pursued several months later in small claims court. However, even though Appellant may collect past due amounts, the existence of an adequate remedy at law would prohibit the trial court from issuing an injunction to compel Appellees to pay their street light utility fee in the future. Based upon the position taken by Appellees, it appears that the Village would have to repeatedly collect utility fees through the court system, which would be unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Therefore, we conclude that the Village did not act unreasonably in terminating Appellees' water service. In addition to our unwillingness to impose a burden upon the Village to pursue the non-payment of Appellees' street light fee bill through the court system ad infinitum, several other considerations support our conclusion that the Village acted reasonably. First, Appellees' proposed penalty for their refusal to pay the street light fee would be impossible to effectuate. Appellees' argument assumes that they only receive the benefit of one street light in the Village, that is, the street light nearest to their property. Appellees reason that the penalty for failure to pay their street light fee should have been to terminate service to that single street light. To the contrary, Appellees derive a general benefit from all of the street lights in the Village. The street lights facilitate safe passage on the Village streets and also provide increased security for citizens in their homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Further, it would have been impossible to fashion a penalty for failure to pay the street light fee for a single delinquent utility customer without affecting all of the other customers in the Village. Street light service is not severable like water service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 31} This indivisibility of the service was also present in\n   <em>\n    Spofforth\n   </em>\n   , supra. The city terminated Spofforth's water service for his failure to pay his garbage bill. Had the city terminated Spofforth's garbage service, the penalty would have been imposed upon Spofforth and his neighbors alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Next, Appellees argue that street lights are not an essential service. On the contrary, street lights provide an important benefit to all of the citizens of the Village. According to Bibbo, the Village provides street light utility service to promote the health and safety of its residents. (8/2/2016 Bibbo Aff., \u00b6 10.) The Ordinance reads, in pertinent part, \"Whereas the Council of the Village of Rayland has determined that it is in the best interest of the residents of the Village of Rayland to continue to operate a street light system throughout the village in order to promote the general health, safety, and welfare of its residents and businesses....\" Ordinance No. 12-2012. Although street lights and water service are not so interrelated that they can be \"rightfully considered one transaction,\" they are nonetheless part of a program for the safety and general welfare of the citizens of the Village.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Finally, it is important to distinguish this case from cases where a utility customer contests the validity of a bill. Appellees could have challenged the constitutionality of the street light fee through\n   the court system, but chose instead to flout the law. While other Village residents paid their street light fees, Appellees continued to receive the benefit of the utility without paying for it. Moreover, Appellees were twice put on notice that their water service would be terminated for failure to pay the past due balance on their unified utility bill. They continued to flout the law at their own risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Based upon the foregoing analysis, we find that Appellant's sole assignment of error has merit. To the extent that Appellees allege intentional acts on the part of the Village employees, or state constitutional violations, Appellant is statutorily immune from suit. Further, Appellees have failed to demonstrate the existence of a duty on the part of the Village to provide water service to a citizen that refused to pay another utility included on a unified bill. Because Appellant was engaged in a proprietary function, and Appellees have failed to show that municipal employees acted negligently in terminating their water service, the Village is immune from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 35} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and summary judgment is entered in favor of the Village on Appellees' counterclaim, on the basis of sovereign immunity. This matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Robb, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
