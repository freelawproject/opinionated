The plaintiff argues that because at least one of the Merit Board members who participated in this termination decision was appointed without proper authorization, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Dart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20143684-B\">\n    2017 IL App (1st) 143684-B\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20Ill.%20Dec.%20735\">\n    414 Ill.Dec. 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.E.3d%201\">\n    81 N.E.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Merit Board's decision was a nullity and void from inception. Accordingly, the plaintiff seeks reinstatement or, in the very least, remand for a hearing before a properly constituted Merit Board. In the alternative, the plaintiff contends that the Merit Board's decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence and lacking cause. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was employed as a correctional officer with the CCDOC for more than nine years, beginning on November 1, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 On July 9, 2013, the defendant, Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart (Sheriff), filed a complaint with the Merit Board seeking to remove the plaintiff from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The defendant Merit Board is an administrative body created by statute, and its members are appointed by the Sheriff and approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners (County Board). 55 ILCS 5/3-7002 (West 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Sheriff's complaint alleged that between December 29, 2012, and April 13, 2013, without authorization, the plaintiff failed to appear at scheduled work shifts for a total of 96 hours. The complaint further alleged that in February 2012, the Sheriff's Attendance Review Unit (ARU) counseled the plaintiff regarding unauthorized absence and the options available to him to apply for different types of extended leave, which the plaintiff refused. According to the complaint, later in 2012, the Sheriff served the plaintiff with four unauthorized absence disciplinary action forms, a written reprimand and six suspension days, but the absences continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 The complaint alleged that by his actions, the plaintiff violated the following rules: (1) general order 3.8, which requires employees to obtain proper authorization prior to or immediately after the need for an absence and permits an employee under the collective bargaining agreement who incurs 80 hours of unauthorized absences to be recommended to the Merit Board for termination; (2) Sheriff's order 11.4.1.1, which provides all of the options available to employees to authorize an absence or obtain extended leave if necessary; and (3) article X of the Cook County Sheriff's Department Merit Board Rules and Regulations (Cook County Sheriff's Department Merit Board Rules and Regulations, art. X (eff. Jan. 2008) ), which requires that no correctional officer violate any of the general orders, special orders, directives, or rules and regulations of the Sheriff's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 The plaintiff's complaint was assigned to Merit Board member, John R. Rosales, and Rosales was the hearing officer that presided over the evidentiary hearing in the plaintiff's case. That evidentiary hearing was held on July 17, 2014, and the following relevant evidence was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 Investigator Georgia Garcia from the Sheriff's Office of Professional Review (OPR) testified that in 2012 she was assigned to investigate allegations of unauthorized absences involving the plaintiff. Garcia received a complaint register from the ARU alleging that the plaintiff had accumulated 96 hours of unauthorized absences. She explained that the ARU keeps track of all unauthorized absences and counsels and disciplines employees, up until an employee acquires 80 hours of unauthorized absences. At that point, the matter is forwarded to OPR, pursuant to Sheriff's order 11.4.1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 Garcia testified that after receiving the complaint register, she reviewed the plaintiff's attendance records and counseling forms from the ARU and spoke to personnel to confirm the number of unauthorized absences the plaintiff had accumulated. Garcia also interviewed the plaintiff on April 23, 2013, in the presence of a union representative. According to Garcia, during that interview, the plaintiff explained that the 96 hours of absences were due to medication he was taking that made him drowsy. The plaintiff told Garcia that because of this medication he would sleep past the time he needed to call into the Sheriff's medical line to report his absences. Garcia testified that the plaintiff did not tell her the name his medication or the reason for taking it. The plaintiff also never told Garcia that he had a problem with alcohol dependency. In addition, Garcia stated that during her investigation, she never received any information about the plaintiff's alcoholism from any peer or employee support groups. Based on her investigation, Garcia concluded that the Sheriff's allegations of violations of the general orders were substantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 On cross-examination, Garcia acknowledged that in the course of her investigation she did not learn that prior to December 29, 2012, the plaintiff had been on disability leave. She acknowledged that an employee's time sheets only show when an employee is absent and do not reflect if an employee is making an effort to see a Cook County Medical Unit (CC Medical Unit) physician to obtain clearance to return to work after a disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 Former Sheriff's ARU supervisor Prentiss Jones next testified that he was instrumental in drafting Sheriff's order 11.4.1.1, governing unauthorized absences, disciplinary actions related to such absences, and all options available to employees in achieving authorized attendance status. Jones explained that this order had been created, among other reasons, to address safety concerns in the CCDOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 According to Jones, under the order, the threshold number of unauthorized hours that would trigger referral to OPR was 80. However, before a complaint register was issued to OPR, the ARU followed a standard procedure. First, for every unauthorized absence of at least one hour that was deemed actionable, an employee would be brought in for counseling. If multiple infractions of the attendance policy continued, the employee would be progressively disciplined and continually reminded not to exceed 80 hours of unauthorized absences. After any disciplinary action, the employee could file a grievance with the legal department, challenging that action. One purpose for the grievance procedure was to protect any medical information that the employee felt uncomfortable disclosing to the ARU and still permit the\n   employee to be placed back into authorized status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 Jones testified that the plaintiff visited the ARU on at least four occasions during which his options for obtaining authorized status were explained. The first such meeting and counseling session occurred on February 24, 2012, during which the plaintiff was provided with an unauthorized absence counseling form and a family medical leave absence (FMLA) packet and advised on obtaining disability. According to Jones, the plaintiff indicated he did not plan on applying for authorized status by checking the box on the counseling form, dating, and signing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 Jones confirmed that additional counseling meetings with the plaintiff were conducted on February 24, 2012, April 19, 2012, June 20, 2012, and August 14, 2012. These corresponded to disciplinary forms submitted against the plaintiff on April 19, 2012 (for an absent late call on April 14, 2012), June 20, 2012 (for no personal time), and August 10, 2012 (for no holiday time).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 Jones acknowledged that the plaintiff filed three grievances with the legal department but that all three were denied with a recommendation for suspension time in order to follow the ARU's progressive discipline procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 The deputy director of human resources of CCDOC, Sharon Little, next testified that after her investigation into the matter it was her conclusion that the plaintiff had violated Sheriff's order 11.4.1.1. Little confirmed that the plaintiff was \"absent no call\" from work on December 29, 2012, and on January 1 through January 10, 2012. She also confirmed that the plaintiff was \"absent late call\" on February 20, 2012, and March 19, 2013. She explained that this meant that the plaintiff had called in after the one-hour-before-shift requirement. Little testified that these unauthorized absences totaled 96 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18 Little next acknowledged that the plaintiff did apply and was granted disability leave at a later date but testified that this did not negate any part of the 96 hours of previously unauthorized absences that he had accumulated. Little similarly acknowledged that the plaintiff applied for FMLA leave in April 9, 2013, but explained that he was denied this benefit because he had not accumulated the requisite number of hours in his previous year of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 19 Little also testified that she scrutinized the plaintiff's absences after April 2013, which revealed a pattern of abuse. She explained that plaintiff had several unauthorized absences that coincided with regular days off, which meant that the plaintiff was extending his weekends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 20 Little also confirmed that all employees that reach 40 hours of unauthorized absences are sent a certified letter informing them of their unauthorized status and options available to them to return to authorized status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21 After the Sheriff presented its case, the plaintiff testified on his own behalf. He stated that he was currently on disability leave for alcohol dependency. The plaintiff averred that he first realized he had a problem with alcohol dependency in late 2012. As a result in August 2012, he spoke to Michael Goldman from the CCDOC's Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Goldman assesses employees and determines what, if any, treatment he or she needs. Based on their conversation, Goldman recommended that the plaintiff join an outpatient treatment program, and the plaintiff entered such a program between September 5, 2012, and October 22, 2012. The plaintiff suffered a relapse and was hospitalized from October 26, 2012, through November 8, 2012. He reentered\n   intensive outpatient treatment from November 9, 2012, through December 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 22 The plaintiff explained that he was on authorized disability leave while in treatment and that prior to being permitted to return to work he needed clearance from a physician in the CC Medical Unit. Accordingly, beginning on December 17, 2012, he began calling that unit to schedule an appointment with a county physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 23 The plaintiff acknowledged that he did not report to work on December 29, 2012, but stated that he was not aware that his disability had ended the day before. The plaintiff testified that he could not contact the CC Medical Unit to make his appointment on December 29 or December 30 because those dates fell on a weekend. He explained that he waited until Monday, December 31, 2012, to call again, but no one answered the phone. He did not attempt to call on January 1 because he knew it was a holiday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 24 The plaintiff finally made contact with the CC Medical Unit on January 2, 2013. The plaintiff informed Dr. Manikowski, who was the county physician responsible for clearing him before he could return to work, that he was not feeling well. Dr. Manikowski advised him that he would be excused from any absences so long as she provided him with a note stating that he was under her care for alcoholism. The plaintiff never followed up by calling his employer's medical line to inform them of these intended absences. Instead, the plaintiff admitted, he was absent from work from January 2, 2013, through January 10, 2013, and returned to work on January 11, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 25 The plaintiff also admitted that he was absent from work on February 20, 2013, March 19, 2013, and April 13, 2013. He explained that on those mornings, he woke up late due to sleep medication he was taking for his alcoholism and therefore had to make absent late calls to work. The plaintiff introduced into evidence a doctor's note indicating that on these dates \"patient could not attend to work due to side effect of medication.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 26 The plaintiff acknowledged that since 2012 he has suffered two relapses. He stated that in the spring of 2014 he entered an inpatient treatment program, at the suggestion of EAP. Immediately afterwards, he entered an intensive outpatient treatment program to limit the possibility of relapse. The plaintiff confirmed that since spring 2014, he has been on disability leave but stated that he intends to return to work once he is cleared by the CC Medical Unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 27 On cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that this was the first time anyone from the Sheriff's department was hearing about his claim of alcohol dependency. Furthermore, he confirmed that on at least five occasions, he was given all options for authorized leave by the ARU but did not take advantage of any them. The plaintiff also acknowledged that ultimately it was his responsibility to remain in authorized status regarding his attendance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 28 CCDOC Deputy Peter Cozzi next testified that he worked for the CCDOC's Peer Assistance Program, helping correctional officers cope with adverse life situations, including alcoholism. Cozzi testified that after the plaintiff contacted him about his alcoholism, Cozzi had the plaintiff evaluated and placed in an inpatient treatment program. Based on his experience, Cozzi testified that the plaintiff's recovery efforts were genuine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 29 CCDOC Sergeant Craig Johnson next testified that he was the plaintiff's immediate supervisor for about a year and a half in 2004 and then again for about six\n   months in 2013. Johnson testified that the plaintiff was a good employee who followed direct orders and got along well with fellow coworkers.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 30 On cross-examination, Johnson admitted that he had no information about the plaintiff's unauthorized absences. He also acknowledged that such absences can create security risks, increase overtime costs, and damage the morale of good officers, who are forced to work extra shifts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b6 31 On January 15, 2015, the Merit Board issued its decision, terminating the plaintiff's employment as of July 8, 2013. That decision was signed by Rosales and seven other members of the Merit Board. In its decision, the Merit Board found that the plaintiff was absent from scheduled work shifts which totaled an excess of 80 hours. The Merit Board further found that the Sheriff had proven by preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff violated each of the \"general order[s], Sheriff's order[s] and rules and regulations as set forth in the complaint.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 32 On February 5, 2015, the plaintiff sought administrative review of the Merit Board's decision in the circuit court. On March 3, 2016, the circuit court remanded the cause to the Merit Board asking that the Merit Board \"include findings of fact regarding the [plaintiff's] defense of alcoholism\" and \"refer to the specific rules that were violated and sustained by the Merit Board and not simply refer to the complaint.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 33 No new hearing was held by the Merit Board on remand. Instead, the Merit Board issued its second decision on June 1, 2016, again terminating the plaintiff as of July 8, 2013. This decision was practically identical to the original decision, except that in the findings/conclusions section it clarified that having given \"due consideration\" to the evidence of the plaintiff's \"alcohol dependency or alcoholism,\" the Merit Board nonetheless found that the Sheriff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff violated \"General Order 3.8, Sheriff's Order 11.4.1.1 and Cook County Sheriff's Department Merit Board Rules and Regulations, Article X, Paragraph B.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 34 On August 5, 2016, the plaintiff again sought administrative review of the Merit Board's decision in the circuit court. On February 22, 2017, the circuit court affirmed that decision. The plaintiff now appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    \u00b6 35 II. ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b6 36 A. The Implications of Rosales's Improper Appointment\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00b6 37 On appeal, the plaintiff first asks this court to vacate as void the Merit Board's termination decision on the basis that at least one of the Merit Board members involved in issuing that decision, Rosales, was improperly appointed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    In support,\n    he cites to\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20143684-B\">\n     2017 IL App (1st) 143684-B\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20Ill.%20Dec.%20735\">\n     414 Ill.Dec. 735\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.E.3d%201\">\n     81 N.E.3d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     appeal denied\n    </em>\n    , No. 122392,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=417%20Ill.%20Dec.%20845\">\n     417 Ill.Dec. 845\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548485,12548486,12548487,12548488,12548489,12548490,12548491,12548492,12548493,12548494,12548495,12548496,12548497,12548498,12548499,12548500,12548501,12548502,12548503,12548504\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/764/\">\n     89 N.E.3d 764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Ill.

The Sheriff contends that this issue is waived for purposes of appeal because the plaintiff failed to raise it in a timely manner below, thereby depriving this court of a full record on which to assess his claim. In addition, the Sheriff argues that the\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    decision is not relevant to the issue before us because the final decision issued by the Merit Board, from which the plaintiff now appeals, was never signed by or presided over by Rosales. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b6 39 While it is true that generally issues or defenses not raised before an administrative agency will not be considered for the first time on administrative review ( 735 ILCS 5/3-110 (West 2012) ), our courts have repeatedly held that waiver serves as an admonition on the parties and not a limitation on this court's jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Texaco-Cities Service Pipeline Co. v.

In support, he attaches a voluminous appendix with documents he claims are responses to his FOIA requests, showing the terms and the dates of appointment for those members. However, since these allegations are raised for the first time in the plaintiff's reply brief and the documents attached are not part of the record on appeal, we are not at liberty to consider them for purposes of this appeal.
