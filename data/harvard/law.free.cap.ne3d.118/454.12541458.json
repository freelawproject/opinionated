The trial court erred by failing to grant the appellant's motion to dismiss due to preindictment delay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   2. The trial court erred by admitting evidence of prior acts as said evidence did not meet the requirements of Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   3. The guilty verdict cannot stand as the state failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find some merit to the appeal and affirm the trial court's judgment denying Hart's motion to dismiss for preindictment delay. However, we reverse Hart's convictions and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Hart was charged with one count of rape with a sexually violent predator specification; one count of corruption of a minor; and one count of kidnapping with sexual motivation and sexually violent predator specifications. Prior to trial, Hart filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing he was prejudiced by preindictment delay. The offenses allegedly occurred in October 1998, and Hart was indicted in October 2016. The trial court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On the eve of trial, the state filed a notice of intent to introduce other acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). Hart's trial counsel sought to exclude the other acts evidence on grounds that the evidence was inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) and because the notice was untimely. The trial court admitted the evidence over defense objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The victim, C.H., testified at trial that on or about October 12, 1998, she and her friend T.J., who were students at Shaw High School in East Cleveland, decided to cut school. While they were walking down the street, they observed a car driven by someone whom T.J. knew but C.H. did not. They entered the vehicle, which was occupied by two men including Hart, and drove to a brick, ranch style house in \"the Miles area\" of Cleveland. (Tr. 290-291.) At the house, T.J., C.H., Hart, and the driver of the car went directly into a TV room in the basement where a third man was playing video games. On one side of the room, a doorway opened into a laundry room. On the other side of the room, a doorway opened into a small room that contained a weight bench and some weights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At first, C.H., T.J., Hart, and the driver sat on couches in the basement drinking and smoking. After awhile, T.J. and the driver went into the laundry room, and Hart began fondling C.H.'s breasts and kissing her neck in the presence of the third man, who was playing video games. (Tr. 296.) C.H. told him \"no,\" and stood up to walk out of the house. (Tr. 299-300.) Hart blocked her exit and pushed her onto a weight bench in the weight room, where he removed her pants and held her down by the wrists while he put on a condom. C.H. alleges that Hart then vaginally raped her. (Tr. 300-303.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After the rape, C.H. told T.J., who was still in the laundry room, that it was time to go. The girls walked to C.H.'s sister's house in East Cleveland where she called her mother and reported what happened. C.H.'s mother took her to Huron Hospital where a rape kit was collected. C.H. spoke with the police at the hospital, and a detective later went with C.H. to the house where the rape occurred for identification purposes. However, C.H. did not hear from the police again until the summer of 2016. (Tr. 311-312.) By that time, investigators had discovered that DNA from the rape kit matched Hart's DNA in the Combined DNA Index System (\"CODIS\"), a national database used to collect and store DNA profiles from convicted offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} T.J. testified at trial and confirmed that she and C.H. cut school one day in October 1998 and went to an unknown man's house in the Miles area. According to T.J., C.H. was emotional when they left the house because the man she was with \"possibly took it too far.\" (Tr. 372.) T.J. explained that C.H. \"probably did not want to do what they did.\" (Tr. 372.) However, T.J. also stated that C.H. went with Hart into the weight room voluntarily. (Tr. 370.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A.P., a victim from a prior criminal case, testified over objection that she was sexually assaulted by Hart in 1996 when she was 15-years old. A.P. explained that her friend Ann, pretending to be A.P., arranged to meet Hart at Ann's house. Hart and his friend picked up Ann and A.P. and took them to a house on Cleveland's west side near Denison Avenue. They went directly into the basement of the house where A.P. soon found herself alone with Hart. (Tr. 453.) A.P. testified that Hart grabbed her breasts and tried to pull her shorts down. Hart forcibly rubbed A.P.'s vagina, but before he could rape her, A.P. escaped out of the house. (Tr. 457.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Detective Sonya Dziuba testified that she conducted the investigation after investigators discovered the CODIS \"hit\" that identified Hart as the perpetrator of C.H.'s rape. When Dziuba called Hart and told him she was investigating \"an old case,\" he asked, \"Is this about a rape?\" (Tr. 572.) Dziuba informed Hart that she could neither confirm nor deny the circumstances of the old case, and Hart indicated that he did not want to talk to her. Dziuba did not speak with Hart again until after\n   he was arrested and she executed a search warrant to obtain a buccal swab for his DNA, which again matched the DNA in the rape kit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After hearing all the evidence, the jury reached an impasse in their deliberations and the court gave them a\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   charge. A juror failed to appear for service the following day, and the deliberations began anew. Ultimately, the jury found Hart guilty on all counts, and the court found him guilty of the sexually violent predator specifications. The kidnapping and corruption of a minor charge merged with the rape conviction, and the court sentenced Hart to ten years to life in prison on the rape conviction and sexually violent predator specification. Hart now appeals his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preindictment Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In the first assignment of error, Hart argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for preindictment delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The statute of limitations for a criminal offense is the defendant's primary protection against overly stale criminal charges.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

But Hart has no story. Unlike Luck, who claimed she acted in self-defense, Hart has told us nothing about the events of that day. In fact, Hart asserted in his motion for preindictment delay that \"his own memory of what did or did not occur on that day in 1998 has faded due to the passage of time.\" (Motion to dismiss for preindictment delay at 4.) But, as previously stated, faded memories are not sufficient to establish actual prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Hart also asserts that had the case been prosecuted sooner, three of the four witnesses would still have been alive and \"could have provided relevant testimony concerning what did or did not occur on the day in question. Because the police failed to pursue the investigation, that relevant testimony is lost.\" Hart claims the driver of the car and the third individual in the basement, who was playing video\n   games, observed Hart and the victim and \"could show that the interactions between the victim and the defendant did not amount to the actions that gave rise to the indictment.\" (Motion to dismiss for preindictment delay at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Hart also asserts that his grandmother, who owned the home where the alleged rape occurred, spoke with the victim on the day of the incident and therefore \"could shed further light onto the nature of the interaction between the defendant and the victim that day and other information that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   exculpate the defendant.\" (Motion to dismiss for preindictment delay at 5, emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Finally, Hart contends he was prejudiced by the unavailability of Detective Nathaniel Pursley, who was subpoenaed for trial but failed to appear. Detective Pursley was one of the original investigators in this case in 1998. But Hart tells us nothing about how the testimony of these missing witnesses would have minimized or eliminated the impact of the state's evidence and bolstered the defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.

The state argues the evidence demonstrated Hart's motive, intent, preparation, and plan to target vulnerable teenage girls with intent to be sexually gratified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Although the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, Williams was charged with multiple counts of rape, kidnapping, and unlawful sexual conduct with a minor after he allegedly molested a 14-year old boy. Williams had become the child's mentor in his local church and groomed him for a period of time before the sexual assaults began. Prior to impaneling the jury, the state moved to admit evidence that Williams had had a similar relationship with a 16-year-old member of the high school swim team Williams had coached. In support of its motion, the state argued that Williams's relationship with the swimmer paralleled the relationship he had with his mentee. According to the state, both relationships \"indicated a course of conduct constituting a common plan, demonstrated a distinct pattern of sexual conduct constituting modus operandi, and by reasonable inference, tended to prove Williams's intent to achieve sexual gratification with teenage males.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The trial court in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   allowed the evidence to be admitted, but gave a cautionary instruction before the evidence was presented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. The trial court reiterated this instruction prior to deliberations, and the jury found Williams guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Williams appealed his convictions, arguing the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior criminal acts with another teenage boy. After conducting the three-step analysis described above, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the evidence was admissible. First, the court found that the swimmer's testimony was relevant because it tended \"to show the motive Williams had and the preparation and plan he exhibited of targeting, mentoring, grooming, and abusing teenage boys.\" The court noted that the swimmer's testimony also rebutted the suggestion offered by the defense during opening statements that the victim had falsely accused Williams of abuse with the hope of getting out of trouble at school. The court also found the swimmer's testimony that \"Williams received 'some type of sexual gratification' \" was relevant to show\n   Williams's intent to receive sexual gratification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Therefore, with respect to the first step of the analysis, the court determined that the swimmer's testimony was relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   court also determined, in the second step of the analysis, that the state did not offer the testimony to prove that Williams's conduct was in conformity with his bad character. In making this conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   court found that the swimmer's testimony demonstrated Williams's plan and preparation to target teenage males, who had no father figure, in order to gain their trust and confidence for the purpose of grooming them for sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Finally, the court determined, in the third step of the analysis, that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The court reasoned that the limiting instructions \"lessened the prejudicial effect\" of the swimmer's testimony and corroborated the victim's testimony, which had been disputed by Williams. Moreover, the court concluded that the swimmer's testimony was probative because \"it helped prove motive, preparation, and plan on the part of Williams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   took time and planning to groom his victims. Hart could not have planned on raping C.H. in advance because he did not know he was going to have the opportunity for sex until he and his friend happened to pick up C.H. and T.J., who were supposed to be in school. Although Hart's prior case with A.P. demonstrates possible prior planning because he prearranged the meeting by phone, there is no evidence that Hart prearranged his encounter with C.H. Therefore, any evidence of prior planning and scheming in A.P.'s case was irrelevant since there was no evidence of prior planning or scheming in this case. The opportunity for rape arose spontaneously, and Hart simply took advantage of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Furthermore, Hart's motive and intent to obtain sexual gratification is inherent in any rape case. Therefore, the state did not need any extrinsic evidence to prove Hart's motive or intent. And since there is nothing unique or unusual about Hart's criminal conduct, there was no evidence of a modus operandi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Hart's assault of A.P. is strikingly similar to his assault on C.H. Both victims were 15-year-old girls. Hart and a friend picked up each of the victims, purchased alcohol and offered it to the teens before arriving at a house where Hart directed his victims to the basement where he assaulted them. He even restrained both victims in the same manner, by holding their wrists. But these similarities can be viewed as nothing more than a propensity for corrupting and raping minors, and Hart's conduct in conformity with that character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 41} As previously stated, the third step of the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   analysis requires the court to consider whether the probative value of the prior criminal acts is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the trial court gave a limiting instruction prior to deliberations to lessen the prejudice caused by the prior bad acts evidence. Although we may presume that the jury followed this instruction, the similarities between this case and Hart's prior criminal conduct is hard to ignore, and the prior case offers nothing probative. Moreover, the risk of unfair prejudice resulting from the wrongful inclusion of other acts evidence \"is 'particularly high when the other acts are very similar to the charged offense or of an inflammatory nature.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although T.J. testified that C.H. was upset following her encounter with Hart in the weight room, T.J. testified that C.H. went with Hart into the weight room \"willingly.\" (Tr. 370.) Therefore, the jury's determination was necessarily based on the victim's credibility vis-a-vis the defendant's version of the facts. In a \"he said/she said\" case, where credibility is paramount, we cannot say that the erroneous admission of other acts evidence was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Therefore, the second assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 44} We affirm the trial court's judgment denying Hart's motion to dismiss.

The victim claimed that after she and the others had smoked marijuana for a bit, her friend and another guy went to a separate room. It was then, while she and Hart were on the couch with another male who continued to play video games and who was later identified by Hart as being deceased at the time of trial, that Hart started forcefully fondling and kissing her, despite the victim's panicked protestations. The victim stood up and began walking toward the exit, but she was blocked by Hart who then forced her into the weight room. Importantly, the victim claimed her friend had left the room by that time, so the deceased witness was the only person other than the victim and Hart to have observed the events as they unfolded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 51} According to the victim's friend, after the group sat around for a bit, the victim voluntarily went into the separate room with Hart and the friend did not observe any of the events as described by the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Thus, and contrary to the lead opinion's conclusion that Hart did not have a story or version of events, Hart is not relying on broad assertions of missing evidence to establish prejudice - he presented a tangible connection between the deceased witness and his defense.

Moreover, the lead opinion recognizes that Hart's story was essential to the conviction: \"the jury's determination was necessarily based on the victim's credibility vis-a-vis the defendant's version of the facts.\" Lead opinion at \u00b6 43. Because the victim's credibility was essential to the state's case, it cannot be concluded that the defendant failed to demonstrate actual prejudice under the first prong of the preindictment-delay analysis.

For example, most juries are instructed, as they were in this case, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [e]vidence was received about the commission of other acts than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for a limited purpose. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conforming or in accordance with that character.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   If you find that evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purposes of deciding whether it proves, A, the absence of mistake or accident, or B, the defendant's motive, opportunity, intent, or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offense charged in this trial, or C, knowledge of circumstances surrounding the offense charged in this trial, or D, the identity of the person who committed the offense in this trial. That evidence cannot be considered for any other purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Evid.R. 404(B) provides a nonexhaustive list of alternatives for admitting other acts evidence. Not all factors are relevant in every case such that the above instruction is always appropriate. The proponent of the evidence must demonstrate the applicability of one or more of the exceptions. It is not enough to simply cite them all and let the jury figure out which one applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The lead opinion thoroughly analyzes the issue under\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125145\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/521/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5695\">\n    2012-Ohio-5695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20N.E.2d%201278\">\n    983 N.E.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state, however, is not contending that this is a \"grooming\" case, one in which the defendant systematically takes steps to expose a child to sexual material with the goal of reducing the child's inhibitions to prepare the child for sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. The state claimed that the other acts evidence demonstrated a scheme, a pattern, or modus operandi because both girls were plied with alcohol and then sexually assaulted.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   has no relevance to the Evid.R. 404(B) discussion in this case other than setting forth the black-letter framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The starting point of the analysis should always be the stated reason upon which the trial court admitted the evidence, or if the record is silent as to the trial court's reasoning, the proponent's stated reason for seeking to admit the evidence. According to the trial court, in this case, the other acts evidence was admitted for the express purpose to demonstrate Hart's motive or intent \"to take advantage of young girls when the situation presents itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Taking advantage of a victim whenever the opportunity arises is the quintessential propensity evidence prohibited under Evid.R. 404(B). The trial court permitted the evidence for the purpose of\n   demonstrating that if Hart has the opportunity to sexually assault a teenaged girl, he will. I would hold that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence under its stated rationale. According to the trial court, there was no alternative purpose for the admission of the character evidence; it simply proved Hart's propensity to act in conformity therewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 60} The state concedes the point through its silence. On appeal, the state seeks to affirm the evidentiary judgment on a ground other than relied on by the trial court. The state contends that the other acts evidence of the prior sexual assault was probative of a common plan or scheme. According to the state, the evidence admitted under Evid.R. 404(B) in this case \"clearly demonstrated the defendant's intent and scheme in obtaining sexual gratification by isolating two 15 yr [sic] olds in an unknown residence while attempting to get them drunk,\" and the pattern of conduct is similar between both crimes in that Hart sexually assaulted the victims by first isolating them from their friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 61} There is no evidence to support such a claim. As the lead opinion concluded, Hart's intent, sexual gratification, is inherent to the sexual misconduct in this particular case. The state did not need extrinsic evidence of another sexual assault in order to demonstrate Hart's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The state's second potential use of the prior bad acts evidence, common scheme, or plan, is not borne out from the evidence either. The other acts evidence of driving the teenaged victim to a house she was unfamiliar with and engaging in similar sexual misconduct is not probative evidence of a common plan or scheme. In\n   <em>\n    In re C.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-2458\">\n    2013-Ohio-2458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=991%20N.E.2d%201171\">\n    991 N.E.2d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33 (8th Dist.), it was concluded that manufacturing an opportunity to be alone with a young female to commit acts of sexual misconduct was not the type of plan or scheme envisioned by the drafters of Evid.R. 404(B).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. In that case, the offender was accused of forcing the victim to perform oral sex on him and digitally penetrating her after the defendant drove the victim to a secluded area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. At trial under cross-examination, the offender stated that he had previously been convicted of the same type of sexual misdeeds with another victim after likewise taking the victim to a secluded area to facilitate the crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. According to the state, in that case, the similarities between the sexual misconduct and the similar methods of isolating the victim demonstrated a common plan or scheme for the purposes of Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 63} That reasoning was rejected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was concluded that similarities between the charged crimes and the prior bad acts are insufficient to demonstrate a common scheme or plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Finding an opportunity to be alone with another is a necessary part of engaging in sexual misconduct, and the similarities with respect to the sexual misconduct address the elements of the sexual assault crimes, not a common plan or scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This is not to suggest that the similarities would be entirely irrelevant in all cases. For instance, the similarities in committing the crimes could be probative of a behavioral footprint for the purposes of establishing identity or intent.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-2718\">\n    2016-Ohio-2718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20N.E.3d%20676\">\n    51 N.E.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50 (8th Dist.). As already noted, identity was not an issue at trial because the state established identity with the undisputed DNA evidence and the intent to obtain sexual gratification is inherent in the rape crime itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 64} With that clarification, I agree with the lead opinion that the other acts evidence of Hart's earlier conviction was inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Nevertheless, I dissent from the lead opinion's conclusion - that the existence of a deceased witness, who was present during the acts underlying the criminal conduct, does not constitute actual prejudice because the defendant is unable to articulate specifically what that witness's testimony would have been. The Ohio Supreme Court has unambiguously rejected the lead opinion's stated rationale. I would find that Hart has demonstrated actual prejudice from his inability to call the only other person present during the events to which the victim testified, and remand for the trial court to consider the remaining aspects of the preindictment-delay analysis.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
