Cuyahoga,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12538101\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/110/849/\">\n    2018-Ohio-1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12538101\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/110/849/\">\n    110 N.E.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is hereby vacated and substituted with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This matter involves the issue of whether the probate division or the general division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court had jurisdiction over a complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, fraud, conversion, and that sought a constructive trust and an accounting. Upon de novo review, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Plaintiff-appellant, Sami Sosnoswsky (\"Sosnoswsky\"), was gifted money to be placed into a trust until she turned 18 years old. Judith Lieber, Sosnoswsky's mother, was custodian of the account. From 1973 - 1980, the following amounts were to be placed in the trust: $19,000 from Sosnoswsky's grandmother, $6,057.40 from her grandfather, and $50,000 from her father. Sosnoswsky has alleged that the trust is currently worth about $2,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In February 2016, defendant-appellee John Koscianski (\"Koscianski\") was appointed the guardian of the estate and person of Lieber. On December 12, 2016, Sosnoswsky filed a complaint in the probate division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Probate Court Case No. 2016ADV221589). She filed a second complaint in the court's general division on December 29, 2016 (Common Pleas Case No. CV-16-873745). The complaints were virtually identical in that they named the same defendants and alleged that, due to Lieber's fraudulent conveyance of the funds, Sosnoswsky never received any of her trust money. The complaints named Koscianski as guardian of Lieber and several financial institutions as defendants. Importantly, the allegations dealt solely with the actions of Lieber, a ward, that took place prior to the guardianship being established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Koscianski filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the general division pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court stayed the case pending decision by the probate division court on the complaint Sosnoswsky had filed with that court. On April 28, 2017, Sosnoswsky voluntarily dismissed her complaint without prejudice in the probate court and moved to reinstate her general division case to the active docket. The general division trial court granted her motion to reinstate the case to the active docket. Sosnoswsky refiled her probate court complaint on May 18, 2017 and a Civ.R. 41 notice of dismissal of that complaint on October 31, 2017 (Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court, Probate Division Case No. 2017ADV225631).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Koscianski moved to renew the original motion to dismiss in the general division. On July 31, 2017, prior to the October 31, 2017 dismissal of her probate court complaint, the general division trial court granted the motion to dismiss, holding, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to R.C. 2101.24, it is well settled that the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided by law, as to all matters set forth in R.C. 2101.24 and as to all matters pertaining directly to the administration of estates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [T]his instant matter involves a ward [Lieber] that is currently under guardianship in the Cuyahoga County Probate Court. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims are controlled by Ohio Rev. Code 2109.50 through Ohio Rev. Code 2109.56 and the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction of this matter. As such, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is granted for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(l).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Sosnoswsky filed a notice of appeal, raising one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court erred in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss complaint on the ground that the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas lacked subject matter jurisdiction in accordance with Civ.R. 12(B)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In her sole assignment of error, Sosnoswsky claims that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Civ.R. 12(B)(1). The standard of review for a Civ.R. 12(B)(1) dismissal is whether any cause of action cognizable by the forum has been raised in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Prosen v.

This court, relying on\n   <em>\n    Goff,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moser\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , rejected the proposition that probate courts cannot award monetary damages for claims that are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court, such as claims based upon the conduct of a guardian.\n   <em>\n    Rheinhold\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. All of the plaintiff's claims arose out of alleged conduct by her mother\n   <em>\n    as guardian\n   </em>\n   , the attorney for the guardian, and the bank's handling of the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Koscianski argues that the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction and control of a guardian and all things that \"touch the guardianship\"; therefore, Sosnoswsky's claim that the case belongs solely in the general division is incorrect. The cases mentioned above, as well as the other Ohio cases we have reviewed, concern actions against a fiduciary of an estate and/or ward. The issue in this case differs. We are called upon to determine whether a probate court has exclusive jurisdiction, to the exclusion of the common pleas court general division, to hear and determine a cause of action brought by a ward's child (or other beneficiary) against the ward's estate for actions of the\n   <em>\n    ward.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Sosnoswsky's complaint alleges that her mother, Lieber, a ward of the state, was the perpetrator of the offending acts - the complaint refers to improper acts that Lieber did and did not do with the money Sosnoswsky claims belonged to her and various financial institutions handling of the funds. Importantly, the complaint does not call into question the conduct of Koscianski as Lieber's guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The above cited case are all distinguishable because they involved claims relating to the actions of a fiduciary, and not a ward. In this case, the claims relate entirely to the conduct of the ward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 21} R.C. 2101.24 does not provide for jurisdiction over claims made against a ward. The majority of the cases we have reviewed have cited to R.C. 2101.24(A)(1)(c), (e), and (m) to prove statutory authority for fraud cases brought in probate court. These subsections provide that probate court has exclusive jurisdiction to direct and control the conduct and settle the accounts of (c) executors; (e) guardians, conservators, and testamentary trustees, and (m) fiduciaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 22} We recognize that, pursuant to R.C. 2111.13, the guardian of a ward has a duty to \"protect and control the person of the ward.\" R.C. 2111.13(A)(1). We do not find that this is sufficient, however, to convey exclusive jurisdiction to the probate\n   court over a ward's conduct, especially since, in this case, the allegations stem from actions that occurred\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the guardianship being established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Therefore, the probate court did not have exclusive jurisdiction over Sosnoswsky's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdictional Priority Rule Does Not Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We have determined that the probate court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the claims. We further find that the probate court did not have concurrent jurisdiction over Sosnoswsky's claims; therefore, even though Sosnoswsky first filed her complaint in probate court, the jurisdictional-priority rule does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"The jurisdictional priority rule prevents the prosecution of two actions involving the same controversy in two courts of concurrent jurisdiction at the same time.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.
