FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 27, 2016, Detective Lowell Smittle of the Columbus Division of Police applied for a search warrant requesting a search be authorized at 643 Belvidere Avenue \"and the curtilage\" thereof in Columbus, Ohio. (Aff. in Support of Warrant to Search at 2; Search Warrant at 1.) The affidavit in support of the warrant to search provided by Smittle states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2016, Detective Smittle received information pertaining to a Tera Igel Hughes and Jordan Cook who were selling illegal drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin out of the residence located at 643 Belvidere Ave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   From January 28th and April 1st 2016, Detective Smittle conducted stationary and mobile surveillance at 643 Belvidere Ave. and observed several vehicles registered to Tera Igel Hughes, parked out front of the location. Detective Smittle observed Jordan Cook driving vehicles registered to Sarah Igel Hughes in the area on multiple occasions. Detective Smittle also observed Tera Igel Hughes and Jordan Cook in the back yard of the residence coming and going from 643 Belvidere Ave. on several occasions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   During the week of March 13th 2016, utilizing a confidential informant, Detectives made a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from 643 Belvidere Ave., Columbus, Ohio 43223. Undercover officers personally met with informant prior to the buy. The source knows what crack cocaine looks like, how it is packaged and has used it in the past. The C/I was searched and found not to have any contraband or money on his/her person; was given a specific amount of city funds with which to purchase the narcotics; proceeded to 643 Belvidere Ave. The C/I returned directly to the undercover officers, detective's maintained constant surveillance of the C/I. The C/I gave them an amount of illegal contraband which he/she had purchased from the premises. The informant was searched and no contraband or money was found\n   on his/her person. After the narcotics were recovered they were field tested \"Positive\" and transported to the Columbus Police Property Room and held as evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   During the week of March 27th 2016, utilizing a confidential informant, Detectives made a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from 643 Belvidere Ave., Columbus, Ohio 43223. Undercover officers personally met with informant prior to the buy. The source knows what tar heroin looks like, how it is packaged and has used it in the past.

Smittle # 1776 of the Columbus Division of Police has verified that 643 Belvidere Ave. Columbus, Ohio 43223, is the correct address in relation to the criminal offense underlying the request for the issuance of the search warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Smittle has good cause to believe and does believe that. Trafficking in Drugs, 2925.03 O.R.C, Possession of Drugs, 2925.11 of the O.R.C., Drug Paraphernalia Offenses, 2925.14 of the O.R.C, are currently being violated at, 643 Belvidere Ave., Columbus, Ohio 43205, in Franklin County and requests permission to search said premise, occupants known or unknown and curtilage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the above-described facts, the Affiant requests that the statutory preconditions for non-consensual entry be waived (no knock) for the following location: 643 Belvidere Ave. Columbus, Ohio 43223, and the curtilage thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Sic passim.) (Aff. in Support of Warrant to Search at 1-2.) The search warrant, which was signed by a municipal court judge that same day at 11:35 a.m., states that Smittle, having been duly sworn, says that he has good cause to believe and does believe that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Evidence of the crimes of: Trafficking in Drugs, 2925.03 O.R.C., Possession of Drugs, 2925.11 O.R.C., Drug Paraphernalia Offenses, 2925.14 O.R.C., Illegally obtained prescription medication, or any other controlled substance or drug of abuse, as defined in \u00a7 3719.41 R.C.; other evidence of illicit drug trafficking, to search for and collect all cash, weapons, documents and any other fruits and instrumentalities and evidence of the crimes unknown at this time; and authority to search any persons at such premises or curtilage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Search Warrant at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The warrant was executed two days later on April 29, 2016 at 11:55 a.m. by the Columbus Division of Police. According to the sworn inventory of property taken on the warrant, property taken from the garage of the residence attributable to appellant and another suspect included: 29 marijuana plants; 29 planting pots; a grow tent; multiple types of grow lights; filters; drying racks; an \"electronic ballast device\"; ceramic heater; an \"xtreme nano\"; a \"fan blower\"; an open bag of plugs; a \"BlueLab PH pen\"; 12 bottles of grow chemicals; and 2 plastic tubs. (Evidence Inventory at 1-2.) This property was seized and submitted for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 9, 2016, a grand jury indicted appellant on one count of possession of marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.11, a fifth-degree felony, for knowingly obtaining, possessing, or using marijuana in an amount equal or exceeding 200 grams but less than 1,000 grams on or about April 29, 2016. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty at arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 14, 2017, appellant moved to suppress and exclude from trial the evidence found during the search. Appellant argued the information on which the affidavit was obtained was stale and insufficient, and, therefore, the seizure violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution. Appellant additionally argued that plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, could not take advantage of the good-faith exception. In its memorandum contra appellant's motion to dismiss, appellee argued that the information in the warrant affidavit provided a substantial basis\n   for the trial court judge's conclusion that there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in appellant's home. Alternatively, appellee argued the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 6} A hearing on the motion to suppress was held on July 19, 2017. The parties stipulated to admission of a certified copy of the search warrant, supporting affidavit, and subsequent documentation of property seized. No witnesses were called, and the trial court heard arguments from the parties. Appellant asserted the affidavit supporting the warrant was \"stale\" in that, based on the information provided in the affidavit, there was not a fair probability that drugs would still be on the premises. (July 19, 2017 Tr. at 26.) Appellant additionally challenged the reliability and basis of knowledge of the confidential informant and the lack of more specific dates cited in the affidavit. Appellant agreed that under the standard of review, \"[i]f it's legitimately a close call, then you probably need to give deference to the municipal court [judge].\" (July 19, 2017 Tr. at 43.) Appellee argued the affidavit described drug trafficking from the residence at issue, the nature of drug trafficking is that of an ongoing operation, and that case law relevant to warrant issued based on suspected drug trafficking support the time frame of issuance of the warrant in this case. Appellee also argued that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule would apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 17, 2017, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. According to the trial court, the only real issue in the case is the staleness issue, and case law on this topic is \"all over the place.\" (August 17, 2017 Tr. at 54.) To the trial court, although the affidavit was \"disturbingly vague,\" he would deny the motion because \"in looking at the totality of the circumstances and the fact that the case law instructs that in a close call, the warrant and the affidavit is to be upheld.\" (August 17, 2017 Tr. at 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A plea and sentencing hearing was held on October 23, 2017. After being advised of his rights, pursuant to Crim.R. 11, appellant, represented by counsel, entered a no contest plea of guilty to possession of marijuana. According to the facts recited at the plea and sentencing hearing, which appellant did not take any exception to for purposes of the plea, appellant \"was one of the people who was inside the house at the time\" of the raid, was interviewed regarding the raid after being read his constitutional rights, and \"did admit to owning, possessing and maintaining the large marijuana grow operation that was recovered inside the unattached garage at 463 Belvidere Avenue\" but claimed he did not sell the drugs but only used the drugs. (Oct. 23, 2017 Tr. at 4.) Furthermore, the plants recovered were found to be 477.2 grams of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court imposed a period of community control for three years, reserving a prison term of twelve months if appellant violates the terms of community control. No fines or court costs were imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant filed a timely appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court erred in denying Defendant-Appellant's motion to suppress all evidence obtained from the search of 643 Belvidere conducted on April 29, 2016 as the information contained in the search warrant was stale and did not provide sufficient and timely information to establish probable cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.

However, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule provides that the \"exclusionary rule should not be applied so as to bar the use in the prosecution's case-in-chief of evidence obtained by officers acting in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In this appeal, appellant submits that the nearly one-month lag between the last investigative action indicated in the detective's affidavit and issuance of the warrant is \"far too long\" to create a fair probability that drugs or the targets of the investigation would be present at the residence on the date and time of the search given the perishable and easily transferable nature of the contraband sought and the absence of any intervening police work such as surveillance or controlled buys to provide recent corroboration.
