Mitchell raises the following assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   1. The trial court erred in granting appellee's motion to enforce a settlement agreement because it is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   2.

The trial court erred in granting appellee's motion to enforce the settlement agreement as contrary to public policy and the efficiency of the judicial system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After careful review of the record and relevant case law, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Turoczy is a duly registered bail bonds company located in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Mitchell was hired by Turoczy as an independently contracted bail bond agent who had authority to write bail bonds through Turoczy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} While issuing bonds for Turoczy, Mitchell entered into a business arrangement with another bail bond agent to share bail premiums collected from indemnitors. From 2009 through 2011, the nonparty bail bond agent gave Mitchell all of the payments he collected. Mitchell, however, did not turn those premiums over to Turoczy as he was required to do under their independent contract. As a result, the nonparty bail bond agent was never compensated for the commissions he earned from collecting the premium payments. In August 2015, the nonparty bail bond agent obtained a civil judgment against Turoczy for unpaid commissions in the amount of $75,000, plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In June 2016, Turoczy filed a complaint against Mitchell, asserting causes of action for breach of contract, contribution, theft, and equitable estoppel. The complaint alleged that the civil judgment rendered against Turoczy was the result of Mitchell's actions. Thus, Turoczy sought damages for the amount of outstanding bond premiums that Mitchell collected from the non-party bail bond agent, but failed to turn over to Turoczy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Mitchell filed an answer and counterclaims against Turoczy, asserting causes of action for breach of contract, quasi contract, conversion, and fraud. Mitchell alleged that Turoczy was obligated to pay him $221,057.86 for unpaid commissions, but refused to do so \"under a number of false premises, excuses and improper tactics.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} During the pendency of this litigation, counsel for Mitchell and counsel for Turoczy engaged in a series of email communications, including discussions regarding a potential settlement agreement. On June 22, 2017, counsel for Mitchell initiated settlement discussions by asking Turoczy's counsel if his \"client [is] ready to stop this fight?\" On July 17, 2017, counsel for Turoczy responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I don't have any authority to make or accept any offers, but maybe my client might be agreeable to a walk away with both sides paying their own fees. Let me know if I should take this to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that day, counsel for Mitchell inquired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I think they should ask us if we will accept walking away * * * are they offering that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 18, 2017, counsel for Turoczy sent the following email:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I wanted to confirm what we talked about earlier today.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Your client will agree to a mutual dismissal of all claims, with prejudice. Each party to bear their own costs with a broad release. You can draft the release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Counsel for Mitchell replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Yes * * * provided it's happening ASAP and not after I do a bunch more work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 24, 2017, counsel for Turoczy contacted Mitchell's counsel to see \"how the release is coming along.\" Counsel for Mitchell responded on July 26, 2017, stating that he \"was working on it * * * no worries.\" However, on July 31, 2017, counsel for Mitchell sent Turoczy an email stating that Mitchell had changed his mind\n   and no longer wished to enter into a settlement agreement. The email provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I'm not sure what happened but Donnell has exploded. He was ready to move forward but some side-deals have made him upset. We need to get together and regroup on this. Now, because of their acts (other deals) they're going to need to come up with money. Sadly I thought we'd worked this out but he's [not] taking zero when they're paying out others, it's not fair and he's enraged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Approximately one month later, the parties attended a court-ordered mediation hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, however, the parties were unable to settle the case, and the matter was returned to the trial court's active docket on August 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On October 3, 2017, Turoczy filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The motion asserted that the parties agreed in writing to mutually dismiss their claims at their own costs. In support of the motion, Turoczy attached copies of the relevant email correspondences exchanged between counsel for Turoczy and counsel for Mitchell in July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Mitchell opposed the motion to enforce the settlement agreement, arguing that \"there was no 'meeting of the minds' as to the creation of an enforceable settlement agreement.\" Mitchell maintained that he never signed a written settlement agreement and that the email communications do not constitute an enforceable settlement agreement because they did not contain any clear and definite terms. Mitchell further asserted that Turoczy's voluntary attendance and participation at the subsequent mediation hearing supports his position that while a settlement agreement was discussed, no formal agreement was entered into.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Upon consideration, the trial court granted Turoczy's motion to enforce the settlement agreement, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement, filed 10/03/2017, is granted. On July 18, 2017, the parties negotiated settlement agreement through their attorneys by email. The parties ultimately agreed to a mutual dismissal of all claims, with prejudice, each party to bear their own costs. On July 31, 2017, defendant changed his mind about the settlement and attempted to revoke his acceptance. However, once there is a meeting of the minds as to the essential terms for the settlement agreement, a party cannot refuse to proceed due to a mere change of mind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mack v.

Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Collectively, Mitchell argues in his first, second, and third assignments of error that the trial court committed reversible error by granting Turoczy's motion to enforce the settlement agreement. Mitchell contends the trial court's judgment was against public policy, the manifest weight of the evidence, and established case law because \"the email communications between his counsel and counsel for [P]laintiff throughout the month of July do not constitute an enforceable settlement agreement.\" We consider these assignments of error together for judicial clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The standard of review to be applied to a ruling on a motion to enforce a\n   settlement agreement depends primarily on the question presented. If the question is an evidentiary one, this court will not overturn the trial court's finding if there was sufficient evidence to support such finding.\n   <em>\n    Chirchiglia v.

However, as stated, the email communications reflect a definite offer and acceptance, bargained for consideration, and the parties' clear understanding of the settlement terms. Significantly, the terms of the parties' settlement agreement did not expressly state that the agreement would not become binding until it was formally executed. Thus, there is no evidence in this record to suggest that the parties did not intend to be bound by the terms of the settlement until formalized in a written document and signed by both parties. As set forth in counsel for Mitchell's July 31, 2017 email, it was counsel's clear understanding that the parties had reached a settlement agreement and \"worked this [case] out\" prior to Mitchell's change of heart. In the absence of conditional language stating otherwise, the terms of the written agreement did not lose their binding force merely because they were not reduced to writing as contemplated in the relevant emails. Under these circumstances, we find Turoczy satisfied its burden of establishing a valid settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, we agree with the trial court's determination that Mitchell agreed to the terms and conditions of a valid settlement agreement, only to subsequently change his mind. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting Turoczy's motion to enforce the settlement agreement.

Helper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071433\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/96/1/\">\n    96 Ohio St.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-2985\">\n    2002-Ohio-2985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20N.E.2d%2058\">\n    770 N.E.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17, citing\n   <em>\n    Rulli v. Fan Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"278321\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/79/374/#p376\">\n    79 Ohio St.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376, 377,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20N.E.2d%20337\">\n    683 N.E.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 27} For a variety of reasons, calling this on-again-off-again negotiation a mutually agreed to, enforceable settlement would be a very troubling precedent. For reasons best known to the parties, they were unable to close this one out. We and the trial court should not step in and finish their work for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 28} These negotiations were being conducted in good faith by two lawyers but the evidence does not show they were ever able to reach an agreement. The omelette never took shape nor did the jello ever form beyond the liquid state. If a clearly outlined, written, signed settlement agreement was the objective of both of the parties, then there would be one to show as the fruit of the discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The long-established standard to require clear evidence of a meeting of the minds in order to enforce a court-mandated agreement is as compelling in this dispute as it has been since the beginning of the common law of contracts. Informal exploratory emails, phone calls, failed mediation, and all other forms of huffing and puffing do not add up to a finalized negotiation unless the evidence of such is clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 30} This negotiation failed to produce an agreement. It fell apart before anything was signed, before a settlement agreement was ever drafted or circulated, before there was a willing acceptance to end the contest. Approximately one month after the alleged settlement took place, the parties attended a mediation hearing, after which it was journalized that the case did not settle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The instinct on the part of this and the trial court to end unessential, prolonged litigation is laudable. There are, though, clear limitations. We are prohibited from creating or finishing binding agreements to hold private parties responsible to terms to which they do not agree. We are not a party to this dispute and should not assume the active role of unwanted referee. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
