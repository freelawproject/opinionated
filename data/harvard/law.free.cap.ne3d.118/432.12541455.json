For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 13, 2013, Ashley obtained a loan from 1st National for $1,998.31 and executed a loan repayment agreement. On September 24, 2014, 1st National filed a complaint in Franklin County Municipal Court case No. M2014CVI-31681, alleging Ashley violated the loan repayment agreement by failing to make payments on the loan. In November 2014, Ashley entered into a payment arrangement with 1st National providing for monthly payments and a lump sum payoff. 1st National asserts Ashley made three monthly payments pursuant to that arrangement but failed to make the lump sum payment. 1st National further asserts Ashley subsequently contacted its counsel and agreed to compromise and settle the case by signing a Cognovit Promissory Note (\"cognovit note\"). On February 28, 2015, Ashley signed a cognovit note in favor of 1st National for $1,423.70. On March 2, 2015, 1st National dismissed case No. M2014CVI-31681 without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 27, 2015, 1st National filed a complaint on the cognovit note in Franklin County Municipal Court case No. M2015CVI-13668, alleging an outstanding balance of $1,073.70. An answer was filed the same day on behalf of Ashley invoking the warrant of attorney in the cognovit note and confessing judgment against Ashley and in favor of 1st National. On April 30, 2015, the court entered a judgment entry against Ashley for $1,073.70 plus interest and costs. The court subsequently ordered garnishment of Ashley's wages to satisfy the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Assisted by new counsel, Ashley filed a motion to vacate the judgment on\n   September 9, 2015, arguing the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case pursuant to R.C. 2323.13(E)(1) because the underlying loan was a consumer loan. 1st National filed a memorandum in opposition asserting the terms of the cognovit note and the circumstances surrounding the signing of it established it did not arise out of a consumer loan. Because 1st National filed a satisfaction of judgment on November 23, 2015, the trial court denied all pending motions as moot. On appeal, this court held that because the parties disputed whether the loan was a consumer loan for purposes of R.C. 2323.13(E)(1), the proper procedure was to hold an evidentiary hearing and make a determination on that issue.\n   <em>\n    1st Natl.

This court reversed the trial court's dismissal of Ashley's motion as moot, remanded with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the cognovit note arose out of a consumer loan as defined under R.C. 2323.13(E)(1), and whether the trial court had jurisdiction to enter judgment on it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On remand, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing. Ashley testified on her own behalf, and 1st National presented testimony from its attorney, Kevin O'Brien, and the office manager of O'Brien's office. Following the hearing, the trial court issued a decision denying Ashley's motion to vacate. The court concluded it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the case, holding that Ashley failed to meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the underlying loan was a consumer loan as defined by R.C. 2323.13(E)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Ashley's motion to vacate was supported by an affidavit in which she averred she obtained the original loan to help pay personal bills and all funds she obtained from that loan were used for family and household purposes. Ashley further averred she did not own a business and had never owned a business, and she did not understand the significance of the cognovit note when she signed it. Similarly, at the hearing Ashley testified regarding the nature of the underlying loan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Okay.

In the affidavit, O'Brien averred he did not know why Ashley took out the underlying loan or what she used the loan proceeds for, but that he told Ashley she could only sign the cognovit note if the underlying loan proceeds were used for a business purpose. O'Brien further averred that Ashley did not indicate to him that the proceeds of the underlying loan had been used for family or household purposes. O'Brien testified at the hearing that he explained the terms of the cognovit note to Ashley when she came to his office to sign it and that Ashley indicated she did not have any questions. At the hearing, O'Brien testified about his conversation with Ashley when she came to his office to sign the cognovit note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Okay. Well, I'm going to jump ahead here, 6, 7 and 8, Ms. Ashley's affidavit is basically saying this was for personal bills. She didn't own a business and never owned a business.

But given the circumstances here, I thought, you know, it would be acceptable to do it and she certainly represented to me that she'd use the funds for business. I didn't ask her what her business was. She did not say to me that it was for -- to pay, you know, personal bills. She didn't tell me what she was using the money or what she used the money for at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court: She didn't tell you at all? Is that what you said?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [A.] She didn't tell me at all when she took the loan out in September of '13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Tr. at 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The trial court concluded that, as the moving party, Ashley bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the underlying loan was a consumer loan, and she failed to meet this burden. We conclude the court's analysis failed to account for the particular circumstances presented by a cognovit judgment. As explained above, a trial court has no jurisdiction to enter judgment on a cognovit note arising out of a consumer loan. Because of the summary nature of a cognovit judgment, the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction may not be fully litigated prior to entering judgment, as it was not in the present case. Ashley's motion to vacate raised the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction and she testified the underlying loan was a consumer loan, which would have prevented the court from having subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2323.13(E). If Ashley had filed a motion for relief under Civ.R. 60(B), it would have been sufficient for her to allege a meritorious defense in a timely motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third Bank\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Applying similar principles to her common law motion to vacate judgment, because Ashley alleged facts that would have precluded the court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction, the court should have placed the burden on 1st National to prove that subject-matter jurisdiction existed, as the party seeking to invoke the court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Accordingly, because the court improperly placed the burden in denying Ashley's motion to vacate, we reverse and remand for application of the proper analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
