Velasquez, over the objections of the respondent, Downer Place Holdings, LLC (DPH). DPH appeals, arguing that Illinois law bars Velasquez from obtaining the tax deed, because he held an interest in the Property. We find that he had no interest that would prevent issuance of the tax deed to him and affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Property is a two-story multi-unit commercial property that is zoned for mixed use. In October 2012, the 2011 property taxes on the Property, which had not been paid, were sold to MTAG, identified as the custodian for Alterna Funding 1, LLC (collectively, Alterna). After extensions, the final date for any redemption of the taxes was October 28, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2013, the ownership of the Property was transferred to a land trust, the beneficiary of which was DPH. James B. Liggett was the sole owner of DPH. The trustee for the land trust was Standard Bank and Trust Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In April 2014, DPH leased one of the units at the Property to Velasquez and his wife, Katie, to operate a wedding services business. The lease provided that, in addition to rent, the Velasquezes would pay for the unit's gas and electric service. The lease did not require them to pay for property insurance, property taxes, or water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Over the years, various mechanic's liens were filed against the Property, and in 2014 a foreclosure suit involving the Property was filed. Trial was scheduled for May 7, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Shortly before then, Velasquez and DPH began negotiations over a possible transfer to the Velasquezes of some of DPH's interest in the Property. On May 5, 2015, Velasquez and DPH entered into a \"trust share purchase agreement\" (Agreement). The Agreement identified Liggett-as \"managing member\" of the land trust that owned the Property-as the seller and the Velasquezes as the buyers. Under the Agreement, the Velasquezes were to obtain a 51% interest in DPH in return for paying $51,000 to DPH by October 27, 2015. The Agreement stated that Velasquez \"pledged by this document\" that the 2011 taxes on the Property would \"be paid in full no later than October 27th 2015\" and that Velasquez would \"become the Managing Member upon completion of full payment by or before October 27th 2015.\" Further, the parties agreed that Velasquez would pay off the mechanic's liens against the Property. (Although this condition does not appear in the written contract, both parties have agreed throughout this litigation that the condition was a part of the Agreement.) The Agreement was signed by Liggett and Velasquez. That same day, Velasquez paid $23,000 to settle the foreclosure case involving the mechanic's liens. On May 7, 2015, the foreclosure case was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 On May 13, Liggett (as \"manager\" of DPH) executed a form assignment of 51% of DPH's interest in the land trust to the Velasquezes. However, the assignment contained a limiting clause: \"This assignment shall not be binding on the Trustee unless and until the original thereof is lodged with the Trustee and its acceptance indicated thereon.\" It is undisputed that the trustee took no action with respect to the assignment, and neither party argues that it ever became effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 On May 18, both Liggett and Velasquez signed a 30-day notice terminating the tenancy of one of the other tenants at the Property. However, about this time, the relationship between Liggett and Velasquez began to deteriorate. On May 29, DPH's attorney circulated a notice to all of the tenants at the Property, advising them that Liggett was \"still the managing member for the ownership of the building\" and that the tenant named in the 30-day notice was the building manager. Nevertheless, on June 1, Velasquez paid one installment of the 2014 property taxes on the Property, in the amount of $2028.29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 On June 2, an attorney representing Liggett and the trustee wrote the Velasquezes, informing them that Liggett \"elects to and hereby does terminate\" the Agreement and that they should \"consider this Agreement as null, void and of no legal effect.\" On June 11, Liggett (on behalf of DPH) served the Velasquezes with a 10-day notice terminating their tenancy at the Property. On June 23, the attorney for Liggett and the trustee wrote Velasquez's attorney regarding the 10-day notice. That letter stated that there were \"no existing agreements in force other than the lease agreement.\" The letter further stated that the Velasquezes \"never acquired more than a possessory interest in the property\" and that the Agreement \"was terminated some time ago in writing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 In early July 2015, DPH filed a forcible detainer (eviction) complaint against the Velasquezes. The Velasquezes filed an answer that included an affirmative defense and counterclaims for specific performance of the Agreement and for misrepresentation. The affirmative defense alleged that DPH had induced Velasquez to enter into the Agreement and to pay off the mechanic's liens and the current property tax bill, thereby unjustly enriching DPH, and thus no rent was due. The counterclaim for specific performance alleged\n   that Velasquez had partially performed their obligations under the Agreement and were willing to complete their performance if DPH were required to proceed with the Agreement. The misrepresentation counterclaim alleged that, although DPH had promised to convey 51% of its interest in the Property, it never intended to perform this promise but instead always intended to revoke the Agreement without refunding any of Velasquez's payments on DPH's behalf, as in fact it did. The outcome of the eviction action does not appear in the record on appeal. Although the Velasquezes' occupancy at the Property appears to have continued, the record does not contain evidence documenting the nature of that occupancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 On July 16, 2015, Alterna filed a petition for a tax deed for the Property, alleging that the time to redeem the taxes would expire on October 28, 2015, and that no one had yet done so. Paragraphs 1 through 5 of the petition alleged that all of the conditions for issuance of a tax deed had been met, and the relief sought was the issuance of such a deed once the redemption period expired. On October 6, 2015, Velasquez bought the tax-sale certificate from Alterna. No one redeemed the taxes by October 28, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Velasquez was substituted for Alterna as the petitioner in the tax-deed proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 In April 2016, DPH filed an answer in which it argued that Velasquez should not receive a tax deed because he had breached the Agreement, had unclean hands, and was subject to promissory and judicial estoppel. That answer was stricken by agreement. In October 2016, DPH filed a new answer. It admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 5 of the petition but asserted the affirmative defense of fraud, alleging that Velasquez induced DPH to enter into the Agreement by promising to redeem the 2011 taxes on the Property but then failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 In November 2016, Velasquez moved for summary judgment. He noted that all of the legal requirements for issuance of the tax deed had been met through DPH's admissions of the first five paragraphs of the petition for tax deed, and he argued that, in light of DPH's June 2015 anticipatory repudiation of the Agreement, DPH could not sustain its affirmative defense of fraud. He attached as exhibits copies of the letters dated June 2 and 23, 2015, terminating and confirming the termination of the Agreement. DPH's response to the motion did not refute or even address the evidence of anticipatory repudiation, instead arguing that fraud in the inducement was a permissible defense to a tax-deed petition under section 22-45 of the Property Tax Code (Code) ( 35 ILCS 200/22-45 (West 2014) ) and that DPH had asserted this defense. DPH also attached an affidavit by Liggett describing the Agreement and charging that it was \"an artifice of fraud concocted by * * * Velasquez to deprive [DPH] of its value in the Subject Property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 On December 20, 2016, the trial court heard argument on the motion for summary judgment. The record does not contain any transcript or other record of that hearing. The order entered that day stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[T]he court having reviewed the briefs, pleadings and oral argument of the parties, it is hereby ordered that petitioner's motion for summary judgment is granted as to [the] affirmative defense of fraud. The court finds that there is no issue of material fact regarding fraud in procurement of the tax deed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The order continued the case for prove-up on January 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 On January 10, 2017, Velasquez and DPH appeared through their attorneys, and Velasquez filed an application for an order directing the issuance of a tax deed. A wrinkle arose when Velasquez's attorney informed the court that outside the courtroom he had met John Grafft, who claimed to be the record owner of the Property. Grafft produced a deed recorded on December 29, 2016, conveying the Property to Grafft from a land trust held at the State Bank of Geneva (Geneva bank). Velasquez's attorney stated that, in researching the title to the Property for the prove-up, he had discovered that, in September 2015, the trustee of the land trust that owned the Property had conveyed the deed to the Geneva bank land trust, which in turn conveyed it to Grafft. The attorney did not know whether DPH or Liggett was a beneficiary of the Geneva bank land trust. DPH's attorney stated that he was unaware of any of these purported conveyances. Grafft addressed the court and stated that he was \"happy to hand over all interest in the property\" to Velasquez and that he had no objection to the issuance of a tax deed. The court continued the prove-up for one week to allow the filing of the prove-up transcript and the presentation of original receipts showing that Velasquez had paid the outstanding taxes for all years from 2012 through the present, as required by the Code. The written order stated that the matter was continued to January 17, 2017, \"for the entry of an order directing the Kane County clerk to issue a tax deed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 On January 17, 2017, the trial court granted Grafft time to file a pleading regarding his standing to be heard in the tax-deed proceedings and any objections he might have to the issuance of the tax deed, and allowed Velasquez a brief time after that to file any response. The issue of Grafft's standing and any objections would be heard on February 28, 2017. The order noted that, although Liggett was present in court, his attorney was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 On February 27, 2017, DPH filed a handwritten motion to vacate the grant of summary judgment. On February 28, 2017, the trial court entered two orders. The first order, which noted that Liggett appeared that day without his attorney, struck the motion to vacate and stated that Grafft had withdrawn any objections to Velasquez's petition for a tax deed. The second order directed the Kane County clerk to issue a tax deed for the Property to Velasquez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19 DPH subsequently retained another attorney and filed a motion to vacate the order of February 28, 2017, granting Velasquez the tax deed. DPH argued that its counsel had not been present and that Liggett had not realized that the issuance of the tax deed could occur on that date. It also argued that the affirmative defenses raised in its original answer to the tax-deed petition had never been ruled on and should be heard. Velasquez responded that those affirmative defenses were rendered a nullity by DPH's amended answer, which superseded its original pleading. Fraud was the only affirmative defense raised in the amended answer, and the trial court had granted summary judgment in Velasquez's favor on that defense. Velasquez also noted that, even if Liggett was not represented at the January 17 and February 28 court dates, Liggett himself was present and the issuance of the tax deed had been before the court since January 10 and was delayed only to allow full exploration of Grafft's interest and to hear any objections. The trial court denied the motion to vacate on May 4, 2017, and DPH appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 20 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 21 DPH appeals the orders entered December 20, 2016 (granting summary\n   judgment in favor of Velasquez), February 28, 2017 (directing the issuance of the tax deed), and May 4, 2017 (denying the motion to vacate). Its primary argument is that Velasquez is barred from receiving the tax deed because, at the time he bought the tax-sale certificate, he held an interest in the Property. Thus, it argues, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for Velasquez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 22 A motion for summary judgment is properly granted where the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits establish that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 735 ILCS 5/2-1005 (West 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Gaylor v.

Ordinarily, lessees do not have the obligation to pay taxes on the property they rent. Thus, the rationale for the rule does not apply to them and there is no reason to bar them from obtaining tax deeds through tax purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 32 At oral argument, DPH argued that public policy reasons support extending the rule barring those with ownership and security interests in property from receiving tax deeds to apply to lessees as well. DPH notes that rents provide an income stream that owners might rely upon for funds to pay property taxes, and it argued that a lessee can \"manipulate\" the tax-sale system by failing to pay rent, thereby increasing the likelihood that the owner will be unable to pay the taxes, the taxes will be sold, and the lessee can then swoop in and purchase them, thereby depriving the rightful owner of its property. Leaving aside the attenuated and speculative nature of this hypothetical chain of events, we reject the contention that this argument supports the extension of the rule to lessees. Property owners have the obligation to pay property taxes regardless of whether their properties are leased to tenants, and the burden of ensuring that they have the funds to pay those taxes is properly placed on them. If a lessee fails to pay rent, the owner has ample means of redress through eviction procedures, which\n   include the ability to seek past-due rent and other damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 33 There may be occasions in which a lessee owes a contractual duty to pay property taxes under the terms of the lease, and in such circumstances, perhaps a lessee could be barred from receiving a tax deed if the lessee's failure to pay those taxes was the cause of the taxes being sold. We need not decide this issue, however, as no such situation is before us. In this case, nothing in the Velasquezes' lease obligated them to pay property taxes. Further, as noted, DPH's argument that Velasquez's possessory interest gave him the right to redeem under section 21-345(a) lacks any legal support. We therefore reject DPH's argument that Velasquez's status as a lessee prevented him from obtaining a tax deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 34 2. Property Manager\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 35 DPH next contends that Velasquez acted as a property manager, collecting rents and exercising day-to-day control, and that this status made him a \"person interested in the property\" under section 21-345(a) so that he should be barred from obtaining a tax deed for the Property. As an initial matter, it is far from clear that Velasquez actually exercised any control over the Property. Most of DPH's citations to the record on this point are to the allegations of its amended answer and affirmative defense. But allegations are not proof and are insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a question of fact that would prevent the entry of summary judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Carruthers v. B.C. Christopher &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5407090\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/57/376/#p380\">\n    57 Ill. 2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20N.E.2d%20457\">\n    313 N.E.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) (in deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider \"evidentiary facts\" and the nonmovant cannot rely solely on allegations to show a factual issue). The only actual evidence offered on this point is Liggett's assertion in an affidavit that DPH \"ceded day-to-day management\" of the Property to Velasquez and the fact that in May 2015 Velasquez and Liggett both signed a 30-day notice terminating a tenancy. DPH has not provided citations to the record that would further illuminate the nature or duration of any control exercised by Velasquez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 36 Even if we assume that Velasquez served as a property manager at some point, however, DPH provides no legal authority whatsoever that a property manager is a \"person interested in the property\" under section 21-345(a) of the Code. Instead, DPH merely relies on the bald assertion that, as property manager, Velasquez \"had an interest in the Property that likely gave him the right, and the duty, to redeem the taxes.\" This bare statement is no substitute for reasoned argument or legal authority and thus DPH has forfeited this point.

DPH argues that, because Velasquez signed the Agreement to acquire a majority interest in DPH (the beneficial\n   owner of the Property under the land trust), he therefore had the right to redeem and should be barred from acquiring the Property through a tax sale. We have no quarrel with the general principle that contract purchasers are within the category of persons who may redeem under section 21-345(a) and who are barred from acquiring title through a tax sale to the property they contracted to buy. However, we find that, because the evidence unquestionably establishes that DPH repudiated the Agreement in June 2015 and that Velasquez elected to treat the Agreement as terminated in response to the repudiation, Velasquez had no rights under that contract and was not bound by it when he purchased the 2011 taxes from Alterna in October 2015.

Taking the latter point first, there is no indication in the record as to the outcome of the eviction case and thus DPH has not proved that Velasquez was \"successful\" in that proceeding. More significantly, Velasquez has not taken two factually inconsistent positions. In his affirmative defense and counterclaims in the eviction action, Velasquez never alleged that the Agreement was still in effect. Rather, Velasquez alleged that he had partially performed his obligations under the Agreement by satisfying the mechanic's liens and making a payment toward the 2014 taxes, but that DPH then revoked the Agreement without refunding any of the money paid on its behalf. Velasquez alleged that he and Katie were ready and willing to proceed with their further obligations under the Agreement (including redeeming the 2011 taxes) if DPH were ordered to perform its obligation to convey 51% of its interest in the Property to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 44 These allegations are not inconsistent with the argument that DPH repudiated the Agreement or that the Agreement was ended by that repudiation. \"A continued willingness upon the part of the injured party to receive performance is an indication that, if the repudiator will withdraw his repudiation, but not otherwise, the contract may proceed.

Jaeger, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1334 (3d ed. 1968) ). Accordingly, Velasquez is not judicially estopped from asserting that DPH repudiated the Agreement and that he was therefore released from his obligation (and right) to redeem the 2011 taxes. As Velasquez was not a contract purchaser when he bought the tax-sale certificate from Alterna, he was not barred from obtaining a tax deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 45 B. Remaining Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 46 Perhaps recognizing the paucity of legal support for its arguments that Velasquez was barred from receiving a tax deed because of his status as a lessee, a property manager, or a contract purchaser, DPH raised a new argument at oral argument: that Velasquez was actually a lienholder, either because he had satisfied the mechanic's liens against the Property and was therefore entitled to seek reimbursement for that payment, or because he was a\n   lessee and his lease could be described as an encumbrance upon the Property. In this way, DPH belatedly sought to bring Velasquez within the ambit of\n   <em>\n    Candlewick\n   </em>\n   , which held that lienors may not obtain a tax deed for the property against which they hold a lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 47 As an initial matter, DPH is prohibited from raising this argument because it failed to raise it earlier, either in the trial court or in its initial brief in this court. Our supreme court rules mandate that the appellant's opening brief must set out all of that party's arguments on appeal and the legal and record support for those arguments; \"[p]oints not argued are waived and shall not be raised in the reply brief, in oral argument, or on petition for rehearing.\" Ill.

DPH has cited no legal support for the proposition that the mere description of a lease as an encumbrance on property means that every lessee is, legally speaking, equivalent to a lienholder. And although Velasquez did settle the mechanic's lien proceeding against the Property, paying those liens, he has never placed a lien against the Property. Nor has DPH identified any legal basis on which Velasquez could place such a lien. Thus, this argument is forfeited both by the failure to raise it earlier and by the lack of any legal support provided by DPH. Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. Jan. 1, 2016);\n   <em>\n    E.R.H.

We turn to DPH's remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 49 In an effort to convey its position that Velasquez engaged in fraudulent conduct by failing to perform his promise to redeem the 2011 taxes on the Property, DPH asserts that his conduct could possibly, in the context of tax-scavenger sales, be considered criminal. As DPH concedes, however, tax-scavenger sales are not governed by the provisions of the Code that apply to the sale of annual taxes, such as the one at issue here. We therefore find its argument to have little relevance here. DPH also argues that there were genuine disputes of material fact that should have prevented the entry of summary judgment on its affirmative defense of fraud, but it has not identified any. As discussed above, DPH never denied or put forward any evidence challenging Velasquez's contention that it had repudiated the Agreement and that he thus was not a contract purchaser when he bought the tax-sale certificate. And any dispute over whether Velasquez was a lessee or a property manager was immaterial, as it could not affect the outcome of the case. DPH has not shown any reason why the trial court's judgment should not be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 50 III.
