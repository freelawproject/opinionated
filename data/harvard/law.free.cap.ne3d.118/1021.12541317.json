Brown, appeals a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas that granted defendant-appellee, P &amp; S Hotel Group, Ltd. (\"P &amp; S\"), judgment on the pleadings. For the following reasons, we affirm that judgment in part and reverse it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 28, 2014, Brown was a guest of the Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites Columbus East, which P &amp; S owns and operates. Brown took a shower and, afterwards, grabbed a towel off the rack to dry herself. While Brown was drying her face, she discovered that feces covered the towel she was using. As a result of this incident, Brown allegedly suffered physical injury and emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Over a year later, on November 26, 2015, Brown filed suit against P &amp; S, Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites, and an unknown employee of Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites. In the complaint, Brown purported to allege claims for battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and negligent supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} P &amp; S answered the complaint and moved for judgment on the pleadings. P &amp; S argued that the one-year statute of limitations governing claims for battery applied to all Brown's claims. Because Brown did not file her complaint within one year of the accrual of her claims, P &amp; S maintained that the statute of limitations barred her action. In a judgment issued June 27, 2017, the trial court granted P &amp; S' motion and entered judgment in P &amp; S' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Brown now appeals the June 27, 2017 judgment, and she assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred in holding that based on the allegations in Plaintiff/Appellant's Complaint, the Plaintiff/Appellant could prove no set of facts entitling her to relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred in holding that Plaintiff/Appellant's claims were all barred by a one-year statute of limitations because the allegations sounded in battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [3.] The trial court erred by failing to consider Plaintiff/Appellant's claims as pleaded in the alternative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [4.] The trial court erred in finding that Plaintiff/Appellant's claim for negligent supervision was barred by a one-year statute of limitations, as it is based on separate conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [5.] The trial court erred in failing to allow Plaintiff/Appellant to present evidence of negligence under the theory of\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} We will begin our review with Brown's second assignment of error. By that assignment of error, Brown argues that the trial court erred in granting P &amp; S judgment on the pleadings on the basis that the one-year statute of limitations for battery barred Brown's claims. We agree with Brown with respect to her claims for negligence and negligent supervision, but we disagree with her with respect to her\n   claims for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 12(C) permits parties to move for judgment on the pleadings.

Likewise, Brown's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is also time barred. As pled in the complaint, that claim is premised on the allegation that an unknown hotel employee intentionally caused Brown harm when he left the soiled towel for Brown's use. Consequently, like Brown's claim for battery, her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress arises from an intentional, offensive touching. In such a circumstance, the one-year statute of limitations for battery governs a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1725964\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/531/#p536\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20N.E.2d%20402\">\n    629 N.E.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Stafford v.

Conceivably, providing a feces-soiled towel for a hotel guest's use could constitute either an intentional or negligent act. Nothing in the nature of the act itself renders the act inherently intentional. This case, therefore, is distinguishable\n   from\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   .

Given the allegations contained in the complaint, P &amp; S cannot establish that the one-year statute of limitations applies to Brown's negligence-based claims. P &amp; S, therefore, failed to carry its burden, regardless of whether Brown raised or failed to raise any counterarguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting P &amp; S judgment on Brown's claims for negligence and negligent supervision. However, the trial court properly applied the one-year statute of limitations to Brown's claims for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and, thus, it did not err in entering judgment in P &amp; S' favor on those claims. Accordingly, we sustain Brown's second assignment of error in part and overrule it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Our ruling on Brown's second assignment of error moots her remaining assignments of error. We, therefore, do not address those assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain in part and overrule in part the second assignment of error, which moots the first, third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this case to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed in part; reversed in part; case remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SADLER and LUPER SCHUSTER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
