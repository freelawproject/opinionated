For the reasons set forth below, this Court reverses and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} HSBC Bank filed a complaint to foreclose on the Brinsons' residential mortgage and to obtain a personal judgment against Mr. Brinson on the note. HSBC Bank moved for summary judgment on the complaint. The Brinsons opposed the summary judgment motion by arguing that HSBC Bank lacked standing to bring the foreclosure action and HSBC Bank was estopped from obtaining a judgment against Mr. Brinson in the full amount due to a partial loan forgiveness. The trial court struck the Brinsons' cross-motion for summary judgment and supplement in support of their summary judgment. Additionally, the trial court denied the Brinsons' motion for reconsideration as to its prior order and denied their motion to submit additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After a bankruptcy stay and a stay for a short sale review, the trial court granted HSBC Bank's motion for summary judgment. The Brinsons timely appeal from this judgment entry, asserting two assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING [HSBC BANK'S] MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WHEN [HSBC BANK] COULD NOT ESTABLISH STANDING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Brinsons argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to HSBC Bank because it could not establish standing due to a broken chain of title. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellate courts consider an appeal from summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

The Brinsons allege that HSBC Bank failed to meet its\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden with regard to its \"right to enforce the mortgage [and the note] via an unbroken series of transfers.\" To support their position, the Brinsons rely upon a 2010 Loan Modification which was not included in the documents relied upon by HSBC Bank to establish its standing to file the foreclosure complaint and the unbroken chain of title. The Brinsons' reliance upon the 2010 Loan Modification is appropriate for consideration once the\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden shifts to them to create a genuine issue of material fact. Because this Court must first determine whether HSBC Bank met its initial\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden, we will initially limit out review to the documents produced by HSBC Bank in support of its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A plaintiff in a foreclosure action must have standing at the time it files the complaint in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

Further, the conflicting business records identified in the affidavit do not support the affiant having personal knowledge regarding HSBC Bank's status as the holder of the note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202918461\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} While HSBC Bank relied solely on the indorsements on the note to establish that it was the holder of the note and the chain of title of the note, HSBC Bank submitted two assignments that called into question its standing to enforce the note and the chain of title of the note. Accordingly, HSBC Bank has failed to meet its initial\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact as to the chain of title for the note and standing to enforce the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mortgage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In its summary judgment motion regarding its status as the current mortgagee, HSBC Bank cited case law regarding the principle of equitable assignment of mortgage. Despite citing this case law, HSBC Bank did not argue in the alternative that it was the current mortgagee based upon an equitable assignment of the mortgage. Instead, HSBC Bank concluded that it was the current mortgagee based strictly on the two assignments and an affidavit from its servicer authenticating the assignments. On appeal, HSBC Bank asserts, for the first time, the alternative argument of equitable assignment of mortgage. \"Arguments that were not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    JPMorgan Chase Bank, Natl.

Summit No. 27104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2746\">\n    2014-Ohio-2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202918455\">\n    2014 WL 2918455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12. Accordingly, we will not consider HSBC Bank's equitable assignment of mortgage argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As addressed above, HSBC Bank submitted the February 2010 Assignment of Note and Mortgage which transferred both the note and the mortgage from Quicken Loans to HSBC 1. Additionally, HSBC Bank filed the June 2015 Assignment of Mortgage which assigned the mortgage from HSBC 1 to HSBC Bank. HSBC Bank relied solely on these two\n   assignments to argue that it had an unbroken chain of title as to the mortgage. However, this Court must also consider the other evidence submitted by HSBC Bank, namely the note with indorsements from Quicken Loans, Inc. to IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. and then in blank. The affidavit did not address why there was an indorsement from Quicken Loans, Inc. to IndyMac Bank, F.S.B., but no assignment of mortgage between those two entities and instead an Assignment of Note and Mortgage from Quicken Loans, Inc. to HSBC 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Accordingly, the assignments of mortgage in the record do not track with the purported indorsements on the note. Because of the discrepancy between the assignments and the indorsements, HSBC Bank has failed to meet its initial\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact as to the chain of title for the mortgage and standing to foreclose the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     HSBC Bank's Other Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On appeal, HSBC Bank argues that the Brinsons waived any defense regarding standing because they failed to timely raise the affirmative defense in their answer. Instead, the Brinsons raised the issue of standing in their response to HSBC Bank's summary judgment motion. \"A lack of standing defense may be raised at any time during the proceedings, but it does not affect the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court nor can it be used to collaterally attack a judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Church at Warren v.

Accordingly, HSBC Bank's waiver argument is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Additionally, HSBC Bank contends that the Brinsons \"lack standing to challenge the propriety of the assignments of the mortgage\" because they were not parties to the assignments or indorsements and thus cannot challenge HSBC Bank's \"status as the assignee and holder of the [n]ote and [m]ortgage.\" HSBC Bank misconstrues the Brinsons' argument. The Brinsons questioned the existence of assignments, not the validity of the assignments. The Brinsons challenged whether HSBC Bank could \"establish chain of title\" based on the assignments and transfers in the record. And chain of title was one of the essential elements HSBC Bank needed to establish in order to obtain summary judgment in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552956\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/1009/\">\n    2017-Ohio-7686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552956\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/1009/\">\n    97 N.E.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} After consideration of HSBC Bank's evidence, this Court concludes that HSBC Bank has failed to meet its initial\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding the chain of title for the note and mortgage and its standing to enforce the note and foreclose the mortgage.

Mr. Brinson asserts that HSBC Bank was estopped from seeking a judgment for the full amount of the original loan because HSBC Bank had reported a loan forgiveness to the IRS.
