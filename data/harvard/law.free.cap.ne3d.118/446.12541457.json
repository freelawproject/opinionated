Caplinger, appeals the October 2, 2017 nunc pro tunc entries of the Muskingum County Court of Muskingum County, Ohio, denying his motions to suppress. Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 30, 2017, the Muskingum County Sheriff's Office received a citizen's report of a white Chevrolet Blazer with temporary tags parked at a gas station for thirty minutes and two individuals were rummaging through the vehicle. The Sheriff's Office contacted the Ohio State Highway Patrol to check on the vehicle. Trooper Samuel Hendricks was dispatched to the scene. When he arrived at the gas station, the vehicle was gone. He observed a white Chevrolet Blazer in the drive-thru of a McDonald's next to the gas station. He waited for the vehicle to pull out. When the vehicle did not exit the parking lot, Trooper Hendricks drove into the parking lot and observed the vehicle parked in a space. He stopped behind the vehicle and activated his lights. He approached the vehicle and observed the driver, appellant herein, and his passenger, eating ice cream. Upon speaking with appellant, Trooper Hendricks decided to conduct field sobriety tests on appellant. As a result of the testing, Trooper Hendricks arrested appellant for physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence in violation of R.C. 4511.194. The prosecutor amended the charge to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence in violation of R.C. 4511.19 (Case No. TRC1702238). Based upon the results of his urine test, appellant was charged with three additional charges under R.C. 4511.19 for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana metabolites, cocaine, and cocaine metabolites (Case No. TRC1704238).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On June 15, and August 16, 2017, appellant filed a motion to suppress in each case, respectively, claiming a warrantless seizure. A hearing was held on September 11, 2017. By nunc pro tunc entries filed October 2, 2017, the trial court denied the motions, finding Trooper Hendricks had probable cause to stop the vehicle and conduct a consensual encounter or an investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 18, 2017, appellant pled no contest to the charges. By sentencing entries filed October 18, 2017, the trial court sentenced appellant to thirty days in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant filed an appeal in each case and this matter is now before this court for consideration. The assignment of error is identical in each case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS BY OVERRULING APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OBTAINED DURING AN INVESTIGATORY STOP OF APPELLANT WHERE THE STATE FAILED TO PRESENT SPECIFIC ARTICULABLE FACTS TO SUPPORT A REASONABLE SUSPICION OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In his sole assignment of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress.

He did not approach with his weapons drawn. None of that was present here.

The informant also relayed the location, model, make, color and license plate number of his vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Most importantly, the informant gave his name and contact\n   information and visually observed appellant going into a nearby restaurant and kept him in sight until police arrived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Meanwhile, a second identified citizen informant telephoned after observing appellant at the drive-thru window of the restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Affirming the court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress we noted that, based upon the totality of the circumstances which included \"identified citizen informants\" combined with their observations of appellant staggering, slurring his speech with \"weird eyes\" and the information regarding his vehicle and location, the officer had reasonable suspicion to effectuate the warrantless stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The\n   <em>\n    Whitacker\n   </em>\n   court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Sabo.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Whitacker,\n   </em>\n   an anonymous caller informed police of intoxicated females in a red vehicle containing children parked behind a bar. When the responding officer pulled into the parking lot, the red vehicle was moving. The driver stopped upon seeing the police cruiser. Two other cruisers were with the responding cruiser. None had activated their overhead lights. The responding officer parked parallel to the defendant's vehicle and spoke with the defendant. He detected an odor of alcohol and she admitted to drinking. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding the stop was a consensual encounter. In reversing the trial court's decision, the\n   <em>\n    Whitacker\n   </em>\n   court found the stop to be investigatory, not consensual, noting the following at \u00b6 17 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Whether an encounter is an investigatory stop or consensual encounter turns on whether a reasonable, innocent person would feel free to leave or end the encounter with police.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our conclusion does not turn on whether or not the police cruiser physically blocked appellant's exit of the parking lot. * * * We are more troubled, however, by the fact that appellant's vehicle was moving when it was approached by multiple police cruisers. The video depicts that appellant stopped only after the cruisers approached. We find that a reasonable, innocent person would not feel free to leave when her vehicle is surrounded by police.

The anonymous telephone call which prompted police response, while specific in its description of the vehicle, passengers, and location failed\n   to provide a reasonable basis to suspect criminal activity.

Instead it is one element of our totality of the circumstances review of this informant's tip, weighing in favor of the informant's reliability and veracity.\" The\n   <em>\n    Maumee\n   </em>\n   court went on to find that the citizen informant had relayed an eyewitness account of a crime and therefore the dispatch based on the call justified the officer's investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The\n   <em>\n    Sabo\n   </em>\n   court found the citizen informants relayed facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of driving while impaired warranting an investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In the case before us, was the stop consensual or investigatory and what did the citizen informant relay to justify the stop?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 29} When Trooper Hendricks decided to approach the vehicle, it was already stopped, parked in a parking spot in the McDonald's parking lot. He parked his cruiser behind the vehicle and activated his lights. There was a parking block in front of the vehicle preventing appellant from pulling forward. We find, as the\n   <em>\n    Whitacker\n   </em>\n   court did, that a reasonable, innocent person would not feel free to leave when his/her vehicle is \"blocked\" in by a police cruiser with flashing lights running, a clear \"show of authority.\" One cannot expect a driver to start turning and maneuvering his/her vehicle out of a tight parking situation to evade speaking with an approaching officer with flashing lights in the background. Appellee concedes in its appellate brief at 5 that it agrees with appellant's argument \"that the trooper needed reasonable suspicion because he activated his lights.\" We find the stop was not consensual, but investigatory. The question now is whether Trooper Hendricks had specific and articulable facts,\n   which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, gave rise to the probability of criminal behavior to warrant the investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Trooper Hendricks testified he understood a caller reported a vehicle parked in a gas station for approximately thirty minutes with a male and a female rummaging through the vehicle. There were no reports of breaking into the vehicle or of either person appearing to be intoxicated or under the influence and about to operate the vehicle. The only \"suspicious crime\" was \"rummaging\" through the vehicle, perhaps looking for loose change to make a purchase at the McDonald's next door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 31} When Trooper Hendricks responded to the call, he observed the vehicle at the McDonald's drive-thru. He next observed the vehicle parked in a parking spot in the McDonald's parking lot. He did not testify to observing any criminal activity. Given the totality of the circumstances, we find Trooper Hendricks did not have a reasonable suspicion to believe appellant was involved in criminal activity to warrant the investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Upon review, we find the trial court erred in denying appellant's motions to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The sole assignment of error in each case is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The judgments of the Muskingum County Court of Muskingum County, Ohio are hereby reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wise, John, P.J., and Delaney, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
