The parents of three of the children sued Columbia Township and Liverpool Township for wrongful death because the road the teens were driving on bordered those townships. Following discovery, the Townships moved for summary judgment, arguing that they\n   are immune from liability under Revised Code Section 2744.02. The trial court granted their motions in part, but denied them as to the parents' claims that the Townships failed to remove obstructions from the road, failed to keep the road in repair, and failed to have mandatory road markings.

R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(e) ; R.C. 2744.01(F). The parents argue that the Townships' immunity is abrogated under Section 2744.02(B)(3), which provides, in part, that \"political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure * * * to remove obstructions from public roads[.]\" According to the parents, the condition of the roadway at the railroad\n   crossing was an obstruction to motorists because it was impassable at the legal speed limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The term \"obstructions\" is not defined in Chapter 2744. The Ohio Supreme Court, however, interpreting Section 2744.02(B)(3), has held that \"an 'obstruction' must be an obstacle that blocks or clogs the roadway and not merely a thing or condition that hinders or impedes the use of the roadway or that may have the potential to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Supreme Court noted that Section 2744.02(B)(3) had previously required political subdivisions to keep roads \"free from nuisance[.]\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. It reasoned that, in changing the requirement to \"remove obstructions,\" the legislature made \"a deliberate effort to limit political subdivisions' liability for injuries and deaths on their roadways.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. It concluded that, in light of the \"more demanding\" showing that is required under the amended language, ice that formed on a roadway did not constitute an obstruction because it did not block or clog the road.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} It is not disputed that the road involved in this case was straight. Before the railroad crossing, there was a 7.9% grade as it rose to the height of the tracks, followed by a downward slope immediately after the crossing. According to the sole teen who survived the collision, the group travelled on the road because it was their intent to use the changes in elevation to make their car go airborne. Following their first \"jump,\" the driver repositioned the car and went over the tracks again, this time losing control and going off the roadway 100 feet after landing on the road. There is no evidence in the record that suggests that there was anything blocking or clogging the road at the time the teens went over the tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The teens' parents argue that the term \"obstruction\" should include any situation in which a motorist cannot safely travel the road at the posted speed limit. They argue that those circumstances exist in this case because the speed limit for the road was 55 miles per hour and experts opined that any car travelling over the tracks at that speed, or at any speed greater than 40 miles per hour, would go airborne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} This Court is bound to follow the decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

To construe the elevation changes of the road at the railroad crossing as an obstruction merely because it was a hazard would require this Court to ignore the direction of the Ohio Supreme Court and construe Section 2744.02(B)(3) as still containing the \"nuisance\" language that the legislature replaced. We have no authority to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 32. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly determined that the \"intersection of the tracks and roadway could constitute an obstruction\" and that it incorrectly denied the Townships' motions for summary judgment on this issue. The Townships' first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN DETERMINING THERE WERE GENUINE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT AS TO WHETHER BOSTON ROAD WAS IN REPAIR AT THE SUBJECT RAILROAD INTERSECTION WHEN NEITHER THE CONDITION OF THE ROAD NOR SIGNAGE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Townships also argue that they are entitled to immunity on the parents' claim that the road was not \"in repair\" under Section 2744.02(B)(3). That section provides, in part, that \"political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair[.]\" The teens' parents argued that the road was not \"in repair\" because it could not be safely travelled at the posted speed limit and because it was lacking mandatory traffic control devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The term \"in repair\" is not defined in Chapter 2744, but the Ohio Supreme Court has recently defined it by its dictionary meaning, which is \"the state of being in good or sound condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Pelletier\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19, quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1923 (2002). The Townships argue that the phrase refers only to the surface condition of the roadway, not its overall design. They also argue that any problems with the surface of the road were not the reason the car left the roadway and collided with the tree. The parents, citing this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sanderbeck v. County of Medina\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Medina No. 09CA0051-M,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-3659\">\n    2010-Ohio-3659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203075598\">\n    2010 WL 3075598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , argue that a road is not in repair if it cannot be safely travelled at the legal speed limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In\n   <em>\n    Sanderbeck\n   </em>\n   , a car left a road while navigating an \"S\" curve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. Mr. Sanderbeck's expert opined that the road was in disrepair because the \"critical speed\" of the road was at or below the legal speed limit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The county argued that the \"in repair\" language under Section 2744.02(B)(3) referred only to surface conditions such as ruts, potholes, or crumbling pavement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. This Court, in affirming the trial court's denial of summary judgment to the county, did not resolve whether the expert's \"critical speed\" analysis would support a finding that a road was not \"in repair\" under Section 2744.02(B)(3), because it noted that, even under the County's more limited definition, the expert had testified that the road \"was 'deteriorated' in the area where the [driver] lost control of his vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n   <em>\n    Sanderbeck\n   </em>\n   , therefore, does not support the parents' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Before the amendments to Section 2744.02(B)(3), the Ohio Supreme Court noted that its \"nuisance\" analysis \"focused on whether the alleged nuisance rendered the roadway unsafe for the usual and ordinary modes of travel.\"\n   <em>\n    Manufacturer's Nat'l Bank v. Erie Cty. Rd. Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1714596\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/63/318/#p321\">\n    63 Ohio St.3d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20N.E.2d%20819\">\n    587 N.E.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Now that the statute has been amended to replace \"free from nuisance\" with \"remove obstructions\" and the Ohio Supreme Court has defined \"obstructions\" narrowly, the parents' argument attempts to preserve the old definition of nuisance by transferring it to the \"in repair\" language that the legislature did not modify. In\n   <em>\n    Pelletier\n   </em>\n   , however, the Ohio Supreme Court focused on whether the part of the public road at issue, a stop sign, was in \"good or sound condition\" or whether it was \"deteriorated or disassembled.\"\n   <em>\n    Pelletier\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The teens' parents have not identified any precedent in which a road was considered out of repair simply because of its slope. In addition, it is not disputed that the approach and retreat of the road from\n   the railroad crossing were designed and constructed in that fashion. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that political subdivisions are immune from design and construction defects because they involve discretionary functions under Section 2744.03(A)(3) and (5).\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729051\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/69/345/#p349\">\n    69 Ohio St.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349-350,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=632%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n    632 N.E.2d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Although one of the parents' experts testified that the crossing was not as level as possible and that an improper slope \"could be a design issue [or] it could be a maintenance issue[,]\" he did not explain why the allegedly improper slope of the road in this case should be considered a maintenance issue. Furthermore, although he also testified that the tracks were not even with the road, causing the crossing to be \"rough,\" he did not explain how the unevenness of the tracks contributed to the teen driver's loss of control. We, therefore, conclude that his testimony does not create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the road was \"in repair\" on the night of the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The teens' parents next argue that the road was not in repair because there was surface damage to the road after the railroad crossing. It is not disputed that there were a number of gouges in the road from other cars that had gone over the tracks and bottomed out on the far side. The parents, however, did not submit any evidence that the teens' car made contact with any of those gouges. According to the accident reconstruction expert, the gouge that the teens' car made in the road was 15 feet beyond any of the previous gouges. One of the parents' experts also opined that nothing about the surface condition of the road contributed to the collision. Upon review, we conclude that the teens' parents have not pointed to any evidence in the record that creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the surface of the road that the teens' car actually travelled on was in disrepair. R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Regarding the parents' argument that the road was not in repair because it did not have some mandatory traffic control devices, Section 2744.01(H) provides that a \"[p]ublic road[ ]\" does not include \"traffic control devices unless the traffic control devices are mandated by the Ohio manual of uniform traffic control devices.\" Traffic-control devices that are mandated by statute are also included, even if they are not in the manual.\n   <em>\n    Bibler v. Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280480\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/144/\">\n    150 Ohio St.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280480\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/144/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20N.E.3d%20424\">\n    80 N.E.3d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17. The Townships do not deny that the road was missing some mandatory traffic control devices leading up to the railroad crossing, but they argue that the missing devices did not cause the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The teens' parents argue that before the railroad crossing the road was required to have an X, the letters RR, no-passing zone markings, and certain transverse lines. Because the crossing was equipped with active control devices, the road was also required to have a stop line that indicated the point at which vehicles were required to stay behind while a train was passing through. They further argue that the retro-reflectivity of the signage that was present was not in compliance with the manual's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The signs and markings required by the manual appear to be intended to alert drivers to the fact that there is a railroad crossing approaching. The teens, however, were fully aware of the crossing and, according to the one who survived the collision, took the road for the specific purpose of going over the tracks. She also indicated that the driver of the car did not lose control until his second crossing of the tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Upon review of the record, there is nothing in it that suggests the collision\n   would have been avoided if the mandatory traffic control devices existed. One expert testified that the teens might have been deterred from jumping the tracks if there was a stop sign immediately before the crossing, but such a stop sign was not required by the manual of uniform traffic control devices. Accordingly, the fact that there was no stop sign present did not make the road out of repair. We conclude that the teens' parents did not demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the absence of mandatory traffic control devices contributed to the teen driver's loss of control. The trial court, therefore, incorrectly denied summary judgment to the Townships on the parents \"in repair\" claim.

This case involves a heart breaking situation where four teenagers tragically lost their lives when their vehicle went airborne after crossing railroad tracks. The parents of three teenagers sued the Townships. The Townships filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that it was entitled to sovereign immunity. The trial court ultimately denied the motion on the basis that there was a question of material fact. The sole issue in this interlocutory appeal is whether the Townships are immune from liability under R.C. 2744 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 22} It is well-established that an appeal pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C) is limited to the issue of governmental immunity.\n   <em>\n    Calet v.

More specifically, the Supreme Court noted that failure to establish the requirements of immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 would deprive a defendant of statutory\n   <em>\n    immunity\n   </em>\n   , but whether the element of proximate cause had been established would function to determine\n   <em>\n    liability.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, a defendant could fail to establish immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, but could ultimately be found not to be liable if a plaintiff failed to establish the elements of the relevant claims, including causation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} This distinction - and the nature of immunity as an exemption from liability - means that a political subdivision's immunity does not depend on whether plaintiffs can establish the elements of their tort claims. Immunity exempts a political subdivision from liability before the elements of the claims are considered. This is why the denial of immunity is a matter of such magnitude, and it is why orders that deny immunity can be immediately appealed and should, therefore, occur early in the litigation, \"prior to investing the time, effort, and expense of the courts, attorneys, parties, and witnesses[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hubbell v.

Unfortunately, the nature of the Townships' arguments on appeal has resulted in a blurring of the distinction between proximate cause and immunity in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the teenagers' parents, the nonmoving party, the trial court here ruled \"that the intersection of the tracks and roadway could constitute an obstruction since there is evidence tending to show it could not be traversed safely at the stated speed limit and as a result posed a significant and dangerous hazard to person and property.\" I agree. While the Supreme Court has said that an obstruction must block or clog the roadway, the high court has not said that the obstruction must be an actual physical object in the road.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pelletier v.

Even assuming we could entertain the Townships' proximate cause position, there is, at a minimum, a question of fact regarding the proximate cause of the accident in this case. It is well settled that there may be more than one proximate cause of an injury.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708864\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/585/#p587\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587-588,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20N.E.2d%20828\">\n    575 N.E.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Here, the Townships do not dispute that the road was missing mandatory traffic control devices leading up to the railroad tracks. The lack of mandatory traffic control devices is significantly probative given that there was expert testimony indicating that a vehicle would go airborne if it was traveling at a speed of 40 miles per hour, and the speed limit on the road in question was 55 miles per hour. In other words, there was expert testimony that the railroad tracks could not be safely crossed at the posted speed limit. Furthermore, there was additional evidence that neighbors complained about the railroad tracks and there was at least one prior serious accident at that location. This evidence coupled with the physical grooves in the road where cars had landed after going airborne supports the conclusion that the road was either in disrepair or obstructed. Yet, despite the evidence which tended to show that the Townships' trustees knew about the problem with the railroad tracks, the Townships declined to\n   take the necessary steps to resolve the issue. Under these circumstances, the trial court correctly declined to award summary judgment to the Townships as questions of fact remain as to whether the railroad tracks constituted an obstruction and whether the road was in a state of disrepair. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
