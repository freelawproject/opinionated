Mitok, appeals following his conviction for aggravated driving under the influence (DUI). He argues that the circuit court applied an improper double enhancement when the same prior felony that was an element of his offense was also considered as a predicate offense making him eligible for mandatory Class X sentencing. Thus, he argues that the court committed plain error when it sentenced him as a Class X offender rather than as a Class 2 offender. We vacate the court's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-8\">\n     \u00b6 2 FACTS\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     \u00b6 3 The State charged defendant by indictment with aggravated DUI (625 ILCS 5/11501(a)(2), (d)(2)(C) (West 2016) ). The indictment alleged that the present offense would be defendant's fourth DUI violation and listed each of the previous three offenses, including a 2015 violation in Will County. The indictment specifically cited subsection (d)(2)(C) of the DUI statute as the portion that defendant violated.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00a7 11-501(d)(2)(C).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     \u00b6 4 Following a bench trial, the circuit court found defendant guilty of the charged offense. The presentence investigation report (PSI) prepared for defendant's sentencing listed defendant's three previous convictions for DUI: a Will County misdemeanor violation in 1987, a Cook County misdemeanor violation in 1991, and a 2015 Class 2 felony aggravated DUI in Will County. The PSI also indicated that defendant was convicted of a Class 2 felony robbery in 1994.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     \u00b6 5 At sentencing, the State asserted that defendant was eligible for mandatory Class X sentencing based on his two prior Class 2 felony convictions. See 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-95(b) (West 2016) (providing than an offender convicted of a Class 1 or Class 2 felony shall be sentenced as a Class X offender where he has been twice previously convicted of Class 2 or greater felonies). Defense counsel agreed with the\n     State's assertion. In imposing sentence, the court commented: \"Well, I'm bound by the law. It has to be 6 to 30, but I see no reason to sentence you to anything other than the minimum. There is nothing necessarily aggravating about the case itself, so I'm going to sentence you to the six years in prison.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     \u00b6 6 ANALYSIS\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     \u00b6 7 On appeal, defendant contends that his subjugation to Class X sentencing represented an improper double enhancement where the same prior offense-his 2015 felony aggravated DUI-was used both as an element of the charged offense and also to make him eligible for Class X sentencing. He concedes that he did not preserve the error below, but urges this court to review the issue under the rubric of plain error.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     \u00b6 8 The first step in any plain-error analysis is to determine whether a clear, obvious, or plain error has been committed.\n     <em>\n      People v.

That section holds that \"A fourth violation of this Section or a similar provision is a Class 2 felony * * *.\" 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(2)(C) (West 2016). Accordingly, the State listed defendant's three prior DUI convictions in the charging instrument. When the court subsequently used one of those three convictions-namely, the 2015 Class 2 felony aggravated DUI-as one of two predicate felonies making defendant Class X sentencing eligible, it committed a clear violation of the prohibition of double enhancements. In other words, once the 2015 felony had been used to elevate defendant's offense to a \"fourth violation\" under section (d)(2)(C) of the DUI statute, it could not be used again to further increase his sentencing range. Indeed, the State concedes that the court erred in applying an improper double enhancement.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     \u00b6 11 The only dispute in this appeal is whether the application of an improper double enhancement rises to the level of second-prong plain error. Defendant insists that he has a \"fundamental right to be sentenced by a judge who is aware of the correct minimum and maximum sentences for an offense.\" The State simply cites to recent decisions from the Second and Fourth Districts (\n     <em>\n      People v.

The circuit court stated explicitly that it saw \"no reason to sentence [defendant] to anything other than the minimum\" and that \"[t]here is nothing necessarily aggravating about the case itself.\" Thus, this is not a case where we are forced to speculate as to the impact of the circuit court's mistaken impression as to the sentencing range. Following the improper double enhancement, that minimum was six years' imprisonment. 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-25(a) (West 2016). Had the court acted properly, however, defendant would have faced a minimum sentence of only three years in prison.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20N.E.3d%20661\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     \u00a7 5-4.5-35(a) (prescribing a sentence of not less than three years and not more than seven years' imprisonment for Class 2 felonies).
