Miller appeals his conviction on two counts of rape entered in the Delaware County Common Pleas Court following a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-Appellee State of Ohio has also filed a cross-appeal in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On Sunday, August 28, 2016, twelve-year-old T.A. resided at 135 Ross St. in Delaware, Ohio, with her grandmother Dolly Broyles-Miller, step-grandfather Shawn Miller, her brother J.A., and several other family members. (T. at 871-872). J.A. testified that Sunday afternoon, T.A. approached him on the bike path behind their home. (T. at 875). He explained T.A. was acting \"nervous,\" \"jittery,\" \"upset,\" \"shaking,\" and kept looking back at the house. (T. at 876-879). He explained that he could tell something was bothering her and had not seen her like this before. (T. at 876). T.A. then asked her younger brother to leave so she could speak privately with J.A. (T. at 878).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Once her younger brother was out of earshot, T.A. explained to J.A. that earlier in the day Miller had asked T.A. to go into his bedroom. While inside the room, Miller held her down and pulled her pants off. Miller then went into the bathroom and retrieved white cream that he rubbed on T.A.'s private parts and licked it off. (T. at 880). J.A. explained that T.A.'s statements made him angry. This prompted them to run away in an effort to go find their mother, who resided elsewhere in Delaware. (T. at 884-885). The children eventually located their mother in the parking lot of a gas station in Delaware. (T. at 887). At that time, T.A. informed her mother Miller had sexually abused her. T.A.'s mother departed and reported this information to the Delaware Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Detective Michael Bolen of the Delaware Police Department was assigned to investigate the allegations. (T. at 1085). Det. Bolen made contact with T.A. and J.A. at 135 Ross St. He asked T.A. to speak with him in an area that would afford them more privacy than inside the home. (T. at 1090). During a brief series of questions near the bike path, T.A. became visibility upset. T.A. stood before him silent, covered her face with her hands, and began to silently weep. (T. at 1092). At that point T.A. informed Det. Bolen that Miller had hurt her by touching her privates. (T. at 1093). T.A. stated Miller touched both the inside and outside of her private. T.A. also stated that Miller had put his private inside of her private. Finally, T.A. stated all of this conduct occurred earlier in the day. (T. at 1093-1094).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After speaking with T.A. and J.A., Det. Bolen arrested Miller and continued his investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On September 7, 2016, Appellee was indicted for allegedly committing ten sexually oriented offenses against T.A. (Jane Doe 1), M.B. (Jane Doe 2), and J.B. (John Doe).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On February 1, 2017, the matter proceeded to trial for the first time. On February 9, 2017 the jury returned not guilty verdicts on two counts of gross sexual imposition relating to T.A. and all of the counts relating to M.B. The jury was unable to reach verdicts on the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On April 18, 2017, the matter proceeded to trial for the second time on the remaining four counts. On May 2, 2017, the jury returned not guilty verdicts on the two counts relating to J.B., but was again unable to reach a verdict on the two counts alleging Appellee raped T.A. A mistrial was again declared on Counts 1 and 2, and those counts were again tried on July 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In the first trial, T.A. testified to a detailed account of the sexual abuse. However, in the third trial, T.A. became visibly upset during her testimony. Although\n   T.A. would answer some questions unrelated to her abuse, when questioned about the abuse she cried silently to herself. (T. at 977-1005). After a persistent refusal to answer Appellee's questions, the court instructed T.A. that she should answer the questions. (T. at 950). When T.A. continued to sit silent while Appellee questioned T.A. regarding the sexual abuse, the trial was recessed for the day. The next morning T.A. continued to remain silent when questioned about the sexual abuse. This led the court to directly order T.A. to answer Appellant's questions. (T. at 1003). When T.A. continued to sit silent during questioning, the court found T.A. unavailable as a witness pursuant to Evid.R. 804(A)(2). (T. at 977-979, 1006). Accordingly, a portion of T.A.'s testimony from the first trial was read to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. at 1006-1008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} T.A. testified that on the afternoon of August 28, 2016, Shawn Miller sexually abused her. T.A. (T. at 15). She explained that Miller had called her back into her bedroom; he closed and locked the door behind her. T.A. (T. at 16). T.A. testified she was scared and that Miller locking the door was not a \"good sign.\" T.A. (T. at 17). T.A. then testified that Miller removed her pants, held her down, and proceeded to \"do it.\" T.A. (T. at 18). After explaining what her private parts are called to the jury, T.A. testified Miller retrieved an unknown white substance from the bathroom and licked it off of her vagina. T.A. (T. at 19). T.A. then testified Miller tried to put his penis in her private part. T.A. (T. at 20:11-25. T.A. further testified that Miller took his finger and tried to stick it into her vagina. T.A. (T. at 21). The assault ended when T.A. yelled and her aunt knocked on the door to Miller's bedroom. T.A. (T. at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} During the third trial, after the State rested its case but prior to Appellee's motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim. R. 29, the court conducted a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   inquiry into the conduct Appellant alleged was encompassed by each count of the indictment. (T. at 1295).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The State explained the conduct supporting count one was vaginal penetration of T.A. by any body part of Miller (either his penis or his finger). (T. at 1295). The State explained the conduct supporting count two was cunnilingus performed on T.A. by Miller. (T. at 1299).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The court expressed skepticism that the State could allege count one encompassed multiple acts of sexual conduct and required it to elect which sexual act constituted the conduct underlying count one. The State informed the court, if forced to choose, it would proceed only on digital penetration. The court later explained that Miller's penetration of T.A.'s vagina with his penis was no longer \"at issue in this case.\" (T. at 1303). The jury was ultimately instructed, and the State was required to argue, that the only sexual conduct supporting count one was Miller's insertion of a finger into T.A.'s vagina. (T. at 1643).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After its colloquy with the State, the court addressed Miller's motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The court denied Miller's motion and recessed the trial for the weekend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Before Miller commenced his case the following Monday, the court went on the record and offered a number of statements in defense of its decision limiting count one of the indictment to the allegation of digital penetration. (T. at 1322-1328). The court explained it did not \"think it would be fair\" to Miller to allow the State to argue multiple modes of sexual conduct with respect to count one. (T. at 1326). The court explained that because \"this is a two count rape case, not a three count rape case ... I think it only fair and\n   right that the prosecution be compelled to specify which two rape allegations it will be asking the jury to vote on.\" (T. at 1328). The court stated it considered the matter \"settled.\" (T. at 1326). After the State clarified that the court's ruling would not preclude it from referencing the now uncharged conduct during closing argument, Miller presented his case. (T. at 1328).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The jury was ultimately instructed that, as it pertained to count one, sexual conduct was \"the insertion-however slight-of a finger into the vaginal or anal opening of another person without privilege to do so.\" (T. at 1643). With respect to count two of the indictment, the jury was instructed that sexual conduct was \"cunnilingus between persons regardless of their gender.\" (T. at 1648). After the completion of instructions and deliberations, the jury found Appellee guilty on both counts with the additional findings set forth in the indictment. The jury further found Miller compelled T.A. to submit by force or threat of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On July 27, 2017, the court sentenced Miller to an indefinite term of imprisonment of twenty-five (25) years to life on each count. After making the requisite findings, the court ordered those sentences to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Both parties now appeal, assigning the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} \"I.

I referred [T.A.] to The Center for Family Safety and Healing to their family support program. It's a program that is trauma focused but it specifically works with children who have been sexually abused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (T. at 356).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q: As part of your work on the treatment team, you mentioned something about the Nationwide Family Support Program, why do you order that? Why did you think that was medically appropriate to recommend it I should say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A: Based on the, my observations of how [T.A.] was interacting with our interviewer, along with the simple fact that she didn't have family present, we, I felt and in corresponding with the team that she, she really needed a trauma focused counseling that can specialize in sexual abuse, so the best program that I know of is there at The Center for Family Safety and Healing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q: Do you order that in every case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (T. at 360).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant argues that these statements amounted to Ms. Looman telling the jury that she believed T.A.'s allegations that she was sexually abused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellant's trial counsel cross-examined Ms. Looman on this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q: Your opinions yesterday about [T.A.'s] body language, you said that you've had just a class or two in child psychology?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A: I don't know how many classes I have had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q: Okay.

Ms. Looman stated she could not say what type of trauma T.A. experienced which resulted in her exhibiting the non-specific symptoms of trauma she observed. (T. at 433).

Appellant argues that counsel should have objected and requested redactions as to two portions of the interview. The first is where Det.
