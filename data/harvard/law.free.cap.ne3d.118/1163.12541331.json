The trial court deprived George Mincy of a fair trial when it commented unfavorably on his decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   2. The trial court committed reversible error when it found George Mincy guilty of violating R.C. 2919.25(A) based on a finding sufficient only to support a violation of R.C. 2919.25(C), which was not charged and is not a lesser included offense of R.C. 2919.25(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   3. The trial court erred when it found evidence sufficient to convict George Mincy of only a fourth degree misdemeanor but nevertheless sentenced Mincy as if he had been convicted of a first degree misdemeanor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   4. There was insufficient evidence to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that George Mincy violated R.C. 2919.25(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   5. The trial court deprived George Mincy of a fair trial when it * * * questioned the complainant after trial but before rendering a verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find that there was sufficient evidence to support Mincy's conviction for domestic violence and, therefore, overrule his fourth assignment of error. We also overrule his fifth assignment of error. Nevertheless, finding merit to Mincy's first assignment of error, we vacate Mincy's conviction and remand for a new trial. Our resolution of Mincy's first assignment of error renders his second and third assignments of error moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 30, 2017, Mincy was charged with domestic violence under R.C. 2919.25(A), which states, \"No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\" The charges were based on statements made by the complainant and alleged victim, Charrell Mincy (\"Charrell\"), George Mincy's 21-year-old daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mincy pleaded not guilty to the charge, and the matter proceeded to a bench trial, where the following evidence was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 29, 2017, Charrell was at her parents' house where she lived with her son. Charrell stated that around 7:00 p.m. she went inside to grab a can of pop from the kitchen. According to Charrell, Mincy was in the kitchen and they had an argument about her taking the last can of pop and cursed at one another. Charrell testified that she walked out of the house with the can. She stated that Mincy followed her outside and said, \"You'd better watch who you're talking to,\" to which Charrell responded that Mincy should \"get out [of her] face.\" She testified that Mincy then stated that he was going to \"slap the s*** out [of her],\" and that she responded, \"You smack me, I'll beat your a**.\" She stated that Mincy then \"walked up to [her] then he walked away and then he walked back and he smacked the pop out of [her] hand and then he smacked [her]\" in the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Charrell testified that she called the police, who arrived and took Charrell's statement as well as pictures. Charrell testified that she did not suffer any injury as a result of Mincy's smack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer James Sanders of the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority Police Department testified that he was dispatched to Mincy's house on May 29, 2017, for a report of domestic violence. After speaking to Charrell, Sanders testified that he spoke to Mincy, who told him that \"there was a verbal argument between him and his daughter.\" He stated that another officer on the scene advised him to place Mincy under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The city then rested, and Mincy moved for an acquittal under Crim.R. 29. The trial court denied Mincy's motion. Mincy then rested and renewed his Crim.R. 29 motion, which the court again denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After the city and Mincy presented their closing arguments, the court asked Charrell a number of questions about her son, educational level, work history, and about the events on May 29, 2017. The trial court also commented on Charrell's verbal pronunciation and asked her to enroll her child in daycare and go back to school. The city objected to the trial court's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court also made a number of comments concerning Mincy's decision not to testify. Specifically, the trial court stated, \"I'm just trying to get some stuff clear in my head. This is an interesting\n   set of facts. This young man chose not to testify. I had some questions. That's the only reason I'm asking.\" Moments later, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I have similar questions for this young man, but he didn't testify. * * * I cannot find some questions I need answers to. And it's his right. It's his right not to testify. Everybody has a right to remain silent and not testify. Public defender is relying upon the unknown, for the testimony to carry itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court also stated, \"I would like to ask how this could have been avoided, but I can't ask him because he chose not to say anything, so I can't ask him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court ultimately found Mincy guilty and sentenced him to a 180-day suspended term of incarceration and imposed a $1,000 fine of which $700 was suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Mincy appealed, and we sua sponte remanded the case to the trial court to correct a clerical error contained in the trial court's August 9, 2017 journal entry; specifically, the entry did not show that the trial court found Mincy guilty of violating R.C. 2919.25(A). The trial court corrected the clerical error on March 13, 2018, and Mincy's appeal is now properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} For the ease of discussion, we will address Mincy's assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sufficiency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his fourth assignment of error, Mincy argues that his conviction under R.C. 2919.25(A) was not supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} A sufficiency challenge essentially argues that the evidence presented was inadequate to support the jury verdict as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, the court found that the trial court's comments referred \"to issues raised at trial but not sufficiently addressed to the trial court's satisfaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   , we found that when the trial court stated \"that Reddy failed to explain the evidence against him,\" it meant that \"his defense did not adequately address all of the evidence against him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. We, therefore, found that the trial court's statement \"did not reference Reddy's decision not to testify[,]\" and we overruled his assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 41} After questioning Charrell but prior to rendering its verdict, the trial court stated, \"I'm just trying to get some stuff clear in my head. This is an interesting set of facts. This young man chose not to testify. I had some questions. That's the only reason I'm asking.\" Moments later, the trial court stated, \"I have similar questions for this young man, but he didn't testify. * * * I cannot find some questions I need answers to. And it's his right. It's his right not to testify. Everybody has a right to remain silent and not testify. Public defender is relying upon the unknown, for the testimony to carry itself.\" The trial court also stated, \"I would like to ask how this could have been avoided, but I can't ask him because he chose not to say anything, so I can't ask him.\" The trial court then found Mincy guilty of domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 42} After comparison to\n   <em>\n    In re K.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   , we find that the trial court's statements concerning Mincy's decision not to testify violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's statements were not expressing its belief that Mincy's defense counsel failed to address the evidence against him. Instead, like\n   <em>\n    In re K.B.\n   </em>\n   and despite the trial court's recognition of Mincy's right to not testify, the trial court made numerous statements suggesting that Mincy failed to answer questions that the trial court found to be important by choosing to exercise that right. We find that, like\n   <em>\n    In re K.B.\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's \"repeated statements regarding appellant's silence * * * strongly suggest a shift in the burden of proof from the [city] to [Mincy], requiring [Mincy] to explain his conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Therefore, in conclusion, we overrule Mincy's fourth and fifth assignments of error, sustain Mincy's first assignment of error, vacate Mincy's conviction, and remand for a new trial. Further, our resolution of Mincy's first assignment of error renders his second and third assignments of error moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The conviction is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   EILEEN A.
