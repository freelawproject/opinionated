We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 2} McQueen was charged with one count of having weapons while under disability, a third-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) ; one count of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, a fourth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B) ; one count of receiving stolen property, a fourth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A) ; and one count of carrying a concealed weapon, a fourth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2). McQueen filed a motion to suppress, arguing that all of the evidence was a result of an unconstitutional arrest. The trial court agreed and granted McQueen's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 6, 2017, McQueen was outside with a group of five or six young men. Sergeant James Neal (\"Sgt. Neal\") was patrolling the area because eight days earlier, a murder had occurred in the area. Sgt. Neal noticed the young men, but McQueen stood out because he had on a dark hoodie and what appeared to be a scarf over his face. The scarf was actually his T-shirt that was pulled around his neck. Sgt. Neal thought that McQueen looked suspicious because it was 74 degrees outside. As Sgt. Neal drove past the group, McQueen took off the hood of his hoodie and pulled the T-shirt off his face. Sgt. Neal began tracking McQueen's movements as McQueen stepped away from the group. While following McQueen, Sgt. Neal observed McQueen enter a red Pontiac on its passenger side. Two minutes later McQueen exited the Pontiac and began walking down the street. Sgt. Neal walked parallel to McQueen, and then McQueen started running.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Sgt. Neal chased McQueen into a residential apartment building to the second floor landing. Sgt. Neal observed McQueen taking off his hoodie and T-shirt. Sgt. Neal ordered McQueen to the ground, handcuffed him, and patted him down. Sgt. Neal did not find anything on McQueen during the pat down. Sgt. Neal also conducted a warrant check on McQueen that revealed no outstanding warrants. However, McQueen was detained, and Sgt. Neal placed McQueen in the back of the patrol\n   car. Lieutenant Dale Homerick (\"Lt. Homerick\"), Sgt. Neal's supervisor, responded to Sgt. Neal's call for assistance. After McQueen was taken into custody, Sgt. Neal retraced the route that McQueen took to the apartment building from the red Pontiac. Sgt. Neal did not discover anything of an illegal nature. Lt. Homerick arrived while McQueen was in the back of Sgt. Neal's patrol car. Lt. Homerick looked inside the front passenger window of the red Pontiac and saw a firearm lying on the front passenger seat. Sgt. Neal also observed the firearm. Sgt. Neal ran a search for the license plate and found that it was not owned by McQueen, nor was the gun registered to McQueen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 15, 2017, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a four-count indictment against McQueen. McQueen filed a motion to suppress, alleging that the police obtained the gun in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The trial court granted the motion to suppress and stated the following in its journal entry,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Even if one were to accept that the stop was proper, it is further shown to be baseless when the defendant was stopped, patted down and frisked, that there was nothing found upon the defendant of an illegal nature.

After Sgt. Neal's initial observance of McQueen that we find did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion, Sgt. Neal continued to watch McQueen. Sgt. Neal then observed McQueen enter and exit a red vehicle. While McQueen was in the vehicle, Sgt. Neal did not observe any furtive movement or anyone approach the vehicle. Thereafter, McQueen started to run, and Sgt. Neal chased after him. During the chase, Sgt. Neal did not see McQueen go into his pockets or throw anything. McQueen was stopped inside of a building, detained, and handcuffed. A warrant check was then completed on McQueen that did not reveal any wants or warrants. Sgt. Neal stated that people run because they either have something illegal on them or are wanted. Neither hunch was true in this case. And if we had found that the initial observance of McQueen was justified, we find that McQueen's detention should have concluded here. We find that any potential probable cause which may\n   have existed was no longer available to justify a continued detention of McQueen.\n   <em>\n    State v. McDowell\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

Thus, events which justify a temporary detention at one location may not suffice to justify involuntary movement to another location.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, we will address the argument for the purposes of providing context and structure for a warrantless search. While it is true that the officers could have randomly discovered the gun in the vehicle that was not on their radar until McQueen sat in it, they did not. The officers found the gun in a vehicle that was not registered to McQueen. The gun was not found while McQueen was in the vehicle nor did the officers observe McQueen placing the gun in the vehicle. \" '[P]olice may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

McQueen was not within reaching distance at the time of the search, and the arrest was unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The state also argues that there were two separate incidents: the arrest and then the search of the vehicle. They argue that the two were not tied together. We disagree. The police searched McQueen and found nothing. They also ran a check for warrants, and McQueen did not have any warrants. At that point, the police should have released McQueen. However, they continued to detain him and then drove him along the path they chased\n   him on and found nothing. Then while McQueen was still detained, they went back to the car and observed the gun lying on the seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The detention of McQueen and finding the gun was continuous and not a separate act. \"When justification for the original detention ends, there must be an additional reasonable suspicion of illegal activity in order to justify the continued detention.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The original reason the officers detained McQueen was because Sgt. Neal thought that he was in possession of something illegal in nature or that he was wanted. Once both thoughts turned out to be false that resulted in no additional reasonable suspicion of illegal activity, McQueen should have been released. Based on the foregoing, we find the officers' illegal seizure of McQueen tainted the subsequent seizure of the gun. In other words, the seized gun is fruit of the poisonous tree that the officers acquired as a result of their prior, unlawful conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baber\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Neal indicated four factors that led to his suspicions regarding McQueen: McQueen's presence in a high crime area, one where a murder had occurred eight days earlier; his notable nervousness upon seeing Sgt. Neal; his wearing a hoodie and a T-shirt over his face in hot weather; and his unprovoked flight from Sgt. Neal. Sgt. Neal stated that, in his experience, people tend to run from police if they have warrants or are in possession of illegal items. He further pointed to his experience performing undercover drug buys where dealers, upon seeing police, would look around for places to dump their contraband. These four specific, articulable facts, taken together with Sgt. Neal's experience as a police officer, were sufficient to provoke reasonable suspicion that justified Sgt. Neal's interaction with McQueen.

Three requirements must be met for the plain view doctrine to apply: (1) the police are not violating the Fourth Amendment in arriving in the place where the evidence was found; (2) the incriminating character of the evidence is \"immediately apparent\"; and (3) the police have a lawful right to access the object itself.\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

First, the car was parked on a public roadway, alongside a sidewalk. Any person, including Sgt. Neal and Lt. Homerick, had the right to walk on the sidewalk. The firearm was on the front seat of a car, clearly visible to a passerby on the sidewalk through the cars untinted windows. The officers were not violating the Fourth Amendment when they walked along a public street and noticed the firearm on the passenger seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The second requirement is also met because the incriminating nature of the firearm - specifically, the violation of R.C. 2923.16(B) - was immediately apparent. This statute states that \"no person shall knowingly transport or have a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in such a manner that the firearm is accessible to the operator or any passenger without leaving the vehicle.\" The fact that no one was in the car when the firearm was discovered is irrelevant here because the firearm was lying on the passenger seat and easily accessible to anyone who would be in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Finally, the third requirement was also met here. Upon seeing the firearm, Sgt. Neal had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of a crime, specifically R.C. 2923.16(B). Therefore, he was permitted to search the vehicle based on this probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 29} For these reasons, I would sustain both of the state's assignments of error and reverse the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
