Ragland II appeals from a judgment of the Champaign County Court of Common Pleas, which denied his motion for jail time credit for 267 days he was held at the Tri-County Regional Jail on unrelated charges in Clark County, Ohio. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 11, 2014, a Champaign County grand jury indicted Ragland on one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A)(4), a felony of the third degree, and one count of disrupting public services in violation of R.C. 2909.04(A)(1)(C), a felony of the fourth degree. A warrant for Ragland's arrest issued on the same date was not served until July 1, 2015, when Ragland was located at Pickaway Correctional Institution, where he was imprisoned on a sentence from Clark County C.P. Case No. 2015 CR 018. On September 8, 2015, while still in custody on the Clark County offenses, Ragland entered a plea of guilty to both charges in Champaign County. He then was transported to the Tri-County Jail, where he apparently was held while awaiting sentencing in Champaign County. (See Docket Sheet # 32, Warrant for Removal; # 33, Sheriff's Return).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Ragland was returned to Champaign County on October 5, 2015, for sentencing. The Champaign County trial court imposed sentences of 30 months imprisonment on the domestic violence count and 14 months imprisonment on the disrupting public services count, to run concurrently, for a total prison term of 30 months. The court specified, however, that such 30 month sentence was to \"be served CONSECUTIVELY to the sentence imposed in Clark County Case No. 2015 CR 018.\" (Emphasis sic.) The trial court further found that \"[a]ll time\" Ragland had \"spent in the Tri County Regional Jail shall be credited to the Clark County term of imprisonment,\" with \"no jail time credit\" to be applied toward Ragland's Champaign County sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ragland filed a direct appeal in the Champaign County case, raising a single assignment of error that objected to the payment plan the trial court imposed for post-confinement repayment of his court-appointed trial attorney's legal fees.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ragland\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Champaign No. 2015-CA-036,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-2783\">\n    2017-Ohio-2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202223064\">\n    2017 WL 2223064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court sustained that assignment of error and ordered the trial court to modify its judgment regarding the repayment of costs and legal fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ragland thereafter moved in the trial court for 267 days of jail time credit, representing the span from January 23, 2015, when he says he was arrested on charges in Clark County, through his October\n   5, 2015 sentencing on the Champaign County offenses. Asserting that Champaign County had \"a detainer\" on him throughout that period, Ragland argued that such time should be credited toward his Champaign County sentence. The trial court denied that motion, determining that Ragland \"is not entitled to the requested credit because the sentences imposed [in Champaign County] run consecutively to his Clark County sentence,\" and the requested time, as credited to his Clark County sentence, \"applied once to his total term of imprisonment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ragland brings this timely appeal from that judgment, setting forth one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT ABUSED IT'S [sic] DISCRETION WHEN THE COURT MADE A [sic] AMBIGUOUS RULING OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BEFORE THE COURT, AND IN SO DOING, FAILED TO FULFILL IT'S [sic] FUNCTION AS A JUDICIAL DUTIES [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Specifically, Ragland contends that the trial court's ruling was contrary to R.C. 2967.191, which he maintains requires that he be credited for \"\n   <em>\n    ALL\n   </em>\n   \" time he was in custody while awaiting sentencing in the Champaign County matter. (Emphasis sic.) In essence, Ragland appears to argue that all days he was incarcerated between his Clark County arrest and his Champaign County sentencing should be credited to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   his Clark County\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Champaign County sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In response, the State asserts that Ragland's claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, because he could have raised the jail time credit issue in his direct appeal, but did not. Alternatively, the State argues that the trial court correctly applied jail time credit to only one of Ragland's consecutive sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Res Judicata\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Before addressing the merits of Ragland's assignment of error, we must consider the State's contention that the doctrine of res judicata bars Ragland from now appealing a jail time credit issue that he failed to raise on direct appeal. The State cites a single decision of this Court for the proposition that \"[r]es judicata applies to motions for jail-time credit that involve a legal determination\" rather than \"a mere mathematical or clerical error.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kilgore\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

Accordingly, res judicata applied to bar review of the trial court's decision on the merits of Kilgore's jail time credit argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12-13. Because the discussion regarding \"legal determination[s]\" versus \"mere mathematical or clerical error[s]\" was not the basis for the actual holding in\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   , that statement is dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In addition, we conclude that the above-quoted portion of\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   no longer represents an accurate statement of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There, this Court cited 2007 and 2005 decisions of the Tenth District Court of Appeals as authority for the legal propositions stated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.

The offender may, at\n   <em>\n    any time after sentencing\n   </em>\n   , file a motion in the sentencing court to correct\n   <em>\n    any error\n   </em>\n   made in making a determination under division (B)(2)(g)(i) of this section, and the court may in its discretion grant or deny that motion. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court explained the significance of that new provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to the enactment of R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii), an offender was able to seek correction of an error made in determining jail-time credit only on direct appeal.

He addresses the latter phrase only by implying that because he was subject to a detainer from Champaign County while confined on the Clark County charges, his confinement\n   arose out of the Champaign County offenses. Ragland offers no authority for the distinction he attempts to draw on that basis. In fact, a prior decision of this Court supports the opposite conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We therefore concluded that the fact that a detainer for one jurisdiction was in effect while a defendant was serving his sentence in another jurisdiction did not mean that the first sentence \"arose from\" the latter offenses for purposes of R.C. 2967.191.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%2016140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Appellant's \"detainer\" argument is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The record demonstrates that in denying Ragland's motion for jail time credit, the Champaign County trial court properly determined that any jail time credit accumulated by Ragland should be credited only to his Clark County sentence, and not also to the Champaign County sentence that was to run consecutively to the Clark County sentence.
