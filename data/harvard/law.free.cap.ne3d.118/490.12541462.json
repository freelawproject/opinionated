For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Dimension administers vehicle service contracts to automobile purchasers. Each of the appellees, Champion Chrysler, Plymouth Jeep and Ed Parker, Bert Ogden Dealer Group, Ferguson Dealer Group, Allen Tillery Chevrolet and Great Lakes Insurance Agency, Inc., entered into a Profit Share Agreement (\"PSA\") with Dimension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of the appellees, except Great Lakes Insurance Agency, Inc., were car dealers and offered consumers a Dimension vehicle service contract at the point of sale. On July 28, 2014, appellees and Darryl Hickman (collectively \"claimants\") served a joint arbitration demand on Dimension pursuant to the mandatory\n   arbitration provisions in the PSAs, arguing that Dimension failed to make payments in violation of its obligation to do so under the PSAs. Claimants filed a single demand for consolidated arbitration because they were each pursuing claims for additional profit share payments pursuant to identical PSAs. The arbitration demand nominated Kirk Borchardt to serve as the claimants' selected arbitrator. Dimension nominated Frank A. Ray as its selected arbitrator. The final arbitrator, Richard Neville was selected. On January 12, 2015, Dimension objected to the consolidated arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After briefing, on March 16, 2015, the arbitration panel held that the claims of the six claimants would be consolidated for discovery and motion practice purposes. The panel examined the PSAs finding the same language in each granted the panel broad authority. The consolidation decision set forth that, \"[t]he Panel, having been granted this broad authority, finds that this is a proper case for consolidated discovery and motion practice based in part on the principle that arbitration is intended to be an efficient, timely, and cost-effective alternative to litigation.\" (Mar. 16, 2015 Decision.) The decision set forth that consolidation for discovery and motion practice purposes would \"not prevent separate, individual evidentiary presentations as to defenses or claims,\" and Dimension was free to petition the arbitration panel to request a separate hearing for any individual claimant and the panel would consider the request. (Decision.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In August 2015, Arbitrator Borchardt resigned from the arbitration panel. Borchardt had accepted a job as a consultant for Innovative Aftermarket Systems, Inc., the parent company of First Dealer Resources, LLC, the entity that served as Dimension's marketing representative. Borchardt acknowledged that he was resigning because of the conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Subsequently, claimants appointed Jason Dubner to replace Borchardt. Dimension objected to Dubner on September 18, 2015 because Dubner had previously served as an arbitrator in a separate arbitration proceeding between Dimension and two of the present claimants and because Dubner had previously represented clients of Frank Klaus, an individual with business relationships with claimants. The arbitration panel denied Dimension's request to disqualify Dubner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The arbitration panel issued an interim award on October 19, 2016, granting relief to each of the appellees, but denying relief to Darryl Hickman. Dimension filed a motion for reconsideration alleging calculation errors. The arbitration panel issued a final award on December 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellees filed an application for an order confirming the final arbitration award in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and Dimension filed a motion to vacate the final arbitration award. The trial court granted the motion to affirm and denied the motion to vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In its first four assignments of error, Dimension argues that the trial court erred in finding that the arbitration panel could properly consolidate the claims. Dimension argues four reasons the consolidation constitutes an error. First, Dimension argues that the parties must\n   expressly consent to consolidation pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Internatl. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    559 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Second, Dimension argues that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority because the language of the arbitration agreements did not grant the panel the authority to consolidate. Third, Dimension argues that the arbitration panel did not have the authority to consider consolidation because, pursuant to R.C. 2712.52, a petition, along with proof of unanimous consent to consolidation, must be filed with the courts to consolidate separate arbitration claims. Finally, Dimension argues that the arbitration panel did not have the authority to consolidate because the consolidation question is a threshold arbitrability question that was reserved for the courts, as expressed in\n   <em>\n    Shakoor v. VXI Global Solutions\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2587\">\n    2015-Ohio-2587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.E.3d%20539\">\n    35 N.E.3d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48 and\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Dimension contends that\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   held that arbitrators cannot force collective arbitration and express consent is required to consolidate bilateral arbitrations. However,\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   specifically applies to class actions. Dimension mischaracterizes the\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   holding because the United States Supreme Court held that express consent is required to consolidate class-action arbitrations, not bilateral arbitrations, because class-action arbitrations are fundamentally different from bilateral action arbitrations. As the court explained, class-action arbitration \"changes the nature of the arbitration\" because the arbitrator's award \"no longer resolves a single agreement, but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   at 686,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The arbitrator's award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In this case, the arbitrators consolidated the actions for the limited purposes of discovery and motion practice. Further, the arbitration panel's decision expressly permitted Dimension to request a separate hearing for any individual claimant but Dimension did not make any such requests. Moreover, we note that Dimension waited more than five months after the joint demand for arbitration was made to object to the consolidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Dimension argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by consolidating the actions because the PSAs did not grant the panel authority to consider the request to consolidate or authority to order consolidation. The Federal Arbitration Act provides that an arbitration panel only has the rights and duties that are provided under the contract.\n   <em>\n    Reyna Capital Corp. v.

Since the contracts were identical and the defenses were likely identical, the panel found consolidation permissible by the contract language and efficient. (Mar. 16, 2015 Decision.) The arbitrators did not violate any provision in the agreements by consolidation. Rather, the language gives the arbitrators broad powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Dimension argues that R.C. 2712.52 requires a petition to the court and unanimous consent of the parties for consolidation of arbitration. R.C. 2712.52 provides, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (A) If the parties to two or more arbitration agreements have agreed, in their respective arbitration agreements or otherwise, to consolidate the arbitrations arising out of those arbitration agreements, the court of common pleas, on application by one party with the consent of all the other parties to those arbitration agreements, may do one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) Order the arbitrations to be consolidated on terms the court considers just and necessary;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (2) If all the parties cannot agree on an arbitral tribunal for the consolidated arbitration, appoint an arbitral tribunal in accordance with section 2712.20 of the Revised Code ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (3) If all the parties cannot agree on any other matter necessary to conduct the consolidated arbitration, make any other order it considers necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (B) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the parties to two or more arbitrations from agreeing to consolidate those arbitrations and taking any steps that are necessary to effect that consolidation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 22} R.C. Chapter 2712 is not applicable to these facts. R.C. 2712.02(A) provides: \"This chapter applies to international commercial arbitration and conciliation, subject to any agreement that is in force between the United States or any other state or states.\" R.C. 2712.03(A)(1) defines \"international arbitration\" as one in which \"[t]he parties to an arbitration or conciliation agreement have, at the time of the conclusion of that agreement, their places of business in different states.\" A \"state\" is defined in R.C. 2712.03(B)\"[f]or purposes of this section, the states, districts, commonwealths, territories, and insular possessions of the United States and the areas subject to the legislative authority of the United States shall be considered one state.\" Thus, since these facts do not involve international commercial arbitration, it is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Finally, in its brief, Dimension argues that consolidation is a threshold question of arbitrability for the courts to determine.

However, again Dimension misconstrues the case law. In\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   , an insurer sought a motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. The insurer was not a party to the arbitration rider and the subject matter of the litigation was outside the scope of the arbitrable issues.\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the case at hand because its facts involved a motion to stay litigation already pending in the court, a party who was not a party to the arbitration rider and an issue that was not within the scope of the arbitrable issues. Thus, this court determined that the trial court needed to determine whether the parties before the court were the same parties named in the agreement to arbitrate and whether they agreed to arbitrate the dispute in question before the trial court orders arbitration. The holding was not that consolidation is a threshold question of arbitrability for the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal have consistently held that the matter of consolidation is not a threshold question of arbitrability for a court to decide, but, rather, is a matter of procedure for the\n   arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London v.

Therefore, Dimension's first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In its fifth and sixth assignments of error, Dimension contends that the trial court erred in failing to consider that evident partiality existed requiring the arbitration award to be vacated under R.C. 2711.10. Dimension provides two arguments of evident partiality, (1) that Arbitrator Borchardt had a conflict of interest which tainted his participation in the panel's decision to consolidate for purposes of discovery and motion practice, and (2) Arbitrator Dubner was biased because Dubner had previously served as an arbitrator in a separate arbitration proceeding between Dimension and two of the present claimants and because Dubner had previously represented clients of Frank Klaus, an individual with business relationships with claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} R.C. 2711.10 provides, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   In any of the following cases, the court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (A) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (B) Evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrators, or any of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (C) The arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (D) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter was not made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   If an award is vacated and the time within which the agreement required the award to be made has not expired, the court may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Dimension's first argument is that Arbitrator Borchardt resigned as a member of the arbitration panel because of a conflict of interest because he accepted a position as legal consultant to the parent company of First Dealer Resources, LLC,\n   the entity that had served as Dimension's marketing representative for the programs that were the subject of the arbitration. Dimension contends that since Borchardt participated in the decision to consolidate, that decision must have been tainted by his conflict of interest and the trial court erred in not vacating the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellees argue that Dimension waived the argument that Arbitrator Borchardt had a conflict of interest that tainted his participation because Dimension did not present this argument to the trial court.

Arbitrator Borchardt did not accept the position that created the conflict of interest until August 2015. Borchardt resigned as a member of the arbitration panel immediately. Dimension did not provide any direct evidence of bias but argues that Borchardt must have been biased when the consolidation decision was made because he admitted a conflict of interest five months later. However, there is no evidence that Borchardt had any conflict of interest at the time of the consolidation decision. Some evidence of actual bias or evidence of circumstantial fact which would give rise to a question of bias must be presented and Dimension has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Dimension's second argument is that Arbitrator Dubner was biased because Dubner had previously served as an arbitrator in a separate arbitration proceeding between Dimension and two of the present claimants and because Dubner had previously represented clients of Frank Klaus, an individual with business relationships with claimants. Dubner did not represent Klaus or any of the applicants. Moreover, the representation began in 2008 and had ended years before the arbitration panel issued its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Dimension provides no argument and no authority as to why an arbitrator demonstrates bias when he had previously served as an arbitrator for the parties. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an arbitrator is not disqualified simply because he has served on previous arbitration panels for the same parties or the same contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trustmark Ins.

However, the transcript pages demonstrate that First Dealer Resources is a subagency to appellee Great Lakes. Klaus is a principal of Great Lakes. (Tr. at 162-63.) Dubner represented clients of Klaus but not Klaus or any of the applicants. The testimony did not demonstrate that Dubner had a financial interest in the PSAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The trial court observed that the arbitration panel thoroughly considered the issue but determined that Dubner was qualified to serve on the panel. The trial court found that a relationship eight years prior to the arbitration and one that involved no direct representation between Dubner and Klaus was too tenuous and remote to establish bias or evident partiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Dimension cites\n   <em>\n    Close v.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Close\n   </em>\n   , the arbitration award was vacated because the arbitrator was a partner in a law firm that had an ongoing relationship with one of the parties. This court stated, \"[w]e hold, therefore, that an arbitrator's partnership in a law firm having a substantial, continuing attorney-client relationship with a party is grounds for vacating an arbitration award under Rev.

In\n   <em>\n    Beck Suppliers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the motion to vacate the arbitration award was based on the fact that one of the arbitrators was a partner in a law firm that had represented the parent and sister corporations of Dean Witter. Even though Dean Witter prevailed in the arbitration, the court found that the arbitration did not need to be vacated. The Sixth District Court of Appeals held that the arbitrator's relationship to Dean Witter was \"too indirect and remote to substantiate any inference of bias.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Here, the evidence in support of Dimension's position is indirect and tenuous, at best, to prove arbitrator partiality.

Dimension's argument is based on paragraph two of the PSAs. The arbitration panel found paragraph two ambiguous and examined the parties' course of dealing. The course of dealing demonstrated that Dimension historically calculated the profit share payments, not Allstate. Since the arbitration panel reviewed the PSAs, the trial court properly declined to review and vacate the arbitration award.

(Dimension brief at 51.) After the arbitration panel issued its Interim Award, Dimension submitted a Statement of Interest, Costs, and Motion to Reconsider the Interim Award and set forth the same arguments to the arbitration panel. The arbitration panel specifically mentions that it considered Dimension's Motion to Reconsider and awarded Dimension one-sixth of its $2,876.50 in reimbursable costs claimed in its Motion to Reconsider and denied all other relief sought. (Jan. 11, 2017 Final Award at 2.) The arbitration panel specifically addressed and rejected Dimension's argument.
