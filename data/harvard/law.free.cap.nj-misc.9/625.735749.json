The relator seems to say it was filed, and Mr. Castles, the building inspector, seems to say that it was not. In the depositions Mr. Castle admits in effect that he did not tell relator at the time that a plot plan was required, but he does say that he told relator \u201cdownstairs\u201d that he should have a plot plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The defendants say that a plot plan is required by the ordinance. Whether that is so we cannot now determine with certainty, for while an ordinance seems to have been marked as an exhibit, it is not printed. There was some testimony, however, that seems to indicate that all applications for building permits shall be accompanied by plan showing the actual dimensions, &amp;c., of the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We think there is a showing sufficient for the award of an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Where, on application for <em>mandamus </em>it appears, as here, that there are fairly debatable questions involved, the Supreme Court will ordinarily issue an alternative writ, to the end that an issue may be made and the facts ascertained, and an opportunity for review in error. <em>Schnitzler </em>v. <em>New York Transportation </em>Co., 76 <em>N. J. L. </em>171.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">An alternative writ will therefore be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
