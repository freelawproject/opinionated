The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant\u2019s counter-claim for damages to its engine. The amount of the-plaintiff\u2019s verdict was $375.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The defendant\u2019s first point is that the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence upon the issue of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence and upon the issue of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We think that it was clearly open to the jury to find, as it evidently did, that the defendant company was negligent in failing to keep in proper repair this railroad crossing, with the direct result that because of its failure, the automobile of the plaintiff, driven in the exercise of due care, was demolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">We reach this conclusion even though there was testimony upon the part of the defendant tending to support the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff was at fault in proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ill the fog, and that by reason of the fog, failed to keep upon that part of the crossing which prudence would have required, thereby putting Ms automobile, or some portion of it, off of the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Shortly, we think that the jury was amply justified in finding for the plaintiff on this phase of the case, and against the defendant on its counter-claim, and that the jury\u2019s verdict cannot be said to be against the clear weight of the evidence upon these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">It is lastly said that the verdict was excessive. We think the testimony to which we have referred puts the case in a position where it cannot properly be said that the verdict is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Tiie rule to show cause will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
