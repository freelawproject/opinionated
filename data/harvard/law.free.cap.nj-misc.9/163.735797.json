He was summarily dismissed from his employment and claims that the dismissal is illegal because of the Exempt Firemen\u2019s act of 1911 <em>(Pamph. </em>L., <em>p. </em>444), which provides, among other things, that no person then holding a position or office under the government of any city, &amp;c., of this state, or may thereafter he appointed to snch position, whose term of office is not fixed by law and receiving a salary, &amp;c., who was an exempt fireman, &amp;e., shall be removed except for canse and after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The prosecutor was not appointed by any ordinance or resolution; but was employed by the commissioner as a sort of general utility man working at trimming trees, painter, carpenter, &amp;e. At first he was paid by the day but later was placed on a salary. We do not think that he held either a position or an office. The distinction of the three classes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>service is contained in the leading case of <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Board of Health, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>200, which cites, among other cases, <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>51 <em>Id. </em>240; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Hudson County, </em>53 <em>Id. </em>585, and <em>Kreigh </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>62 <em>Id. </em>178.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">We are clear that the prosecutor is not entitled to the protection of the statute invoked and, consequently, the rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
