The suit arose out of an automobile collision. Plaintiff sued to recover the damage done to her car and defendant counterclaimed for the damage to his car. The court gave judgment for the defendant on his counter-claim. No point is made of the propriety of entertaining a counter-claim in a District Court action in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The case presents a question of fact only. Appellant argues no other ground. There is ample support for the finding of the trial judge that the plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s negligence was -the proximate cause of the accident and that the defendant was free from contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
