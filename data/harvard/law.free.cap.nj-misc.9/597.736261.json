The plaintiff, as contractor, sued the defendants as owners and builders. The notice of appeal states four grounds\u2014first, that the judgment was unlawfully entered because there had been a lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the diligent prosecution required by the statute (section 18 of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien act, 3 <em>Comp. Stat.j p. </em>3305); second, that no notice of the filing of the report was given to-the defendant pursuant to Rule 100 of this court; third,, that no notice of confirmation of the referee\u2019s report was-given; fourth, that the lien claim is for less than the amount of the judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">There were no exceptions taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">As to the first point, the statute is not automatic. Had appellant desired to raise the question of lack of diligence-she should have done so by appropriate procedure resulting in a court ruling, followed by exception or equivalent noted, objection. Nothing of the sort is presented and we find that-the point is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The second point lacks merit. Defendant\u2019s attorney had full knowledge. This is clear from his affidavit and from his-correspondence, printed in the state of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The third point seems not to be grounded in fact. Not: only was the attorney of the defendant notified in advance-of motion to confirm the referee\u2019s report but he was, according to the recitals in the order made by Judge Mountain on October 19th, 1929, physically in court, appearing for the-defendant, on the occasion of the confirming of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The summons in the action was served personally on both defendants. The <em>ad damnum, </em>clause of the complaint names; an amount greater than that of the judgment, and the complaint alleges the debt to be due from the defendants individually as well as a lien on the land. The judgment is for $1,100. Appellant contends that the lien claim was by its terms limited to $925. The lien claim is not printed in the case but respondent\u2019s brief concedes that the amount thereof was $925. Judgment specially against lands is under the statute and the statutory method leading thereto must be-followed. But the judgment before us, as printed in the-state of ca'se, is a judgment generally against the defendants and is not special against the lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">We find no cause for reversal. The judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
