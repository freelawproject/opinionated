Simon, by his invitation, in an automobile, and were injured in a collision between that automobile and the defendant\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The only question argued is as to the amount of the damages. We think that it cannot be said, in view of the evidence, that the verdict of $435 awarded to Daniel Kohl is inadequate. Under familiar rules the jury might with propriety have found the verdict that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Por the same reason we think that it cannot be said that the verdict for $50 in favor of Prances Kohl is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">That both plaintiffs were injured more or less is undisputed ; but it is contended, and the evidence reasonably tends to show, that their injuries were not serious, and we cannot say that the jury erred in disregarding in- whole or in part the evidence of the husband as to his business losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The rule to show cause will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
