The permit was denied, without reason being given, and upon October 4th,s1930, the present rule was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">It appears that on October 6th, 1928, Bloomfield, pursuant to the zoning amendment and the statute thereunder, appointed a zoning commission which made no report until October 4th, 1930, something over two years after its appointment. It appears also that the present rule to show cause was allowed upon the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">This report has been adopted by Bloomfield and its attorney has been directed, and authorized, to prepare a zoning ordinance, in accord therewith, which will create a zone, including relator\u2019s lands, restricting the use thereof to one-family dwellings, which would make the use thereof proposed by relator a non-conforming one.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Mindful of <em>Butvinik </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>6 <em>N.

With this in mind, and without attempting to excuse inactivity in this direction, we are unwilling in the present ease, and at ths time, to grant to the applicant the writ applied for.' This denial, however, is without prejudice to a future application therefor and without prejudice to an application for such a writ to require the governing body to proceed to adopt a zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The rule to show cause is discharged, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
