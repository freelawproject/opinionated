L. </em>1927, <em>p. </em>790) exempting \u201call buildings actually and exclusively used in the work of associations and corporations organized exclusively for the moral and mental improvement of men, women and children, or for religious, charitable or hospital purposes, or for one or more of such purposes, * * The act further provides that the provisions shall apply only when the building is owned by the association, corporation or institution, authorized to carry out such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>All of the requirements to afford the owner of the property herein involved the benefit of the exemption clearly appear from the proofs, and none of the facts are in dispute. Upon the city\u2019s showing of the existing facts, the finding of the Essex county board of taxation and of the state board of taxes and assessment that the assessment must be set aside is clearly correct. <em>City of Trenton </em>v. <em>Trenton Masonic Temple </em>Association, 8 <em>N.
