The prosecutor-defendant thereafter took no part in the proceeding and judgment being rendered against it sued out the present writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">The plaintiff below does not contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">Unquestionably the small cause court had no jurisdiction. The prosecutors\u2019 principal office is in the city of Newark, where there is a District Court and therefore under chapter 175 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1923, and chapter 211, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1921) the small cause court had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">For these reasons the judgment under review is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
