The steering gear mechanism broke causing the injuries from which they complain. At the time of the accident plaintiff Henry Brenson was driving the car at defendant\u2019s request. There is testimony in the case indicating that defendant had stated that before he requested Brenson to drive the car he knew that there was something wrong with the steering wheel, but thought nothing would happen until he had had time to have it fixed. There was also evidence that the forewheels shimmied and wobbled on the way to Baltimore while the defendant was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-13\">The case comes before us to reverse because of the failure of the trial court to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>Unless we are willing to expunge from the record the proof of defendant\u2019s knowledge of the defective steering wheel, we do not see how we can do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
