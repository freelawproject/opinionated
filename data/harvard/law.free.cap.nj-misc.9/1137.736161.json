CHARLES YOUNG, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b1155-4\">Decided November 16, 1931.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1155-7\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Parker and Case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1155-8\">Eor the plaintiff, <em>Aaron L.

Before receiving the injuries sued upon he made between two and three coats a week and earned between $23 and $25 for each coat. The principal injury was a comminuted fracture of the leg which caused the plaintiff to be twice placed in a cast, the first time for six weeks and the second time for about two and one-half months. In addition, some teeth were loosened and later came out, and there were a laceration of the scalp and a brain concussion. In the healing process of the fractured leg there ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>pears to have been an overlapping of the bone, resulting in a shortening of the leg of an inch and a half with a probable percentage of impairment in the plaintiff\u2019s capacity for following his trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Our consideration of all the circumstances of the case, including the age of the plaintiff, brings us to the conclusion that the verdict was excessive. If the plaintiff will consent to a reduction of the verdict to the sum of $10,000, the rule will be discharged; otherwise the rule will be made absolute and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
