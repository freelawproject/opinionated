GEORGE RUCKLE ET AL., TRADING AS RUCKLE BROTHERS, DEFENDANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b165-4\">Submitted October term, 1930</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ai2\">Decided January 20, 1931.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b165-6\">Before Justices Paeicee, Campbell and Boduste.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-7\">Eor the rule, <em>Isidor Kalisch.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>Contra, Joseph F.

The defendants have this rule and urge a setting aside of the verdict and a rule for new trial for several reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">1. Error in refusing to nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">2. Error in refusing to direct a verdict in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">The foregoing upon the contention that the party extending to the plaintiff the invitation to enter and be upon the premises had no authority binding the defendants; that having no such authority, the plaintiff acted upon an implied invitation and exceeded the bounds thereof, and plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">We conclude the proofs were such as required all these matters to be referred to and settled by the jury, and, therefore, there was no error in the rulings complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">3. That the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">This, we also find, was a matter to be submitted to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">4. That the trial court erred in refusing to charge certain requests of the defendants dealing with the exceeding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>bounds of invitation, contributory negligence and assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In this respect we find no harmful error because we conclude the trial court properly charged as to each of these rules and principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">5 and 6. That the verdict is against the weight of evidence and the jury disregarded the court\u2019s charge as to the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We find this to be not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
