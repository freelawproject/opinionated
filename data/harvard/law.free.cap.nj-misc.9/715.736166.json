FRANK HAGUE, WILLIAM B. QUINN, JOHN BEGGANS, MICHAEL I. FAGAN AND ARTHUR T.

The alternative writ was issued in June, 1930, and came on for hearing before this court at the October term of 1930, and no ordinance had yet been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">The relators are entitled to a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus. </em>While it is true that in <em>Butvinik </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>142 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>759, and other cases it was held that municipalities were entitled to a reasonable time after the adoption of the zoning amendment to the constitution in 1927 and the passage of the Zoning act of 1928 (chapter 274) in which to act, we think the reasonable time thus accorded has expired. It is not within the contemplation of the cases cited that property owners should be held up indefinitely in the lawful use of their property, and at the same time be obliged to pay taxes thereon to the city while the latter contemplates the passage of an ordinance that may by possibility affect such property.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">The peremptory writ is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
