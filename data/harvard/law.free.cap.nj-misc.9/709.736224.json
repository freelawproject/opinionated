Our conclusion, therefore, is that the court properly refused to withdraw the case from the jury, and that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Nor do we deem the damages excessive. The car had been purchased seven months before the seizure for $3,515; the jury\u2019s award was $2,500, and there was credible evidence to support the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The rule for new trial is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
