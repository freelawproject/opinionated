At the time defendant\u2019s ear was traveling thirty-five to forty miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Prom the proofs it appears to us to have been a fair jury question as to whether or not the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Every driver of a car knows or should know that as he approaches a \u201cblinker\u201d light he must exercise caution. Not to do so and exercise reasonable care in anticipation of pedestrian and other traffic must be considered to be negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">We conclude that the rule to show cause should be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
