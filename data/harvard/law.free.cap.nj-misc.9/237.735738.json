The commissioner awarded compensation for an eye injury. The workman was employed as a core maker. Part of his work was to clean the cores with sand. He got sand in his eye. The injury was aggravated by a disease called interstitial keratitis. Any blow, or dirt, or dust in the eye will bring the infection to the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">The Court of Common Pleas overlooked this testimony, establishing the causal connection between the blow and the injury, and reversed the findings of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">We think there is evidence to support the findings of the commissioner, but not to support the findings of the Common Pleas Court. <em>Atchison </em>v. <em>Colgate &amp; Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>451; <em>Charlock </em>v. <em>Kellogg Co., </em>4 <em>Id. </em>260</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas reversing the findings of the commissioner is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
