The controversy turns upon whether plaintiff struck defendant\u2019s car when in plain view on the highway or whether the defendant struck plaintiff\u2019s car while turning into the highway. Defendant lives on the north side of the highway and proceeded out of his driveway into the road. He testified he did so when plaintiff was five hundred feet distant on his right; that he made a turn to the left and when fully turned and on the south side of Atlantic Highlands road and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>yet in that highway, he was struck by plaintiff\u2019s car. The plaintiff testified that defendant passed entirely across the road and into the trolley right of way and was hidden from view behind trees on that side, and that when plaintiff reached the place of the accident defendant\u2019s car came out without warning and the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">While the number of witnesses preponderates in favor of the defendant\u2019s story, there are circumstances connected with the accident strongly corroborating the plaintiff\u2019s version, and we think a fair jury question was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">As to the damage of $5,000 for a hernia and temporary bruises, defendant presented proofs that an inguinal hernia cannot result from injury, but other medical proofs in the case are to the contrary. In addition to the physical pain and loss of his car, the plaintiff had substantial bills for treatment. lie worked regularly up to the time of the accident at his job and has never been able to do so from that time to the date of trial, a period of fourteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The award is not so clearly excessive as to justify the court in disturbing the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
