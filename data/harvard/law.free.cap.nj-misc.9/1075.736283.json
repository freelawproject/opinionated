The plaintiff, a young man twenty-three years of age, received through the negligence of the defendant an injury to his left shoulder, lacerations of the hand, a fracture of the left forearm and an injury to his private parts resulting in a permanent stricture of the urethra. He received a verdict of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">While the verdict is high, we think it is not so clearly excessive that it should be disturbed. The proofs were that he suffered severe pains; that his left arm was seriously impaired in its usefulness and that there was a permanent stricture of the urethra which required a periodical expanding of that organ to permit the passage of the urine; that this was always painful and that even the passage of urine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>itself was a painful experience. We are not prepared to say that for such injuries, both of which were permanent in their effects, we should either grant a new trial or reduce the-amount as a condition of refusing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">The rule is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
