The moving affidavit has lost all evidential force <em>(Peer </em>v. <em>Bloxham, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>288) and there is nothing before us by way of stipulation, or deposition, or any documentary evidence, to support the rule. Consequently it will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">It may be pertinent to add that the brief submitted for the prosecutor is not signed by a counselor-at-law, and hence should not be considered even if the state of the ease were before us. <em>Leaver </em>v. <em>Kilmer, </em>54 <em>Atl.
