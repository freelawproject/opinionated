The jury awarded a verdict in her favor of $200 and to her husband, <em>per </em>quod, $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">The plaintiffs claim that the verdict is inadequate; the defendants, that there should have been a verdict in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">Our reading of the testimony satisfies us that if the plaintiffs were entitled to any damages the amounts found are plainly inadequate; but on the other hand the right to a recovery is in our view most doubtful. Our conclusion is that there should be a new trial at large, whereat the questions both of liability and <em>quantum </em>of damages may be retried.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
