The jury placed the liability upon the defendant Griffith and rendered a verdict against Griffith of $2,500 and found a verdict in favor of Kaplan of no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">As we read the proofs the foregoing statement of facts is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant Griffith writes down three reasons for a new trial: (1) that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence; (2) that the verdict was contrary to law; and (3) that the damages awarded by the jury are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">We turn now to the damages awarded by the jury. The verdict was for $2,500. We are not satisfied that the verdict is excessive. Plaintiff claimed for damages resulting from personal injuries and also for the loss of his motorcycle. The evidence tended to show, and was uncontradicted, that the motorej'ole was so damaged as to render it practically worthless. The plaintiff\u2019s injuries were what may well be called serious, and up to the time of the trial, which was September 10th, 1930, he had not fully recovered therefrom. It was undisputed that his rib was broken; that he suffered severely for three weeks and was unable to resume his usual occupation for a period of four months; that thereafter he was much disturbed with headaches, pain in his side, back and shoulder. He was a young man and theretofore had had employment under contract as a chauffeur, and had theretofore been well and strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>The evidence as to his earnings is not perfectly clear, but undoubtedly his average earnings prior to the accident amounted to $40 a week, and the jury might have found from the evidence that they amounted to $80 a week. His expenses for doctors and X-rays amounted to $12; the proved loss for his motorcycle was $450. Considering his wages lost, and what would be reasonable compensation for his pain and suffering and future discomfort or disability, it seems reasonably certain that his verdict of $2,500 cannot be said to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">And upon the whole case we think the verdict cannot be said to be against the weight of the evidence, either upon the question of negligence of the defendant or upon the alleged contributory negligence of the plaintiff, and that the verdict is not contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The rule will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
