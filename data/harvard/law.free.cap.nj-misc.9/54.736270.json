Her testimony was uncorroborated. Several witnesses, most of them disinterested, testified to the effect that the bus did not move and that she had alighted from the bus and was making her way over the sidewalk when she fell and hurt her hip. Not only did the witnesses so testify, but a number of witnesses, including the policeman, who were present, and who interviewed her soon after-wards, testified that she then said that it was not the fault of the bus, that the bus did not move, but that the injury was the result of turning her ankle or making a mis-step.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
