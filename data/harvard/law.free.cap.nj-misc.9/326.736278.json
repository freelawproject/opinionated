Mrs. Melnick testified that she was in charge of the property for the defendant and that she was charged with the duty of collecting rents and making repairs. There was evidence that following the injury to the woman, the defendant or someone acting for her put a nail in the nosing as a temporary expedient, and that thereafter no further repairs were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The whole ease presented a clear question of fact for the determination of the jury upon the question of the defendant's liability as well as the plaintiff's contributory negligence. Several objections are made to the rulings of the trial judge with respect to the admission of testimony, but we are unable to discover any harmful error, and likewise in the refusal of the trial judge to charge in the language of some of the defendant's requests. The trial judge submitted the matter properly to the jury and there was no harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
