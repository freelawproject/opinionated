The suit was for damages to silk portieres which plaintiff had given to the defendant to be cleaned and which, as alleged, were irreparably damaged in the cleaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The first and second points relate to the admission of the testimony'of Eleanor S. Beynolds on matters claimed by the appellant to be hearsay. We are of the opinion that a number of the questions, admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection, called for and were answered with testimony'that was clearly hearsay. One such question was as follows: \u201cDid you inquire about and make inquiries about the silk, as to the value of replacing them ?\u201d Objection was made and overruled, and an exception was taken. The question, slightly changed\u2018but substantially the same, was repeated and was answered-\u2014\u2022 omitting the interruption of a further objection made in the course thereof\u2014\u201cI went to several factories, mills here in Paterson, to see if they made the material, and they said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>no; and the place at the end of Market street, way down at the end of Market street, whatever its name is, told me to replace that goods he would need to order\u2014whatever gentleman waited on me at that factory told me it would be fifteen dollars or sixteen dollars a'yard to replace that to-day. They told me it was pure silk in two or three places, and they didn\u2019t have anything like that now.\u201d The purpose of this evidence was to show the extent of the loss sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the injury to his silk portieres. It was incompetent and a judgment which rests in any degree upon such testimony cannot be supported. <em>Arata </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>46.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">We deem it unnecessary to consider the remaining points raised on appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
