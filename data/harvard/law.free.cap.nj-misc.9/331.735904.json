In addition to certain liabilities specifically enumerated in a schedule, the agreement between the parties provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u201cIt being distinctly understood and agreed that should there be any other liabilities not specifically enumerated in the schedule in the possession of Arnold B. Rosenthal, certified public accountant, that as to such amount the party of the first part and the party of the second part hereby agree to bear the same equally between them, and the same has reference to any current bills outstanding, such as telephone bills, electric light bills or any other bill not specifically enumerated in the accountant\u2019s statement of liabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The court found on the count in question that the plaintiff is entitled to receive one-half of the sum of $465.45, or $232.74, as well as the sum of $63 on the second count, making $295.72 in all. There is no controversy as to the item of $63 on the second count. The question, therefore, is whether under the agreement stated the plaintiff-appellee was entitled to judgment against the defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The items in question were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Edmund A. Hayes, for incorporating company. . . . $250.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">Leon Jacobs and Bros, for merchandise.......... 12.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">City Tax ................................... 56.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">Advertising, New Brunswick Spokesman ........ 6.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">New Jersey Bell Telephone Co.................. 12.35</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">Advertising, Eagles ........................... 35.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">or $371.85, which under the state of the case it appears the plaintiff-appellee established as being liabilities of the corporation. Eor this sum, under the facts stated and the finding of the District Court, plaintiff is entitled to judgment for one-half, or $185.92. The other items upon which the District Court found in favor of the plaintiff-appellee are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Lumber to close up door....................... $5.05</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">W. Stenner, carpenter........................ 4.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Joseph Randolph, window lights ................. 34.65</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Rolfe Lumber Co.............................. 50.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">$93.70</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The testimony was that these items were incurred by the plaintiff-appellee in making certain alterations to the property theretofore occupied by the corporation so that both plaintiff and defendant might occupy one-half, the property being owned by the plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">There are two objections to the collection of these items. First, it does not appear that the plaintiff-appellee paid these bills, so that if they were within the purview of this provision of the agreement, the plaintiff would have no right to collect for them in advance of payment by him. And secondly, these items do not come within the agreement. They were not corporation liabilities, having arisen out of an agreement between plaintiff-appellee as landlord and the defendant-appellant as tenant. There was, therefore, legal error in the allowance of these items in this case. <em>Oppicci </em>v. <em>Eric Railroad Co., </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>394.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Let the judgment be reversed and the record remitted for a new trial in the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
