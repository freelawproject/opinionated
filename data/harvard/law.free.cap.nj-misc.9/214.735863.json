We gather from her brief that she lays the error in the denial of the motion to direct, but we do not understand that the defendant has a right to compel a verdict, large or small, to be entered in favor of an unwilling plaintiff. Perhaps the defendant meant thus-to limit the extent of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery, but the motion was not appropriate to that end. Nor was the motion sufficiently explicit. A verdict for money damages is in figures or their equivalent, not in the nomenclature \"nominal damages.\u201d Plaintiff would now waive aside the entire defense on the theory that the defendant, having moved for a direction, was not entitled to produce testimony thereafter\u2014a. matter which, by pertinent objection, should have been\u2014but according to the record was not\u2014presented at the trial. Nevertheless, we find no reversible error in this division of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">A further allegation of error requires a brief statement, of the case. The action arises out of a contract relating to a \"Hair Devitalizing Machine.\u201d There had been an earlier agreement between the distributor and one Clark, giving the-latter certain agent\u2019s and lessee\u2019s rights. Clark\u2019s rights were assigned to Yan Ilouten. Yan Houten, one of the plaintiffs herein, and Campbell, the defendant herein, entered into-an agreement whereby the former undertook to assign \u201cthe contract\u201d to Campbell, and the latter agreed to purchase the same for $500, payable $100 on the next day, namely, November 19th, 1929, and $400 on December 2d, 1929; the-contract to be actually transferred upon the making of the $400 payment. Nothing further was done except that, as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the stipulated facts recite, \u201cthe plaintiff was notified by the \u2022defendant that she would not take the machine.\u201d This suit was brought for the recovery of the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">It is conceded by both parties that the case is within the Sale of Goods act (4 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>4647); but a dispute .arose at the trial and is continued on appeal as to which .section of the act was operative, whether section 63, subsection 2, as argued by the plaintiff, or section 64 as argued by the \u2022defendant. The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found, in his decision, that \u201cthis action was brought by the plaintiff under section 63, subsection 2, of the Sales act, and not .section 64, and under this section plaintiff is entitled to recover the purchase price of the contract, viz., five hundred \u25a0dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Nothing had been done under the contract. The contract was wholly executory. \u201cThe rule of law is that either party to a contract, wholly or partially executory on the part of the \u2022other party, always has the right to stop performance by the \u25a0other party subject to that party\u2019s right to damages. <em>Ell. L. S. </em>611. Eepudiating a contract to sell goods or countermanding performance, does not rescind the contract, but \u25a0constitutes a breach of it. 2 <em>Mech. S., </em>\u00a7 1092. If the breach \u25a0of contract takes place before any of the goods have been \u2022delivered, the measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of \u25a0events, from the buyer\u2019s breach of contract.' <em>Sales of Goods Act, </em>\u00a7 64 (1) (2); <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>4662; <em>Ell. L. 8. </em>612;\u201d <em>Bixler </em>v. <em>Finkle, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>77. See, also, <em>Crichfield-Loeffler, Inc., </em>v. <em>Taverna, </em>4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>310.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Section 64 of the Sales act, <em>supra, </em>subsections 1 and 2, provide as follows: \u201c(1) Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may maintain an action against him for damages for non-accept.ance. (2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of \u2022events, from the buj^er\u2019s breach of contract.\u201d 4 <em>Comp. Stat., </em>jp. 4662. That language, in our opinion, is controlling. It \u25a0cannot be said that the obligation to pay the $500 was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>irrespective of delivery that section 63, subsection <em>2, </em>became-applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">There was no proof of damage ensuing from the defendant\u2019s breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The finding of the trial judge was in error. Judgment below will be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
