While Moriarity was waiting at defendant\u2019s garage for the hour of the appointment, Ered W. Meuter, president of the defendant corporation, sent the car out on another errand. Moriarity informed Meuter that Mortality had made an appointment in Edgewater for the car, whereupon Meuter said: \u201cTake the big Nash. Try and sell him that car.\u201d Moriarity complied and during the trip made an unsuccessful effort at a sale. On the return trip, after the party had stopped at two roadhouses and Moriarity had had several drinks of beer and whisky, and while Moriarity was at the wheel driving at a speed of between thirty-five and forty miles per hour in a residential neighborhood, the ear left the road, hit a pole and was badly wrecked. Lonergan was injured in the accident and died, as a result, on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\">Supplementing the oral and documentary evidence were photographs of the wrecked car and the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">With the proofs in this shape we think that the trial court properly refused defendant\u2019s motions for nonsuit and direction of verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">The only other point argued in the appellant\u2019s brief is that the jury was confused by the court\u2019s reading, in its charge, of section 1 of article IX, of chapter 281 of the laws of 1928, commonly known as the Traffic act. The matter read by the court from section 1 was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">\u201cAny person who shall drive any vehicle upon the highway carelessly and heedlessly in willful or wanton disregard of the rights and safety of others, or without due caution or circumspection, or at a speed and in a manner so as to endanger or to be likely to endanger any person or property, shall be guilty of reckless driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">We think there was nothing in that language to confuse the jury. The jury was distinctly told that there was no liability on the part of the defendants (Moriarity being one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>of the defendants below) unless Moriarity was negligent and unless such negligence was the proximate cause of Lonergan\u2019s death. If Moriarity was guilty of reckless driving, as described in the quotation complained of, and if, further, Lonergan was injured and came to his death as the result thereof, there would be civil liability, not as a consequential outworking of the statute, but because such a state of facts constitutes actionable negligence. The jury was further instructed that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff. No harm came to the defendant from the language of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">The judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
