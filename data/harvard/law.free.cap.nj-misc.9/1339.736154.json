The suit was brought upon a contract by which plaintiffs were to manufacture for the defendant a large quantity of shirts for $2.55 a dozen, the material to be furnished by the defendant. The defendant failed and refused to furnish the material, thereby preventing performance at the time specified, or as a matter of fact at any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 proofs clearly showed that they would have made a profit of at least a dollar a dozen on the shirts to be manufactured. Defendant offered no evidence, and the trial judge directed the jury to bring in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for at least one dollar a dozen damages, which they did. Damages recovered were the profits which the proofs showed the plaintiffs would have realized had they been permitted to perform the contract. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Rutherford, </em>56 N. <em>J.
