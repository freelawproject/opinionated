There is a general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-14\">The attack is obviously founded on a series of statutes purporting to be amendments of section 2 of \u201cAn act respecting municipal police departments * * *,\u201d approved April 23 st, 1915. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>688. See <em>Pamph. L. </em>1926, <em>p. </em>600; 1927, <em>p. </em>495; 1928, <em>p. </em>387. But as we have twice distinctly held, these so-called amendments were futile, .be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>cause at the time they were enacted the act of <em>1915 on </em>which they were based had been repealed and was no longer in existence. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>ch. </em>204 (at <em>p. </em>665). See <em>Mulsoff </em>v. Sloat, 8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>554; 151 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>113, and <em>Wentzell </em>v. Steelman, 8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>503; 151 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>116. These eases are dispositive of the matter so far as we are now concerned. The respondent is entitled to judgment on the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
