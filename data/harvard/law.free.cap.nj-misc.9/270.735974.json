As was declared by .this court in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>O'Donnell </em>(No. 1 of the May term, 1930), the refusal to charge that, in order to justify a conviction for violation of the statute, the proofs must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>show not only that the defendants kept a place to which persons resorted for betting, but also that it was the intent of the defendants that persons should resort to such place for that purpose, was legal error; following the rule upon this subject laid down by this court in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>456, and by the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>539. It is argued on behalf of the state that the decisions referred to do not support the request, for the reason that it required the jury to acquit unless it was satisfied <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>of the existence of such intent on the part of the defendants. We cannot concur in this view. Both of the decisions quoted declare that the intent of the keeper of the place that persons should resort thereto for betting, &amp;c., is essential to his guilt; and, in our opinion, the existence of an <em>essential </em>fact, upon which the guilt of the defendant is predicated, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The judgment under review will be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
