The defendant admitted the services but contended that at least a portion of them were rendered in pursuance of a written contract which provided that for such portion there should be no charge. The difficulty here is that the alleged contract does not appear to have been offered in evidence, nor is it contained in the state of the case. There is nothing, therefore, before us that would justify a reversal and the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
