It was rested in part upon the contention that there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. We think there was. It appeared that the decedent was riding in an automobile operated by the defendant; that defendant operated the automobile in such a careless and negligent manner that while riding through Cadwalador Park in Trenton it left the road and thereafter traveled seventy-five feet when it collided with a tree, and the result was that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was seriously injured and died the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Defendant further says that the motion to nonsuit should have been granted because there was no proof that plaintiffs intestate was an invitee in his automobile. We think there was such proof, although the proof was contradicted. The testimony was that before decedent entered the car defendant said to him, \u201cI will take you home,\u201d and asked decedent -to get into the car. Decedent entered and they started.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The motion for a direction of a verdict was properly denied for the same reason that the motion for nonsuit was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We cannot say that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The criticism of the court\u2019s charge contained in the defendant\u2019s brief is not [assigned as a reason for setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The rule to show cause will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
