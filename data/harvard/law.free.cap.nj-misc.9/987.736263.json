GEORGE NAGLE, AS EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF PAUL B. STETKA, DECEASED, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b1005-11\">Submitted May term, 1931</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHA\">Decided September 28, 1931.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1005-16\">Before Justices Campbell, Lloyd and Bodine.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>For the rule, <em>James A. Major </em>and <em>William George.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1006-4\">\n<em>Oonira, John H. Sheridan.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1006-5\">Pee Cueiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">This was a suit to recover from the estate of a deceased' attorney the loss to the plaintiff through his investment of her funds in second and subsequent mortgages instead of' first mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">There is nothing in the record to show either a verdict or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The rule to show cause allowed to defendant assumes a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and the plaintiff below calls-this to our attention but apparently makes no point of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">We are asked to set aside such assumed verdict\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">1. Because of error in the trial court refusing to nonsuit or direct a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">We think this is without substance. There were proofs warranting submission of this point to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">2. Because it was error to refuse to nonsuit and to direct\u2019 a verdict upon the ground that the plaintiff had ratified the-action of defendant\u2019s decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">For the reasons previously expressed we think there was-no error in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">3. The trial court erred in admitting the evidence of oneNappes respecting conversations with the defendant\u2019s decedent because Nappes was the attorney of record for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">This is without substance. There is nothing making the-testimony of such a witness incompetent. It may be subject to severe scrutiny, &amp;c., by the jury but is not incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">4. Error in striking out first and fourth counts of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">We think it simply went to the question that the plaintiff' had not presented her sworn account to the estate of the-defendant. This did not bar her from her action which was not for an ordinary debt but for damages for negligence, &amp;c.,. of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-18\">5. The verdict was against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-19\">This we do not find to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-20\">The rule should be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
