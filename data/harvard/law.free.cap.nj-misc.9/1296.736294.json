Prosecutor moved the deputy compensation commissioner to dismiss the petition because not filed within one year after the date on which the accident occurred, as required by section 5 of chapter 145, laws of 1918, as amended by chapter 229, laws of 1921. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1921, <em>p. </em>731. The petition shows that prosecutor failed to file notice of the accident as required-by section 6 of chapter 187, law\u2019s of 1924 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1924, <em>p. </em>401), and by stipulation attached to defendants\u2019 brief it appears that the motion was denied because it appeared that the employer and insurance carrier failed to file the notice required by the act of 1924 referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>A single question is presented, namely, the propriety of the refusal of the deputy compensation commissioner to dismiss the petition for compensation for the reason that it was not' filed within one year after the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">This question has been decided against the contention of the prosecutor in the case of <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas of Monmouth et al., </em>8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>600; affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, October 19th, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">The order of the compensation bureau will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
