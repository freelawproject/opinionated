L. </em>1903, <em>p. </em>478; 1916, <em>p. </em>429; <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat., p. </em>913.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">The record before us conclusively shows that there is no record of such a judgment or finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">It would be useless to establish by authority that such a record must in fact exist to support a judgment such as that before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Goncededly no such judgment or finding of record in the court exists and this compels a reversal of the judgment brought up for review. Such will be the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
