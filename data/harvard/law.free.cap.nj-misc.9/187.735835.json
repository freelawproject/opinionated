Sentence was served in the Essex county penitentiary. For three or four years after release no professional occupation is said to have been pursued. In 1927, or 1928, the practice \u2022of law was resumed. In at least two instances since, clients\u2019 money has been retained improperly. No reason exists for the continuance of a professional calling when neither trust \u25a0or confidence exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The report of the board of bar examiners is confirmed, and rule of disbarment will accordingly be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
