MCKAY III, CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Damon Patterson appeals his conviction and sentence. Based upon the record, evidence and applicable jurisprudence presented to this Court we affirm both his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 15, 2011, the State charged Damon Patterson (defendant) with being a felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (count 1); resisting an officer by force, in violation of La. R.S. 14:108.2 (count 2); possession of cocaine, in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(C)(2) (count 3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and possession of drug paraphernalia, a violation of La. R.S. 40:1023 (count 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant was arraigned on November 22, 2011, and entered not guilty pleas to all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a hearing on May 8, 2012, the defendant was found competent to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 23, 2012, the court sentenced the defendant to twelve years at hard labor on count 1 and to two years on count 2, sentences to run concurrently. Also, the trial judge found the defendant guilty of count 4 and sentenced him to serve five months in Orleans Parish Prison, sentence to run concurrently with his other sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 22, 2014, the State filed a multiple bill alleging that the defendant was a quadruple offender. On May 16, 2014, the court held a hearing on the multiple bill. The court found insufficient evidence to adjudicate the defendant a quadruple offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 7, 2015, after a previous ruling by the trial court, the State filed a new multiple offender bill again alleging the defendant was a quadruple offender. On June 29, 2015, following the trial of the multiple bill, the court adjudged the defendant a quadruple offender. The court vacated the defendant's twelve-year sentence for the crime of felon in possession of a firearm and re-sentenced him to thirty years at hard labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant's timely appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Joseph Pollard, the State's expert fingerprint examiner, identified State's Exhibit 1 as the defendant's fingerprints, which Officer Pollard took on August 13, 2012. Officer Pollard identified the Orleans Parish cert pack under case number 381-113 in which the defendant pled guilty on November 12, 1997, to simple\n   burglary of an inhabited dwelling. Officer Pollard compared the fingerprints on the back of the bill of information and found the fingerprints matched and that the fingerprints belonged to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lydrell Varise of the NOPD's Communication Center testified that all 911 calls received by the department are recorded and assigned an item recall number (in this case J-5064-11) for future investigative purposes. Ms. Varise identified State's Exhibit 4 as the audio recording of the call for assistance placed by Ms. Marichelle Cooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   NOPD Criminalist Jon Hoang, an expert in the identification of controlled dangerous substances, analyzed the loose powdery substance seized in this case. The plastic bag containing the substance was identified by Item No. J-5064-11. The substance proved to be cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Detective Jason Hickman responded to a call for service at 1218 Kabel Drive on October 4, 2001. Detective Hickman spoke to Ms. Cooper, the complainant/caller. She explained that the defendant was armed, using drugs and had barricaded himself in her residence. Ms. Cooper feared for the safety of her elderly father and children. Detective Hickman and Officer Theresa Morris entered the house accompanied by Ms. Cooper, who led them to the bedroom and unlocked the door for the officers to enter. Detective Hickman and Officer Morris, with their weapons drawn, opened the bedroom door. They observed the defendant standing about two feet from the door holding a black semi-automatic weapon, which he pointed directly at them. Detective Hickman ordered the defendant to put his weapon down. The defendant slowly placed his gun on the floor. Detective Hickman then ordered the defendant to exit the bedroom. As the defendant did so, Detective Hickman and Officer Morris holstered their weapons, whereupon the defendant became combative. He charged the officers and threw Officer Morris against the wall and Detective Hickman to the floor. The defendant refused to submit to the officers and continued to batter and wrestle with Detective Hickman and Officer Morris, who tased the defendant. The defendant remained out of control and ran to the front door. Backup officers arrived on the scene, and the struggle continued with the defendant attempting to enter his truck. An officer pepper-sprayed the defendant, but that did not stop him. Officer Morris tased the defendant a second time and still the defendant remained non-compliant. The fighting continued with other officers joining in the attempt to subdue the defendant. Detective Hickman struck the defendant in the leg with a baton, but the defendant continued to resist. Yet another contingency of officers arrived on the scene and finally secured and handcuffed the defendant. Detective Hickman reentered the house and retrieved the defendant's loaded gun from the bedroom. After giving a statement at the police station, Detective Hickman was transported to the hospital for treatment of injuries to his hands, knees and eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Morris testified and corroborated Detective Hickman's reporting of their responding to a disturbance call on October 4, 2011, and their ensuing encounter with the defendant. Like Detective Hickman, Officer Morris suffered bodily injury from being tossed about by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sergeant Bradley Wax arrived on the scene after Detective Hickman and Officer Morris. Ms. Cooper advised Sergeant Wax\n   that Detective Hickman and Officer Morris were inside the house trying to subdue the defendant. Sergeant Wax entered the residence as Detective Hickman and Office Morris were trying to calm the defendant in the hallway outside the bedroom. The defendant was talking wildly as he struggled with the officers as they attempted to handcuff him. Sergeant Wax approached the defendant and attempted to pacify him and talk about the disturbance. The defendant broke away from Detective Hickman and Officer Morris and headed toward the front door. Upon realizing the dangerous position the defendant placed the officer in, Sergeant Wax called for backup. He then re-engaged the defendant and was pulled down on the floor where he and Detective Hickman once again wrestled with the defendant. Officer Morris tased the defendant, but it had no effect on him. One of the officers pepper-sprayed the defendant. Detective Hickman struck the defendant in leg with his baton, and Officer Morris tased a second time. The defendant continued to struggle and yell wildly. Backup finally arrived and detained the defendant. Sergeant Wax also sustained bodily injury while subduing the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Humbles responded to Sergeant Wax's call for backup at 1218 Kabal Drive. Detective Humbles and Detective Corey Foy observed the defendant in a kneeling position attempting to get up. Detective Hickman was on the ground and battered. Officer Morris was holding a taser in her hand, and Sergeant Wax had his radio in his hand requesting backup. As Detective Humbles exited his vehicle, the defendant got to his feet but was knocked down by officers. The defendant was ultimately restrained but only after several more officers and EMS personnel assisted. Sergeant Wax, Detective Hickman and Officer Morris were bloodied as a result of their confrontation with the defendant. Detective Humbles had Ms. Cooper sign a consent to search form and accompanied her into the house. Ms. Cooper led Detective Humbles to the bedroom and related that the defendant had been smoking drugs earlier in the day and refused to leave her house. Detective Humbles' search of the room yielded a plastic bag containing a white substance, which proved to be cocaine. Ms. Cooper showed Detective Humbles an aluminum can the defendant had been smoking out of that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant called Lieutenant Bradley Tollefson, who testified he authored the police report in lieu of Sergeant Wax, who was injured in the scuffle with the defendant. Lieutenant Tollefson interviewed Ms. Cooper on the day of the incident at the police station. He identified the recording of the interview. The prosecution played the tape for the jury. In her statement, Ms. Cooper recounts smelling smoke in her house the morning of the incident and going to her bedroom where she encountered the defendant who was smoking cocaine. She told him to leave and then she left the house to bring her daughter to school. When Ms. Cooper returned, the defendant was still in her house smoking cocaine. She opened the bedroom door and saw that the defendant had a gun in his hand. She closed the door and led her father and child out of the house. She called the police, reported the defendant's activities and alerted police that the defendant was armed. When the officers confronted the defendant at Ms. Cooper's residence, he resisted them to the utmost-battering and knocking the officers down. Because she feared for the officers' safety, Ms. Cooper videotaped the defendant fighting with the officers. Eventually, additional officers and EMS personnel arrived and were able to subdue the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Lafondra Patterson, the defendant's sister, testified on his behalf. She related\n   having received a phone call from Ms. Cooper asking her to come to the residence to check on the defendant. When Ms. Patterson arrived on the scene, the defendant was strapped to a stretcher. She was told he was alright but that he was high on drugs, which surprised her because she was not aware the defendant ever used drugs. She also learned the defendant had been tased during his encounter with the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant testified that Ms. Cooper awoke him early on the morning of the incident and said the police were coming to the house. The defendant got out of bed, dressed and tried to make his way to the front door. He was met by officers, who kept pushing him back in the house. He denied fighting with the officers and said he just wanted to leave the residence. He claimed that on the video made by Ms. Cooper, he can be seen crawling on the ground because he broke his leg when he encountered the police. He told the jury the police had tased him numerous times and tried to smother him while he was on the medical stretcher. The defendant claimed that the police caused such damage to his internal organs he thought he was dying. He said the police forced Ms. Cooper to make the 911 call; supplied her with the cell phone to make the video of his encounter with the police; and coerced her into making the statement about his smoking cocaine and possessing a gun. He denied owning a gun and being involved with drugs. In fact, when he encountered the police on October 4, one of the officers went into the bedroom and crushed some pecan candy and then claimed it was cocaine. He claimed this incident, which resulted in several charges against him, was in retaliation for his filing a disciplinary complaint against Sergeant Wax stemming from an earlier dispute over a car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A review for errors patent on the face of the record reveals two as to the defendant's sentence. When resentencing defendant as a fourth-felony habitual offender, the district court sentenced the defendant to an illegally lenient sentence by omitting the restriction that the sentence be served without probation in addition to the restrictions that it be served without benefit of parole or suspension of sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:529.1 G (providing that \"[a]ny sentence imposed under the provision of this Section shall be at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 15:529.1 ). The sentencing restrictions for the defendant's present felony-felon in possession of a firearm ( La. R.S. 14:95.1 )-are that the sentence be served at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The district court thus erred in failing to stipulate that the sentence be served without the benefit of probation. Pursuant to La. R.S. 15:301.1 A and\n   <em>\n    State v.

Neither did he file motions to reconsider sentence within thirty day of his initial sentencing or his re-sentencing. The defendant's habitual offender adjudication and sentence became final for purposes of La.

Consequently, the State contends the prosecutor's question about the defendant's 1992 conviction for distribution of cocaine was permissible as impeachment under La.

However, as a limited exception to the general rule, Article 404(A)(1) allows admission of evidence of a pertinent trait of a defendant's character-such as a moral quality-offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the character evidence. Under La. C.E. art. 405(A), a character witness may be cross-examined regarding relevant specific instances of conduct.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mosley\n   </em>\n   , 2008-1318, p.18 (La.

His mother was called by the defense as a character witness at trial. Defense counsel questioned the mother as to whether she had ever known her son to be violent or to carry a gun. She responded that the defendant was not violent, and that she had not seen a gun. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked her about the defendant's prior arrests for armed robbery, possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana, and his conviction for theft of goods valued at under $100.00.\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   , 2001-1817 at 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11386916\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/828/1165/\">\n    828 So.2d at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argued the trial court erred in overruling his objections to the State's questions regarding his prior criminal history. Citing La.

Officer Joseph Pollard, the State's expert fingerprint examiner, proved the defendant had a prior conviction for simple burglary thus establishing that the defendant was a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Detective Hickman, Officer Morris, and Ms. Marichelle Cooper all testified the defendant was armed when they encountered him and that he pointed his weapon directly at the officers when they attempted to remove him from the residence. Additionally, the 911 call made by Ms. Cooper demonstrated that the defendant was in her house, armed and using drugs, and her statement, which was played at trial, proved the defendant's violent and erratic behavior when the police arrived. Other officers detailed their struggles with the defendant as he wrestled them to the ground and overpowered them while fighting to flee the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Even though the prosecutor attempted to elicit testimony from Ms. Patterson concerning the defendant's prior conviction, Ms. Patterson did not answer affirmatively. Finally, even assuming the testimony of the conviction may have had an adverse effect on the jury, its impact would have almost certainly affected only the defendant's charge of possession of cocaine, and the jury was hung on that charge. There is nothing to suggest the State's questioning concerning the defendant's prior drug conviction contributed to the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Next, the defendant references portions of the record as illustrative of other instances of prosecutorial misconduct, including instances in which the district attorney called the defendant a \"liar\" during both cross-examination and closing argument.

Following a mental competency hearing on May 8, 2012, the defendant was declared competent to proceed. On June 22, 2012, the trial judge addressed the defendant concerning his decision to represent himself by taking a realistic account of the defendant's capacity to represent himself, exploring the defendant's education (schooled paralegal) and understanding of legal terms and procedures and granted the defendant's motion, albeit appointing attorney Jason Ullman as defendant's co-counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The present record contains no convincing evidence that the defendant lacked the capacity to proceed at the time of sentencing.

He was actively engaged in all aspects of the trial, denied guilt, impeached witnesses and evidence and presented a defense. The defendant required co-counsel's assistance on only a few occasions. Moreover, the trial judge was indulgent and took into consideration the defendant's inexperience when considering evidentiary and procedural matters and afforded the defendant some leniency. Although the minute entry of July 24, 2014, indicates the defendant was in the custody of the East Louisiana Mental Health Facility on that day, there is no explanation for his presence or treatment at the facility. Nor is there any other mention in the docket master of the defendant's competency after that date.

Minute entries in the record reflect that on February 2, 2007, with the defendant present, the court ordered a lunacy hearing for February 15, 2007. While competency determinations were made prior to trial, there is no indication in the minute entries which followed, or the transcript of the April 2, 2007 proceeding, that a post-trial competency hearing ever took place or that a separate competency determination was ever made in connection with the multiple billing of the defendant. Also, there are no reports from physicians in the record which indicate the results of any post-sentencing examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   The minute entry of March 16, 2007 states that \"clerk will inform the clerk's office which event is scheduled for 3-29-07\" with a notation below it that both a lunacy hearing and a multiple bill hearing were set for March 29, 2007. The March 29, 2007 minute entry stated that both the defendant and his counsel appeared that date \"for multiple bill hearing\" which was then continued on the defense motion. That March 29, 2007 minute entry makes no reference to the lunacy hearing referred to in previous minute entries. At the next setting, April 2, 2007, the multiple offender proceeding occurred, but no further reference is made to anything related to the defendant's mental capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   La.

When the question is raised, there shall be no further steps in the criminal prosecution, except the institution of prosecution, until the court has determined that he has the mental capacity to proceed. Here, the record does not indicate the court's determination regarding the defendant's capacity to proceed prior to the multiple bill, although there was a competency hearing prior to trial and the court determined he was competent. Subsequently, the defendant was found competent to represent himself at trial. Furthermore, a review of the April 2, 2007 transcript shows that no mention was made of the defendant's competency, and there was no objection by defense counsel as to any failure to find him competent to proceed with the multiple offender proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gauthier\n   </em>\n   , unlike this case, the trial court raised the issue of competency to proceed and set a hearing, although no hearing took place, and the trial court in this case only requested a medical evaluation and treatment, if necessary, but the matter was never set for a competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In short, the record does not suggest a reason to doubt the defendant's competency at the time of re-sentencing.

Those circumstances shall include but are not limited to the educational background of the petitioner, the petitioner's access to formally trained inmate counsel, the financial resources of the petitioner, the age of the petitioner, the mental abilities of the petitioner, or whether the interests of justice will be served by the consideration of new evidence. New facts discovered pursuant to this exception shall be submitted to the court within two years of discovery.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n    (2) The claim asserted in the petition is based upon a final ruling of an appellate court establishing a theretofore unknown interpretation of constitutional law and petitioner establishes that this interpretation is retroactively applicable to his case, and the petition is filed within one year of the finality of such ruling.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    (3) The application would already be barred by the provisions of this Article, but the application is filed on or before October 1, 2001, and the date on which the application was filed is within three years after the judgment of conviction and sentence has become final.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n    (4) The person asserting the claim has been sentenced to death.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Ms. Harowski was not addressed personally about whether she could find the defendant not guilty if the State failed its burden of proof, etc., however, when the prosecutor asked the group of potential jurors of which Ms. Harowski was member whether she could fulfill her duty as a juror, she did not indicate otherwise.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
