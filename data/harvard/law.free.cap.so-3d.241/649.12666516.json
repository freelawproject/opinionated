The motion for rehearing is denied. The previous opinion of this Court is withdrawn, and this opinion is substituted in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Clyde Chatman was convicted of the murder of Patrick Williams and sentenced to life imprisonment with eligibility for parole. After his post-trial motions were denied, he appealed, arguing the sufficiency and weight of the evidence do not support the verdict, and testimony regarding an accomplice's statement to law enforcement violated his right to confront witnesses under the Confrontation Clause. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. On the evening of March 27, 2012, Williams was visiting his girlfriend, Tanedra Christian, in Jonestown, Mississippi. While the two were talking and kissing on her front porch, a white car drove by her house, turned around, and came back up the road. Williams abruptly left and walked up the road toward his house, ignoring Christian's calling out after him. A few minutes later, Christian heard gunshots. Larry Wiley, a neighbor, and Toshema Crosby, the owner of a nearby gas station, also heard shooting, and Crosby found Williams lying on the ground outside her store with gunshot wounds. When she asked Williams who shot him, he replied: \"Those mother f***ers from Friars Point.\" Crosby called 911 and contacted Williams's aunt, Shamon Williams. When Shamon arrived, Williams told her that \"Little Clyde and them\" had shot him and that they were driving a \"white car.\" The first officer on the scene was Deputy Stephen James, who heard Williams say, \"I'm gonna get those mother f***ers. They shot me.\" Williams died at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Law enforcement recovered .25-caliber shell casings in the road nearby; forensic testing indicated the casings were all fired from the same gun. By the following day, law enforcement had arrested Friars Point residents Chatman, John Battle, and Reginald Cox for Williams's murder. The three suspects were tested for gunshot residue (GSR) and submitted buccal\n   swabs. Law enforcement also tested a white Crown Victoria titled to Chatman's mother for GSR and fingerprints, as well as a glove found in the back seat. A search was conducted for the weapon in Friars Point, Mississippi, but it was never located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. On May 30, 2013, Chatman, Battle, and Cox were co-indicted for deliberate-design murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-19\">\n    Miss.

Christian, Williams's girlfriend, testified that before Williams left her home, he said \"something about he was tired of something.\" She also testified that Chatman had expressed a romantic interest in her, bringing her a toy bear and flowers on Valentine's Day. Shameka Cox, Cox's mother, also lived in Jonestown and said Cox and Chatman had visited her that evening. She noted it was odd since Cox never came to visit her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Deputy Fernando Bee of the Coahoma County Sheriff's Department testified he had seen Chatman driving a white Crown Victoria in Jonestown the night Williams was shot. He noted two persons in the car with Chatman. Deputy Bee, who was off duty, was talking with another individual in the yard of a Jonestown home when he heard shooting. After he learned Williams had been shot, he went home to get ready for work and then returned to the scene. Chatman's sister later phoned Deputy Bee to inform him that Chatman wanted to turn himself in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. A forensic pathologist, Dr. Mark LeVaughn, testified that Williams sustained three gunshot wounds : two to the right side of his back, and one to the right forearm. He determined the shots were not fired at close range. DNA results for the rear passenger-door grip of the Crown Victoria and the glove found in the car \"contained a profile consistent\" with Chatman. Forensic testing also revealed \"particles indicative of gunshot residue\" on Chatman's palms. There were also GSR particles found on Battle's and Cox's hands and located \"behind [the] driver seat and headrest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. Chatman testified that he was in Jonestown, driving the white Crown Victoria with the windows down. His version of events was that Williams ran up to his car and \"attacked\" him. Then Chatman heard gunshots and saw Battle shooting a gun. In shock, he drove home to Friars Point. He denied having a gun and shooting Williams. He admitted that he liked Christian, claiming the two had relations in the past. He had planned to drive by and see Christian that night in Jonestown, but Chatman insisted he and Cox went to Shameka's home instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. Chatman was convicted of murder by a Coahoma County Circuit Court jury. Since he was a juvenile, the trial judge carefully weighed the factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), at a bifurcated sentencing hearing, and sentenced Chatman to life in prison with eligibility for parole. Chatman filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, for a new trial, which the trial court denied. He now argues on appeal Deputy Bee's testimony that Battle told law enforcement where to\n   find the weapon violated the Confrontation Clause. He also challenges the sufficiency and weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the testimony concerning Battle's statements to police violated Chatman's right to confront witnesses.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11. Chatman claims that his right to confront witnesses was violated during the State's questioning of Deputy Bee about the search for the weapon, specifically when Deputy Bee testified that Battle told law enforcement where to look for the gun.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q.

Williams told Crosby that the persons who shot him were from Friars Point, and he identified to his aunt that \"Little Clyde and them\" shot him. The prosecution also established that Chatman had a motive to kill Williams-he was angry Williams was dating Christian. Chatman admitted that he was in a white car that evening, driving around Jonestown, and that he liked Christian, Williams's girlfriend. Christian saw a white car drive by while she was with Williams on her front porch, and she heard the gunshots a few minutes later, after Williams had walked up the road. She also said Chatman had attempted to call her on her cellphone that day, but she did not talk to him. \"Deliberate design to kill a person may be formed very quickly, and perhaps only moments before the act of consummating the intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Ct. App. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8353665\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/965/1023/#p1030\">\n    965 So.2d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030 (\u00b6 28) (Miss. 2007) ). The white Crown Victoria, owned by Chatman's mother, contained GSR, and particles indicative of GSR were found on Chatman's palms. The glove found in the back seat also had Chatman's DNA. The prosecution noted during closing argument that had Chatman been driving the car as he claimed, any GSR would have likely settled on the back of his hands, not his palms. Regarding Chatman's assertion that Williams came up to the car and \"attacked\" him, this testimony is contradictory to the forensic testimony that Williams was shot in the back and on his right side. As the trial judge commented during sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [W]hat the defendant testified to was inconsistent with the fact that we knew the deceased was shot in the back. I don't see how [Williams] could be standing and swinging at the driver of a car ... and all of a sudden have a hail of gunfire and get shot in the back. You're going to be facing him if you're swinging at him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 20. Chatman also contends the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. In reviewing the weight of the evidence, \"we will only disturb a verdict when it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9028388\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/895/836/#p843\">\n    895 So.2d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 18) (citing\n   <em>\n    Herring v.

Based on the evidence summarized above, we find that allowing Chatman's conviction to stand would not sanction an unconscionable injustice, as there was overwhelming evidence that Chatman murdered Williams.
