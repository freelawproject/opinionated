Saunders, Marc T. Amy, and D. Kent Savoie, Judges.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   SAUNDERS, Judge\n   Defendant, Derrick Walker Stafford, was indicted on December 10, 2015, for second degree murder, a violation of La.R.S. 14:30.1, and attempted second degree murder, violations of La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1. On January 5, 2016, Defendant filed a \"Motion for Bill of Particulars.\" On February 3, 2016, the State filed a \"State's Memorandum in Opposition to the Defense Motion for Bill of Particulars.\" On September 13, 2016, the State filed a \"Notice of State's Intention to Introduce Other Crimes Evidence Under La.Code of Evidence Article 404(B) and Supporting Memorandum of Law.\" Defendant responded to the State's \"Notice\" on September 28, 2016, and filed a \"Memorandum in Opposition.\" Defendant also filed a \"Motion to Quash\" and \"Memorandum in Support\" on September 21, 2016. A hearing was held on September 28, 2016, to address the above motions and responses. The trial court denied the motion to quash and granted the State's motion to introduce other crimes evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A jury trial selection commenced on March 13, 2017. On March 24, 2017, Defendant was found guilty of manslaughter, a violation of La.R.S. 14:31, and attempted manslaughter, violations of La. R.S. 14:27 and 14:31. On March 30, 2017, Defendant filed a \"Motion for New Trial and Memorandum in Support.\" The motion was heard on the date of sentencing, following which the motion was denied. Defendant waived all delay requirements, and the trial court proceeded to sentence him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment at hard labor for the attempted manslaughter conviction and forty years imprisonment at hard labor for the manslaughter conviction, with the first twenty years without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The two sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. Defendant filed a \"Motion to Reconsider Sentence\" on April 20, 2017. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant has perfected a timely appeal, wherein he raises five assignments of error, as follows: 1) The trial court erred in denying Mr. Stafford's motion for a bill of particulars; 2) The trial court erred in denying Mr. Stafford's motion to quash the bill of indictment in this case; 3) The trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts that were more prejudicial than probative; 4) It was error for the trial court to deny the motion for mistrial based on the introduction of a rape allegation against Mr. Stafford; and 5) Mr. Stafford's sentences of forty years and fifteen years are unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Christopher Few's (\"Mr. Few\") car was stopped following a traffic pursuit, Defendant and Officer Norris Greenhouse (\"Officer Greenhouse\") fired at a ninety-degree angle into the driver's side of the vehicle while the victim sat in his car. Officer Greenhouse shot four times, and Defendant shot fourteen times. Mr. Few was wounded. His six-year-old son, Jeremy Martis (\"Jeremy\"), who was sitting in the front seat of the car, was killed. Both officers were charged under separate lower\n   court docket numbers with attempted second degree murder and second degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Testimony given at trial established that on November 3, 2015, Mr. Few picked up his six-year-old son, Jeremy, from school. He and his girlfriend, Megan Dixon (\"Ms. Dixon\"), dropped the boy off at the house of Ms. Dixon's aunt, Erica Slocum (\"Ms. Slocum\"), and went out to a bar in Marksville. Shortly thereafter, they got into an argument, and Ms. Dixon left the bar with some girlfriends. Mr. Few left at the same time. He picked up his son from Ms. Slocum's house. He then spied Ms. Dixon driving her friend's van. When the van was stopped at a stop light, he approached the van on foot and attempted to get Ms. Dixon to get out and go home with him. The light changed, and Ms. Dixon drove on. As she drove away, she heard sirens. Mr. Few followed her briefly in his vehicle then passed her up with a police car in pursuit. She indicated that Mr. Few gestured towards Jeremy as he passed the van. She assumed he wanted her to take Jeremy home. Mr. Few pulled his vehicle over once, but she drove past him. Once again, while being pursued by a police car, Mr. Few passed her while pointing at Jeremy. However, she turned off to go to the casino with her friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jason Brouillette (\"Officer Brouillette\") and Defendant were both officers with the Marksville City Police Department. However, on the evening of November 3, 2015, they were moonlighting for the Ward 2 City Marshal's Office. The officers received a transmission from Officer Greenhouse that he was in pursuit of a Kia SUV. The officers were close to the area and soon spotted Mr. Few's vehicle. Officer Brouillette turned his unit across the roadway in an attempt to block Mr. Few, but Mr. Few drove off the roadway and around the police unit. Officer Brouillette joined the chase behind Officer Greenhouse. Officer Brouillette testified that the chase was conducted at speeds approximately forty to fifty miles per hour. Officer Greenhouse attempted to pass Mr. Few to cut him off, but Mr. Few weaved his vehicle in a manner to block Officer Greenhouse from passing him. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Few entered a street that dead-ended, and he stopped with Officer Greenhouse's unit stopped right behind him. Officer Brouillette did not actually see Mr. Few's vehicle back into Officer Greenhouse's unit or the officer fall to the ground. He saw Mr. Few pull the Kia forward. He stood next to Officer Greenhouse and Defendant as they fired at Mr. Few's vehicle. While his gun was pulled, he did not believe he was threatened, and he did not fire his gun. He did not see Mr. Few with a weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant, who was thirty-three years old at the time of trial, testified that at the time of the shooting, he was acting in self-defense and defense of another. Defendant explained that after Mr. Few was stopped on the dead-end road, as he exited the police vehicle, he saw Mr. Few back into Officer Greenhouse's vehicle. Officer Greenhouse was able to get out of the way, however. Mr. Few then pulled his vehicle forward. At this point, Defendant had pulled his weapon and gave a loud verbal command for Mr. Few to exit the Kia and to show his hands. Defendant explained that he believed Mr. Few was either going to run into the woods or he was going to \"ambush\" them. Defendant insisted he never saw Mr. Few put his hands up. However, when Mr. Few looked back at the officers and backed towards them, Defendant \"felt [he] had no choice but to save Norris[.]\" He believed Mr. Few was using the vehicle as a dangerous weapon. While Defendant stated he was not aware at the time of how many times he fired his gun, he agreed the evidence established he fired fourteen times and acknowledged\n   that three of the bullets that struck Jeremy were from his gun. He stated that he did not intend to kill when he fired his weapon, only to stop the threat. Defendant stated he did not know Jeremy was in the front seat of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kenneth Parnell (\"Lieutenant Parnell\"), a lieutenant with the Marksville City Police Department, also joined the chase at speeds between twenty-five and thirty miles per hour. He arrived last at the dead-end street and parked his unit in such a way that Mr. Few had an \"area where he could have got out.\" Lieutenant Parnell got out of his unit and stood between his unit and Officer Greenhouse's unit. While he never saw Mr. Few back the Kia SUV into Officer Greenhouse's unit or saw Officer Greenhouse fall to the ground, as the lieutenant exited his vehicle, he saw the Kia back up. This was when the shooting started. The lieutenant never fired his gun, and he never saw Mr. Few with a gun. He testified he was not in fear for his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury also heard testimony for two crash scene constructionists. It was established that Officer Greenhouse's unit had been struck in the front end and Mr. Few's Kia's rear end exhibited damage consistent with backing into the police vehicle. The jury also heard testimony from two Louisiana State Police Criminalistics Laboratory ballistic analysts and firearm analysts who testified regarding the shots fired into Mr. Few's vehicle. Finally, the jury heard the testimony of an expert in the use of force. The expert explained in detail why physiologically it takes seconds after a suspect gives up for an officer under stress situations to stop firing his weapon. He testified that in a situation like what Defendant was experiencing, it was easy to make a wrong call because the mind does not receive all the information instantaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NUMBERS 1 AND 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We will address assignments of error number one and two together, as the alleged errors are interrelated. Defendant's first argument is that the trial court erred when it did not order the State to respond to his motion for bill of particulars after he was arraigned with a short form indictment because the State offered open file discovery. Defendant's second argument is that because the State failed to respond to his motion, the indictment was rendered defective. We find no merit to these contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A hearing was held on September 28, 2016, wherein the following motions were heard: \"Defendant Greenhouse's Motion for Bill of Particulars[,] Defendant Stafford's Motion to Quash and Motion to Consolidate[,] and State of Louisiana Prieur 404 Motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officer Greenhouse's counsel began the hearing with the argument that the State should have responded to his motion for a bill of particulars. He argued the State's strategy was to convict Officer Greenhouse of second degree murder of Mr. Few's son, Jeremy, using the \"transferred intent\" theory. Officer Greenhouse's defense counsel argued that because the State used a short form indictment, which stated only that on November 3, 2015, Officer Greenhouse committed the offense of second degree murder of Jeremy, a violation of La.R.S. 14:30.1, there was insufficient information provided to Officer Greenhouse to prepare an adequate defense. Officer Greenhouse argued that he did not learn how the State intended to prove his guilt of second degree murder until the State submitted a proposed jury instruction to the trial court which defined the killing of someone by \"transferred intent.\" Officer Greenhouse requested that the trial court order the State to respond to its motion for a bill of\n   particulars to verify that the element of transferred intent was going to be the basis of its argument to the jury. Noting that the State gave Officer Greenhouse open file discovery and that the information sought regarding the question of the State's theory of prosecution was satisfied during the hearing, the trial court denied Officer Greenhouse's motion. We note that Defendant never sought to join or adopt Officer Greenhouse's motion requesting that the trial court order the State to respond to its bill of particulars. Nor did Defendant object in any way to the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While Officer Greenhouse's motion was addressed, Officer Greenhouse and Defendant were not co-defendants, and Defendant did not adopt Officer Greenhouse's motion or object to the trial court's denial of the motion. As noted above, Officer Greenhouse's motion involved the theory of \"transferred intent\" concerning the shooting death of the six-year-old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Next, Defendant argued that his and Officer Greenhouse's cases should be consolidated for the convenience of the defendants, the witnesses, and the trial court. Officer Greenhouse, however, objected, and the trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although Defendant's motion for bill of particulars requested that the trial court order the State to comply with the motion, Defendant's motion was not addressed at the September 28, 2016 hearing; therefore, the trial court made no ruling regarding Defendant's motion. Accordingly, we find that Defendant's assignment of error number one lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court then took up Defendant's motion to quash the indictment, which alleged that the State should have included the phrase \"specific intent\" in the indictment because it was an essential element of the crime of attempted second degree murder. Defendant argues that had the State responded to his motion for bill of particulars, his constitutional right to specific notice of the nature and circumstances of the charge against him would not have been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In pertinent part, second degree murder is defined as \"the killing of a human being: (1) when the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm[.]\" La.R.S. 14:30.1. The attempt statute, La.R.S. 14:27, in pertinent part, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Any person who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended; and it shall be immaterial whether, under the circumstances, he would have actually accomplished his purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the September 28, 2016, hearing, Defendant argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The case law is pretty clear, you have to prove the specific intent to kill with attempted second degree murder. And the case law also is further clear and the law is that the indictment must state specific intent to kill must be in the indictment .... They failed to even put that in there. And so I'm supposed to just believe based on the indictment alone because like I said they didn't do a bill of particulars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   An indictment shall be a \"plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute which the defendant is alleged to have violated.\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 464.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the hearing, Defendant argued the indictment was defective and should be quashed. He argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Now we read their documents Your Honor, and all it says is that Mr. Stafford committed the offense of attempted\n   second degree murder by committing the offense of attempted second degree murder. There's nothing alleged in there so if you're looking on the indictment itself, the face of it, just telling me that he did this is not enough. It's simply not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The law is pretty clear, essentially it requires whether any conceivable set of facts, as alleged in the bill of information together with those specified in the bill of particulars when particulars have been provided if found credible by the trier of fact can support a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"You're looking at ... you look at this indictment essential element of attempted second degree murder is specific intent to kill. \"They failed to even put that in there. And so I'm supposed to just believe based on the indictment alone because like I said they didn't do a bill of particulars. I can't ask the court to look at the entire file, then we'd be getting into the merits of the case. That's not what a Motion to Quash is for.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   And the law is clear even if it's just a technical requirement. It has to say specific intent, those words have to be in the indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following argument, the trial court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   And in addition as stated in the prior motions, the law is quite clear from the Louisiana Supreme Court that the normal statutory requirements that the-each essential element of a crime be listed in an indictment is not required in a short from indictment; especially considering when open file discovery is granted. Motion to Quash is therefore denied; objection to the ruling of the court is noted and error is assigned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court, however, did not agree with Defendant's interpretation of the case. As reported in the lower appellate court's case,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant was convicted of attempted second degree murder. Years later, after several post-conviction applications, the defendant obtained a reinstatement of his previously filed notice of appeal. The appellate court ruled that the state failed to show specific intent to kill the victim and reduced the conviction to aggravated battery.

Steven McIntosh, who lived in Marksville, testified that while attending a Fourth of July celebration in 2013, he and a friend were watching some men having an argument when the police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Mr. McIntosh stated that as he turned to leave, he dropped his keys. As he bent over to pick up his keys, he was \"slammed\" to the ground. Mr. McIntosh stated he attempted to explain he was retrieving his keys but as he lay handcuffed on his stomach on the ground, Defendant pepper-sprayed him in the eyes. Mr. McIntosh stated he was found guilty of disturbing the peace and fined. He agreed that Defendant did not threaten him with a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Sammy Carmouche, who also lived in Marksville, stated that in June 2011, he had just arrived home from work when there was a knock on the door. An officer was at the door and advised him that a neighbor had accused him of shooting the neighbor's dog. Mr. Carmouch said he denied it, but the officer pulled him out of the doorway and handcuffed him. He testified that as the officer pushed him down the porch steps, he accidently bumped into another officer. At this time, Defendant ran up to him and tasered him on the chest. Mr. Carmouch stated he was not fighting the officers or threatening. He stated his wife and children were standing on the porch watching it all happen. He said he had never been arrested before this time. He was convicted of resisting arrest and was given jail time and a year of probation. He agreed Defendant did not pull out his firearm. Theresa Carmouche, Mr. Carmouche's wife, corroborated his testimony. She stated that Defendant tasered Mr. Carmouche twice, once while he lay helpless on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Aleathia Barbin, who was a nurse, testified that one afternoon a repo-man showed up at her door. She objected to him repossessing her car because he did not have a court order to do so. She stated that the repo-man called the police. When the police arrived, she was arrested for disturbing the peace, handcuffed behind her back, and tossed into the back seat of a police car. She stated that while she sat in the police unit with her hands cuffed behind her back, Defendant reached in and tasered her in the stomach. She stated that she was not threatening or being aggressive. She said that Defendant did not pull out his gun. Ms. Barbin testified she was convicted of disturbing the peace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Following testimony, the State argued the evidence was relevant and probative because it established a motive and intent to inflict harm on persons arrested-that Defendant's actions in these cases demonstrated a pattern of excessive force in response\n   to an arrest situation after the arrestee ceased to be a threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant argued the current circumstances were significantly different from the prior confrontations; primarily that in the prior cases, he never pulled out his weapon. He argued that in the current case, he was reacting to a direct threat when the suspect backed his vehicle into Officer Greenhouse, in an attempt to harm the officer, and he was acting in defense of another and himself. Alternatively, Defendant argued that should the trial court find that the alleged prior acts were appropriate to be admitted at trial, the evidence was unduly prejudicial to Defendant. He argued the State was simply attempting to picture him as a bad man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The trial court granted the State's motion to introduce the above testimony at trial and stated for the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Well 404B specifically says that evidence of other crime or wrongs or acts. Doesn't have to be just a crime, are ordinarily not admissible. To be admissible it must show proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, planning knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   And I've got to tell counsel that upon reading first of the notice of intent, I read the notice of intent and I said man this is easy, this is all admissible. Then I read the memorandum in opposition and studied that and I said this isn't so easy. There's some legitimate issues here. That's why I said after hearing the evidence today and viewing the video evidence and the evidence presented in support of the notice, it became easy once again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   First of all, the defense said that the prior acts and the law says must be similar. In the case here Mr. Stafford is accused of shooting when coming to the aid of another officer. Same thing happened in the other cases that were presented here today. Other officers were there and were on the scene and he's coming presumably to their aid. And the incident happens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The defense says in their memorandum the defendant was not arrested, tried, convicted or found civilly liable, the court must take judicial notice the civil litigation on some of the matters that were testified to by the State's witnesses today are still pending and are not over with. The fact that someone was not arrested, tried or convicted does not mean that it was not a bad act that is admissible under 404B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The defense also says that they are not similar acts and that he never pulled his weapon or fired at any of the alleged victims in those incidents. However, the evidence was beyond clear and convincing that he used a taser on these individuals who testified today and a taser certainly does meet the definition of a weapon. The defense also said in their memorandum that Mr. Few was using his vehicle as a deadly weapon that night and that the defendant acted within the course and scope of his employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The video I saw at the time that the shooting began that weapon-that car was not being used as a deadly weapon at that time. If it was being used before hand and the evidence presents that, so be it. But at the time on the video that was played here today, that shooting occurred and from whether the distance where these police officers were, I dare say it was not even close to being a deadly weapon used at that time nor the evidence would indicate from review of that video that these officers were in an imminent danger at that time, as has been confirmed through the statements given from some of the officers Parnell and/or Brouillette to Officer Owens who testified today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The defense seems to indicate or say that the facts of this case are so different; sure we're dealing with a charge of attempted murder and murder versus in these other case Mr. Stafford was not charged with a crime, I don't mean a crime didn't happen, that doesn't mean he couldn't be civilly liable. But these incidents to me after hearing these witnesses today are so similar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   He's coming to the aid of another officer and force is used. Now that doesn't mean that this evidence is so credible a jury has to accept it. The State will put on their evidence, and the defense has a right to defend that evidence. But it's certainly under the code due to the similar natures and under 404B it is the probative value greatly outweighs any prejudicial effect. Prejudice would come to Mr. Stafford if there were other acts as either a police officer where somebody attacked him, was coming at him and he shot his Taser at them or shot a gun at him or he's doing something on his private time as counsel said. But these are acts when he's going to the aid of other police officers, as he was doing presumably in this case. And in so doing the person who had allegedly broke the law, force was used upon that person. That's not ... this is not my statement that Mr. Stafford did wrong, this is just a statement that what Mr. Stafford did in this case and what was testified to in the other cases is very factually similar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is the state's burden to prove that a defendant committed the other crimes, wrongs, or acts by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Officer Mayeux ordered him to leave the area, but Mr. McIntosh refused, stating he had dropped his car keys. Officer Mayeux described mayhem occurring at the time. He asked Mr. McIntosh to leave and afterwards he would help look for the car keys, but again Mr. McIntosh\n   refused.

Finally, Defendant applied the pepper spray. Officer Laken Rico was one of the officers at the fight following the Fourth of July fireworks.

Thus, the other crimes evidence cannot be said to have attributed to the verdict in this case, as, according to the State, the evidence was submitted pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 404(B) to show specific intent to commit harm.

Chief Walker testified he was the Chief of Police of Marksville City Police in 2010 until 2013. He stated he had known Defendant since 2007. He stated that he conducted yearly evaluations of his officers and that Defendant's evaluations were average. He promoted Defendant from sergeant to lieutenant. Defense counsel asked him if there were ever any complaints filed against Defendant. Chief Walker replied that only those persons Defendant arrested made complaints, but he never found any of the complaints credible. The State objected, arguing that defense was going beyond what was permitted concerning the reputation Defendant enjoyed in the community. Following a bench conference in chambers, defense counsel continued questioning Chief Walker. Defense counsel asked the Chief whether he thought Defendant was a good person, and he answered affirmatively. Chief Walker stated Defendant always obeyed his orders and never abused his authority as a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   During cross-examination of Chief Walker, the State asked if he had ever suspended Defendant from his duties. Chief Walker answered yes. Defendant objected for the reason that the evidence the State was attempting to elicit was irrelevant, unduly prejudicial, and therefore inadmissible. Again, out of the hearing of the jury, the State argued that defense counsel opened the door to the questioning of Chief Walker regarding Defendant's training, awards, and specific events, rather than discussing general character evidence. The trial court overruled defense counsel's objection, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   We must remember that the State objected to Chief Walker testifying at all as a characteristic [sic] witness because it didn't go to simply the moral reputation of Officer Stafford and at the request of the Defense I allowed this character evidence to be submitted because the fact that Officer Stafford is accused of committing an offense while a police officer, so therefore [t]he moral quality of a police officer is at issue. Normally, character witnesses simply identify\n   themselves and state how long they've known the defendant or the accused and how and whether they are familiar with the reputation or character of the accused within the community or in this case in the Marksville Police Department. Once it is established that a witness has heard and has knowledge of the accused['s] reputation the law says that the State may seek to under mind [sic] the validity of this testimony by asking this character witness if he has heard of certain acts of misconduct by the defense, I'm sighting [sic] code of evidence article 608c in State versus Bagley\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9626687\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/378/1356/#p1357\">\n    378 So.2d 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The specific question here, after an officer or Chief Walker testified at length about the good qualities of Officer Stafford while under his supervision as Chief of Police he certainly can and the defense has opened the door to this introduction of any such evidence where in the prosecution seeks to rebut this evidence with any allegation of arrests, or bad character, or bad conduct in reference to Officer Stafford's duties as a police man if within the knowledge of Chief Walker. They can question the witness as to their knowledge of any prior acts of the misconduct of the accused, sighting [sic] code of evidence Article 405a which is directly on point. And although this evidence otherwise would be inadmissible, the door has been opened by the testimony of Chief Walker and is therefore admissible, the objection is overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The State asked Chief Walker again whether Defendant had ever been suspended from his duties. The Chief explained that when an officer is accused of committing a crime, he is suspended pending resolution of the charges. In this case, the Chief testified that in 2011 Officer Stafford had been indicted for two counts of aggravated rape. Defendant then moved for a mistrial arguing that after the jury heard the testimony, there was no possibility Defendant could get a fair trial. The defense argued that Defendant was charged with murder committed during the performance of his law enforcement duties, and rape was not relevant to the particular moral qualities pertinent to the crime of which Defendant allegedly committed while he was executing his duties as a police officer.

Derrick Walker Stafford had a desire early in his life to become a police officer and he did further that pursuit by becoming employed by the town of Cheneyville Police Department, Marksville Police Department, Marksville Ward Marshall's Office, and Alexandria Ward Marshall's Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   The testimony adduced at Trial by Derrick Walker Stafford was extremely impressive. Stafford testified in an extremely calm manner considering the circumstances. This testimony confirms this Court's prior involvement with Stafford in several cases whether Stafford appeared as a police officer/witness in Division B of the Twelfth Judicial District Court. Officer Stafford has always appeared in a very calm manner and has always been extremely respectful to the Court process. This respect continued\n   throughout the pendency of these proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Additionally, this Court has reviewed many photographs of Derrick Stafford with several friends and family members together with several letters from relatives, friends, and concerned individuals. For the most part these letters describe Derrick Walker Stafford as a hard working, trustworthy family man. These letters indicate and confirm that Derrick Walker Stafford is a good man, good husband and good father to his children. For the most part, these letters request leniency. However, some of the letters received were extremely critical of the entirety of the process.Additionally, this Court has considered the criminal background of the defendant, Derrick Stafford. The criminal record of Derrick Stafford reflects four arrests-one in 2001 for Possession of Marijuana; one in 2007 for Discharge of a Firearm in the City Limits; one in 2011 for Aggravated Rape; and the arrest for the matters before the Court. The Aggravated Rape charge was dismissed by the Rapides Parish District Attorney. The Possession of Marijuana charge and Discharge of a Firearm in the City Limits charge reflect no disposition, indicating they also were dismissed. Additionally, the Court has considered the allegations that Officer Stafford used excessive force on individuals after they were under arrest. These are only mentioned as allegations due to the fact that these matters remain outstanding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   In any regard, this Court has a firm belief that Derrick Walker Stafford is a good man, family man, good father and good husband. Unfortunately, there are times when good people do bad things. In the case at bar, a good-Derrick Walker Stafford has been convicted by an Avoyelles Parish Jury of doing some extremely bad things-Committing two very serious crimes. The evidence submitted at Trial brought forth many surprises to this Court. Although having presided over this proceeding from its inception, this Court was amazed at how much evidence was submitted at Trial that was not part of the Pre-Trial Discovery and/or Motion process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   .... These limited comments are only issued to confirm that the verdict of the jury was substantiated by evidence submitted. In particular, the evidence confirms that the police chase ended at the end of Martin Luther King Drive at its intersection with Tensas Street. Apparently Few backed into the Greenhouse vehicle and then pulled forward and away in a perpendicular manner; stopped; then backed up away from the three stationary police cars again at a perpendicular angle. While backing up Officer Stafford yelled for Few to put up his hands and while doing so Officer Stafford aimed his handgun at Few and pulled the trigger, shooting fourteen times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   As a result of the shooting Christopher Few sustained serious injuries and Jeremy Mardis was killed. Some of the bullets in the body of Jeremy Mardis were traced to the gun of Derrick Stafford. Two of these bullets alone were sufficient in and of themselves to cause death to this six year old child. This evidence in and of itself clearly justifies the finding of the responsive verdicts returned by the jury, at the least. After these considerations, the Court looked to the law. Article 894.1 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth several sentencing guidelines for Courts to consider. This law provides that if a defendant has been convicted of a felony, the Court should impose a sentence of imprisonment if there is an undue risk that during any period of suspended sentence the defendant would commit another crime; if the defendant is in\n   need of correctional treatment or a custodial environment that can be provided most effectively by his commitment to an institution; if a lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of the defendant's crime. Considering all evidence and research, it is obvious that this portion of our law requires a sentence of imprisonment in the case at bar.\n   <em>\n    Article 894.1\n   </em>\n   goes on to list certain aggravating and mitigating circumstances for Court's [sic] to consider. In considering the aggravating circumstances set forth in\n   <em>\n    Article 894.1\n   </em>\n   , the following are found to be applicable:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   1) Officer Stafford's conduct during the commission of the crime manifested deliberate cruelty to the victims, Christopher Few and Jeremy Mardis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   2) Officer Stafford used his position or status as a police officer to facilitate the commission of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   3) Officer Stafford used actual violence in the commission of his crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   4) The offenses resulted in significant permanent injury to Christopher Few and death to Jeremy Mardis, thereby resulting in a significant loss to the family of Jeremy Mardis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   5) Officer Stafford used a dangerous weapon, that being a .40 mm handgun, in the commission of the offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In considering mitigating circumstances as set forth by Article 894.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the following are found to apply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   1) The imprisonment of Officer Stafford will entail hardship to himself and/or his family. This provision applies to every case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   2) The actions of Christopher Few, though insufficient to establish a defense of justifiable homicide and/or self-defense, was a substantial factor in the commission of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The trial court sentenced Defendant to fifteen years at hard labor for attempted manslaughter, with credit for time served, as per the mandatory provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 893.3(D), and to forty years at hard labor for manslaughter, with credit for time served. Twenty years of the later sentence imposed is to be served without parole, probation or suspension of sentence, pursuant to the provisions La.Code Crim.P. art. 893.3E(1)(2), which provides that if a firearm is discharged during the commission of such a violent felony, the sentence imposed shall be a minimum term of twenty years. Such sentence shall be imposed without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. A defendant sentenced under the provisions of this law shall not be eligible for parole during the period of the mandatory minimum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The trial court supported its decision to sentence Defendant to the maximum sentence for manslaughter by referencing several cases, which the trial court contended were similar in nature and circumstance:\n   <em>\n    State v.

If adequate compliance with Article 894.1 is found, the reviewing court must determine whether the sentence the district court imposed is too severe in light of the particular defendant as well as the particular circumstances of the case, \"keeping in mind that maximum sentences should be reserved for the most egregious violators of the offense so charged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
