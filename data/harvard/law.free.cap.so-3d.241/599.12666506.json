On April 2, 2015, Audrey Swinney drove her brother Tony Swinney and their cousin LaMarvin Swinney to rob Bullets, a convenience store in Flora, Mississippi. Tony and his cousin LaMarvin entered the store and robbed Pyare Lal, the seventy-three-year-old proprietor of the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On May 6, 2015, a grand jury indicted Tony for robbery with an enhancement for a crime committed against a victim of sixty-five years of age or older, and conspiracy to commit robbery. On October 27, 2015, a Madison County jury found Tony guilty on both counts. The trial court sentenced Tony as a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-83 (Rev.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2015), to life in prison without the possibility of parole or early release for each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Tony appeals, raising the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Whether the trial court erred in sentencing Tony to life imprisonment as a habitual offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   II. Whether the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial where the State elicited testimony of Tony exercising his constitutional right to remain silent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   III.

On the morning of April 2, 2015, Audrey picked up her cousin LaMarvin and her brother Tony. While in the car, the three made a plan to rob Bullets convenience store. They planned that LaMarvin would put an item on the counter so the cashier would open the register, tackle the cashier, and take the money from the register. Meanwhile, Tony would destroy the surveillance video footage. Audrey would serve as the getaway driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 5. Audrey, Tony, and LaMarvin arrived at the store around 9:00 a.m. Tony and LaMarvin entered the store. Because too many people were outside, Tony and LaMarvin exited the store and returned to the vehicle. Audrey drove away and they waited across the street. About twenty minutes later, they returned to the store's parking lot and pulled up to one of the gas pumps. Tony and LaMarvin remained with the vehicle, and Audrey got out as if she were going to pump gas. Lal did not turn on the pump. Audrey got back in the vehicle and drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6. About fifteen or twenty minutes later, Tony and LaMarvin returned and entered the store. LaMarvin placed an item on the cashier's counter. When Lal opened the register, LaMarvin rushed around the counter and tackled Lal to the ground. LaMarvin grabbed money from the register while holding Lal down. Meanwhile, Tony went into Lal's living quarters behind the counter. When Tony came back out, he and LaMarvin exited the store. Audrey picked up Tony and LaMarvin beside the store and they left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 7. Lal called the police, and Flora's Assistant Police Chief Clifton Nelson responded. Lal reported that $500 had been taken from the register, $200 from a stand near the register, and $1,500 from a bank deposit bag located in Lal's living quarters, for a total of $2,200. Chief Nelson reviewed the store's surveillance video showing the robbery. The surveillance video of the robbery was shown to the jury at trial. Chief Nelson learned from a witness at the scene that two males, matching the appearance of the two robbers depicted in the surveillance video, ran and got into a blue Honda near the store after the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8. Lal could not identify Tony or LaMarvin; however, Lal identified the driver of their vehicle as Audrey Swinney. Audrey was Lal's former employee, whom he had terminated for theft. Upon the information gathered by Chief Nelson, Audrey was developed as a suspect in the robbery. That afternoon, Audrey voluntarily appeared at the police station and agreed to be interviewed. Audrey denied any involvement in the robbery at Bullets and was released. Before Audrey left the police station, Chief Nelson took photographs of Audrey's vehicle, a blue Honda matching the witness's description given at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9. On April 6, 2015, a warrant was issued for Audrey's arrest. Audrey agreed to be interviewed a second time. During the interview, Audrey said that Eric Jackson and Milton Deemus were the two males with her at the store the day of the robbery. Audrey posted bond and was released. Eric Jackson and Milton Deemus were arrested the next day. After Eric Jackson was arrested, his brother Joshua Jackson came forward with information implicating Tony in the robbery. Joshua Jackson claimed that he had overheard Audrey, Tony, and Milton Deemus planning to rob Bullets days prior to the robbery. Milton Deemus provided an alibi. Eric Jackson and Milton Deemus later were released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10. Chief Nelson issued an arrest warrant for Audrey for impeding the investigation. Audrey was arrested and interviewed a third time. Audrey stated that the individuals she had previously named as assisting her in the robbery were incorrect. Audrey stated that her brother Tony and her cousin LaMarvin assisted her in the robbery. At trial, LaMarvin admitted that he, Audrey, and Tony had planned and carried out the robbery of Bullets. LaMarvin identified himself and Tony as the two males depicted in the surveillance video robbing Lal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11. During a recess of Tony's trial, Audrey pleaded guilty to robbery. The State did not call her to the stand to testify. After the State rested its case in chief, Tony rested without testifying and without putting any witnesses on the stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12. The jury returned a verdict finding Tony guilty of robbery of a person of the age of sixty-five years or over and conspiracy to commit robbery. On November 2, 2015, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. The trial court sentenced Tony as a habitual offender under Section 99-19-83 to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or early release on both counts, with each sentence to run concurrently with the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13. Tony raises several arguments for the first time on appeal. \"Generally, a party who fails to make a contemporaneous objection at trial must rely on plain error to raise the issue on appeal, because otherwise it is procedurally barred.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

As a result, Tony asks the Court to review the arguments raised for the first time on appeal under the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14. \"The plain error doctrine is employed only in situations when a defendant's substantive or fundamental rights are affected.\"\n   <em>\n    Green v.

Habitual Offender\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 16. First, Tony argues that the trial court erred by sentencing him as a habitual offender under Section 99-19-83, because the State failed to prove that Tony had served two terms of confinement of a year or more for his prior felony convictions. Second, Tony argues that the State failed to prove that at least one of his previous felony convictions had been a crime of violence as required by Section 99-19-83. The Court does not reach Tony's second argument because it is undisputed that the State failed to prove that Tony served two terms of confinement of a year or more for his prior felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17. Both Tony and the State agree that the Court should vacate his sentences and remand for resentencing because there was insufficient proof demonstrating that Tony actually had served a year or more for his prior felony convictions. \"An illegal sentence is an obvious error subject to plain-error review.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

As such, the issue raised for the first time on appeal of whether the State failed to prove his habitual offender status under Section 99-19-83 is reviewable as plain error.\n   <em>\n    Conner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6957934\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/138/143/#p151\">\n    138 So.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150-51 (\u00b6 19) (Miss. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18.

On October 19, 2015, the trial court entered an order granting the State's motion to amend the indictment to charge Tony as a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-83. At the sentencing hearing, the State sought to prove Tony's habitual offender status by offering three collective exhibits into evidence showing Tony's prior convictions and sentences. Each collective exhibit included an indictment, sentencing order, and notice of criminal disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 20. The first collective exhibit showed that Tony was convicted of attempted escape, occurring on August 24, 2008. Tony was sentenced to one year for the conviction, but the notice of criminal disposition did not show that Tony actually served a term of at least one year. The second collective exhibit showed that Tony was convicted of two counts of burglary of a dwelling occurring on July 30, 2004, and November 23, 2004. Tony was sentenced to six years, with three years to serve and three years suspended, on both counts, with the sentences to run concurrently. The notice of criminal disposition provided an initial confinement date but did not indicate whether Tony actually had served a term of at least one year for either count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 21. The third collective exhibit showed that Tony was convicted of burglary of a dwelling, occurring on January 6, 2008. Tony was sentenced to twenty-five years, with fifteen years to serve and five years of post release supervision. The notice of criminal disposition showed that Tony had been confined for at least one year for the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22. An essential element of Section 99-19-83 is that the defendant must have served at least one year under each sentence.\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

Here, the State presented insufficient evidence to make the requisite showing under Section 99-19-83 because the collective exhibits did not demonstrate that Tony had been convicted of at least two previous felony convictions and sentenced to and served separate terms of one year or more for each conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7613942\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/485/1062/#p1064\">\n    485 So.2d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Sentencing as an habitual offender under Miss.

As such, Tony's sentences must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23. The State requests that Tony be resentenced under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2015), because the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing met the requirements of Section 99-19-81. Unlike Section 99-19-83, Section 99-19-81 does not require the serving of any time on the two prior felony crimes. Section 99-19-81 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Every person convicted in this state of a felony who shall have been convicted twice previously of any felony or federal crime upon charges separately brought and arising out of separate incidents at different times and who shall have been sentenced to separate terms of one (1) year or more in any state and/or federal penal institution, whether in this state or elsewhere, shall be sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for such felony, and such sentence shall not be reduced or suspended nor shall such person be eligible for parole or probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20991981\">\n    Miss.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Ellis II\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the State had failed to prove the essential element under Section 99-19-83 that the defendant had served at least one year for each of his previous sentences.\n   <em>\n    Ellis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7613942\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/485/1062/#p1064\">\n    485 So.2d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Right to Remain Silent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27. Tony argues for the first time on appeal that his fundamental right to remain silent was violated when Chief Nelson testified that Tony \"declined to interview\" upon Chief Nelson's request. The State argues that nothing in the record shows that Tony had received a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   warning at the time Chief Nelson said he declined to be interviewed. The State argues that Chief Nelson's testimony in reference to post-arrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence does not constitute reversible error. Alternatively, assuming the testimony was in reference to post-arrest, post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence, the State argues that it was harmless error because of the overwhelming evidence of Tony's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28. Tony asks the Court employ plain error review because there was no objection to Chief Nelson's comment. Tony's assignment of error is predicated on the following exchange that occurred during the State's direct examination of Chief Nelson:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q.

The trial court also instructed the jury that if the State had failed to prove any one or more of all of the essential elements of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery beyond a reasonable doubt, it should find Tony not guilty.

LaMarvin testified that he had planned and participated in the robbery with Tony. In light of nearly identical cautionary jury instructions approved by the Court regarding accomplice testimony, the jury instruction at issue did not amount to any error, much less plain error. What is more, Tony argues, albeit under different assignments of error, that the case is \"wholly dependant upon the inherently untrustworthy testimony of an accomplice\" who \"cut a sweet-heart deal for [his] testimony.\" The jury instruction, routinely requested by defendants, was favorable to his defense as it instructed the jury that LaMarvin's testimony was \"to be considered and weighed with great care, caution and suspicion.\" As such, Tony certainly was not prejudiced by the instruction that\n   coincided with his defense.

Tony argues that he did not receive constitutionally effective assistance of counsel at trial. Tony argues that his trial counsel allowed the errors alleged in issues I through V, by failing to object to the State's proof of Tony's habitual offender status, Chief Nelson's comment on Tony's right to remain silent, Chief Nelson's and Joshua Jackson's hearsay testimony, Joshua Jackson's testimony that Tony had been in jail, and Jury Instruction Six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 58. \"[G]enerally, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims are more appropriately brought during post-conviction proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Dartez v.

The Court addresses ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal only where \"[1] the record affirmatively shows ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, or [2] the parties stipulate that the record is adequate and the Court determines that findings of fact by a trial judge able to consider the demeanor of witnesses, etc., are not needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

The Court strongly presumes that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, and the challenged act or omission might be considered sound trial strategy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 5). Thus, defense counsel is presumed competent, and even where professional error is proven, the Court must determine if there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 61. Tony argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to contest the evidence offered by the State at sentencing to prove his habitual offender status. However, Tony's counsel contested Tony's habitual offender status under Section 99-19-83 on grounds that his prior convictions did not constitute crimes of violence. The ineffective assistance claim based on the failure to contest Tony's habitual offender status under Section 99-19-83 now is moot because the Court is vacating the sentences and remanding for resentencing due to plain error on separate grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7589325\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/477/191/#p192\">\n    477 So.2d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 62. Tony's counsel was not deficient for failing to object or seek a mistrial in response to Chief Nelson's testimony that Tony had declined to be interviewed or Joshua Jackson's testimony about his and Tony's time in jail together. \"[D]ecisions such as the decision not to object are considered tactical, and do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Golden v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8370151\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/968/378/#p390\">\n    968 So.2d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (\u00b6 50) (Miss. 2007). The Court has said that \"counsel might [have] concluded that an objection would draw attention to the question and answer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8370151\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/968/378/#p390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 63. Likewise, Tony's counsel was not deficient for failing to object to the\n   \"multiple instances\" of hearsay. As previously discussed, Chief Nelson's testimony regarding statements he obtained was offered by the State \"merely to show its effect\" on how he proceeded with his investigation of the robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034612\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/469/#p504\">\n    56 So.3d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 98). To the extent testimony was arguably hearsay, \"counsel might have many reasons for deciding not to object to a question which is technically objectionable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034612\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/469/#p504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We hold that Tony's counsel was not deficient for choosing not to object, and Tony suffered no prejudice as a result, due to other direct evidence of his guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 64. Tony's counsel was not deficient for choosing not to object to Jury Instruction Six. The instruction was favorable to Tony's defense, i.e., that LaMarvin's testimony as an admitted accomplice should be received with \"great care, caution and suspicion.\" As previously discussed, the favorable jury instruction did not prejudice Tony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 65. For the foregoing reasons, Tony's claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Cumulative Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 66. Tony argues the cumulative effect of the alleged errors at trial, in their aggregate, serves as a basis for reversal. In cases where the Court discerns harmless error or error that is not reversible in and of itself, we have discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the errors require reversal due to the resulting cumulative prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    Parker v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051969\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/30/1222/#p1227\">\n    30 So.3d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1235 (\u00b6 50) (Miss. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 67. At most, harmless error existed due to Chief Nelson's testimony that Tony had declined to be interviewed and the fleeting, unexplained reference to Tony's prior stint in jail. However, considering the circumstances of the present case and the overwhelming evidence of guilt, any cumulative effect of the two harmless errors does not require reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 68.
