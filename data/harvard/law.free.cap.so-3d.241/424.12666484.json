McElroy, appeals his convictions for armed robbery and aggravated kidnapping. For the following reasons, we affirm the conviction for armed robbery, but vacate the conviction for aggravated kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION OF THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant was charged by bill of information filed on November 12, 2015, with aggravated kidnapping, a violation of La.R.S. 14:44, and armed robbery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:64. After waiving his right to trial by jury, a bench trial was held on January 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence at trial established that the victim, Latasha McKinney, a shift manager at the Many, Louisiana Pizza Hut restaurant, was taking a deposit to the bank on August 24, 2015, when a man, who was hiding in the backseat of her car, pointed a gun at her face and ordered her to keep driving. As she drove on, she noticed a silver car following her car. The defendant subsequently took Ms. McKinney's phone and the cash from the money bag and threw five twenty-dollar bills at her as he exited her car. He then got into the silver car, which drove off. The evidence established that more than $3,000.00 was taken from Ms. McKinney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. McKinney first identified the defendant from a photographic lineup. She later identified him as the perpetrator during her trial testimony. At the close of the bench trial, the trial court found the defendant guilty of both aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant filed a motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, which was denied by the trial court. He was then\n   sentenced to life in prison at hard labor, without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, on the aggravated kidnapping conviction, and twenty years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, on the armed robbery conviction, with both sentences ordered to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the charge of aggravated kidnapping was improperly instituted by bill of information and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he committed each of the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find that there are two errors patent, one of which is directly raised by the defendant herein and is addressed in our discussion of his first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition, the defendant waived his right to trial by jury and elected to be tried by a judge alone. While a written waiver was filed on October 18, 2016, it was signed only by counsel for the defendant and not signed by the defendant himself, as required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 780. In addition, the written waiver referenced only the charge of aggravated kidnapping. However, the October 27, 2016 court minutes indicate that the defendant and his attorney were present in court when the trial court personally addressed the defendant concerning his right to a jury trial and the waiver thereof. Thereafter, the trial court found that the defendant had \"knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to a trial by jury[;]\" thus, rendering the error harmless.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Louisiana Constitution Article 1, \u00a7 15 provides that \"no person shall be held to answer for a capital crime or a crime punishable by life imprisonment except on indictment by a grand jury.\" Similarly, La.Code Crim.P. art. 382(A) provides that \"[a] prosecution for an offense punishable by death, or for an offense punishable by life imprisonment, shall be instituted by indictment by a grand jury.\" Aggravated kidnapping is punishable by life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. La.R.S. 14:44. Therefore, the institution of prosecution for this offense should have been by grand jury indictment. The failure to proceed by grand jury indictment is a \"fatal defect.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Underdonk\n   </em>\n   , 11-1598, p. 7 (La.App. 1 Cir. 3/23/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7012916\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/92/369/#p374\">\n    92 So.3d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 12-910 (La. 10/8/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7028522,7028556,7028589\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/98/848/\">\n    98 So.3d 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Consequently, this requires reversal of the defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We now turn to whether the remaining conviction for armed robbery must also be vacated as a result of the inclusion of the aggravated kidnapping charge in the bill of information. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Donahue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9701134\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/355/247/\">\n    355 So.2d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1978), the institution of prosecution for second degree murder and armed robbery was by bill of information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The supreme court annulled the second degree murder conviction and discussed the armed robbery conviction as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Armed robbery is neither a capital crime nor a crime punishable by life imprisonment. La.R.S. 14:64 ; La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 15 (1974). It may be charged by grand jury indictment or by bill of information.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9678722\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/341/370/\">\n    341 So.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1976) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is clear, therefore, that had the armed robbery charge been brought alone, it could properly have been brought by bill of information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, if the second degree murder had been quashed before trial began, the prosecution for armed robbery could have continued on the valid robbery count. This is so because each count in a multiple-count charge independently charges an offense. It is this principle which underlies the entire procedure whereby offenses are joined in a single count, as explained in Wharton's Criminal Procedure, as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Each count, being in legal contemplation a separate indictment or information must contain all the allegations necessary to constitute the offense sought to be charged in such count, for it is upon the principle of the joinder of offenses that the joinder of counts is allowed. In determining whether an indictment or information is sufficient, each count must be treated as a whole, and the jury is not required to treat such an indictment or information as an indivisible unit.\" 2 Wharton's Crim.Proc. \u00a7 295, pp. 138-39 (12th ed., Torcia ed., 1975)[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, if one count of a two-count indictment or information is invalid, the entire accusation will not be quashed, but, instead, only the defective counts will be quashed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selvester v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599762\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/170/262/\">\n    170 U.S. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599762\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/170/262/\">\n    18 S.Ct. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599762\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/170/262/\">\n    42 L.Ed. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1898). Moreover, Louisiana law allows the granting of partial relief in response to a motion to quash.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9629037\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/319/357/\">\n    319 So.2d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1975).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The only real question, then, is whether the charge and evidence of second degree murder presented to the jury simultaneously with the armed robbery charge so infected the otherwise properly charged and tried armed robbery prosecution as to require reversal of the armed robbery conviction. We believe that it did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In the first place, the two crimes arose out of the same transaction, and facts as to each would have been respectively admissible at separate trials of the other as part of the res gestae. R.S. 15:447, 448. This is not a situation where the counts could not have been joined and where such misjoinder resulted in inherent prejudice to defendant on each charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. McZeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9710362\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/352/592/\">\n    352 So.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1977). Here, because of a technical but fatal deficiency in one count of the accusation defendant should not have been tried on that count. Under these circumstances, we hold that our quashing of the second degree murder count post trial does not affect the otherwise valid armed robbery charge and trial, and that the conviction and sentence for the crime of armed robbery should be allowed to stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, while we nullify defendant's conviction and sentence for second degree murder, we find that this defect does not infect the conviction and sentence for armed robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 249-50 (footnote omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underdonk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7012916\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/92/369/#p374\">\n    92 So.3d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, we conclude that the defective bill of information as to the aggravated kidnapping count nullifies only the defendant's conviction for that offense. If the armed robbery charge had been brought\n   alone, it could have properly been charged by bill of information. Moreover, had the aggravated kidnapping charge been quashed or severed prior to trial, the prosecution for armed robbery could have continued separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The germane issue is whether the evidence of aggravated kidnapping presented concurrently with that of the armed robbery so infected the properly charged and tried armed robbery prosecution as to require reversal of the armed robbery conviction. We find that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Generally, courts may not admit evidence of other crimes to show defendant is a man of bad character who has acted in conformity with his bad character. However, under La. C.E. art. 404(B)(1) evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts may be introduced when it relates to conduct, formerly referred to as\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   , that \"constitutes an integral part of the act or transaction that is the subject of the present proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Res gestae\n   </em>\n   events constituting other crimes are deemed admissible because they are so nearly connected to the charged offense that the state could not accurately present its case without reference to them. A close proximity in time and location is required between the charged offense and the other crimes evidence \"to insure that 'the purpose served by admission of other crimes evidence is not to depict defendant as a bad man, but rather to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context of happenings near in time and place' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   doctrine in Louisiana is broad and includes not only spontaneous utterances and declarations made before or after the commission of the crime, but also testimony of witnesses and police officers pertaining to what they heard or observed during or after the commission of the crime if a continuous chain of events is evident under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, as this court recently observed, integral act (\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   ) evidence in Louisiana incorporates a rule of narrative completeness without which the state's case would lose its \"narrative momentum and cohesiveness, 'with power not only to support conclusions but to sustain the willingness of jurors to draw the inferences, whatever they may be, necessary to reach an honest verdict.' \"\n   <em>\n    Colomb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11511378\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/1074/#p1076\">\n    747 So.2d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Old Chief v.

Evidence indicated that the manager was escorted to the bank by an off-duty police officer working security detail. Immediately after the assailants fired a barrage of shots into the police car, the co-defendant reached into the car to get the bag of money and was face-to-face with the manager. Although the manager had received eleven bullet wounds, she was able to drive away. When the manager immediately reported the crime to the 911 operator, she could not describe either of the\n   assailants. Later, she gave a detailed description of the assailant who reached into the car, and, at trial, she gave the jury a detailed description of one of the perpetrators. There was no objection to the testimony or the identification. The supreme court found that the defendant waived any claim based on the erroneous admission of this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The defendant in the case at bar did not file a motion to suppress the photographic line-up, did not object when the line-up was introduced as an exhibit at trial, and did not object to the trial testimony of Assistant Chief of Police Dewayne Brumley, of the Many Police Department, who prepared the photographic lineup, or the testimony of Ms. McKinney, the victim. Accordingly, the defendant waived review of this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For additional reasons, we find that the defendant's assignment of error lacks merit. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that the defendant was the person who committed the armed robbery. Ms. McKinney identified the defendant as the perpetrator, both in a lineup and in court. Additionally, still shots from video footage taken from Radio Shack and the Housing Authority, both locations Ms. McKinney passed or stopped at while driving with the defendant in the backseat of her car, showed Ms. McKinney's vehicle followed by a gray Dodge Charger, corroborating her other testimony.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A positive identification by only one witness is sufficient to support a conviction.

However, despite denying involvement, the defendant offered to make payment for the loss from the robbery when questioned by Detective Winfred McDowell of the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Department, when he was arrested in Natchitoches on the Sabine Parish warrant. In addition, the evidence established that approximately $3,000.00 was taken, that it was taken by force or intimidation, and while the defendant\n   was armed with a dangerous weapon, as clearly shown in the victim's testimony that she saw him, saw the gun pointed to her face, and heard the defendant state, \"Do you see this gun? I'll shoot you.\" The defendant testified at trial, again denying his involvement. On cross examination, however, he admitted that he had previously been convicted of the attempted armed robbery of a Dollar General store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The trial court clearly believed the testimony of Ms. McKinney, who identified the defendant, and other evidence supported that decision as well.
