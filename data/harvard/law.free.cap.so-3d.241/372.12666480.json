(\"New Jax\") and Lafayette Insurance Company (collectively, \"defendants\"),\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   , in the amount of $1,185,700.00 for the loss of use of plaintiffs' condominium unit. In the first of these consolidated appeals, defendants seek reversal of the trial court's judgment and the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims for loss of use damages. In an answer to defendants' first appeal, plaintiffs seek reversal and remand on the trial court's pre-trial judgment precluding plaintiffs from introducing evidence at trial to support a claim for bad faith damages against Lafayette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the pendency of the first appeal, plaintiffs filed a motion to tax costs of the trial against defendants, which the trial court granted in part, assessing court costs and expert fees in the amount of $49,862.92 against defendants. Defendants then filed an appeal of the trial court's judgment assessing costs of the trial. This Court ordered that the two appeals be consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on our review of the record and the applicable law, we affirm the trial court's March 24, 2016 judgment finding defendants jointly liable to plaintiffs for the loss of use damages awarded by the jury. We also affirm the trial court's March 2, 2016 pre-trial judgment challenged by plaintiffs in their answer to the first appeal. Finally, we affirm the trial court's January 6, 2017 judgment assessing costs and expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Robert Chris Jordan is the sole member and manager of FIE and Iberia Tigers, LLC (\"Iberia Tigers\"), through which Mr. Jordan acquires mostly commercial properties for investment purposes. In May 2007, FIE purchased Unit 5-C in the New Jax Brewery building, located at 640 Decatur Street, which is managed and operated by New Jax. FIE later transferred ownership of Unit 5-C (\"the condo\") to Iberia Tigers. According to Mr. Jordan, the condo was purchased as an investment property and for his personal use to entertain family, friends, or clients during visits to New Orleans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Within the first year of acquiring the condo, Mr. Jordan observed water intrusion in areas of the condo directly below the roof of the building. Mr. Jordan reported the water intrusion to Earl Weber, Jr., the President of the Board of New Jax, and requested that repairs be made to the roof to stop the water intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2008, finding that New Jax had not yet made successful attempts to repair the roof and stop the water leaks, Mr.\n   Jordan began withholding the monthly condo assessment fees owed by FIE to New Jax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2009, New Jax made attempts to discover the source of the water leaks by cutting holes in the ceiling and walls of the condo; during this process, New Jax tarped off the perimeter of the condo with Visqueen plastic sheeting. At that point, Mr. Jordan found the condo uninhabitable and unusable for its intended purpose. Between July 2009 and October 2011, Mr. Jordan corresponded with New Jax by email about ongoing water leaks, damage to furniture, and the presence of black mold growth in the condo;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   along with each complaint, he constantly sought updates from New Jax on the status of the roof repairs. During that same two year period, New Jax reported several times to Mr. Jordan that attempts were being made to find the source of the water leaks, that roofers were making repairs to the roof, and that the condo was being monitored for further water leaks. However, by 2012, the roof had not been repaired successfully; and, on March 28, 2012, plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   instituted this suit for damages against New Jax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In July 2012, plaintiffs hired Greg Fisher, a roofing contractor and consultant, to perform a visual inspection of the roof above the condo and prepare a report of his findings. During his initial inspection, Mr. Fisher observed that limited remedial repair work was being undertaken on the roof, and he recommended that water tests be performed to assess the effectiveness of that work. In October 2012, Mr. Fisher returned for a second visual inspection and he observed that a significant component of the roof-the standing seam metal roofing-had been completely removed and no temporary waterproofing material had been installed to protect the building from the weather. He returned a week later and observed that Visqueen had been installed to cover the portion of the roof that had been removed; however, he did not observe progress in the completion of the repairs. Mr. Fisher discussed his observations with Mike Storms, New Jax's maintenance manager overseeing the roof repairs, and he recommended that New Jax hire a \"competent roofer\" to perform all necessary roof repairs due to the complex nature of the building's roofing system. Subsequently, by letter dated November 21, 2012, plaintiffs formally requested that New Jax hire a competent roofer to repair the roof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In December 2012, New Jax hired Paul Couget to install a new roof over the condo. In January 2013, Mr. Couget submitted an invoice to New Jax for the completed installation of a \"standing seam snap lock roof system complete with all necessary trim, flashing, and closures.\" Despite these repairs, Mr. Jordan continued to find water leaks in the condo, and he reported to New Jax that the condo had sustained further water damage and mold growth during the months that the roof was removed. In April 2013, plaintiffs and New Jax came to an agreement that New Jax would gut the affected areas of the condo but no interior repairs would take place until the recurring leaks were repaired successfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2014, New Jax held an annual Board meeting at which all new Board members were elected. In July 2014, the newly elected Board of New Jax hired a new property management company and a roofing consulting firm, BE-CI, to assess the roof. On August 4, 2014, BE-CI issued a detailed report of its findings and recommendations for necessary repairs. In September 2014, New Jax hired Acadian Waterproofing to complete the repairs outlined in BE-CI's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2015, a hard rain tested the roof repairs and provided confirmation that the roof and water leaks had been repaired successfully. Soon thereafter, repair work began on the interior of the condo. All repairs were complete by September 15, 2015-seventy-five months after Mr. Jordan had first reported that the condo was unusable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this suit for damages against New Jax on March 28, 2012. In the original petition, plaintiffs alleged that, since 2009, water leaking from the roof of the New Jax property had caused extensive damage to their condo, making it uninhabitable, as a direct result of New Jax's negligence in failing to maintain and repair the roof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs sought damages for the loss of use of the condo, subsequent rental value, the cost of reconstruction, and the loss of personal enjoyment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 11, 2013, plaintiffs filed their first supplemental and amended petition alleging further damages as a result of New Jax's \"ineffective, negligent effort to repair the exterior roof,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and naming New Jax's liability insurer, Lafayette Insurance Company (\"Lafayette\"), as a jointly liable defendant. Subsequently, in a third supplemental and amended petition, filed on March 27, 2014, plaintiffs asserted an additional claim against Lafayette for bad faith pursuant to La. R.S. 22:1892, and, after being granted leave to file a fourth supplemental and amended petition on July 7, 2015, plaintiffs added a claim for the recovery of attorney's fees pursuant to La. R.S. 9:1121.104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After answering the petition, New Jax filed a reconventional demand against plaintiffs for failure to pay monthly condo assessment fees as required by New Jax's Declaration and By-Laws. New Jax asserted that plaintiffs had failed to pay their monthly condo assessment fee of $1,418.07 since April 2008. New Jax sought all amounts due, owing, and accruing through the period of proceedings, as well as an acceleration of fees for one year, pursuant to La. R.S. 9:1123.115(A)(1) of the Louisiana Condominium Act. In total, New Jax sought judgment against plaintiffs\n   for $96,424.74, together with legal interest, attorney's fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to trial, which was continued from its original setting of September 15, 2014 to March 7, 2016, the parties engaged in protracted motion practice, which narrowed the claims and issues proceeding to trial. At the time of trial, the only claims remaining for adjudication were plaintiffs' claim for loss of use damages and defendants' reconventional demand for unpaid condo assessment fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following a five-day jury trial, the jury returned the following findings and award on plaintiffs' main demand:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Do you find that New Jax breached its obligation owed to plaintiffs under the contract between the parties? Answer: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Do you find the defendant New Jax was negligent in the repair process through the common element roof above plaintiffs' Unit 5-C? Answer: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Do you find that the negligence of New Jax was a legal cause of damage to the plaintiffs? Answer: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Please state the sum of money that would reasonably compensate plaintiffs for the following: LOSS OF USE. Answer: $1,185,700.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On New Jax's reconventional demand, the jury found plaintiffs owed New Jax condo assessment fees for the period of April 1, 2008 through September 15, 2015, in the amount of $63,563.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 24, 2016, the trial court rendered a final judgment as follows: on the main demand, judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against defendants,\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   , in the amount of $1,185,700, with interest from March 28, 2012; on the reconventional demand, judgment in favor of defendants and against plaintiffs in the amount of $63,563.15, with interest from October 31, 2012; and reserving the parties' claims for attorneys' fees and costs to be determined in later proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 31, 2016, New Jax filed a motion for new trial or, in the alternative, a motion for remittitur. After hearing arguments on the motion, the trial court rendered judgment on May 23, 2016, denying New Jax's motion for new trial and motion for remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants then filed a timely suspensive appeal from the trial court's March 24, 2016 judgment in favor of plaintiffs for loss of use damages and the trial court's May 23, 2016 judgment denying the motion for new trial. After the lodging of the record of this appeal, plaintiffs filed a timely answer to the appeal, seeking reversal of the trial court's March 2, 2016 pre-trial judgment granting Lafayette's motion in limine to preclude plaintiffs from presenting evidence of a bad faith claim under La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(4) at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While the appeal of the trial court's March 24, 2016 judgment was pending before this Court, plaintiffs filed a motion to tax costs, seeking all of the costs of the trial to be assessed against defendants. On January 6, 2017, the trial court rendered judgment granting, in part, plaintiffs' motion to tax costs and assessing court costs and specified expert fees against defendants in the amount of $49,862.92. Defendants then timely appealed the trial court's January 6, 2017 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The two appeals were consolidated by this Court on its own motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendants' Appeal of March 24, 2016 Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants raise joint assignments of error regarding plaintiffs' claim for loss of use, whether plaintiffs' claim sounds in tort or contract, and prescription. Each defendant also raises separate assignments of\n   error. New Jax assigns error to the trial court's exclusion of trial testimony regarding rental values and to the trial court's pre-trial judgment finding no policy coverage for attorney's fees awarded as damages under its insurance policy with Lafayette. Finally, in its own defense of the judgment, Lafayette asserts policy coverage defenses to its liability for the loss of use damages. We begin our discussion by addressing the joint assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Right to Claim Loss of Use\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In their first assignment of error, defendants argue that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in allowing plaintiffs, two limited liability companies, to recover damages for loss of use. During pre-trial litigation, this legal issue of plaintiffs' right to claim loss of use was raised by both parties in cross-motions for partial summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After an initial hearing on the issue, the trial court denied both parties' motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, the parties filed a joint motion for reconsideration of their cross motions for partial summary judgment on this unresolved issue. After a second hearing, the trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the right to claim loss of use and to present evidence of the ready market value of substitute property as the measure of damages for loss of use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This Court reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Sutherland v.

Defendants assert that corporate entities can suffer only economic damages and, in this case, it is undisputed that plaintiffs did not suffer any economic loss to the entities as a result of the loss of use of the condo. Thus, defendants argue that plaintiffs are not entitled to claim non-pecuniary damages for loss of use as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In support of their argument, defendants rely primarily on federal jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Corp. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Chriss\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that property owners are entitled to be compensated for the loss of use of their property and distinguished such damages from those awarded for mental anguish. This Court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Louisiana courts have allowed recovery of damages for mental anguish in cases involving other torts, such as trespass, assault, and other acts involving the violation of recognized individual rights. These compensatory damages have been awarded whether or not the violation causes pecuniary damage, since such violations self-evidently result in mental anguish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In negligence cases involving injury to property this court has limited recovery of damages for emotional stress (unaccompanied by physical injury) to those cases where the disturbance causes bodily harm or illness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Damages are recoverable, however, for loss of normal use of the building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ... Furthermore, damages for loss of use are recoverable whether the property is used for business or personal purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The normal measure of damages for loss of use is the rental value of similar property and perhaps necessary incidental expenses. It is not necessary, however, that a plaintiff actually rent substitute property in order to recover damages due for loss of use.

First, plaintiffs presented the testimony of Greg Fisher, a roofing expert whom plaintiffs hired in July 2012 to inspect the roof and offer recommendations. Mr. Fisher testified at length regarding the complexity of the roof system that, in his opinion, necessitated hiring a professional roofing contractor to complete the repairs. Upon his inspection of the roof in July 2012, Mr. Fisher observed that the only repairs that had been attempted were done by the general maintenance manager for New Jax and no professional roofing company had been hired. During subsequent inspections from October 2012 to October 2013, Mr. Fisher found a consistent lack of progress in the repairs to the roof, despite having offered his recommendations to the maintenance manager that a competent roofer be hired to perform certain repairs. Mr. Fisher also discussed the findings and recommendations from the roof assessment prepared by BE-CI in August 2014; he noted that it was a thorough, complete report that revealed the source of the leaks and detailed recommendations for repairs. Finally, based on his observations and experience, Mr. Fisher stated his opinion that the necessary roof repairs could have been completed within three to six months of when the leaks were first reported if New Jax had hired a roofing consultant and competent, professional roofer at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Harold Asher, an expert forensic accountant, testified that he sought to review New Jax's financials from July 2009 through March 2014 to determine whether New Jax had sufficient funding to repair or replace the roof of the building during that time. However, Mr. Asher learned that New Jax did not maintain a disbursement ledger, income or balance sheets, or proper financial documentation expected to be maintained by an incorporated condominium association. After recreating income statements and preparing a comparative budget analysis from the bank statements and documents New Jax did provide, Mr. Asher concluded that New Jax was financially mismanaged and distressed during the time period he examined from 2009 through 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Cal Grevemberg, an expert on mold identification and remediation, testified regarding the air quality and mold inspections he conducted of the condo and other areas of the building in 2011 and in 2013. After the first inspection, he concluded that the mold contamination in the condo posed a health risk to any occupant; after the subsequent inspection, he found that the mold contamination had worsened from the continuous water intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Jordan testified that beginning in July 2009, when he informed New Jax that the condo had become uninhabitable as a result of the water leaks and associated damage, New Jax continually failed to take reasonable steps to repair or replace the roof and, consequently, the water leaks and damage to the condo continued unabated for years. Mr. Jordan stated that in response to his emails informing New Jax of ongoing leaks and requesting updates, New Jax provided vague responses that work was being done, without naming any contractors or roofers or stating a timeline\n   for repairs. Mr. Jordan further testified that the first progress toward repairs came in mid-2014, after the election of all new Board members for New Jax; soon thereafter, Mr. Jordan learned that the new Board hired BE-CI to assess the roof and Acadian Roofing to make the necessary repairs. After the roof repairs proved successful in May 2015, he testified that the interior repairs of the condo required Board approval, and the condo was fully repaired for use in September 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on our review of the evidence presented, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we find there is sufficient evidence to conclude that plaintiffs made a prima facie case of active negligence or active breach of contract by New Jax.

Based on her review of historical and current rental values of comparable luxury condos in the French Quarter, Mrs. Poche provided comparable rental values for July 2009 through September 2015, the period of time plaintiffs lost the use of the condo. After presenting her findings, Mrs. Poche testified that the total market value for a comparable, replacement condo was $1,185,700. Defendants did not cross-examine Mrs. Poche.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   During defendants' case-in-chief, Mr. Schmidt testified regarding his knowledge, as a member of the Board of New Jax and a unit owner, of the water leaks in plaintiffs' condo and New Jax's efforts to make repairs. While questioning Mr. Schmidt, defense counsel sought to elicit Mr. Schmidt's \"assessment\" of the estimated rental values for plaintiffs' condo as presented by Mrs. Poche. Plaintiffs objected to the lack of foundation given that defendants did not list or offer Mr. Schmidt as an expert witness regarding rental values. The trial court sustained plaintiffs' objection\n   and excluded any testimony from Mr. Schmidt regarding his opinion of real estate rental values. Later, in explaining its ruling, the trial court stated that defendants did not identify Mr. Schmidt as an expert witness in the pre-trial order or, prior to his testimony, disclose that Mr. Schmidt was being called to offer lay opinion testimony. However, the trial court allowed defendants to proffer Mr. Schmidt's testimony regarding his opinion of comparable rental values for plaintiffs' condo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The record reflects that, prior to the first trial setting, plaintiffs identified Mrs. Poche as an expert witness regarding real estate rental values and defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude her testimony, which was denied. Although defendants argue that the deadline to identify expert witnesses had passed prior to the trial court's ruling denying their motion in limine, the record does not reflect that defendants ever sought to extend the discovery deadline for the purpose of obtaining a rebuttal expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In addition, in the pre-trial order, defendants listed Mr. Schmidt as a fact witness but did not identify real estate or rental values as part of his area of testimony. However, the record reflects that defendant had ample time and opportunity prior to trial to identify Mr. Schmidt as a witness to testify regarding his personal knowledge of real estate rental values, either in rebuttal to Mrs. Poche's testimony or as a lay expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Based on our review of the record, including Mr. Schmidt's proffered testimony, we cannot say that the trial court abused its vast discretion in excluding testimony from Mr. Schmidt regarding comparable real estate rental values.\n   <em>\n    Policy Coverage for Plaintiffs' Attorney's Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In New Jax's final assignment of error, New Jax argues that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of Lafayette finding that the Lafayette insurance policy does not provide coverage for attorney's fees awarded as damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As discussed previously, this Court reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , applying the same criteria that govern the trial court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate, i.e., whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Sutherland\n   </em>\n   , 15-1136, p. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797940\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/193/1178/#p1181\">\n    193 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1181 ;\n   <em>\n    Weintraub\n   </em>\n   , 08-0351, p. 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8189300\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/996/1195/#p1196\">\n    996 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1196-97 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   La.

At that time, the instant suit had not been filed, but the letter specifically acknowledges receipt of a copy of plaintiffs' petition naming New Jax as a defendant. The letter informs that counsel has been assigned to represent New Jax in this matter. Further, it states, \"[n]either our defense of the case, investigation, nor any attempts at negotiating or compromising a settlement should be construed as a waiver preventing us from raising any coverage defense under this policy.\" Finally, Lafayette specifically reserved its right under the policy, \"including the right to deny coverage, withdraw from the defense of this lawsuit or file a declaratory judgment if so warranted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The record further reflects that plaintiffs' original petition naming New Jax as a defendant did not assert a claim for attorney's fees as damages. In plaintiffs' first supplemental and amended petition adding Lafayette as a defendant, the allegations in the petition do not include a claim for attorney's fees as damages; however, a request for attorney's fees is included within the prayer for relief. In answering that petition, Lafayette denied policy coverage for any of plaintiffs' claims and pled its entire policy as an affirmative defense to coverage, but Lafayette did not specifically deny coverage for attorney's fees or plead a policy exclusion for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   After being granted leave to amend their pleadings to add a specific claim for attorney's fees, plaintiffs asserted a claim for the recovery of attorney's fees as damages pursuant to La. R.S. 9:1121.104 within their fourth supplemental and amended petition, filed on July 7, 2015. On August 25, 2015, Lafayette filed an answer to plaintiffs' latest petition and specifically denied that its policy provided coverage for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Then, on September 16, 2015, Lafayette filed its motion for summary judgment seeking, in part, a finding that the policy does not provide coverage for attorney's fees. Lafayette attached its policy and specifically cited its \"SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS-COVERAGES A and B\" which provides in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   1. We will pay, with respect to any claim we investigate or settle, or any \"suit\" against an insured we defend:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   e. All court costs taxed against the insured in the \"suit\". However, these payments do not include attorneys' fees or attorneys' expenses taxed against the insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   At the hearing on Lafayette's motion for summary judgment, New Jax argued that Lafayette had waived its right to enforce the policy exclusion for attorney's fees because plaintiffs included a request for attorney's fees within their first supplemental and amended petition and Lafayette did not provide timely notice to New Jax that it intended to deny coverage for attorney's fees. In response, Lafayette argued that it had properly reserved its rights to assert coverage defenses and it timely raised the defense of no coverage for attorney's fees in response to plaintiffs' fourth supplemental and amended petition asserting the specific claim for attorney's fees for the first time. Further, Lafayette argued its policy clearly and unambiguously does not provide coverage for attorney's fees taxed against an insured and, therefore, it is not a policy exclusion which must be specifically plead as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In ruling upon Lafayette's motion for summary judgment, the trial court found\n   that the policy did not provide coverage for attorney's fees. Although the trial court did not make a specific determination on the issue of waiver, the trial court implicitly found that no waiver occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Based on our review of the record, we find that Lafayette properly and timely reserved its rights to raise coverage defenses; Lafayette pled its entire policy as an affirmative defense within its original answer; the language of the policy clearly states there is no coverage for attorney's fees taxed against the insured; plaintiffs did not assert an allegation and claim for the recovery of attorney's fees until filing their fourth supplemental and amended petition; and Lafayette timely disclaimed coverage for that claim. Based on this record, we find no genuine dispute as to the material facts pertinent to the issue of waiver and we find that Lafayette did not waive its right to disclaim coverage for attorney's fees. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court's January 15, 2016 judgment granting partial summary judgment in favor of Lafayette finding that the policy does not provide coverage for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    Lafayette's Policy Coverage Defenses to Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Lafayette, in its own defense, raises three assignments of error asserting policy coverage defenses to liability for plaintiffs' loss of use damages. First, Lafayette argues that the trial court erred in finding that its policy provided coverage for an active breach occurring in December 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Lafayette argues that the trial court erred in finding the policy provided coverage for damages occurring outside the effective dates of the policies, which was from May 9, 2008 through May 9, 2011. Lastly, Lafayette argues that the trial court erred in finding the policy provides coverage for any loss of use damage if this claim is a continuing tort. In response to Lafayette's policy coverage defenses, both New Jax and plaintiffs argue that Lafayette failed to urge these arguments or seek a determination on these issues during the trial court proceedings and, consequently, these arguments are not properly before this Court for the first time on appeal. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Appellate courts generally find it inappropriate to consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal when that issue was not pled, urged, or addressed in the court below.\n   <em>\n    St. Philip v.

We also note that in its pre-trial order, Lafayette submitted\n   as contested issues of fact whether the policy at issue provides coverage for plaintiffs' claims and whether the claims occurred within the policy period. Thus, Lafayette acknowledged that there were issues of fact to be determined by the fact finder at trial with regard to its policy coverage for plaintiffs' damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   However, during the four years of litigation, at no time prior to trial did Lafayette seek a determination from the trial court regarding whether the policy provided coverage for plaintiffs' loss of use claim or whether the damages occurred during the effective dates of the policy. Lafayette also did not propose any jury charges or jury interrogatories seeking a determination of facts essential to its policy coverage defenses, i.e., whether the policy covers loss of use damages or whether the damage occurred during the policy period. Moreover, during trial, Lafayette did not present an opening or closing statement to the jury nor did it cross-examine any of plaintiffs' witnesses regarding any policy coverage issues. Then, after the jury returned its verdict in favor of plaintiffs, Lafayette did not object to the final judgment signed by the trial court, which rendered judgment against defendants,\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   , for the entire damages award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Lafayette did not file a motion for new trial or for remittitur as to its\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   liability for the entire damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Since Lafayette did not argue, seek a ruling from the trial court, or a determination by the jury regarding its policy coverage defenses or its liability for plaintiffs' damages, we will not consider any of the three assignments of error raised by Lafayette asserting policy coverage defenses for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commercial Union Assurance PLC v.

Lafayette submitted that plaintiffs never pled a separate bad faith claim for failure to make a written offer to settle the property\n   damage claim within thirty days of satisfactory proof of loss, pursuant to La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(4) ; thus, Lafayette submitted that plaintiffs could not assert the latter bad faith claim at trial. In response, on September 14, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the pleadings to conform to evidence. Plaintiffs submitted that their third supplemental and amended petition set forth sufficient allegations to give notice and fairly inform Lafayette of the claims asserted pursuant to La. R.S. 22:1892.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   On May 22, 2015, following a hearing on plaintiffs' motion to amend the pleadings, the trial court specifically denied plaintiffs' motion insofar as it sought to amend the bad faith claim to plead a claim under subsections (A)(4) and (B)(1) of La. R.S. 22:1892. Plaintiffs then sought review from this Court, which denied plaintiffs' writ.\n   <em>\n    FIE, LLC v.

App. 4 Cir. 8/5/15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Then, on January 27, 2016, Lafayette filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of claims not before the court, stating that it still anticipated an attempt by plaintiffs to offer evidence at trial of a bad faith claim under La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(4) despite the trial court's previous judgment denying plaintiffs' motion to amend the pleadings. On February 19, 2016, the trial court heard arguments on Lafayette's motion and took the matter under advisement to review the record and previous rulings on this issue of the bad faith claim. On March 2, 2016, the trial court rendered judgment granting Lafayette's motion in limine and issued reasons for judgment. In its reasons for judgment, the trial court reviewed the record of the proceedings and found that plaintiffs' motion to amend the pleadings, filed on the eve of the original trial date, \"sought to add a new [bad faith] claim for failure to submit a settlement demand within thirty (30) days of satisfactory proof of loss.\" Although the original trial date was continued, the trial court had precluded any new claims from being asserted at that stage of the proceedings and denied plaintiffs' motion to amend the pleadings. Based on its previous ruling that the plaintiffs could not add the additional bad faith claim, the trial court concluded that any evidence of such a claim would be specifically excluded at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In this answer to the appeal, plaintiffs do not seek review or relief from the trial court's May 22, 2015 judgment denying their motion to amend the pleadings to assert a bad faith claim under La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(4) ; rather, plaintiffs assert that the trial court misinterpreted that judgment as \"tantamount to a ruling that no claim pursuant to La. R.S. 22:1892A.(4) had been pled.\" (a \"Section 1892(A)(4) claim\") Plaintiffs maintain that a Section 22:1892 claim was sufficiently pled within their third supplemental and amended petition and, consequently, the trial court's judgment denying plaintiffs' motion to amend the pleadings did not affect plaintiffs' right to present evidence of a Section 1892(A)(4) claim at trial. Thus, plaintiffs contend that the trial court's judgment denying plaintiffs' motion to amend the pleadings is irrelevant to the determination of whether the trial court abused its\n   discretion in granting Lafayette's motion in limine to exclude evidence of claims not before the court. We disagree. Given the trial court's familiarity with this case and its great discretion in these rulings, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its application of its prior ruling and, thus, no abuse of discretion in the trial court's March 2, 2016 judgment granting Lafayette's motion in limine to exclude evidence of a Section 1892(A)(4) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the trial court erred in failing to construe the pleadings liberally to find that plaintiffs' third and supplemental petition sufficiently put Lafayette on notice of a bad faith claim pursuant to La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(4). However, statutory penalties, such as those provided within La. R.S. 22:1892, are considered items of special damage, which must be specifically alleged.\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.

R.S. 22:1892(A)(4). Therefore, in consideration of the pleadings, the applicable law, and the trial court's prior relevant judgment, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Lafayette's motion in limine to exclude evidence of a bad faith claim pursuant to La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   We find no merit to the arguments raised in plaintiffs' answer to the appeal, and we affirm the trial court's judgment on Lafayette's motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendants' Appeal of January 6, 2017 Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   We now turn to defendants' appeal of the trial court's January 6, 2017 judgment granting, in part, plaintiffs' motion to tax costs and ordering defendants to pay a total of $49,862.92 for court costs and specified expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   While the appeal of the March 24, 2016 judgment was pending in this Court, plaintiffs filed a motion to tax costs in the trial court, seeking all of the costs of the trial to be assessed against New Jax. Plaintiffs submitted invoices to recover costs for filing fees, service of process, deposition costs, expert fees, and other costs associated with trial. In total, plaintiffs sought to recover $121,930.40 in costs and expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Before the hearing on plaintiffs' motion, on December 15, 2016, the parties came to agreement on the amounts to be assessed as expert fees attributable to Greg Fisher ($3,500), Cal Grevemberg ($5,510), and Samara Poche ($2,300). At the hearing, three cost items remained in dispute. Plaintiffs sought expert fees associated with Harold Asher's financial reports and trial testimony in the amount of $46,840; they submitted invoices for consultation work with the Dancel Multimedia Group (\"Dancel\") in the amount of $30,680.52; and they sought to be granted $17,105.84 in other court costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   At the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Mr. Asher regarding the scope and complexity of the work he performed reviewing New Jax's financial records on behalf of plaintiffs and the expenses he incurred in connection with that work and trial preparation. The trial court also heard arguments from both parties regarding the equitable assessment of costs in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In ruling on plaintiffs' motion to tax costs, the trial court noted its reliance on La. C.C.P. art. 1920 and stated its finding that both parties prevailed at trial, making both parties susceptible to the payment of costs. Then, based on the invoices presented, Mr. Asher's testimony, the parties' arguments, and in light of applicable jurisprudence, the trial court assessed and awarded costs to plaintiffs as follows: $20,000 in association with Mr. Asher's testimony; $10,000 for the Dancel costs; and fifty percent of the $17,105.84 in court costs ($8,552.92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On January 6, 2017, the trial court entered judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   The motion to tax costs filed by Plaintiffs is GRANTED in Part;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Defendants, New Jax Condominiums Association, Inc., and Lafayette Insurance Company, shall be cast with the following costs and expert fees:\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-165\">Court costs $8,552.92 Expert fees attributable to Cal Grevemberg $5,510.00 Expert fees attributable to Greg Fischer $3,500.00 Expert fees attributable to Sam Poche $2,300.00 Expert fees attributable to Harold Asher $20,000.00 Fees attributable to Dancel Multimedia $10,000.00 TOTAL $49,862.92</pre>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   In all other respects, plaintiffs' motion to tax costs is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In this appeal, defendants argue that since both parties prevailed at trial, the trial court should have ordered each party to bear its own costs or, in the alternative, should have determined a reasonable amount of costs and split those costs evenly between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   A trial court has great discretion in awarding costs, including expert witness fees; and the trial court's assessment will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Bayou Fleet\n   </em>\n   , 15-0487, 15-0702, p. 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786650\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/797/#p806\">\n    197 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   810 ;\n   <em>\n    Watters v.

The record reflects that after hearing arguments on defendants' motion for directed verdict, the trial court initially stated that plaintiffs' case sounded in contract rather than tort and that the motion for directed verdict was granted. However, the trial court denied the dismissal of plaintiffs' claim for loss of use. Finding this ruling inconsistent, the parties sought clarification on the trial court's ruling. The trial court then invited the parties to submit briefs on the issue of whether plaintiffs' claim sounded in contract\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    in tort; the court informed the parties that it would take the matter under advisement and clarify its ruling on the motion for directed verdict after further review.

From a review of the record and briefs, it appears Lafayette is referring to the trial court's reasons for denying defendants' motion for new trial based on the general tort duty owed by defendants. In finding that defendants' owed a general tort duty, the trial court noted that the roof repairs, particularly when the roof was removed and replaced, posed risks to the general public, and stated, \"that's illustrative of the kind of problems that could have arisen throughout the course of this from a general tort liability aspect.\" The trial court did not make a specific finding that a particular act or occurrence constituted the active breach of contract; rather, in this continuing tort case, the active, negligent conduct of New Jax constitutes the active breach of contract that sounds in tort.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dubin\n    </em>\n    , 25,996, pp. 5-6, 641 So.2d at 1040.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The Rule 9.5 Certificate filed with the proposed judgment reflects that plaintiffs' counsel prepared and circulated the proposed final judgment to all parties and only one objection was raised by New Jax regarding the running of interest in favor of plaintiffs commencing on the date of judicial demand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Plaintiffs filed a timely answer to the defendants' appeal on September 2, 2016.
