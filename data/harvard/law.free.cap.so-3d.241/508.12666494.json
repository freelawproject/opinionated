(\"Gadrel\"). Defendant/Appellant, Arthur Alphonse Williams, appeals a judgment granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Gadrel. In the judgment, the trial court declared that Gadrel and Mr. Williams each owned an undivided one-half interest in the immovable property subject to the partition, granted partition by licitation, ordered the Jefferson Parish Sheriff to seize and sell the immovable property without appraisal, and ordered the net proceeds of the sale to be split evenly between Gadrel and Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams filed a motion for devolutive appeal. On appeal, Mr. Williams discloses that the partition by licitation was completed as the property at issue was sold on September 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For reasons set forth more fully below, we find the trial court erred in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings and reverse that ruling. However, because Mr. Williams failed to file a suspensive appeal to halt the sale of the property and the sale has occurred, we cannot reverse the portions of the judgment ordering partition by licitation and seizure and sale of the immovable property as the sale of the property rendered Mr. Williams' request to reverse these portions of the judgment moot. Therefore, in addition to reversing the trial court's decision to grant the motion for judgment on the pleadings, we reverse the portions of the judgment declaring that Gadrel and Mr. Williams each own an undivided one-half interest in the immovable property and declaring that the net proceeds of the sale be split evenly between Gadrel and Mr. Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 20, 2016, Gadrel filed a Petition for Partition by Licitation alleging in paragraph four of the petition that it owned an undivided one-half interest in immovable property located at 3150 August Street in Jefferson Parish (the \"Property\"). In paragraph five of the petition, Gadrel alleged that it acquired its interest in the Property from \"Betty Joyce Williams via Act of Cash Sale dated January 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016...\" and that \"ARTHUR ALPHONSE WILLIAMS and Betty Joyce Williams acquired the Property from Nolan Lionel Lee via Sheriff's Deed dated February 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   , 1999....\" In paragraphs six and seven of the petition, Gadrel requested that the trial court grant his request for partition by licitation and order the Jefferson\n   Parish Sheriff to seize and sell the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Williams filed an answer admitting the allegations in paragraphs four and five of the petition and denied the allegations in paragraphs six and seven. Mr. Williams did not allege any affirmative defenses. Gadrel then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings arguing that by admitting all of the factual allegations in paragraphs four and five of the petition, Mr. Williams admitted that Gadrel owned half of the Property and was a co-owner entitled to partition the Property. Gadrel further alleged that the Property was a small lot improved by a house which occupied most of the surface area, and therefore, partition in kind was not appropriate, leaving partition by licitation the only available remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to the motion for judgment on the pleadings, Mr. Williams filed an opposition in which he argued that the sale of half of the Property by his ex-wife, Betty Williams, to Gadrel was invalid because it was a community property asset acquired during their marriage. Mr. Williams argued that pursuant to La. C.C. art. 2347, Ms. Williams could not sell the property to Gadrel without his consent and he did not agree to the sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Williams also filed a motion for leave to amend his answer. The proposed amended answer attached to the motion did not seek to reverse Mr. Williams' prior admissions to the allegations in the petition, but rather sought to add \"affirmative defenses of invalidity of the Act of Sale which plaintiff claims its one-half (1/2) ownership of the subject property, as well as lesion beyond moiety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 4, 2017, the trial court granted Mr. Williams' motion to amend his answer and denied Gadrel's motion for judgment on the pleadings as moot. Mr. Williams filed his amended answer adding the affirmative defenses quoted above on April 3, 2017. On April 13, 2017, Gadrel filed a second motion for judgment on the pleadings, again noting that in his answer, Mr. Williams admitted Gadrel owned an undivided one-half interest in the Property. Gadrel further argued that the affirmative defenses raised in the amended answer did not \"properly remedy\" Mr. Williams' admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court set the second motion for judgment on the pleadings for hearing on June 13, 2017. Mr. Williams did not file an opposition brief. According to the minute entry from that court date, Mr. Williams' counsel did not appear for the hearing and the trial court granted Gadrel's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court entered a written judgment on June 19, 2017, which ordered as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   IT IS ORDERED, ADJUGED, AND DECREED that Petitioner, GADREL, L.L.C.'s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is hereby GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUGED, AND DECREED that judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff, Gadrel L.L.C. and against defendant, Arthur Alphonse Williams, declaring that petitioner, GADREL, L.L.C., and\n   defendant, Arthur Alphonse Williams, each own an undivided one half ( 1/2) interest in co-ownership, of the immovable property located at 3150 Augusta Street in Kenner, Louisiana, further described herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUGED, AND DECREED that Partition by Licitation is GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUGED, AND DECREED that the Sheriff of Jefferson Parish shall seize and sell the following related property in order to satisfy the Partition by Licitation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUGED, AND DECREED that the sale/auction of the property is to be conducted without appraisal and that the purchaser of the property shall present one hundred percent (100%) of the purchase price in cash or cash equivalent immediately upon the conclusion of said sale/auction, with the net proceeds, after deduction of Sheriff's costs, of said sale being apportioned as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   One half (1/2) of the remaining proceeds is to be paid to GADREL L.L.C., and one-half (1/2) of the remaining proceeds is to be paid to Arthur Alphonse Williams.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Mr. Williams filed a motion for devolutive appeal, which the trial court granted on August 1, 2017. In his appellate brief, Mr. Williams notes that Gadrel sought to enforce the Judgment and on September 20, 2017, the Property was sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Williams contends the trial court erred by granting Gadrel's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Mr. Williams contends that though he admitted the act of sale of half of the Property occurred between Betty Williams and Gadrel, he did not admit the sale was \"legally valid.\" He contends that the act of sale is invalid or null pursuant to La. C.C. art. 2347 because Ms. Williams and Gadrel did not obtain his concurrence prior to proceeding with the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, Gadrel argues Mr. Williams' admissions in his answer and his failure to amend these admissions, as well as his failure to oppose the second motion for judgment on the pleadings and his failure to appear in court, amount to a concurrence in the sale giving rise to Gadrel's right as a co-owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   La. C.C.P. art. 965 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Any party may move for judgment on the pleadings after the answer is filed, or if an incidental demand has been instituted after the answer thereto has been filed, but within such time as not to delay the\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   trial. For the purposes of this motion, all allegations of fact in mover's pleadings not denied by the adverse party or by effect of law, and all allegations of fact in the adverse party's pleadings shall be considered true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, nothing beyond the pleadings may be considered.\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

Though Mr. Williams admitted the allegations that Gadrel was a co-owner of the Property as the result of Betty Williams' sale of half of the property to Gadrel, Mr. Williams also raised an affirmative defense alleging the sale of the Property was invalid. We do not agree with Gadrel's assertion on appeal that Mr. Williams' failure to amend his admissions and his subsequent failure to oppose the second motion for judgment on the pleadings constituted a concurrence to Ms. Williams' sale of her interests in the Property to Gadrel. A conflict existed in the pleadings with respect to the validity of the sale to Gadrel and therefore, its rights as a co-owner of the Property entitled to seek partition by licitation. Therefore, we find the trial court erred by granting Gadrel's motion for judgment on the pleadings and reverse the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court, however, cannot reverse the portion of the trial court's June 19, 2017 Judgment, which granted partition of the Property by licitation and ordered the Sheriff of Jefferson Parish to seize and sell the property without appraisal. Mr. Williams failed to file a suspensive appeal and concedes the sale of the Property occurred on September 20, 2017. Accordingly, for the following reasons, we conclude\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   that the request to reverse the seizure and sale of the Property is now moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A moot case is one which seeks a judgment or decree which, when rendered, can give no practical relief.\n   <em>\n    United Cos.

If the party cast fails to protect his rights by suspending the execution of the judgment in the manner prescribed by law, the court can not undo what has already been done by virtue of the judgment while it was executory. It was pointed out therein that such a sale in pursuance of a mandate of court transfers the property as completely as if the owner had sold it himself. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, the judgment of the trial court ordering the Property to be partitioned by licitation in the present matter became executory after the suspensive appeal delays expired.
