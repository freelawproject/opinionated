The sole issue presented is the interpretation of Mississippi Code Section 11-44-7, which provides the method for determining attorney's fees in a wrongful conviction and imprisonment case. The trial court held that the statute sets out an escalation of fees tied to each stage of the case, capping the fee award at 25%. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2.

Hall then sued the State under the Wrongful Conviction and Imprisonment Act, Mississippi Code Section 11-44-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Hall appealed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the State, and this Court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

The interpretation of the following statute is at issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   If the court finds that the claimant was wrongfully convicted and incarcerated pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the court shall award: ... (b) Reasonable attorney's fees for bringing a claim under this chapter calculated at ten percent (10%) of the amount awarded under paragraph (a) of this subsection for preparing and filing the claim, twenty percent (20%) for litigating the claim if it is contested by the Attorney General, and twenty-five percent (25%) if the claim is appealed, plus expenses.

For statutory interpretation, the initial inquiry is whether the statute at issue is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Miss. Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Cole ex rel.

Hall argues that the word \"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is used as the coordinating conjunction to join the three phrases, operates in the conjunctive, thereby requiring the three percentages to be added together-should each condition be met (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the claim is filed, litigated, and appealed). The State in response states that the statute lays out a \"three-tier scenario\" with increased percentages according to the stage at which a case was settled or paid: filed, 10%; litigated, 20%; and appealed, 25%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7. \"This Court frequently looks to dictionaries to ascertain the meaning of a word in its common or popular sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037847\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/1024/#p1027\">\n    75 So.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9).

Cir. 2008) (citing\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2002) ) (\"[T]his court notes that dictionary definitions of\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   , while most often listing the additive sense as the most common usage of the term, also show usage of the term to connote alternatives.\"). The use of the word \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   \" to create conditional clauses-such as, \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the claim is appealed\"-along with the lack of any other potentially additive language, reflects the Legislature's intent to use \"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \" to connect alternatives rather than aggregate numbers. In other words, the word \"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \" creates a sliding scale for calculating the fee award. As a result, the plain language of the statute does not require the percentages to be added together if the subsequent conditions are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8.

A plain reading of the statute does not aggregate those percentages for calculating the attorney's fee award.
