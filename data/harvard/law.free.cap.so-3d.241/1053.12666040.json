Essentially, Defendant was charged with aggravated incest of two children (his daughter and her half-sister) who were under the age of thirteen at the time of commission, and of indecent behavior with a child who was under the age of thirteen at the time of commission. A jury found Defendant guilty on one count of the responsive verdict of attempted aggravated incest pursuant to La.R.S. 14:27 (attempt) and 14:78.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the jury rendered its verdict, defense counsel moved for a mistrial alleging that the trial court had failed to properly sequester the jury during its deliberations in accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 791. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following his conviction, the State then billed Defendant as a fourth felony offender. After a proper habitual offender hearing, Defendant was adjudicated as charged as a fourth felony offender and sentenced to fifty years at hard labor without benefits in accordance with La.R.S. 15:529.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court also denied Defendant's post trial motion for new trial, which it heard at the habitual offender adjudication and sentencing hearing. On appeal, Defendant seeks to vacate his conviction and sentence and have this court order a new trial based on the failure of the trial court to properly sequester the jury. For the following reasons, we affirm Defendant's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the jury had been charged and had deliberated for several hours, the jury foreperson sent a note to the trial court indicating the jury was \"widely opposed on all charges\" and questioning the length of time they had to reach a verdict. It was 6:30 in the evening. After meeting with counsel outside of the jury's presence, the trial court called the jury back in to the courtroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It explained that the jury could \"take as much time as [they] need[ed] to go over this matter. [It did] not want to feel that it's pressuring [the\n   jury] at all to reach a conclusion.\" The trial court then offered the jurors three options: first, to continue deliberations through dinner that evening; second, to deliberate for another hour if they thought they could reach a conclusion; or third, to break for the evening and begin deliberations again in the morning. The trial court explained that if the jury decided to go home for the evening and stay home, the jury members would be ordered to go directly home and stay there and refrain from social activities or conversations about the case. It further conditioned the overnight separation: \"if anybody should talk to you or try to talk to you while you're home then report immediately to the court about that situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury chose to go home. Before releasing the jury for the evening, the trial court again admonished the jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [D]o not discuss this matter with anybody including your spouses. You are to discuss this with each other only and only while you're in the jury room, okay? And the court will sequester you in your homes for this evening and tonight. So go straight home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next morning, the trial court asked counsel for both parties in the presence of Defendant whether either had any objection to its calling the jurors back in and allowing them to continue their deliberations at that time. No one objected. After the jury notified the trial court that it had reached its verdict, the trial court offered counsel yet another opportunity to bring any issues to its attention before calling the jury back into the courtroom. Defendant was again present with his attorney and neither counsel brought issues to the court's attention or lodged an objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury was brought in and returned its verdict finding Defendant guilty of one count of attempted aggravated incest and not guilty on all other counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel then orally moved for a mistrial and in the alternative for a new trial. Counsel explained that he had \"unwittingly acquiesced into allowing the sequestration of the jury to be broken to allow them to go home\" contrary to the mandatory sequestration directions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 791. Since then \"[he had] done some research, and juries are not allowed to go back home, they are supposed to remain sequestered.\" Defense counsel specifically did not bring the issue to the attention of the trial court until after the jury's verdict had been rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After defense counsel orally moved for mistrial, the State requested the trial court place each juror under oath and question each individually about their activity the previous night. The court's questions included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   You heard the Court tell you to go home at the end of the day? ... And not have any discussions about this case with anyone nor allow anyone to talk to you. And if that would happen that you would notify the court? ... Has anyone talked to you about the case or tried to talk to you about the case? ... Have you had any discussions with anyone or tried to do any research on your own about this case? ... Has anyone tried to contact you about it? ... Did you go anywhere or did you stay at home as ordered by the court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   All of the jurors answered that no one had talked about the case with anyone or had any exposure to outside influence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Neither counsel took advantage of an opportunity to question the jurors after the trial court finished its questioning. The motion was then denied for oral reasons assigned. Defense counsel then filed formal motions for new trial and for mistrial, which were set for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As previously discussed, the State then filed multiple bill proceedings alleging that Defendant was a fourth felony offender and should be sentenced in accordance with La.R.S. 15:529.1 (the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law). The formal motions for new trial and for mistrial, heard at the same time as the habitual offender proceedings, were also denied. After adjudicating Defendant as a fourth felony offender, the trial court ultimately sentenced Defendant to fifty years at hard labor without benefits pursuant to La.R.S. 15:529.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. The supreme court has recognized improper jury sequestration as an error patent subject to a harmless error test.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

[T]he inquiry 'is ... whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   trial was surely unattributable to the error.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because Defendant also raises this error on appeal, we will contemporaneously review the issue on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant alleges the trial court erred in denying his requests for a mistrial and new trial when the jury was not properly sequestered as required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 791. We are called upon to determine whether allowing the jury to go home overnight once it had been charged was error and, if so, whether Defendant was prejudiced such that a mistrial and/or new trial should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Mistrial:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We review the denial of a motion for mistrial under the abuse of discretion standard of review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant argues in this case that a mistrial should have been ordered pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 775, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A mistrial may be ordered, and in a jury case the jury dismissed, when: ... (3) There is a legal defect in the proceedings which would make any judgment entered upon a verdict reversible as a matter of law; ... Upon motion of a defendant, a mistrial shall be ordered, and in a jury case the jury dismissed, when prejudicial conduct in or outside the courtroom makes it impossible for the defendant to obtain a fair trial, or when authorized by Article 770 or 771.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Mistrial is a drastic remedy, which is warranted only if substantial prejudice resulted\n   which would deprive defendant of a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In doing so, it had to determine whether Defendant's guilty verdict was caused by the jury's separation, thus prejudicing him and entitling him to a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defense counsel twice agreed to allowing the jurors to go home before they were released for the night. The next morning, defense counsel had two more opportunities to raise the jury sequestration issue with the trial court before the verdict was rendered. Only after Defendant was found guilty did defense counsel complain and request a mistrial. Although these waivers were made by defense counsel, they were made on behalf of Defendant who was present throughout the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before releasing the jury, the trial court instructed the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone, not even with each other outside the jury room. He told them to go \"straight home.\" The next day, each juror individually answered questions under oath and all of them indicated they had no outside contact or influence regarding the case while they were separated. Defendant did not and has not shown that he was prejudiced by the jury's separation, which would require proof that the jury's guilty verdict was influenced by the separation rather than the evidence adduced at trial. Any \"presumption of prejudice\" was overcome by the trial court's individual questioning of the jurors and its finding of no prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The totality of the facts and circumstances shown in the record of this case, including the trial court's individual questioning of the jurors, the jurors' individual responses, defense counsel's acquiescence in and failure to object to the separation, Defendant's failure to voice his own objection or concern, and the lack of any proof of actual prejudice in the record, assure us that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendant's motion for mistrial. The State successfully rebutted any presumption of prejudice, and Defendant then failed to show actual prejudice caused by the jury's separation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion for New Trial:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Restating an assigned error in brief without argument or citation of authority does not constitute briefing for purposes of requiring that all specifications or assignments of error must be briefed.\n   <em>\n    State v.

For the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court's denial of Defendant's motions for mistrial and new trial was not an abuse of its discretion. We find nothing in the record to support that the guilty verdict rendered in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   trial was attributable to the jury sequestration error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Keith Hernandez's conviction and sentence for attempted aggravated incest as a fourth felony habitual offender are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:78.1 defined aggravated incest at the time the alleged crimes were committed, between August 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013.
