After Natchez Regional Medical Center (\"NRMC\") filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, H. Kenneth Lefoldt, who had been appointed trustee for the NRMC Liquidation Trust, sued NRMC's former directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, alleging breach of fiduciary duties of care, good faith, and loyalty. The directors and officers sought dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and argued that they were immune under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (\"MTCA\" or \"Act\"), Mississippi Code Section 11-46-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The district court agreed and granted dismissal to the directors and officers. Lefoldt appealed, and the Fifth Circuit certified the following questions to this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1) Does the MTCA furnish the exclusive remedy for a bankruptcy trustee standing in the shoes of a public\n   hospital corporation against the employees or directors of that public corporation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2) If the answer to the foregoing question is affirmative, does the MTCA permit the trustee to pursue any of the claims identified in his complaint against the officers and directors of NRMC in their personal capacity?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Lefoldt v.

In 2014, NRMC filed bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, and a Trustee (Lefoldt) was appointed for the liquidation trust and given the right to pursue all claims or causes of action on behalf of NRMC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant, the Trustee, sued the former directors and officers (collectively, \"Officers\") of NRMC, alleging that the Officers breached their fiduciary duty of care, loyalty, and good faith. The Trustee's claims against the Officers arise from the performance of their duties on behalf of NRMC. In his complaint the Trustee asserts that the defendants were grossly negligent or abdicated their responsibilities in failing to bill patients for services rendered, respond to federal audits, and properly oversee the credentialing of its doctors. Among other allegations, the Trustee contends that NRMC's Chief Financial Officer did not have the formal training or experience in regulatory matters necessary to serve as the hospital's CFO. As a result of the Officers' misfeasance, the Trustee states that the hospital lost millions of dollars in revenue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Trustee seeks to recover damages for the benefit of NRMC's creditors. The parties do not dispute that: (1) NRMC qualifies as a \"government entity\" under the MTCA, (2) the defendants qualify as \"employees\" of NRMC, and (3) the \"acts or omissions\" complained of occurred within the course and scope of the defendants' employment with NRMC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Officers moved to dismiss, arguing that they are immune from liability under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (\"MTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-1\">\n    Miss.

The Fifth Circuit observed that this Court has not resolved \"whether the MTCA bars a governmental entity from suing its own employees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-1\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit asks this Court \"to determine whether the MTCA ties the hands of the sovereign from pursuing claims against its servants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether the MTCA provides the exclusive remedy for a public hospital's bankruptcy trustee who, on behalf of the public hospital, sued former officers and directors of that public hospital.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 4. A careful reading of our laws reveals that a case such as presented today was not contemplated by the MTCA. The purpose of the MTCA is to protect public entities from being sued for the acts of\n   their servants. It is perfectly clear that the Act does not refer to claims \"by\" the sovereign. Its application comes about only as to claims \"against\" the sovereign. Looking at its plain language, \"claim\" is defined as \"any demand to recover damages\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   a governmental entity as compensation for injuries.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-1\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012) (emphasis added). \"Claimant\" is defined as \"any\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   seeking compensation under the provisions of this chapter, whether by administrative remedy or through the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). NRMC is a governmental entity, not seeking compensation under the provisions of the Act. The Act does not apply to actions by a governmental entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 5. Furthermore, Section 11-46-11 provides for a one-year statute of limitations for all claims brought under the Act. However, the State or any subdivision is not subject to any civil statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. Const. art. 4, \u00a7 104.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A statute of limitations, which extinguishes a claim, is totally inconsistent with the Constitutional provision prohibiting the extinguishment of any civil claim by the State. Reading the Act and the Constitution harmoniously together makes it quite evident that the State is not constrained from pursuing a civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 6. A plain reading of the Constitution and the statute lead us to the inescapable conclusion that a suit such as this was not contemplated by the Act. The MTCA does not bind the hands of the sovereign from pursuing any civil claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 7.\n   <strong>\n    CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   WALLER, C.J., KING, COLEMAN, MAXWELL, BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.

I respectfully dissent because I would answer the questions certified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the following manner: 1) yes, the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Mississippi Code Section 11-46-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , provides the exclusive remedy for a public hospital's bankruptcy trustee who, on behalf of the public hospital, sued former officers and directors of that public hospital; 2) no, the MTCA does not permit the trustee to pursue claims of breach of fiduciary duty or gross negligence against the former directors and officers of NRMC in their personal capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The MTCA provides the following: \"[t]he remedy provided by this chapter against a governmental entity or its employee is exclusive of any other civil action or civil proceeding by reason of the same subject matter against the governmental entity or its employee ... for the act or omission which gave rise to the claim or suit ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-7\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2012). Mississippi Code Section 11-46-7(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [N]o employee shall be held personally liable for acts or omissions occurring within the course and scope of the employee's duties. For the purposes of this chapter an employee shall not be considered as acting within the course and scope of his employment and a governmental entity shall not be liable or be considered to have waived immunity for any conduct of its employee if the employee's conduct constituted fraud, malice, libel, slander, defamation or any criminal offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-7\">\n    Miss.

Lefoldt first submits that the plain language of the MTCA forecloses its applying in an action by a public entity against its employee. He refers to Mississippi Code Section 11-46-3(1), which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Legislature of the State of Mississippi finds and determines as a matter of public policy and does hereby declare, provide, enact and reenact that the \"state\" and its \"political subdivisions,\" ... are not now, have never been and shall not be liable, and are, always have been and shall continue to be immune from suit at law or in equity on account of any wrongful or tortious act or omission ... including but not limited to libel, slander or defamation, by the state or its political subdivisions, or any such act, omission or breach by any employee of the state or its political subdivisions ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2012). Lefoldt takes the position that \"[n]othing in Section 11-46-3(1) supports ... that the Mississippi Legislature intended to recognize sovereign immunity for employees for all claims against them, including claims brought by the sovereign.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 11. Lefoldt argues that \"[t]he express references to 'person' in the MTCA's definitions for 'claim,'\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   'claimant,'\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 'injury'\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   evince[ ] the Mississippi Legislature's clear intent that the MTCA apply only in actions by a person-not in actions by a public entity.\" Such argument is supported, according to Lefoldt, by the legislature's omission of the word \"person\" from the definitions of \"[g]overnmental entity,\" which \"includes the state and political subdivisions;\" \"[p]olitical subdivision,\" which includes a \"community hospital;\" and \"[s]tate,\" which includes \"the State of Mississippi and any office, department, agency, division, bureau, commission, board, institution, hospital, college, university, airport authority or other instrumentality thereof ....\" (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-1\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 11-46-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), (i), (j) (Rev. 2012)). The majority adopts Lefoldt's reading of the statute: \"[t]he purpose of the MTCA is to protect public entities from being sued for the acts of their servants. It is perfectly clear that the Act does not refer to claims 'by' the sovereign.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 12. Lefoldt continues that various aspects of the MTCA would be rendered nonsensical were it to apply. He references Section 11-46-11(1), which states that \"any person having a claim under this chapter shall proceed as he might in any action at law or in equity, except that at least ninety\n   (90) days before instituting suit, the person must file a notice of claim with the chief executive officer of the governmental entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-11\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2012). He argues that requiring the trustee to provide notice of the claim against himself and then requiring the trustee to wait ninety days before filing suit against himself would be nonsensical. Lefoldt also argues that the one-year statute of limitations of Section 11-46-11(3)(a) would not apply because Article 4, Section 104, of the Mississippi Constitution and Mississippi Code Section 15-1-51 (Rev. 2012) prohibit the running of statutes of limitation in civil cases against the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority agrees: \"[a] statute of limitations, which extinguishes a claim, is totally inconsistent with the Constitutional provision prohibiting the extinguishment of any civil claim by the State.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 13. But Mississippi Code Section 41-13-11(5) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ...\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   community hospital, owner, or board of trustees shall be subject to and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 11-46-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Mississippi Code of 1972, for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cause of action which accrues from and after October 1, 1993, on account of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   wrongful or tortious act or omission of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   such governmental entity, as defined in Section 11-46-1, Mississippi Code of 1972, or its employees relating to or in connection with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   activity or operation of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   community hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041-13-11\">\n    Miss.

In a case in which the State had brought a civil action against generic pharmaceutical provider, Sandoz, Inc., and prevailed, this Court rejected the State's argument that the statutory punitive-damages cap did not apply to it \"due to its sovereignty.\"\n   <em>\n    Sandoz, Inc. v.

The applicable statute, Mississippi Code Section 11-1-65(3)(a), in pertinent part, limited punitive damages \"[i]n\n   <em>\n    any civil action\n   </em>\n   where an entitlement to punitive damages shall have been established under applicable laws ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6806059\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/829/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6806059\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/829/#p833\">\n    at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

The same is true here.

The majority references the language of the MTCA in support of its dismissal of the argument that it provides the exclusive remedy to a public hospital's bankruptcy trustee who, on behalf of the public hospital, sued former officers and directors of that public hospital. But to the extent that terms of the general MTCA and those of Section 41-13-11(5), which specially and particularly applies the MTCA to any cause of action against any community hospital or its employees, conflict, Section 41-13-11(5) controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 15.
