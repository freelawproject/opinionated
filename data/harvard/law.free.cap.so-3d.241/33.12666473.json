On October 14, 2016, the trial court entered an ex parte protection-from-abuse order and set the case for a final hearing. That same day, Robinson answered the petition. Following the final hearing, the trial court entered a final protection-from-abuse judgment against Robinson on November 21, 2016. On December 2, 2016, Robinson filed a postjudgment motion. Without conducting a hearing, the trial court entered an order on December 5, 2016, denying the postjudgment motion and stating, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Both [Robinson] and [Arnold] were present at the final hearing, with their respective counsel. Both parties were given full opportunity to present to the Court any evidence he or she desired the Court to consider. During this hearing, both parties, after conferring with their respective counsel, agreed to the relief requested by [Arnold]. This Court, however, independently found that there was sufficient evidence to support the issuance of a Final Order Of Protection From Abuse, in this cause, to protect [Arnold].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 10, 2017, Robinson filed his notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 6, 2017, Robinson filed a \"Motion for Statement of Evidence\" with this court, noting that no transcript had been made of the final hearing and attaching his own affidavit setting forth his statement of what he asserted had transpired\n   at the proceedings. On February 14, 2017, this court denied Robinson's motion on the basis that he had not complied with the procedure set forth in Rules 10(d) and 10(f), Ala. R. App. P.

As noted previously, in its order denying the postjudgment motion, the trial court refuted Robinson's arguments concerning what had transpired at the hearing; specifically, the trial court asserted that both Robinson and Arnold had been present at the hearing, that both parties had had the opportunity to present evidence, that both parties had agreed to the entry of the protection-from-abuse judgment, and that there was sufficient evidence to support the entry of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is well established that \"the party claiming error has the burden of showing error on the record and resulting injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Dale Cty.

In\n   <em>\n    Gibert\n   </em>\n   , like in this case, there was no transcript of the hearing included in the record on appeal. This court held that, because we could not determine that the arguments presented in the husband's postjudgment motion were meritless, we could not hold that the trial court's error in declining to hold a hearing on that motion was harmless; therefore, we reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11877482\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/709/1257/#p1258\">\n    709 So.2d at 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
