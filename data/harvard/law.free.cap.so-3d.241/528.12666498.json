For the reasons that follow, we affirm Defendant's conviction and sentence for felon in possession of a firearm and his conviction for illegal use of weapons. However, we vacate his sentence on his illegal use of weapons conviction and remand the matter for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant was initially charged on December 5, 2014 with two counts of illegal use of weapons in violation of\n   La. R.S. 14:94 and pled not guilty. The State subsequently filed a superseding bill of information on May 5, 2016, charging Defendant with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (count one) and one count of illegal use of weapons by discharging a firearm (count three).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy, Defendant was allowed to represent himself with the assistance of appointed counsel. The matter proceeded to a bench trial on September 15, 2016, and the trial court found Defendant guilty as charged on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to sentencing, defense counsel moved for the appointment of a sanity commission to consider Defendant's mental capacity to proceed as well as his competency at the time of his trial. The sanity commission conducted an evaluation of Defendant and recommended that Defendant be found incompetent to proceed to sentencing. It deferred its opinion as to Defendant's competency status at the time of trial until it had an opportunity to review the trial transcripts and other related documentation. Despite the sanity commission's recommendation, the trial court found Defendant competent to proceed. Defendant sought a supervisory writ from this ruling, which this Court denied.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brignac\n   </em>\n   , 16-694 (La. App. 5 Cir. 12/9/16) (unpublished writ disposition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, on February 2, 2017, after denying Defendant's motions for post-verdict judgment of acquittal and new trial, the trial court sentenced Defendant to 12 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence on his felon in possession of a firearm conviction, and two years on his illegal use of weapons conviction, to run concurrently with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2014, Deputy Brent Baldassaro with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office was dispatched to a wooded area near Destrehan Avenue close to the Harvey Canal in response to a report of someone shooting in the area. He turned down a dirt road heading toward the canal when he encountered a red Chevy Cobalt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deputy Baldassaro testified that live ammunition indicative of an assault rifle was found around the vehicle. He stated that an assault rifle and magazine associated with the rifle were found separately in the nearby woods. He further testified that two individuals, one of whom was Defendant, were subsequently found hiding in the woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A witness, Chris Carr, later interviewed by the police, indicated that he had been in an automobile with Defendant, who he identified in a photographic lineup, and another individual, and that there was a firearm located in the vehicle. Although Mr. Carr testified at trial that he did not see Defendant discharge a firearm on that day, the deputy who interviewed Mr. Carr contradicted his claim, stating that Mr. Carr indicated during his interview that he had personally witnessed Defendant discharge the firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State also presented the testimony of Sergeant Joel O'Lear, a latent print examiner with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Crime Laboratory, who examined Defendant's fingerprints taken the morning of trial and opined that Defendant was the same person who had been convicted in 2006 for distribution of cocaine as evidenced by the fingerprints contained in the 2006 certified conviction packet that was introduced into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    ISSUES\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant raises two issues on appeal. First, he asserts the trial court abused its discretion in declaring him competent to proceed to trial. Second, he contends the trial court erred in failing to obtain a valid jury trial waiver before proceeding with a judge trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Competency\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant first argues that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting the sanity commission's unanimous recommendation that he was incompetent to proceed to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant acknowledges that this issue was previously addressed by this Court in a writ disposition, but requests that this Court reconsider the issue. The State responds that Defendant's claim should be denied under the \"law of the case\" doctrine since this Court previously denied relief on this issue in Defendant's writ application, 16-KH-694.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the \"law of the case\" doctrine, an appellate court will generally refuse to reconsider its own rulings of law on a subsequent appeal in the same case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Earls\n   </em>\n   , 12-448 (La. App. 5 Cir. 12/11/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018349\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/106/1149/#p1159\">\n    106 So.3d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 13-132 (La. 9/20/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002753,7002682,7002657\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/122/1012/\">\n    122 So.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Application of the \"law of the case\" doctrine is discretionary and the prior denial of a supervisory writ does not bar reconsideration of an issue on appeal, nor does it prevent the appellate panel from reaching a different conclusion on the issue.\n   <em>\n    State v. Voltolina\n   </em>\n   , 10-1090 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/25/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7031318\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/1027/#p1031\">\n    77 So.3d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1031. Reconsideration is warranted when, in light of a subsequent trial record, it is apparent that the determination was patently erroneous and produced unjust results.\n   <em>\n    Earls,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018349\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/106/1149/#p1159\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this Court's previous ruling on Defendant's writ application, the writ panel thoroughly and carefully considered the merits of Defendant's claim that the trial court erred in finding him competent to proceed to sentencing despite the sanity commission's contrary recommendation. The panel concluded that on the showing made, which consisted of the transcript of the competency hearing during which Dr. Rafael Salcedo testified, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The panel noted that the trial judge based his ruling on his year and a half of interaction with Defendant\n   during which he explicitly found Defendant understood the proceedings as demonstrated by his self-representation, his various conversations with the trial judge, and the questions he asked and arguments he made during trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brignac\n   </em>\n   , 16-694 (La. App. 5 Cir. 12/9/16) (unpublished writ disposition). In reviewing the full and complete record on appeal, which consists of the trial transcript as well as various motion hearing transcripts, we find no reason to disturb the writ panel's previous ruling on this issue. Defendant has failed to cite any new facts or additional jurisprudence indicating that this Court's prior disposition was patently erroneous and produced an unjust result, nor does the full record reveal any new evidence indicating such.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Jury Trial Waiver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant next argues that he was entitled to a jury trial but proceeded to a judge trial without a valid waiver. He notes the waiver of a jury trial cannot be presumed, but must be knowingly and voluntarily waived. He contends the record is silent on the issue of a jury trial waiver as there is no colloquy on the issue in any of the transcripts or any reference to a jury trial waiver in the minutes; thus, because there is no evidence of a valid jury trial waiver, he maintains his convictions and sentences should be set aside and the matter remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State responded by filing a motion to supplement the record with a transcript of Defendant's jury trial waiver, which was granted by this Court. The supplement shows that on August 29, 2016, Defendant, appearing in proper person after having been granted the right to self-representation, the prosecutor and the trial judge were discussing the scheduling of trial in open court. The trial judge informed Defendant that trial would be set for August 31, 2016, to which Defendant assented. Defendant then stated, \"Excuse me, Your Honor; for the record, I would like to do a Judge Trial.\" Defendant was sworn in and the following colloquy took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Okay. Mr. Brignac, what you need to know is, you have the right to do that. You have the right to request a Judge Trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   But what I want you to know is, is that for nineteen years of my life, I was an Assistant D.A., just like Mr. DeCoste over there. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I tried a lot of cases. Okay. Against Mr. Somoza, and other people that are in this building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Alright? I want you to understand that, that I've seen and pretty much heard just about everything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I'll be fair, I'll listen to all the evidence and go where it directs me, but I think it's important for you to understand what I did for a living before I became a Judge. Alright?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Knowing all of that, you still wish to proceed as a Judge Trial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [DEFENDANT]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Okay. Alright. We'll do that. It will be a Judge Trial on Wednesday the 31\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While this supplementation of the record controverts Defendant's claim that the record is silent on the issue of a jury trial\n   waiver, we are still faced with the issue of whether this jury trial waiver was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and La. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 17 (A) guarantee an accused the right to a trial by jury in felony and certain misdemeanor cases. Except in capital cases, a defendant may knowingly and intelligently waive his right to trial by jury and elect to be tried by the judge. La. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 17 ; La. C.Cr.P. art. 780(A) ; La.

In conducting a harmless error analysis where there is no written jury trial waiver as required by La. C.Cr.P. art. 780, the Fourth Circuit has looked to the jurisprudence regarding the validity of oral waivers before the 2013 amendment to La. C.Cr.P. art. 780 that required a written waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Mahogany\n   </em>\n   , 17-377 (La.

In so doing, it has concluded that where the record shows a defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury, the lack of a written jury trial waiver is harmless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374151\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/225/489/#p506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Prior to the requirement under La. C.Cr.P. art. 780 that a jury trial waiver be in writing, the preferred practice for obtaining a valid waiver of the right to trial by jury was for the trial court to advise the defendant in open court of his right to a jury trial and for the defendant to personally waive the right, even though this practice was not statutorily required.\n   <em>\n    State v. Pierre\n   </em>\n   , 02-2665 (La. 3/28/03),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313115,9313135\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/321/\">\n    842 So.2d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In a case very similar to the present one,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The appellate court noted that this occurred during a status conference. Near the end of the conference, as the court attempted to assign a trial date, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [THE DEFENDANT]: Can I ask you one question? You're setting it for a bench trial with the judge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: That's what you wanted; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [THE DEFENDANT]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: That's right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [THE DEFENDANT]: Thank you, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The appellate court concluded that this clearly reflected the defendant waived his right to a jury trial in open court. The court further noted that on the day of the defendant's bench trial, prior to its commencement, the trial court expressly announced, in the defendant's presence, that the right to a jury trial had been waived and the defendant did not object or express any disagreement. Noting that a determination of the knowing and intelligent nature of a jury trial waiver does not require a\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   -like colloquy, the court found the record showed a valid waiver of the defendant's right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We find that the record shows Defendant validly waived his right to trial by jury. At a hearing several months prior to his jury trial waiver, the trial court advised Defendant on the record of his right to either a jury or bench trial, noting \"[a] trial, if you choose to go Judge Trial, would be me. But if you choose to go Jury would be twelve other prospective jurors who would hear all of this to make a determination.\" Thereafter, on August 29, 2016, Defendant independently raised the issue and explicitly stated that he wanted a judge trial. After the State waived the 45-day time period under La. C.Cr.P. art. 780, the trial court personally addressed Defendant, informed him of his right to choose a bench trial, and confirmed that it was Defendant's desire to be tried by the judge. Defendant personally and expressly agreed that he wished to proceed to a judge trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, the record reflects that Defendant had prior experience as an accused in a criminal prosecution. Although Defendant pled guilty in one of his prior criminal experiences and did not proceed to trial, he executed a waiver of rights form that advised him of his right to a trial by jury and he was further advised by the court of his right a trial by judge or jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Under these circumstances, we find Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial. As such, the absence of a written waiver required by La. C.Cr.P. art. 780 was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Young\n   </em>\n   , 16-358 (La.

R.S. 14:94 provides that the term of imprisonment for illegal use of weapons shall be \"with or without hard labor for not more than two years.\" Although the commitment reflects Defendant's sentence was imposed at hard labor, the sentencing transcript does not reflect the trial court ordered the sentence to be at hard labor or be served with the Department of Corrections.

EDWARDS, JUDGE PRO TEMPORE, J., DISSENTS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion on the issue raised by defendant's second assignment of error relating to whether there was a valid waiver of the right to a jury trial in this matter. La. C.Cr.P. art. 780 clearly requires a written waiver, which does not exist in this record. The majority opinion acknowledges that, but finds the error to be harmless. I disagree. Considering the report and recommendation of the sanity commission, and the fact that this defendant was self-represented, I do not consider the oral waiver to be knowing and voluntary to the extent that it would render the failure to comply with the mandate of La. C.Cr.P. art 780 harmless error. Consequently, I would reverse the convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Co-defendant, Devan Smith, was charged in count two of the bill of information with felon in possession of a firearm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     Faretta v.
