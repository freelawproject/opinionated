The Board of Supervisors of Rankin County has appealed the decision of the circuit court granting Lakeland Income Properties' summary judgment motion and holding that Lakeland Income Properties was properly before the circuit court and was entitled to an ad valorem tax exemption under Mississippi Code Section 61-3-21 for the land rented from the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority. The circuit court also granted a refund of the 2015 ad valorem taxes. Lakeland Income Properties filed a cross-appeal, arguing that it was entitled to an ad valorem tax refund under Mississippi Code Section 27-73-7 for the 2015 ad valorem taxes and for the prior three years. Under a de novo standard of review, the Court affirms the trial court in holding that the ad valorem tax exemption sought by Lakeland Income Properties was automatic and self-operating under Mississippi Code Section 61-3-21, and thereby, properly before the circuit court under Mississippi Code Section 11-51-77. Further, the Court affirms the trial\n   court's holding that Lakeland Income Properties was entitled to a refund of the 2015 taxes. The Court reverses the trial court's holding that Lakeland Income Properties is not entitled to a refund for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years, holding that Lakeland Income Properties is entitled to the refund under Mississippi Code Section 27-73-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Lakeland Income Properties, LLC (LIP) filed a Notice of Appeal on November 23, 2015, alleging that LIP was aggrieved by the November 16, 2015, decision of the Board of Supervisors (the Board) assessing ad valorem taxes to LIP for the property it leases from the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority (the Airport).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   LIP cited Mississippi Code Section 61-3-21 as proof that it was entitled to an exemption from ad valorem taxes. The property is a 5.20-acre parcel of land at the corner of Lakeland Drive and Airport Road that contains a shopping plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Both parties filed competing motions for summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment addressed whether Section 61-3-21 required an exemption of the ad valorem taxes assessed to LIP. LIP argued that Section 61-3-21 entitled it to an exemption, and a refund was required for the previous three years of taxes. The Board argued that the exemption did not apply because LIP's real property did not fall into the definition of an airport under Section 61-3-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. After the parties filed responses and rebuttals to the summary judgment motions, the Board filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal because LIP failed to object under Section 25-35-93 to the Board's assessment of taxes or file an application for change of the assessment. LIP responded with a Motion to Strike, stating that the Motion to Dismiss was untimely. LIP also argued that it was not required to file an objection or an application under Section 11-51-77 ; therefore, their appeal was properly before the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After a hearing on the competing motions for summary judgment, the Motion to Dismiss and the Motion to Strike, the trial judge ruled from the bench and then issued a corresponding written judgment to follow. The trial court denied LIP's Motion to Strike, finding that the jurisdictional issue cannot be waived. The trial court then denied the motion to Dismiss, finding that the appeal was proper under Section 11-51-77. The Court then granted LIP's summary judgment motion and denied the Board's summary judgment motion, finding that the exemption applied under Section 61-3-21, for the tax year of 2015 but not the prior years. The Board appealed, and LIP filed a cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. The Board raised three issues on appeal, and LIP raised two issues. The issues are consolidated and restated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Whether the circuit court erred in denying the Board's Motion to Dismiss based upon LIP's failure to object or file an application before the Board prior to appealing to the circuit court pursuant to Mississippi Code Section 11-51-77.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Whether the circuit court erred in granting LIP's summary judgment motion, denying the Board's summary judgment motion and holding LIP exempt from ad valorem taxes under Mississippi Code Section 61-3-21.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   LIP raises one issue on its cross-appeal. The issue is restated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether the circuit court erred in holding that LIP is entitled to a refund of only its 2015 ad valorem taxes, as opposed to a refund reaching back three years.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7.

The instant issue revolves around the reading of three statutes, Sections 11-51-77, 27-35-93 and 27-35-143. Section 11-51-77 states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the board of supervisors or the municipal authorities of a city, town or village, as to the assessment of taxes, may, within ten days after the adjournment of the meeting at which such decision is made, appeal to the circuit court of the county ....

The Board argues that Section 11-51-77 is a statute of general application; therefore, the more specific Sections- Section 27-35-93 and Section 27-35-143 -apply over Section 11-51-77. LIP argues that Section 11-51-77 alone applies. LIP reasons that Section 27-35-93 and Section 27-35-143 do not address exemptions or apply to the instant case because the airport exemption at issue is automatic or self-operating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 12. The Court's role \"is not to decide what a statute should provide, but to determine what it does provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037847\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/1024/#p1027\">\n    75 So.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027 (Miss. 2011). \"All words and phrases contained in the statutes are used according to their common and ordinary acceptation and meaning; but technical words and phrases according to their technical meaning.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-3-65\">\n    Miss.

On the other hand, if a statute is \"ambiguous or silent,\" statutory interpretation is warranted.\n   <em>\n    Miss. Methodist Hosp. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., Inc. v. Miss. Div. of Medicaid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7060211\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/21/600/#p607\">\n    21 So.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (Miss. 2009). Under the doctrine of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Court has stated, \"[W]e will nevertheless continue to apply the previous [statutory] interpretation, pursuant to the doctrine of stare decisis, upon finding the Legislature amended or reenacted the statute without correcting the prior interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Caves v. Yarbrough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201994\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/142/#p153\">\n    991 So.2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (Miss. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    (A) Section 27-35-143\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 14. The Board argues that Section 27-35-143 provides that an application with the Board is required before an appeal can be taken. As stated above, Section 27-35-143 provides that \"[t]he board of supervisors ... shall have power, upon application of the party interested ... to change, cancel or decrease an assessment in the manner herein provided ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-35-143\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-35-143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It then provides: \"When the property has been assessed as subject to state [or county and district taxes] and is exempt ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-35-143\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-35-143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (13). The plain language of Section 27-35-143 neither provides what a taxpayer must do to preserve the right to appeal nor requires a taxpayer to file an application. It merely details the power of the board of supervisors \"upon application.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-35-143\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-35-143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the only statutes at issue that address an appeal and the procedure pre-appeal are Sections 11-51-77 and 27-35-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    (B) Section 27-35-93 and Section 11-51-77\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 15. To understand Sections 27-35-93 and 11-51-77, the Court must look to our\n   caselaw reaching back to 1876 and the corresponding statutes, the rights to appeal an airport exemption interestingly being partly determined by caselaw handed down approximately twenty-seven years before Kitty Hawk and while Orville and Wilbur Wright were mere children. In 1876, the Court stated that the board of supervisors' decision regarding an \"exemption under statutory or constitutional provisions\" is not final.\n   <em>\n    Horne v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8839128\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/52/452/#p457\">\n    52 Miss. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (1876). \"The action of the board of supervisors in matters of assessment is only conclusive as to mere irregularities and matters of fact resting wholly\n   <em>\n    in pais\n   </em>\n   [, outside of court]; such, for instance, as excessive valuation, misdescriptions, listing of property to the wrong person, and the like.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8839128\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/52/452/#p457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8839128\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/52/452/#p457\">\n    at 456-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 16. At the time of\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   , Sections 1684 of the Code of 1871 contained the precursor language to Section 27-35-93. Section 1684 provided \"any person dissatisfied with any assessment, may file his objections thereto, in writing, on or before the first Monday of August, which shall be filed by said clerk, and preserved with said rolls.\" Miss. Code \u00a7 1684 (1871). Further, Section 1685 provided that \"the board of supervisors of each county, shall hold a meeting at the court house ... to hear objections ...[and] said rolls, after being examined and corrected as aforesaid, shall be\n   <em>\n    final and conclusive\n   </em>\n   , as to the assessments contained therein.\" Miss. Code \u00a7 1685 (1871) (emphasis added). At the time of\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   , there was no statute allowing for appeal of an assessment to the circuit court, as is provided for today in Section 11-51-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 17. Moving to the Code of 1880, Section 504 addressed appeals and constitutes the precursor statute to Section 11-51-77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Code of 1880 also continued to contain the language pertinent in\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   . Section 1684 became Section 499,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Section 1685 became Section 503.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Legislature also added the following language to Section 499: \"[A]ny person failing to file objections, as herein provided for, shall be concluded by said assessment, and precluded from questioning its validity, after the approval of such assessment roll by the board of supervisors.\" The additional language added to Section 499 serves to clarify the law already present in the code that, after the rolls are corrected for objection, they are final and conclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. Code \u00a7 1685 (1871).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 18. Although the numbers of the relative statutes have changed since 1871 and 1880, the text of the statutes at issue has remained materially the same. Therefore, the additional language added to Section 499 does not affect the analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   Court. Further, neither does the addition of Section 504 affect the analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 19. The Court now turns to our caselaw over the last century, and when examined closely, it follows the rule first penned\n   in\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   . In 1888, the Court cited\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    City of Meridian v.

The\n   <em>\n    Philips\n   </em>\n   Court upheld\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   in holding that \"where property is\n   <em>\n    exempt\n   </em>\n   by law from taxation, it cannot be subjected thereto by any action of the board of supervisors, or the officers charged with the assessment and collection of taxes ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20So.%20119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20So.%20119\">\n    at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 20. In 1932, the Court created an exception, holding that an objection is needed if the property is \"not such a property as is absolutely exempt from taxation, but is subject to taxation or not, according as the facts may be.\"\n   <em>\n    N. Am. Old Roman Catholic Diocese v.

In 2014, the Court of Appeals considered whether it could consider a tax assessment that never was objected to under Section 27-35-93.\n   <em>\n    Darden ex rel. Darden v.

The\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that it could not, because the statute had not been followed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868240\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/169/913/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868240\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/169/913/\">\n    at 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   considered a tax assessment that was never objected to, but not a tax exemption; therefore, it is in line with\n   <em>\n    Adams County\n   </em>\n   . In fact, many cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that have come before the Court have noted the importance of the objection (or application or petition) before the board (or city or commission) before an appeal is taken. However, like\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Adams County\n   </em>\n   , those cases did not address a claimed exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 25. Based on precedent dating back to 1876 and the fact that the statutes at issue have not materially changed, the Court affirms the trial court's judgment. Under Section 27-35-93, a taxpayer who claims entitlement to an exemption that is automatic or self-operating need not file an objection, petition, or application with the board before appealing to the circuit court under Section 11-51-77. In essence, the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   carries the day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Servs. Auto. Ass'n v.

The Court determined the Legislature's intent in 1876 regarding the precursor statute to Section 27-35-93, and within the passing 142 years, the statutory language at issue in 1876 has not materially changed. Further, the cases related to the issue before the Court-whether they be on the requirement of objections for alleged faulty assessments or on the effect of an exemption-have supported the\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   Court's analysis. This analysis allows the appeal, shall we say, to take flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Whether the circuit court erred in granting LIP's summary judgment motion, denying the Board's summary judgment motion and holding LIP exempt from ad valorem taxes under Mississippi Code Section 61-3-21.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 26. The instant issue turns on a de novo analysis of the following two-part consideration, as stated above. The taxpayer need not file an objection, petition, or application with the board before appealing to the circuit court under Section 11-51-77, if two conditions exist: (1) the taxpayer claims entitlement to an exemption and (2) that exemption is automatic or self-operating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 27. There is no dispute here that the taxpayer claims entitlement to an exemption. The exemption at issue is Mississippi Code Section 6-3-21(3). It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (3) All contracts, leases and other arrangements entered into pursuant to this section are deemed to serve a public and governmental purpose as a matter of public necessity; therefore, all such contracts, leases, and other arrangements\n   and all structures, improvements and other facilities erected, installed, constructed or located in connection therewith on an airport or air navigation facility owned or controlled by an authority, or any portion of facility thereof or space therein, shall be free and exempt from all state, county and municipal ad valorem taxes on real property and personal property for so long as may otherwise be lawful, and the charges, rentals and fees received by an authority in connection with such contracts, leases and other arrangements shall be deemed to be in lieu of said taxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-21\">\n    Miss.

It states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The following words or terms, whenever used or referred to in this chapter, shall have the following respective meanings unless different meanings clearly appear from the context:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (a) \"Airport\" means any area of land or water which is used, or intended for use, for the landing and taking off of aircraft, and any appurtenant areas which are used, or intended for use, for airport buildings or other airport facilities or rights-of-way, or for other appropriate purposes,\n   <em>\n    including buffer areas and areas for airport compatible development,\n   </em>\n   together with all buildings and facilities located thereon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-3\">\n    Miss.

The trial court found that the airport exemption applied to LIP's property. LIP argues that the trial court's holding was correct. Quoting the statuary language, LIP reasons that the leased property is in an area of airport-compatible development, is a buffer area to the Airport and is being used by LIP for commercial purposes. On the other hand, the Board argues that LIP's lease does not qualify for the exemption because the commercial purpose is not in connection with the operation of the airport. Further, the Board argues that LIP has not met its summary judgment burden by providing evidence of the commercial purpose being in connection with operation of the airport. The Mississippi Airports Association filed an amicus brief arguing that the statutory scheme under Section 61-3-1 provides broad authority to airport authorities to lease properties for commercial development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 29.

Considering the plain language and the ordinary use of the words, the attorney general opinion stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The term \"commercial\" is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, as \"relates to or is connected with trade and traffic or commerce in general; is occupied with business and commerce.\" The term \"commerce\" means \"the exchange of goods, productions, or property of any kind; the buying, selling, and exchanging of articles.\" Blacks Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

The Court agrees with the 2012 attorney general opinion. Under the ordinary meaning and use of \"commercial purposes,\" it includes the sale or exchange of goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-3-65\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-3-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (All words and phrases contained in the statutes are used according to their common and ordinary acceptation and meaning). Further, in support of its summary judgment motion, LIP presented an affidavit stating the terms of the lease and stating that the property has been used solely for \"commercial purposes\" since the inception of the lease. The lease itself also was before the trial court, and it provided that the land will be utilized for \"the development and operation of a shopping center and related improvements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 33. Therefore, considering the evidence before the trial court, it is clear that the shopping plaza fell within the general understanding of \"commercial purposes,\" as stated by Section 61-3-21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-21\">\n    Miss.

In fact, the lease could not have been extended to LIP if the proposed development did not serve any of the purposes detailed in Section 61-3-21(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-21\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, here, the lease served a commercial purpose, as detailed in Section 61-3-21(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 34. The question now becomes whether the shopping mall, when leased to LIP from the Airport, constitutes \"other appropriate purposes,\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   buffer areas and areas for airport compatible development.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-21\">\n    Miss.

The plain meaning of \"compatible\" in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is \"capable of existing together in harmony\"\n   <em>\n    Compatible\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2018). Black's Law Dictionary does not define \"compatible.\" Understanding what is compatible with the Airport or exists in harmony with the Airport requires the Court to consider the specific concerns and issues faced by the Airport.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-3\">\n    Miss.

Based on the materials before the trial court\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in the record on appeal, it is apparent that the noise of the airport is a concern for development. According to the Airport Association's brief, \"[t]he FAA has long encouraged measures by state and local governments to establish and maintain compatible land uses around airports.\" Land leased for a commercial purpose-such as the buying or selling goods, products, or property-serves the purpose of ensuring development, despite any noise issues. Therefore, land leased by the Airport for commercial purposes is a compatible development for an airport.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 36. Further, Black's Law Dictionary does not define \"buffer area,\" but it defines a buffer zone as \"[a]n\n   <em>\n    area\n   </em>\n   of land separating two different zones or areas to help each blend more easily with the other, such as a strip of land between industrial and residential areas.\"\n   <em>\n    Buffer zone\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). The record on appeal, including the zoning maps, shows that the property at issue falls in the area immediately adjacent to the land used for landing and taking off of aircraft. Thus, along with being an airport-compatible development, the property at issue also falls within the buffer area or zone, as defined by Black's Law Dictionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 37. The Board argues that certain actions by the Board, specifically in 2008, as shown by the Board's minutes, illustrate that LIP's property is not a buffer area or an airport-compatible development because it was deemed to be surplus land. However, the actions of the Board were\n   specifically-as noted in the minutes on January 22, 2008-to \"preserve the ad valorem tax exemption available to leases of airport properties\" and to make the leases \"more bankable so that it would be more economically feasible for Chamblee to continue to improve the properties.\" The November 20, 2008, resolution also did not change the undisputed fact that LIP continued to rent the land at issue from the Airport. Therefore, this argument is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 38. The record contains information that (1) the leased premises had a commercial purpose, and (2) with the noise concern, land leased for a commercial purpose is compatible with the Airport. Thus, the instant issue does not present a disputed issue of material fact. LIP's shopping plaza constitutes an airport-compatible development as Section 61-3-21 contemplates, and it is entitled to the ad valorem tax exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    (B) Whether the exemption is automatic.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 39. Material to the de novo summary-judgment analysis is the final question of whether the instant exemption is automatic or self-serving. The automatic versus factually driven exemption was first penned by the\n   <em>\n    Havens\n   </em>\n   Court.\n   <em>\n    Havens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1835834\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/164/119/\">\n    144 So. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Havens\n   </em>\n   , the question was not only whether the property was owned by the religious organization, but also whether it was being used exclusively for religious purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 474. In\n   <em>\n    Havens,\n   </em>\n   the Board needed to inquire not only into who bought the property but also into the specific everyday use of the property by the owners.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The inquiry was a fact-driven one that would change on a case-by-case basis. On the other hand, in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that at \"the creation of such mineral interest the exemption automatically applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346498\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/243/294/\">\n    137 So.2d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 40. Here, when the Airport leases land for a commercial purpose and the rents exchange hands, the exemption applies. In other words, at the time of the lease, the purpose of the property is known because the Airport cannot enter into a lease like the one at issue unless it has a commercial purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 61-3-21 states in pertinent part: \"[T]he authority may enter into ... leases ... (a) granting the privilege of using or improving the airport or air navigation facility or any portion or facility thereof or space therein for commercial purposes ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-3-21\">\n    Miss.

The Court holds that the instant case is on point with\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   and distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Havens\n   </em>\n   . The trial court was presented with enough evidence to determine, as the trial court did, that the exemption was automatic and did not require an objection. Thus, because the trial court was presented with evidence of the commercial purpose of the lease and because the creation of the lease for a commercial purpose automatically triggers the exemption, the Court affirms the trial court's grant of LIP's motion for summary judgment and denial of the Board's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS OF THE CROSS-APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether the circuit court erred in holding that LIP is entitled only to a refund of its 2015 ad valorem taxes, as opposed to a refund reaching back three years.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 42. When it granted LIP's summary judgment motion, the trial court\n   found that LIP was entitled to a refund of its 2015 taxes, but the tax refund did not reach back to the three years prior to November 2015 because the additional years were not properly before the court on appeal under Section 11-51-77. On appeal, LIP argues that it is entitled to a tax refund reaching back three years (2012-2015), totaling $152,605.98. The Board argues that an objection was required for each year for which LIP seeks a refund. The Board points to\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

As stated above, the\n   <em>\n    Morco Industries\n   </em>\n   Court held that \"Morco was entitled to exemption from all taxes, ad valorem and otherwise, for a period of ten (10) years from the date of completion of the project.\"\n   <em>\n    Morco Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549671\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/530/141/\">\n    530 So.2d at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
