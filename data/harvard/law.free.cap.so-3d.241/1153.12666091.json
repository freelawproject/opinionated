On September 29, 2016, the State charged Relator with felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of La.R.S. 95.1, and illegal discharge of a firearm, in violation of La.R.S. 14:94, for conduct occurring on August 10, 2016. The charges are to be tried separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to the State, on March 29, 2016, two females, T.D. and N.M., were engaged in a verbal altercation with the mother of Relator's children, N.J. Relator arrived at the scene and fired two shots at T.D. and N.M. N.M. stated that she and Relator had previously been in a relationship. A gunshot residue (\"GSR\") test on Relator returned presumptively positive, and nearby residents confirmed hearing gunshots around the time of the incident. On August 10, 2016, relator fired multiple shots at the mother of his child, R.F., as she drove away from him with the child and another minor. Both minors confirmed the incident, and another GSR test on Relator came back presumptively positive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State subsequently filed notices pursuant to La.C.E. 404(B) regarding evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts (\"404(B) evidence\") it intended to introduce at Relator's trials on the charged offenses occurring on the dates above. While 404(B) evidence is generally inadmissible, exceptions do exist when the evidence is relevant to other, admissible purposes, \"such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident[.]\" La.C.E. art. 404(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Specifically, the State sought to introduce evidence of allegations from three prior instances. The first was a September 3, 2000 incident involving Relator's \"known\" but unidentified ex-girlfriend. The facts alleged that Relator grabbed her by the neck, forced her into a vehicle, and demanded she provide her current boyfriend's address. Upon locating the boyfriend, Relator allegedly shot at him three times with a shotgun. The second allegation concerned an October 15, 2009 incident in which Relator appeared at the\n   home of his ex-girlfriend, N.J., who refused to answer her front door. Believing Relator to have left, she opened her door and was allegedly punched by Relator with a closed fist in the side of her head. The third incident concerned a May 22, 2013 incident in which the mother of Relator's children, R.F., alleged he grabbed her by the hair and punched her in the face. The two struggled over a screwdriver in Relator's hand, and Relator bit R.F. Additionally, the State sought to introduce evidence of the charged offenses occurring on March 29, 2016, at the trial on the offenses occurring on August 10, 2016, and vice versa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A hearing was held on March 9, 2018, with the State submitting its argument on the papers filed. Therein, the State argued the evidence would be relevant to \"motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident.\" The State suggested \"all [the acts] show a pattern of domestic arguments that regularly culminate with [Relator] firing shots indiscriminately on the streets of New Orleans that has continued for almost twenty years. This demonstrates the Defendant's intent and absence of mistake or accident in other incidents.\" Though the State did not expand on its argument as it relates to Relator's motive, it did reference the common thread that all of the prior and charged acts involved women with whom Relator had an intimate relationship. Before the district court and this Court, Relator claimed his intent to defend himself against the charged offenses by arguing that the incidents did not occur, such that the intent exception would not apply. Relator further noted that none of the alleged prior bad acts resulted in a conviction, a point which the State did not dispute, though we note that \"admissible evidence is not limited to only those instances where a conviction has resulted.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 2011-0414, p. 25 (La.App. 4 Cir. 2/29/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7025976\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/85/759/#p774\">\n    85 So.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court ultimately granted the State permission to introduce all of the proffered 404(B) evidence at each trial. The court found the allegations relevant to the issues of motive and absence of mistake or accident, relying upon the Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n    <em>\n     Rose\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court highlighted the defendant's \"deviant attitude\" in the context of an inextricable connection between all the acts in question, thereby rendering it relevant to the identity exception to La.C.E. 404(B) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    [T]he crimes revealed sufficient similarities arising from a fixed and aberrant pattern of behavior that tended to identify defendant as the perpetrator in the death of his second wife[, Ms. Rose]. The other crimes evidence was extremely probative, especially considering the circumstantial nature of the case against defendant. The prior crimes evidence tended to corroborate the remaining evidence introduced at trial. For example, the jurors heard from Mr. James that Ms. Rose and defendant were arguing on the morning of her death over a traffic ticket. They also heard from Mr. Wilson that he and defendant had engaged in a heated telephone conversation on the morning of her death in which defendant accused Mr. Wilson of having an affair with\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    Ms. Rose. The other crimes evidence showed defendant had previously grabbed and struck Ms. Rose during another argument when defendant accused her of not looking at him when he spoke to her. The other crimes evidence also showed defendant acted violently toward another woman with whom he had a close personal relationship [his previous wife], and eventually killed her during an argument. Thus, rational jurors could have found the similarities sufficiently probative to identify defendant as Ms. Rose's murderer because a specific pattern of violent and obsessive behavior earmarked the crimes as the work of one man and thereby \"sustain[ed] the willingness of jurors to draw the inferences, whatever they may be, necessary to reach an honest verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     Old Chief\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     v.

The Supreme Court highlighted the facts that both women were married to defendant when he killed them, and that both women experienced \"stormy\" marriages that involved times of separation. Defendant was physically violent with both women. The Court described both murders as \"brutal\" and as having taken place in defendant's home. After each homicide, defendant contacted his mother and fled the state. Lastly, defendant turned himself in on each incident.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351881\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/949/1236/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , 2006-0402 at 16,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351881\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/949/1236/\">\n     949 So.2d at 1245\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Without that evidence, which included prior acts of violence or threatened violence by both parties ... the jury would have lacked the context in which to evaluate the victim's testimony about what otherwise appeared to be a gratuitous attack by the defendant. To that extent, the threat against the victim's fianc\u00e9, Sims, was also relevant, not because it said anything about the defendant's intent to harm the victim directly, but because it showed how he clung to the relationship, even after it was long over, and how far he was willing to go to enforce that preoccupation on the victim by isolating her from the companionship of other men.\") Thus, prior acts may indeed be relevant to the issue of motive when the victim in the prior act is the same as that in the charged offense. However, to take one example, Relator's conduct toward N.J. on October 15, 2009, is in no way relevant to his motive in committing the charged offense on August 10, 2016, against R.F. Indeed, only the incidents involving R.F. as a victim occurring on May 22, 2013, and August 10, 2016, would satisfy the requirements of this exception.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    While we find the district court erred in finding\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of the acts relevant to the issues of motive and intent, we deny relief. Louisiana Code of Evidence art. 404(B) requires that the State \"provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, of the nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial for such purposes[.]\" Another recognized exception to the general rule prohibiting 404(B) evidence is pattern. The State did submit the pattern exception, in that \"Defendant has committed multiple incidents in the past of being directly involved or happening upon a scene during incidents [of] both verbal and physical arguments with women who he is\n    either in a sexual relationship in or has been in a sexual relationship with.\" The Louisiana Supreme Court recognized the admissibility of such pattern evidence in\n    <em>\n     State v.

However, Relator has not stipulated to intent; Relator has argued that intent will not be an issue at trial because he plans to deny the conduct occurred. The State's notices pursuant to La.C.E. art. 404(B) both specifically describe Relator's actions of taking a gun and shooting \"at\" the victims.

While the State indeed bears the burden of proof, such obligation does not permit otherwise inadmissible evidence from being presented to the jury if it is simply cumulative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    We find that the State placed Relator on sufficient notice regarding its intent to use the prior bad acts to show Relator's pattern of abusive behavior towards women with whom he has had an intimate relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Accordingly, Relator's writ is granted, but relief is denied. The acts in question are relevant and admissible to the issues of motive, as detailed above, and pattern. The Court's limiting instructions should be specific as to the legitimate purposes for which the jury may consider this evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-37\">\n     Should intent indeed become an issue at trial, the court's instructions may include language indicating the jury may consider the acts for that purpose as well.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
