We must also decide whether the inclusion of certain statutory language on the settlement checks imposed impermissible conditions on Employee's receipt of the settlement funds contrary to the terms of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Employee was injured during the course and scope of his employment. Subsequently, Employee entered into a settlement agreement with Employer, wherein Employer stipulated to the unconditional tender of a lump sum settlement to Employee on or before a specified date. The workers' compensation judge approved the settlement agreement, and it was stated on the record. Thereafter, Employer failed to pay Employee pursuant to the terms of their agreement. Ultimately, Employee filed for a new trial, seeking penalties and attorney fees for Employer's failure to tender settlement funds pursuant to the terms of their settlement agreement. Following a hearing, the workers' compensation judge found in Employee's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Employer now appeals the workers' compensation judge's ruling, alleging two assignments of error. Its argument is that the imposition of penalties and attorney fees for the alleged improper tender of settlement funds is inconsistent with Louisiana Law and that the inclusion of certain statutory language on the settlement checks does not constitute impermissible conditions on Employee's receipt of the settlement funds contrary to the terms of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 23, 2013, Rapheal Guillory (\"Employee\") was injured in the course and scope of his employment with R &amp; R Construction, Inc., who was insured by Zurich North America Insurance Company (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Employer\"). Initially, Employee received compensation for his injuries, but those benefits were terminated on May 20, 2016. As a result, Employee filed suit against Employer seeking benefits, as well as penalties and attorney fees for termination of his benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to trial, the parties reached a settlement of Employee's workers' compensation claim which was placed on the record on March 8, 2017. Pursuant to the parties' agreement, Employer agreed to pay Employee a lump sum in full and final settlement of his claims no later than March 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 27, 2017, Employer's counsel untimely hand-delivered to Employee's counsel a Receipt and Release, a Joint Motion and Order of Dismissal, and two checks totaling $225,930.04. The checks contained certain statutory language that allegedly imposed impermissible conditions on Employee's receipt of the settlement funds, which was not part of the settlement agreement between the parties. The expenses totaling $2,224.40, a portion of the settlement agreement, was not delivered until March 30, 2017, and was made payable to Miller and Associates with the\n   same conditional language. Thereafter, Employee's counsel sought permission from Employer's counsel to either scratch through the conditional language so that the checks could be endorsed and deposited, or to return the checks so that they could be reissued without the conditional language. Employer's counsel responded that he did not have the authority to do either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 17, 2017, Employer filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Motion for Penalties and Attorney fees which was heard on May 4, 2017. Following a hearing, the workers' compensation judge found that Employer's tender of settlement funds was neither timely nor unconditional. However, because the amount of penalties awarded could not be determined on the face of the judgment, Employee filed motion for a new trial on June 29, 2017, which was heard on July 24, 2017. Following a hearing, the workers' compensation judge signed an amended judgment which included penalties and attorney fees for Employer's failure to properly pay settlement funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Employer timely filed a motion for suspensive appeal, seeking reversal of the amended judgment signed July 24, 2017. Pursuant to that motion, Employer is presently before this court alleging two assignments of error. Employee timely filed an answer to this appeal alleging one assignment of error, seeking an increase in the award of attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     EMPLOYER'S ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

There is nothing against public policy that prevents parties from shortening the time in which a workers' compensation insurance carrier must pay a judgment. Rather, public policies are in place to prevent corporations and insurance companies from taking advantage of injured workers and unsophisticated persons. Notably, LSA-R.S. 23:1201(G), which is penal in nature, concerns an obligation that arises because of the employer's conduct after a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the parties agreed to a deadline upon which settlement funds were payable, effectively amending the provisions of\n   La.R.S. 23:1201(G). If there was no penalty or ramification for not complying with the agreement, that portion of the settlement agreement would be meaningless and unenforceable. As such, the workers' compensation judge did not err in imposing penalties and attorney fees for Employer's untimely tender of settlement funds, as the parties contractually agreed to shorten the time in which settlement funds were due, the agreement was not against public policy, the agreement was approved by the workers' compensation judge, was placed on the record, and became final. Further, Employer was aware of the ramifications for failure to timely tender settlement funds prior to agreeing on a specified date to do so, and the failure to do so was not the result of a condition Employer had no control over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court notes Employee might as easily have agreed that Employer be given more than thirty days to comply with its obligation. Had this been done, following Employer's reasoning, the Employee might have claimed penalties for Employer's failure to pay within thirty days even though they had agreed to an extension. Clearly, this would be unconscionable. It is clear that the purpose of the law is best served by enforcing such modifications to the time period as the parties may choose. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment imposing penalties and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     EMPLOYER'S ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its second assignment of error, Employer contends that the workers' compensation judge erred in finding that certain statutory language printed on the settlement checks imposed impermissible conditions on Employee's receipt of the settlement funds.

Employer admitted this at the hearing on May 4, 2017, and, as of the date of the hearing, over fifty-eight days had elapsed since Employer had issued the checks to Employee, and Employer had still not given Employee permission to scratch through the language in order to endorse and deposit the checks, and/or to return the checks so that they could be reissued without the language. A judgment debtor is obligated to unconditionally tender payment of the judgment, as required by law, whether judgment is by consent or is a considered one. Employer suggests that certain statutory language included on the back of the settlement checks was nothing more than a restatement of the law set forth in La.R.S. 23:1208. However, if that were the case, there would have been no reason for Employer to include the language and force Employee to sign acknowledging the statement, there would have been no reason for Employer not to allow Employee to scratch through the language so that the checks could be endorsed and deposited, and/or there would have been no reason for Employer not to allow Employee to return the checks so that they could be reissued without the language. As such, the workers' compensation judge did not err in finding that certain statutory language on the settlement checks imposed an impermissible condition on Employee's receipt of the settlement funds.

We find that the workers' compensation judge properly imposed penalties and attorney fees for R &amp; R Construction, Inc. and Zurich North America Insurance Company's failure to timely tender settlement funds pursuant to the terms of its settlement agreement with Rapheal Guillory, Jr. Thus, we affirm the judgment imposing penalties and attorney fees for R &amp; R Construction, Inc. and Zurich North America Insurance Company's improper payment of settlement funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Raphael Guillory raised one assignment of error. We find that the workers' compensation judge properly awarded attorney fees in the amount of $3,000.00. Thus, we affirm the judgment awarding attorney fees in the amount of $3,000.00. Further, we award Employee $5,000.00 in attorney fees for work performed by his attorney on this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Costs of these proceedings are assessed to R &amp; R Construction, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
