We agree with the trial court that she failed to raise an issue of material fact as to such intent and therefore we find no error in the court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Wendy Nolan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action against Alan Borkowski, Larry Przybylski, Raymond M. Pons and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Pons Bakery, Inc., for injuries received while she was employed at Pons Bakery, Inc. The first count of the complaint alleged that the individual defendants had wilfully and maliciously disobeyed her doctor\u2019s work restrictions which were known to them, thereby causing her injuries. The second count of the complaint claimed liability on the part of Pons Bakery, Inc., on the ground that the named individuals had been acting as its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The defendants filed special defenses alleging that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred by the exclusive remedy rule contained in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-284<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 31-293a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The defendants moved for summary judgment with accompanying affidavits. The plaintiff filed an opposition to this motion with affidavits and a supplemental opposition containing excerpts from a deposition of the plaintiff. The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the first count on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to raise an issue of fact as to the defendants\u2019 intent to injure her. As to the see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ond count, the court granted summary judgment on the same basis and also because the plaintiff had failed to show that any of the defendants was the alter ego of the employer corporation. On appeal the plaintiff claims in effect that the court erred in failing to construe the affidavits and the deposition in the light most favorable to her and in finding that the plaintiff had not put the issue of the defendants\u2019 intent to injure her sufficiently in dispute to defeat the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit contained the following claimed material facts. She began work at Pons Bakery, Inc., in September, 1980, as a general laborer and was advancing well. During the spring of 1981 she began having pain in her back and her leg which resulted in disc removal surgery in January, 1982. She was allowed to return to work on February 28, 1982, with the following written instructions: no bending, no lifting over twenty pounds and no working over forty hours a week. These written restrictions were given to Borkowski and also communicated to Przybylski and Pons. Pons was vice-president and general manager of the bakery and Borkowski and Przybylski were co-supervisors or production managers. The individual defendants violated the doctor\u2019s orders by requiring the plaintiff to do work that included bending, pulling one hundred pound racks, lifting one hundred pound sacks of flour, lifting loads of dough weighing up to fifty pounds, loading and unloading trucks and working over forty hours a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In June, 1982, after the plaintiff had made numerous requests for relief, she was given a supervisory job which was supposed to relieve her of most heavy physical duties. Borkowski and Przybylski never told her to refrain from doing certain tasks on the job and repeatedly required her to engage in heavy lifting and bending and to work more than forty hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Excerpts from the plaintiffs deposition before the court contained the following additional factual claims. In the deposition, the plaintiff stated that it was her opinion that Borkowski feared that the plaintiffs performance on the job would place his job in jeopardy. It was also her opinion that Borkowski ordered her to do certain work despite his knowledge of her work restrictions so that she would not be able to continue working. Further, she stated that she \u201cguessed\u201d that by getting rid of her, Borkowski and his friend Keith Briggs got their raises. By August, 1982, the plaintiff had to stop working because of pain and she underwent another operation for a ruptured disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The affidavit of the plaintiffs husband, Gary Nolan, declared that he had complained several times to Borkowski, Przybylski and Pons about how they were continuing to make the plaintiff do heavy lifting when they knew she should not. He also stated that when he complained to Borkowski because Borkowski had the plaintiff loading one hundred pound bags of flour into the mix, Borkowski said: \u201cIf your wife can\u2019t do her job we have no place for her here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Borkowski\u2019s affidavit (1) admitted that he was a manager of the bakery while the plaintiff was employed there, (2) denied that he had wilfully and/or maliciously disobeyed any doctor\u2019s instructions regarding the plaintiff or wilfully and/or maliciously ordered or caused the plaintiff to do any heavy lifting, bending or to work over forty hours a week, (3) denied that there was any intent on his part to cause harm to the plaintiff, (4) stated that because of his awareness of the doctor\u2019s instructions as to the plaintiff she was placed in a supervisory position in order to facilitate those instructions, and (5) stated that he had personally advised the plaintiff against doing any actions on the job that would be contrary to her doctor\u2019s instructions. Przybylski\u2019s affidavit was identical to Borkowski\u2019s. Pons\u2019 affidavit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>also identical to the other two and contained an additional paragraph claiming that he had spoken with Gary Nolan asking him to attempt to ensure that the plaintiff not partake of any activities on the job contrary to her doctor\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Summary judgment shall be rendered if the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment ,as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 384. The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of proving the absence of a dispute as to any material fact. <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984). The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court\u2019s function is not to decide issues of material fact, but rather to determine whether any such issues exist. <em>Telesco </em>v. <em>Telesco, </em>187 Conn. 715, 718, 447 A.2d 752 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In Connecticut the exclusive remedy for an employee injured in the course of employment is provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and, with limited exceptions, suits against fellow employees are barred by General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a. <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 532, 494 A.2d 555 (1985); <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 469, 471, 429 A.2d 943 (1980); <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Crown, Inc., </em>7 Conn. App. 296, 298, 508 A.2d 812 (1986); <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Metal Selling Corporation, </em>3 Conn. App. 40, 45, 484 A.2d 478 (1984). The plaintiff could withstand the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment only if the opposing documentation filed by her raised a genuine issue as to the material fact whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>any of the individual defendants <em>wilfully </em>or <em>maliciously </em>wronged her.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The issue in this case is whether the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit and accompanying documentation meet the test of <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 102, in which this court held that the statutory exception of \u201cwilful or malicious\u201d conduct requires a showing of an actual intent to injure the plaintiff. \u201cTo bypass the exclusivity of the act, the intentional or deliberate act or conduct alleged must have been designed to cause the injury that resulted. Such a concept is nothing new to our jurisprudence. Once recently, drawing on our earlier cases, we said: \u2018 \u201cA wilful and malicious injury is one inflicted intentionally without just cause or excuse. It does not necessarily involve the ill will or malevolence shown in express malice. Nor is it sufficient to constitute such an injury that the act resulting in the injury was intentional in the sense that it was the voluntary action of the person involved. Not only the action producing the injury but the resulting injury must be intentional.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>119 Conn. 532, 534, 178 A. 51 (1935). \u201cA wilful or malicious injury is one caused by design. Wilfulness and malice alike import intent. . . . [Its] characteristic element is the design to injure either actually entertained or to be implied from the conduct and circumstances.\u201d <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Skilton, </em>83 Conn. 503, 507-508, 77 A. 950 (1910). The intentional injury aspect may be satisfied if the resultant bodily harm was the direct and natural consequence of the intended act. <em>Alteiri </em>v. <em>Colasso, </em>168 Conn. 329, 334, 362 A.2d 798 (1975).\u2019 <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>195 Conn. 76, 77-78, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985).\u201d Id., 102-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Mingachos, </em>however, is not on all fours with the present case. In that case the plaintiffs alleged wilful and malicious acts by the defendant employees. This court stated: \u201cIn this motion for summary judgment, affidavits were filed. Practice Book \u00a7 381. Each defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ant employee gave his affidavit personally, specifically disavowing, inter alia, any \u2018wilful intent\u2019 to violate any [Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act (OSHA)] regulation and each indicating that on the day in question he had spent time in the same area where the accident involved occurred. On the other hand, the only affidavit submitted by the plaintiff was one signed by his attorney, which, after referring to certain attached, unverified, OSHA records, averred that \u2018[t]hese exhibits indicate that the employer was aware of the need for ventilation where the explosion occurred; that the lack of ventilation presented a dangerous condition\u2019; and that \u2018[t]he employer did nothing to correct the need for ventilation until after the accident which killed the decedent.\u2019 The record before us on this motion for summary judgment does not disclose that the plaintiff put into dispute the statements of the employees in their affidavit that each had no intent to injure the decedent. There was no genuine issue of material fact. Rather, with the exclusivity of the act, an issue of law emerged and summary judgment was properly granted on all counts of the amended complaint.\u201d Id., 114. Although the plaintiff\u2019s documentation in the instant case goes beyond that in <em>Mingachos, </em>we agree, nevertheless, with the defendants\u2019 contention that <em>Mingachos </em>is ultimately dispositive of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The plaintiff claims that the requisite intent may be implied from the conduct and circumstances in this case, citing <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 102. She argues that the defendants\u2019 conduct viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff easily rises to a level \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhere the known danger [of injury] ceases to be only a foreseeable risk which a reasonable man would avoid, and becomes a substantial certainty,\u201d\u2019\u201d citing <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The plaintiff relies principally on the case of <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 443 A.2d 471 (1982). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Batick, </em>the plaintiff in a negligence action alleged in the second count that the named defendant had fraudulently conveyed certain realty to his defendant wife. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on that count. The named defendant driver\u2019s affidavit stated that he never suspected that Batick would have any claim against him for the accident and that the conveyance of the real estate to his wife was the result of estate planning and a promise he had made to her before marriage. The affidavit of the named defendant\u2019s attorney confirmed that he had been consulted by both the named defendant and his wife and that he had advised that the husband transfer a one half interest in the real estate as part of their estate plan. He also said that he knew of the accident at that time but did not anticipate that the plaintiff would bring suit. Id., 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The court stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff chose not to file an opposing affidavit, presumably because he had no personal knowledge of the mental state which influenced the defendant to quitclaim a one half interest in his house to his wife.\u201d Id. The plaintiff filed a memorandum of law opposing the motion for summary judgment on the ground that the named defendant had failed to show \u201c \u2018the non-existence of any genuine issue as to all material facts . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In finding error in the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the court stated: \u201cWe first must consider the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file an opposing affidavit in the summary judgment proceeding. Practice Book \u00a7 380 provides that\u2018[t]he adverse party . . . shall file opposing affidavits and other available documentary evidence.\u2019 The plaintiff did attach copies of the quitclaim deed which effectuated the transfer and a deposition taken of the defendant in which he admitted that he and his wife were aware of the plaintiff\u2019s serious inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ries at the time the deed was executed. There is no. reason to suppose that the plaintiff had personal knowledge of any of the facts relating to the transfer. His proper course would have been to file an affidavit stating that he could not, \u2018for reasons stated, present facts essential to justify his opposition . . . .\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 382. <em>Dorazio </em>v. <em>M.B. Foster Electric Co., </em>157 Conn 226, 253 A.2d 22 (1968). Nevertheless, the court was not .entitled to assume the truth of the defendant\u2019s declarations concerning his intentions in making the conveyance simply because of the absence of an affidavit contradicting them. It was clear from the documents filed by the plaintiff with his memorandum of law that there was a genuine dispute over the defendant\u2019s intentions and that the plaintiff had done everything he could to present facts to controvert the defendant\u2019s assertion that the transfer was unrelated to the accident. The inference which may ordinarily be drawn from the failure of a party to file an opposing affidavit is not warranted where the other party is the only person having knowledge of the particular facts involved. \u2018Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 381. In no way could the plaintiff have complied with these requirements of the rule in an affidavit pertaining to the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the transfer. Although it would have been preferable for the plaintiff to have followed the procedure of explaining his predicament in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 382, we do not regard his failure to do so as fatal, since his inability to file an opposing affidavit was obvious.\u201d <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra, 645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The <em>Batick </em>court pointed out that \u201c[t]here are situations . . . which do not lend themselves to summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>disposition. \u2018It is . . . well recognized that summary judgment procedure is particularly inappropriate where the inferences which the parties seek to have drawn deal with questions of motive, intent and subjective feelings and reactions.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 646-47. The court, relying on <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 380, 260 A.2d 596 (1969), stated that the test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra, 647. Finally, the court concluded that the jurors would not have been compelled to believe the defendant\u2019s declarations about his motive in executing the deed to his wife. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In order to agree with the plaintiff\u2019s claim that <em>Batick </em>controls this case, we would be required to read it as holding that a summary judgment may never be rendered in a case involving intent. We decline to hold that the <em>Batick </em>decision cast such a wide net. <em>Batick </em>decided that under the circumstances of that case the absence of a counteraffidavit did not justify the granting of a summary judgment. The defendant knew at the time of the deed that the plaintiff was paralyzed, his spinal cord being severed, and that the defendant\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy was limited to $25,000. Id., 637. Further, \u201c[t]he rule is well established that evidence is admissible that a person after the happening of an accident, or the occurrence of some other event which might render him liable, disposed of his property, on the ground that such evidence tends to show a consciousness of liability and a purpose to evade satisfaction of it. 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 274, p. 322; see, e.g., <em>Poston v. Gaddis, </em>372 So. 2d 1099, 1102 (Ala. 1979); <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>552 P.2d 509 (Colo. 1976); <em>Portland Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Ruud, </em>242 Mass. 272, 136 N.E. 75 (1922); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Wright-Hennepin Cooperative Electric Assn., </em>281 Minn. 228, 161 N.W. 2d 294 (1968).\u201d <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>It is quite another matter to allege that a fellow employee intended to injure the plaintiff by pushing her to work beyond her doctor\u2019s restrictive orders for the reasons the plaintiff claims in this case. Here we are faced not with the narrow issue of the effect of the opponent of a summary judgment motion not filing an affidavit but with a case in which the documentation filed illuminates the issue involved and reveals the lack of a genuine issue of the material fact of intent when viewed in the circumstances of the case. \u201cSince these allegations require the plaintiff to undertake the difficult challenge of providing evidence, in advance of trial, of the mental state of the defendant ... we are willing to take into account whatever relevant information the plaintiff was able to provide. See <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>[supra, 645-46].\u201d <em>Conference Center Ltd. </em>v. <em>TRC, </em>189 Conn. 212, 217, 455 A.2d 857 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The claimed acts of all three individual defendants in and of themselves were neutral. They might just as reasonably have occurred in the normal process of production at the bakery. The plaintiff offered broader proof against Borkowski in the excerpts from her deposition contained in the record. An examination of her claims in the deposition clearly reveals the speculative basis of her testimony. She was asked by counsel why she thought that with Keith Briggs, a male, available to do work, Borkowski would nevertheless tell her to do it, knowing she was under work restrictions. She replied, \u201cMy opinion . . . he didn\u2019t want to upset Keith. . . . [A]s long as I was there . . . . A1 [Borkowski] knew his job was in jeopardy because at any time I could step in and take over his job. . . .\u201d When asked why Borkowski would want to give Briggs a raise she replied, \u201cI guess by getting rid of me Keith and A1 got their raises.\u201d When asked why Borkowski would care whether Briggs got a raise, she replied that they were best friends and that it was \u201cpossible\u201d she was in Briggs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>way. Such speculative evidence above cannot serve as a basis for opposition to a motion for summary judgment. \u201cViewed as a whole and in context, the [plaintiffs] testimony is too speculative, too conjectural, to be evidence of [intent].\u201d <em>Acampora </em>v. <em>Asselin, </em>179 Conn. 425, 427, 426 A.2d 797 (1980); see <em>Citizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Hubney, </em>182 Conn. 310, 312, 438 A.2d 430 (1980). \u201cThe bare assertions before the trial court would not have supported a judgment for the plaintiff and the summary judgment was, therefore, properly rendered.\u201d <em>Kakadelis </em>v. <em>DeFabritis, </em>191 Conn. 276, 281, 464 A.2d 57 (1983). The court did not err in granting the individual defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">As a result of the summary judgment for the three individual defendants the plaintiff\u2019s second count against the employer Pons Bakery, Inc., based as it must be on the \u201cwilful and malicious\u201d conduct of one or more of the three named employees, must also fail. We therefore do not reach the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s allegations and proffered proof are sufficient to satisfy the \u201calter ego\u201d exception to the exclusivity of the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation remedy, as set forth in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 219, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

I respectfully take issue with the result reached by the majority because it is contrary to the principles regarding summary judgment and to the case law discussed in the majority\u2019s opinion. It is clear from the opinion that the majority followed the erroneous logic of the trial court that resulted in an impermissible shift of the initial burden in a summary judgment motion to the nonmovant. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the trial court abused its discretion by deciding a material issue of fact contrary to its limited function when deciding a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The fundamental principles of summary judgment procedure, although noted in the decisions of the trial court and the majority, were ignored in the analyses of each court. It is the movant, here the defendants, that bears the initial, heavy burden of demonstrating by way of affidavits and other documentary proof, not only his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, but also the nonexistence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380, 384; <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984); <em>Kakadelis </em>v. <em>DeFabritis, </em>191 Conn. 276, 280-81, 464 A.2d 57 (1983). It is only after the movant has met this burden, that the opponent bears the burden of presenting facts which contradict those offered by the movant. <em>Citizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Hubney, </em>182 Conn. 310, 311, 438 A.2d 430 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The test for granting a motion for summary judgment is the same as in a directed verdict, which is viewing the evidence and the inferences therefrom <em>\u201cmost favorably to the nonmovant, </em>the trier of fact could not reach <em>any other conclusion </em>than that embodied in the verdict as directed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 380, 260 A.2d 596 (1969); see also <em>DHR Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). Most important, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court\u2019s limited function is not to decide issues of material fact, but rather only to determine whether any exist. <em>Telesco </em>v. <em>Telesco, </em>187 Conn. 715, 718, 447 A.2d 752 (1982); <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 647, 443 A.2d 471 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">After noting the general boiler plate language regarding summary judgment procedure, the trial court begins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>its analysis by indicating that the plaintiff employee\u2019s right to pursue common law remedies was limited by the adoption of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and to bypass the exclusivity provisions of the act the intentional or deliberate act or conduct alleged must have been designed to cause the injury that resulted. The trial court then makes reference to the affidavits and deposition transcript submitted by the plaintiff and acknowledges that these documents state conduct on the part of the defendants that show an intent to cause the injury which resulted. Then without indicating whether the defendants met either of their two burdens and without any analysis or legal reasoning, the trial court baldly concludes that the plaintiff failed to put the defendants\u2019 intent into dispute. It is clear that the trial court, in recognition of the limited scope of the \u201cwilful or malicious\u201d exception to the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a, and in recognition of the plaintiff\u2019s difficult burden of proof at trial, decided from the documents submitted by the plaintiff that she failed to prove that the defendants\u2019 conduct evidenced the requisite intent sufficient to come within the exception. The trial court thus erroneously decided the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s action rather than simply determining that no genuine issue of material fact existed. While the plaintiff may not be able to prevail at trial by a preponderance of the evidence, the affidavits she submitted along with her deposition transcript clearly contradict and put into issue the statements contained in the affidavits submitted by the defendants. Under such circumstances the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants. See <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 114, 491 A.2d 368 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">I also dissent from the conclusion of the majority and the trial court because of the well established principle of law that ordinarily summary judgment procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>is particularly inappropriate where, as here, the inferences which the parties seek to have drawn deal with questions of motive, intent and subjective feelings and reactions. <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra, 646-47; <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>supra, 376; see <em>White Motor Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>372 U.S. 253, 259, 83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963); <em>Poller </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 472-73, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962). Intent is clearly a question of fact that is ordinarily inferred from one\u2019s conduct or acts under the circumstances of the particular case. <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 216-17, 477 A.2d 988 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 355, 441 A.2d 98 (1981); <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Scalera, </em>181 Conn. 527, 530-31, 436 A.2d 18 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 466, 423 A.2d 18 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980); <em>Bergen </em>v. <em>Bergen, </em>177 Conn. 53, 57, 411 A.2d 22 (1979); <em>Heffeman </em>v. <em>New Britain Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>175 Conn. 8, 12, 392 A.2d 481 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The case at hand undoubtedly raises an issue of material fact regarding the defendants\u2019 intent to cause the injury to the plaintiff which must be inferred from the acts and conduct of the defendants coupled with their knowledge of the written orders of the plaintiff\u2019s doctor. The documents submitted by the plaintiff set forth specific acts of the defendants to demonstrate the defendants\u2019 intent. As the majority states, \u201c \u2018[a] wilful or malicious injury is one caused by design. . . . [I]ts characteristic element is the design to injure either actually entertained or to be implied from the conduct and circumstances.\u2019 [Citation omitted.] The intentional injury aspect may be satisfied if the resultant bodily harm was the direct and natural consequence of the intended act.\u201d Given the fact that the affidavits of the plaintiff directly contradict those of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>on this score, one could not reasonably conclude that the conflicting affidavits did not at least put the statements contained therein in dispute. Consequently, a genuine issue of material fact existed which the trial court resolved in favor of the defendants contrary to its limited function in deciding motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Additionally, in order to grant summary judgment here, the trial court must have been able to conclude that a trier of fact could not have reached any other conclusion. The conflicting affidavits alone regarding the defendants\u2019 intent mandates otherwise. Part of the majority\u2019s reasoning also indicates to the contrary. In response to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the acts of the defendants were intentionally designed to cause the injuries to her, the majority states that the acts of the defendants <em>\u201cmight </em>just as reasonably have occurred in the normal process of production at the bakery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clearly this indicates that it was reasonable to conclude either way.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Further, the only way in which the trial court or the majority could have concluded that the plaintiff failed to place the defendants\u2019 intent into issue was to discredit the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits and to credit the defendants.\u2019 Absent obvious misstatements within the affidavits, neither court should have judged the credibility of the respective affiants for \u201c \u2018[i]t is only when the witnesses are present and subject to cross-examination that their credibility and the weight to be given to their testimony can be appraised.\u2019 <em>Poller </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc., </em>supra, 473; <em>Fortner Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corporation, </em>394 U.S. 495, 500, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 [1969].\u201d <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Development Commission, </em>supra, 376. The majority clearly judged the credibility of the plaintiff because the majority dispelled as speculative her opinions regarding the defendants\u2019 possible motives for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>intending to cause her injuries. The true issue here is whether the acts and conduct of the defendants evidence the necessary intent and motive to cause the injuries that resulted to the plaintiff as required by \u00a7 31-293a. This court has recognized the inappropriateness of summary judgment with regard to matters, such as intent and motive, that are clearly within the exclusive knowledge of the defendants. <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra. In <em>Batick </em>this court reversed the entry of a summary judgment for a defendant where the plaintiff submitted no affidavits in opposition to the motion because of the virtual impossibility of demonstrating the intent or motives of another in an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court and order \u2018the matter remanded for a trial on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
