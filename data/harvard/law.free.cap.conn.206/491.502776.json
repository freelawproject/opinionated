Hughes, instituted a negligence action against these same defendants, John S. Bemer and Nancy L. Bemer, arising out of an automobile acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>dent. The defendants moved to strike the complaint for its failure to state a cause of action. Practice Book \u00a7 152 (1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>took up the questions presented and filed a memorandum of decision granting the motion to strike. The plaintiffs did not file a substitute pleading and upon motion, the court, <em>Ripley, J., </em>rendered judgment for the defendants. Practice Book \u00a7 157.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>200 Conn. 400, 510 A.2d 992 (1986), we observed that in connection with the motion to strike, the plaintiffs had failed to submit to the trial court the opposing memorandum of law required by Practice Book \u00a7 155. This being the case, the plaintiffs, as the adverse party, were deemed, by operation of the rules, \u201cto have consented to the granting of the motion.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 155; see footnote 2, supra. We concluded that, under such circumstances, Practice Book \u00a7 155 inferentially required the court to grant the motion to strike. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>supra, 402-403. We therefore found no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Within the one year period required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-592, the plaintiffs commenced the present action setting forth the identical allegations contained in their original complaint. They added, however, allegations that the earlier action had been \u201cdismissed without a hearing on the merits\u201d and that the Supreme Court had upheld the dismissal \u201cwithout going to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>merits.\u201d Finally, they claimed that their action was \u201cbrought pursuant to Section 52-592 of the C.G.S.A. and in accordance with <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 28, 34 [474 A.2d 787 (1984)].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss the new complaint, alleging that the court was \u201cwithout jurisdiction over the subject matter in that General Statute Section 52-592 is inapplicable where the prior action was heard on the merits.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>granted the motion. The plaintiffs have again appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The plaintiffs concede that the judgment of the trial court in the first case was on the merits. \u201cSince the decision on the . . . [motion to strike] determined that no right of action existed, the judgment [following a failure to plead over] was as final and complete as a judgment following a trial on the merits. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Berlin Iron Bridge Co., </em>71 Conn. 479, 490, 42 A. 625 [1899].\u201d <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>152 Conn. 697, 699, 204 A.2d 409 (1964). The plaintiffs argue, however, that our subsequent action in affirming the appeal on the basis of the operation of Practice Book \u00a7 155 was not a decision on the merits and that, therefore, they are entitled to reinstitute the action pursuant to \u00a7 52-592. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Section 52-592 does not authorize the reinitiation of all actions not \u201ctried on . . . [their] merits,\u201d only those that have failed for, among other reasons, \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>matter of form.\u201d An order that enters pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 155 is not a matter of form. The failure to file the required memorandum of law operates as a <em>consent </em>to the granting of the motion to strike. The judgment that may thereafter enter, though not necessarily a determination on the merits, is nevertheless a final judgment whose issues are thereafter res judicata as between the parties. <em>\u201cA </em>judgment by consent is in effect an admission by the parties that the decree is a just determination of their rights on the real facts of the case had they been found. It is ordinarily absolutely conclusive between the parties and cannot be appealed from or reviewed on a writ of error.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. Spelke, 110 Conn. 208, 215, 147 A. 675 (1929). We conclude, therefore, that the matter here, although concededly not decided on its merits on appeal, has not failed \u201cfor any matter of form\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-592. \u201c \u2018This statute [\u00a7 52-592] was passed to avoid the hardships arising from an unbending enforcement of limitation statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Surkis, </em>163 Conn. 388, 392, 311 A.2d 74 (1972). We discern no intent to create an exception to the principles of res judicata that require, at some point, an end to litigation. <em>Stocking </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 70, 73, 238 A.2d 421 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 52-592. accidental failure of suit; allowance of new action, (a) If any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated by the death of a party or for any matter of form; or if, in any such action after a verdict for the plaintiff, the judgment has been set aside, or if a judgment of nonsuit has been rendered or a judgment for the plaintiff reversed, the plaintiff, or, if the plaintiff is dead and the action by law survives, his executor or administrator, may commence a new action, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action or after the reversal of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 155 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an adverse party objects to this motion he shall, at least five days before the date the motion is to be considered on the short calendar, file and serve ... a memorandum of law.

We stated: \u201cWe note that the plaintiff is not without remedy and, inter alia, may commence a new action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 . . . .\u201d Id., 34 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> Since neither party has raised the question, we decline to address the propriety of a motion to dismiss the second complaint on jurisdictional grounds when the heart of the matter seems to be whether the earlier action was res judicata as to the present proceedings.
