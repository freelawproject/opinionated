Townsend, appeals from his conviction, after a trial by jury, of the crime of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-133<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 53a-134 (a) (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a consequence of this conviction, the defendant pled guilty to the charge of being a persistent dangerous felony offender under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no reversible error in the defendant\u2019s robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of August 14, 1985, the defendant entered a Windsor convenience store. Brandishing a gun, he forced a clerk to open the store\u2019s cash drawer, whose contents he appropriated, and to hand over bags of money kept under the store counter. Some days later, the defendant returned to the store at a time when the clerk was there with another employee. The clerk told her fellow worker that the defendant was the person who had robbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, the state offered only two witnesses. The clerk testified about the circumstances of the crime and made an in-court identification of the defendant as the person who had committed the robbery. Over objection by the defendant, Windsor police detective John Parlapiano, Jr., testified that he had shown the clerk eight color photographs from which she had selected that of the defendant as depicting the man who had robbed her. The defendant neither testified nor put on any other testimony in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The trial court denied motions of acquittal filed by the defendant both at the end of the state\u2019s case and after the jury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of robbery as charged. On appeal, the defendant alleges that the trial court erred: (1) in permitting Parlapiano\u2019s testimony concerning the clerk\u2019s out-of-court photographic identification of the defendant; (2) in instructing the jury about the defendant\u2019s failure to testify; and (3) in instructing the jury about the charge of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The defendant\u2019s challenge to Parlapiano\u2019s testimony concerning the clerk\u2019s out-of-court photographic identification of the defendant cannot be sustained in light of our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 533 A.2d 545 (1987). There, as here, the victim of a crime made an in-court identification that was corroborated by a police officer\u2019s testimony of an out-of-court identification consisting of the victim\u2019s selection of the defendant\u2019s picture from a photo array. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5, 11, 505 A.2d 685 (1986), and State v. <em>Frost, </em>105 Conn. 326, 341, 135 A. 446 (1926), we held that such testimony comes within an exception to the hearsay rule for testimony thatis reliable and can be tested by cross-examination of the relevant witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>supra, 274. There, as here, \u201c[t]he defendant has not challenged the underlying reliability of the victim\u2019s out-of-court identifications and had ample opportunity to cross-examine both the victim and [the police officer].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The defendant next contests the propriety of the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. In such circumstances, General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) requires a court, in the absence of a contrary request by the accused, to instruct the jury \u201cthat they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead of using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>statutory language verbatim, the trial court charged the jury: \u201cI would warn you at this time that you can draw no inference, which means you cannot discuss or otherwise consider his reasons for not testifying.\u201d The defendant maintains that this instruction is fatally defective because the jury might have understood it as prohibiting only group discussion without forbidding any juror\u2019s private consideration of the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. The state, while conceding that the court\u2019s departure from the literal mandate of \u00a7 54-84 (b) was erroneous, urges us to hold the court\u2019s phraseology to be a minor and harmless deviation that does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">At the outset, we note that we have repeatedly held that a claim of trial court noncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) is reviewable on appeal even though a defendant, as in this case, did not at trial except to the charge as given. The statute \u201cserves to effectuate the fundamental constitutional right of a defendant not to testify in his criminal trial\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 582, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); and it is \u201cplain error for a trial judge not to comply with [its] mandate.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>194 Conn. 594, 595-96, 483 A.2d 1087 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Judicial noncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) does not, however, automatically warrant a reversal and a new trial. We must decide, on a case by case basis, whether a trial court\u2019s failure fully to comply with the statute was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 324-25, 507 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>A.2d 457 (1986). Because such an error is of constitutional dimension, \u201c[t]he applicable test requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, from the viewpoint of the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 584; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra, 325; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 599. In the present context, the state must show that the charge as given conveyed to the jury the substantive meaning of the statutory requirement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 443, 489 A.2d 350 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Examining the charge in this case from this perspective, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s minor deviation from the literal wording of \u00a7 54-84 (b) was harmless error. We are persuaded that it was not reasonably possible that the jury would have understood the court to be permitting any inferences whatsoever to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. If there was any latent ambiguity in the instruction forbidding either group discussion or individual consideration of the reasons for the defendant\u2019s not testifying, that ambiguity was dispelled by the very next sentence in the court\u2019s instructions, which reminded the jury: \u201cYour determination must be made solely on the basis of whether or not the State has sustained its burden of proof, as previously discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error relates to the trial court\u2019s charge on larceny. Because robbery is the commission of larceny by force, the trial court was required to define the meaning of larceny for the jury. In so doing, the court read the statutory definition of larceny in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119, without excising those parts that had no factual relevance to the present trial. The court thus instructed the jury that \u201c[a] person commits larceny, when with intent to deprive another of property, or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains, or withholds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>such property from an owner,\u201d even though there was no evidence of the involvement of a third person and only circumstantial evidence, if any, of the withholding of property. The defendant did not take an exception to this charge at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We have repeatedly disapproved of a trial court\u2019s reading of an entire statute when the defendant has been formally charged under less than the statute as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 493, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 645, 458 A.2d 379 (1983). In this case, however, the information did not specify those aspects of the underlying charge of larceny on which the state was relying. The defendant has pointed to no prejudice attributable to the court\u2019s over-inclusive instruction, which did not adversely implicate a specific element of the crime with which he was charged. It is, therefore, doubtful that the alleged error in this case is reviewable when it was not raised at trial. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 362-64, 521 A.2d 150 (1987), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Even if this claim of error is properly here, it cannot be sustained on its merits. After its reading of the larceny statute, the trial court limited its applicability to the facts before the jury. The jury was told: \u201cSo what the state has to prove [is] basically . . . three elements: that there was a larceny by force, and there was testimony by the complaining witness . . . that there was a taking of money from the register by the robber, the person who committed the crime, and the taking of money would fit within the description of a larceny, if you find that she had a superior right to it over the person who took it.\u201d Viewing this charge as a whole, we conclude there was no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled into mistaking the issues that it was to resolve. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 416, 518 A.2d 35 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 provides: \u201crobbery defined.
