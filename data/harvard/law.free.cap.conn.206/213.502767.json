We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The jury could reasonably have found that on the morning of May 6,1983, police responded to a call and discovered two men who had been shot to death in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Bridgeport apartment. A third victim, Roberto Marin, had survived the shooting and had been taken to the hospital before the police arrived. Police observed a car speeding away from the area of the crimes and, between 9:30 and 10 that morning, brought the driver, Jose \u201cWilly\u201d Rivera, to the police station. Rivera wore a T-shirt which bore \u201csprinkles\u201d of blood, but, in an interview with detectives, he denied any knowledge of the shootings. Rivera gave the T-shirt to the police for laboratory testing of the stains.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Later that morning, a detective interviewed Marin at the hospital. Marin declared that while Rivera had been present at the attack, it was \u201cIran\u201d who had shot him and the two other victims. The detectives then interviewed Rivera again. During this second meeting, Rivera admitted having been present during the shootings and identified \u201cIran\u201d as the nickname of the defendant, Hector Gonzalez. Rivera stated further that \u201cIran\u201d had done all the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On the basis of this information, Bridgeport police located and arrested the defendant later that day. The police read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights in English during the ride to the police station. Upon arrival, Inspector Anthony Fabrizi advised the defendant of his rights in Spanish. After inquiring whether the defendant had understood his rights, and receiving an affirmative response, Fabrizi asked the defendant in Spanish and in English whether he would be willing to make a statement concerning the circumstances surrounding the shootings. The defendant admitted one of the shootings and then related his version of the events in English that the police understood without difficulty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>defendant claimed that a third person, whom he identified as the \u201cCuban man,\u201d shot the two victims following a robbery in the victims\u2019 apartment. The \u201cCuban man\u201d then tossed the gun to the defendant, who then shot Marin accidentally. Upon Fabrizi\u2019s request, the defendant agreed to give a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Lieutenant Frank Nerkowski obtained the defendant\u2019s written statement with the assistance of a fellow Bridgeport employee who translated. After Nerkowski readvised the defendant of each <em>Miranda </em>right, his colleague translated the right into Spanish and asked the defendant if he understood the right. The defendant indicated each time that he did. The defendant then gave his statement concerning the shootings and Nerkowski typed the statement as the defendant spoke. The translator read the statement to the defendant, who then signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in denying, after a hearing, his motion to suppress his oral and written statements given to the police after his arrest. The defendant alleges that he was unable to execute a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and that his incriminating statements were made involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The defendant concedes that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were explained to him in the police car at the time of his arrest and again after arrival at the police station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>before any of his statements were made. He claims, however, that he was intellectually incapable of understanding, and consequently, of waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant bases this claim on (1) his limited facility with the English language, and (2) results of psychological testing that characterized him as falling within the \u201cdull normal\u201d range of intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Where, as here, a defendant claims that his statement was \u201cobtained in violation of our <em>Miranda </em>doctrine, the [s]tate need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 168, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pecoraro, </em>198 Conn. 203, 208, 502 A.2d 396 (1985). To be valid, a waiver must be voluntary, knowing and intelligent. \u201cWhether a purported waiver satisfies these requirements is a question of fact in which the circumstances of the particular case, including the record of the defendant\u2019s conduct in police custody, should be considered.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 743, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In support of his argument that he was intellectually incapable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant presented testimony from a clinical psychologist for the city of Hartford, a graduate student in Spanish who was a teaching associate, and a physician specializing in neurology and psychiatry. The psychologist testified as to intelligence testing she had performed on the defendant that indicated that he had \u201clow\u201d comprehension of verbal material. The physician testified as to neurological and psychiatric findings he had made after examining the defendant. He stated that his \u201cmajor finding\u201d on the neurologic examination was the defendant\u2019s reduced ability to perceive pin prick and vibration sensations on the right side of his body, which indicated damage to the left hemisphere of his brain. On the basis of the results of his psychiatric examination, the phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>sician found the defendant to have a thought disorder characterized by too many thoughts at one time and \u201cthoughts which go too fast,\u201d accompanied by an inability to deal effectively with stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the expert testimony was not necessarily determinative of the defendant\u2019s ability to execute a knowing and intelligent waiver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 744. Examination of the record convinces us that the trial court\u2019s finding of a valid waiver is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 451, 534 A.2d 219 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 219, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982). The defendant conceded \u201cthat he had been read, and had acknowledged his understanding of, his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 48, 50, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987). Although the defendant spoke clear and understandable English, the police, out of an abundance of caution, advised him of his constitutional rights in both English and Spanish. During the translation of the rights form into Spanish, the translator paused after reading each right and asked the defendant whether he had understood. The defendant indicated in each instance that he had, and he then placed his initials on the form next to the right that had just been read to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>him. After translating all the rights on the rights form, including her translation that \u201che\u2019s been advised of all his rights and that he fully understands his rights, and that he\u2019s waiving his rights freely and voluntarily with no fear and no promises,\u201d the translator told the defendant that if he agreed with the document, he could sign it. The defendant then signed the rights form that had been read to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u201cThe question [of valid waiver] is not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra. The defendant contends that the Bridgeport police committed reversible error in obtaining his signature on a \u201cNotice of Rights,\u201d rather than a \u201cWaiver of Rights\u201d form. We reject this argument as one that elevates form over substance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 269, 533 A.2d 545 (1987). After having been advised of all the <em>Miranda </em>rights, including the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right not to be questioned without consent, the defendant was asked whether he would be willing to make a statement to police about the crimes with which he was being charged. He responded by narrating his version of the events in question. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s expressed willingness to speak constituted an explicit affirmative act evidencing waiver, which the court could reasonably find persuasive despite the defendant\u2019s [failure] to sign [a] waiver form.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 580, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On the issue of the language used during the translation of the <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver, the defendant presented the expert testimony of the graduate student in Spanish who was a teaching associate. She testified that the translator erroneously had used the Spanish word for \u201cexercising\u201d (\u201cejerciendo\u201d) instead of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>word for \u201cwaiving\u201d (\u201crenunciando\u201d) in the translation. Her testimony, in essence, was that the defendant might reasonably have understood the translation as \u201cI am <em>exercising </em>my rights\u201d rather than \u201cI am <em>waiving </em>my rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The expert graduate student\u2019s testimony regarding the translation was compromised in two significant respects. First, there was no recording, either on tape or by transcription, of the actual translation at the time the translator made it. The translator testified at the suppression hearing sixteen months <em>after </em>the event in question as to her recollection of what she <em>thought </em>she would have said. It was this recollection, then, rather than the actual translation, that formed the basis of the defense witness\u2019 criticism. Second, the psychologist testified that \u201cejerciendo\u201d is a difficult Spanish word and that it was unlikely that the defendant would have understood its meaning. Thus, even if the translator\u2019s recollection had been accurate and the defense witness correctly described an error in the translation, the error might reasonably have been found to have had no impact, because the more sophisticated word was beyond the defendant\u2019s understanding. On the whole record, coupled with the fact that the defendant had a working understanding of English, as evidenced by his conversations with the police, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that the defendant was competent to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights knowingly and intelligently. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendant also claims that his oral and written statements to police on May 6, 1983, the day of his arrest, along with a further oral statement given at the Bridgeport jail on June 30, 1983, should not have been admitted because they were made involuntarily. The factual context of the defendant\u2019s May 6, 1983 statements has been previously recited and requires no repe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tition at this juncture. As to those statements, we are satisfied that they were the \u201c \u2018product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973), quoting <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961). We find no evidence in the record that the statements in issue were involuntary or that their admission offends due process; see <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 166-67; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeForge, </em>194 Conn. 392, 397-98, 480 A.2d 547 (1984); and we therefore hold that it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to admit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The defendant further claims that the trial court should have suppressed as involuntary his statement to Detective Leo Krusinski at the Bridgeport jail. The record discloses that on June 30, 1983, the defendant telephoned the Bridgeport detective bureau, requesting to speak with Krusinski. In response, Krusinski went to the Bridgeport correctional center and met the defendant in a holding area. The detective asked the defendant why he wanted to speak to him. The defendant recounted to Krusinski his version of the shooting, i.e., that the \u201cCuban man\u201d had killed the two victims and then had thrown the gun to the defendant. See footnote 4, supra. He then gave Krusinski the names of two men who he claimed had witnessed the shootings. Both Krusinski and the defendant spoke only in English at this meeting. Although Krusinski knew that the defendant had been arraigned and had retained a lawyer, he did not advise the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u201c \u2018The [traditional] test of voluntariness is whether an examination of all the circumstances shows that the conduct of police was such as to overbear the defendant\u2019s will to resist and bring about a confession, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>freely self-determined.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>195 Conn. 505, 516, 488 A.2d 1256 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>DeForge, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The defendant concedes that there were no police threats or coercion and that, therefore, his federal constitutional claim of involuntariness is now foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 163-64. In that case, the court required \u201cpolice overreaching\u2019\u2019 as the \u201ccrucial element\u201d in any inquiry into \u201cconstitutional \u2018voluntariness.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The defendant requests, however, that this court review his challenge to the admissibility of the statements based solely upon factors other than police coercion. The defendant claims that, under the broader protections afforded him by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it was error for the trial court to admit these statements. The defendant contends that this article of the Connecticut constitution requires us to consider his limited intelligence and education, his brain damage, his inability to deal effectively with stress, and his continued incarceration, in determining whether these statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This court has not had occasion to decide whether, in light of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, a claim of involuntariness in the absence of any allegations of police overreaching may be successfully pursued under our state constitution. Because \u201c[w]e find no persuasive evidence of involuntariness on the present record\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 452; we do not decide whether statements characterized as involuntary by reason of their being motivated by factors <em>other </em>than police coercion, are inadmissible under our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201c \u2018On appeal, in order to determine whether the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have been infringed, we review the record in its entirety . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>[198 Conn. 573, 576, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 729, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). Our examination of the facts in this record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that his psychological characteristics deprived him of his ability to make a free and rational choice to speak with the police. See footnote 5, supra. Nor is, as the defendant asserts, his continued incarceration from the time of his arrest in and of itself enough to render his statement to Krusinski involuntary. See <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 226; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>309 U.S. 227, 60 S. Ct. 472, 84 L. Ed. 716 (1940); <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 584. Further, the defendant, rather than the police, requested the June 30,1983 contact. Although defense counsel, at the hearing on the motion to suppress, sought to characterize the meeting as an \u201cinterrogation,\u201d Krusinski maintained throughout his testimony that the conversation was merely an \u201cinterview.\u201d No matter how the meeting is characterized, if the defendant\u2019s responses to questions were made voluntarily, no error occurs in admitting the responses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeForge, </em>supra. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we believe that the trial court\u2019s ruling on voluntariness is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra, 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on the loss or destruction of physical evidence and in refusing to instruct the jury on adverse inferences they would be permitted to draw if they found that the loss or destruction had been intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The T-shirt worn by Jose \u201cWilly\u201d Rivera and the clothing removed from the victims were examined by the state toxicological laboratory. The laboratory tests revealed that the blood stains found on the T-shirt and the clothing had been made by type O human blood. Both victims had type O blood. The state laboratory returned the T-shirt and the victims\u2019 clothing to the Bridgeport police department on December 19, 1983. They were never seen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendant claimed at trial that the loss or destruction of this clothing, particularly the T-shirt, so impaired his right to a fair trial that it should serve as the basis for dismissal. To establish the prejudice caused to him by the unavailability of the T-shirt, he called a bloodstain-pattern analyst to testify. The expert testified that with physical observation of the stains on the T-shirt he might have been able to determine the distance between Rivera and the victims. He testified further that he could possibly have determined whether the spots of blood were \u201cback spatter,\u201d which may have tended to show that Rivera was not, as he claimed, an inactive participant. Throughout the trial, the defendant sought to show that the loss or destruction of the evidence was an intentional act on the part of the Bridgeport police motivated by the weakness of their case and the desire to destroy potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201c \u2018In considering whether testimony concerning lost or destroyed evidence should be admitted [or the underlying prosecution dismissed], the trial court has to look to numerous factors including [1] the reason for the unavailability of the evidence, [2] the materiality of the evidence, [3] the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of it by witnesses or the jury, and [4] the prejudice to the defendant caused by the unavailability of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>dence.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>188 Conn. 372, 381, 449 A.2d 1020 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 229, 506 A.2d 125 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">As to the first factor, the trial court found that while the police department was certainly negligent in failing to preserve the evidence, there was no evidence of deliberate and intentional destruction. Second, while the court found that the evidence, consisting of the bloodstained clothing of the victims and a witness, was of such a nature as to be material to the case, it was not so related to the commission of the murders as to warrant a dismissal. The third factor, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation, was minimized by the trial court\u2019s adverse inference instruction on the missing evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>supra, 382 n.5. Moreover, the court allowed extensive testimony on this issue and the defendant was permitted to develop fully through his examination of the witnesses the negative implications to be imputed to the state\u2019s case by the absence of this evidence. Finally, the prejudice to the defendant was not substantial. The additional evidence that might have been obtained from further examining or testing of the T-shirt could only have served to inculpate Rivera, the eyewitness, who claimed to have observed the shootings from the doorway. Such evidence could have been significant had either the defendant or Marin, the surviving victim, claimed that Rivera was the assailant. The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim through<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>out, however, was not that Rivera had committed the murders but that the \u201cCuban man\u201d was the killer. Marin, on the other hand, implicated the defendant. Since neither eyewitness claimed that Rivera was the assailant, the patterns of the stains on his T-shirt did not have substantial materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On the record before us, then, we agree with the trial court that granting the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal under these circumstances would have been too harsh a sanction, and that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was protected by allowing full development and presentation of the missing evidence issue at trial and by the court\u2019s adverse inference instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant also claims error in the trial court\u2019s failure to charge, as requested, on adverse inferences the jury would be permitted to draw if they found that the loss or destruction of the evidence had been intentional. The defendant sought an instruction to the effect that the destruction had been deliberate, as the evidence tended to weaken the state\u2019s case. The court found, however, that there was no factual basis for a conclusion that the loss or destruction had been intentional or deliberate. It was within the trial court\u2019s discretion, therefore, to modify the adverse inference instruction requested. See footnote 7, supra. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vennard, </em>159 Conn. 385, 399, 270 A.2d 837 (1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011, 91 S. Ct. 576, 27 L. Ed. 2d 625 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights of due process when it charged the jury concerning circumstantial evidence. The trial court instructed that an inference must be not only logical and reasonable, but strong enough so that the jury could find \u201cit is <em>more </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>probable than not </em>that the fact inferred is true.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We have examined similar language concerning the drawing of inferences on numerous recent occasions and have found such language to be erroneous because it has a high probability of misleading the jury on the important issue of the burden of proof imposed on the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>205 Conn. 352, 533 A.2d 857 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 502 A.2d 360 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986). The ultimate issue that we must resolve upon review is whether the instruction has made it \u201creasonably possible that the jury was misled by the alleged errors in the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 132. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s instructions [therefore] must be read with reference to the factual issues in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 491, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The central factual issues in this case were the identity of the assailant and the circumstances surrounding this bizarre crime. Two eyewitnesses testified that the defendant was the lone attacker. The defendant claimed that a third person, the \u201cCuban man,\u201d had killed two of the victims and had thereafter thrown the gun to him, Gonzalez, who then had shot Marin inadvertently. The ultimate factual issue, therefore, was the credibility of the conflicting testimony of the three witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cA significant factor for the jury\u2019s consideration was the credibility to be accorded to the [other eyewitnesses as opposed] to the defendant. The principal factual issues, therefore, were not classically dependent upon circumstantial evidence for their proof . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>\u201cWe </em>have recognized that an erroneous charge is not always harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 489-92. An isolated error in an instruction may be cured by other portions of the charge, or circumstantial evidence may be so insignificant compared to direct evidence that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous instruction did not affect a jury\u2019s determination of guilt or innocence. Id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 356. Our task is not to evaluate the challenged portion of the instructions in \u201cisolation from the overall charge,\u201d nor to conduct \u201ca microscopic search for possible error,\u201d but to review the charge as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Reviewing the instructions as a whole within the context of the factual posture of this case, we find that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled concerning the state\u2019s burden of proof. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 356-62; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 490-91; <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>7 Conn. App. 149, 155, 508 A.2d 49, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 512 A.2d 229 (1986). The trial court reiterated no less than sixty-eight times the state\u2019s burden of proving every element of each crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The contested portion of the charge occurred but once.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">.

Three men who had been waiting for them pushed the defendant and the Cuban man into the apartment. One of the men held the Cuban man, one man held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a knife to the defendant\u2019s throat, and the third man robbed the defendant of $205 from his wallet and his jewelry. The Cuban man then took a gun from the attache case he was carrying and shot two of the men dead, and then handed the gun to the defendant, telling him to \u201cdefend [him]self.\u201d The defendant concluded this recital of the events by declaring: \u201cI got nervous because I didn\u2019t want to do it but the gun went off accidentally and I shot the man.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> We note that the intelligence levels ascribed to the defendant by his own expert witnesses were not inconsistent with those found to permit a finding of a valid waiver in other cases.

And that this T-shirt is lost and is not available as evidence. There is a principle of law that where evidence is within the sole power of one party to present or when one party has supervision or sole access to such evidence and that evidence is not produced, the other party, in this case the defendant, is entitled to an inference that [that] evidence would have favored the defense and would have been unfavorable to the State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> In the charge complained of, the trial court instructed the jury: \u201cYou may apply the rule of circumstantial evidence.

Such an inference may be made provided two elements in the application of the rule are satisfied. First, the fact from which you are to draw the inference has itself been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Secondly, the inference has [sic] to be drawn is not only logical and reasonable, but is strong enough so that you can find that it is more probable than not that the fact inferred is true.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
