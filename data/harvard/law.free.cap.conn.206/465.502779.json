We conclude that these claims are without merit and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Examination of the record discloses that on March 7, 1981, the New Britain board of police commissioners disciplined Louis Marino following hearings into allegations that municipal personnel examinations for the positions of police sergeant and police lieutenant had been fixed so that Marino would achieve high scores. The matter ultimately came before a panel of the state board of mediation and arbitration<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which conducted eight hearings between September 29, 1982, and April 26, 1985. Since the parties could not agree as to the issue, the panel adopted the plaintiffs proposal, i.e., \u201cWas Louis Marino disciplined for just cause? If not, what shall be the remedy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">On December 11,1985, the panel filed its arbitration award in which it concluded that \u201cLouis Marino was disciplined for just cause.\u201d On January 2, 1986, the plaintiffs applied to the Superior Court for orders vacating the award and directing a rehearing. On June 20, 1986, the court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application and granted the named defendant\u2019s cross application to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"AaYf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim is that the court should have vacated the arbitration award because it was untimely-filed, being 229 days after the last hearing and 133 days after the time allowed by the board for the submission of briefs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that it was, therefore, outside of the fifteen day filing period set forth in \u00a7 31-98; see footnote 2, supra; dealing with arbitration decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We have previously concluded that the time limitation in this statute\u2019s predecessor<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was directory and not mandatory. See <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>138 Conn. 57, 67, 82 A.2d 345 (1951). We have also held that \u201c[i]n the absence of a mandatory time limitation [in either the collective bargaining agreement or the submission to the arbitrators], an award of arbitrators may be made within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local </em>402, 145 Conn. 53, 59, 138 A.2d 783 (1958); see also <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Police Local, No. </em>1361, 187 Conn. 228, 231-32, 445 A.2d 322 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We do not have to reach those issues in the present case, however, because the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to raise the issue of timeliness prior to the issuance of the arbitration award operates as a waiver of their right to assert the lack of timeliness in the board\u2019s decision. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>record discloses that the only challenge to timeliness is contained in the post-decision application to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201cCourts favor arbitration as a means of settling differences . . . .\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 290, 377 A.2d 323 (1977). \u201c[I]ts autonomy requires a minimum of judicial intrusion.\u201d <em>Bic Pen Corporation </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>183 Conn. 579, 583, 440 A.2d 774 (1981). \u201cIn view of the slow pace of the proceedings up to the time the hearings were concluded, and <em>the failure of either party to object or claim prejudice because of it, </em>the court\u2019s conclusion was not erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>supra, 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the arbitration panel did not conduct a \u201cde novo hearing\u201d as required by \u00a7 31-97.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The specific objection raised is that the panel weighed and considered, among other submissions, the complete transcript of the hearings before the New Britain board of police commissioners. The plaintiffs argue that, by accepting the transcript, the panel failed to conduct an independent inquiry but rather carried out a record inquiry contrary to the statutory mandate. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The statutory mandate of \u00a7 31-97 is general in nature and calls for the panel to \u201cfully investigate and inquire into the matters in controversy, take testimony . . . in relation thereto and . . . issue subpoenas . . . <em>for the production of books and papers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See footnote 7, supra. Further, \u00a7 31-91-37 (a) and (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provide in relevant part that \u201c[c]onformity to legal rules of evidence shall not be necessary. . . . <em>Documents, records and other pertinent data, when offered by either party, may be received in evidence by the panel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Receipt of the challenged transcripts is thus , clearly authorized by the agency regulations, which we may presume to be an accurate reflection of the legislative intent articulated in the statute\u2019s more general language. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599-600, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). Within the confines of the limited review to be accorded an arbitration award,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the presumption in favor of the award\u2019s validity, we are satisfied that the panel did not err in reviewing the transcripts of the hearings conducted before the board of police commissioners. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local </em>308, 171 Conn. 420, 431, 370 A.2d 996 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The plaintiffs next claim that the arbitration panel violated the terms of its own interlocutory ruling. As already explained, the plaintiffs objected to the introduction into evidence, at the arbitration hearing, of the transcript of the earlier proceedings before the board of police commissioners. They especially objected to those portions of the transcript that sought to implicate Marino in the fixing of the sergeant\u2019s examination, as the police commissioners had concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>as to this issue, \u201cthe evidence as to whether he had knowledge of the fixing is inconclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In response to this objection, the arbitration panel issued an interlocutory ruling concluding that the testimony pertaining to Marino\u2019s knowledge \u201cmust be excised from the transcript.\u201d Despite this holding, the final arbitration award made reference to the testimony of Paul Manafort and Sebastian Bianca, both of whom had testified on this very issue. The plaintiffs claim that Marino\u2019s rights were thus prejudiced in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3). See footnote 8, supra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Witnesses Manafort and Bianca testified on both the issue of examination fixing and the issue of Marino\u2019s knowledge of the fixing. By their very nature, the two questions were significantly interrelated. The arbitration award specifically stated that the panel had excised the challenged material and had made a distinction in evaluating the testimony, having accepted the former while excising the latter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record or the award that suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Further, even if this allegation is assumed to be correct, the plaintiffs do not show how this fact prejudiced Marino. The arbitration award stated that Marino \u201creceived a promotion to which he was not entitled.\u201d It further stated: \u201cThis Panel, or at least a majority thereof, is also of the conviction that no one should benefit from a fixed examination, <em>whether he is aware of it or not. </em>Therefore, it seems the action taken by the Board [of police commissioners] . . . was most reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>examination was fixed emerges as the panel\u2019s paramount consideration, rather than the matter of Marino\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u201cIt is the established policy of the courts to regard awards with liberality. Every reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the award and of the arbitrators\u2019 acts and proceedings. Hence, the burden rests on the party attacking the award to produce evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it.\u2019 <em>Von </em>Langendorff v. <em>Riordan, </em>147 Conn. 524, 527, 163 A.2d 100 [1960].\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 308, </em>supra, 431. The plaintiffs have not met that burden and the trial court did not err in concluding as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the arbitration panel considered evidence not formally introduced at one of the hearings. Specifically, they object to the panel\u2019s consideration of a study commissioned by the city of New Britain and entitled \u201cReport on Merit System Abuses and Remedial Action Taken\u201d that was appended to the city\u2019s post-hearing brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We are again confronted with an issue that was never raised until the post-decision application to vacate the award. The board\u2019s regulations not only authorized the reopening of hearings to receive and consider new evidence,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but also provided a specific mechanism for formal, post-hearing communications with the panel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Having used neither of these procedures, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that there was a waiver of the right to challenge the arbitration panel\u2019s consideration of this material. <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>supra, 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\"> In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 application to vacate the award; General Statutes \u00a7 52-418; the named defendant filed a cross application to confirm the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-98 provides in part: \u201coral or written decision.
