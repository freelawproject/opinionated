Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9d\">The plaintiff, Frito-Lay, Inc. (Frito-Lay), appealed to the Superior Court from the denial of its application for a special permit and site plan approval (application) by the named defendant, planning and zoning commission of the town of Killingly (commission).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although that court found Frito-Lay to be aggrieved, it dismissed its appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Court granted Frito-Lay\u2019s petition for certification and, thereafter, this court transferred the appeal to itself. Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Initially, certain relevant circumstances, augmented later in this opinion, are appropriately set out at this point. Frito-Lay is, and has been at all times relevant, the record owner of real estate in Killingly, upon which is situated a food processing facility and office. These premises are located in an industrial district as defined in the Killingly zoning regulations (regulations). After some discussions with Killingly town officials, Frito-Lay filed an application for a special permit on November 26, 1984, which was later supplemented by a site plan. This application explicitly proposed \u201cnew construction\u201d of a wood chip burning electric \u201cco-generation plant\u201d and this proposed facility included, inter alia, a boiler, generator, silo and chimney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The commission formally accepted Frito-Lay\u2019s application at its regular meeting of December 10, 1984. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (c). Thereafter, a public hearing was set by the commission for January 14, 1985. This public hearing was duly noticed and held on January 14, 1985. At that hearing, the commission heard testimony, received other evidence and heard oral argument for and against the application. The chairman of the commission specifically declared the public hearing closed at the end of the meeting of January 14, 1985. At that time, Frito-Lay\u2019s application was tabled to the commission\u2019s next regular meeting on February 11, 1985, pending the receipt of certain information required by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">At its regular meeting of February 11, 1985, the commission, during its \u201cCitiz\u00e9ns\u2019 Participation\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> item on its agenda, heard comments on the Frito-Lay application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found that \u201cfourteen citizens voiced opinions during the course of the meeting on the plaintiff\u2019s application.\u201d A close examination of the transcript of the remarks made during the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d portion discloses that most of those speakers did not view the application with favor. Richard Cunneen, who later intervened and ultimately became a party defendant, was one of the citizens who spoke. After this portion of the meeting was over , commission chair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>man Vincent Baiocchetti addressed William Walker, Frito-Lay\u2019s plant engineer who was present, and told Walker that he had some questions to ask him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Walker responded not only to the chairman\u2019s question, but also to a large number of questions from other members of the commission. At the end of this meeting, the commission voted unanimously to table the application until its next meeting on March. 11, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">At the outset of the meeting of March 11, 1985, the town planner, Richard Hubbard, announced that Frito-Lay would not be present that night due to a fatality at its plant and that Frito-Lay had requested an extension until the end of March. The commission determined that a special meeting would be held on March 26, 1985, and, therefore, that no action would be taken that night.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d portion of the agenda preceded the other business of the meeting, as it had on January 14, 1985, and on Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ary 11, 1985. At the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d portion, nine persons spoke on the Frito-Lay matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On March 26, 1985, the commission held a special meeting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the outset of this meeting, Baiocchetti, before opening \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation,\u201d said that the commission was \u201climiting discussion based on the information that [had] been gathered at the public hearing, so any comments that the citizens want[ed] to make regarding Planning and Zoning <em>should not, should not </em>relate to the matter before us this evening.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) This immediately met with a demurrer from a prospective speaker. She was told by the chairman that anything she said \u201crelative to the issue before [the commission that night would] carry no weight because [the commission had] already taken testimony.\u201d This woman, however, did speak on the Frito-Lay matter. Attorney Gregory Sharp, representing Cunneen, also spoke, as did Cunneen himself. Despite further statements by the chairman that the commission could accept \u201cno more testimony\u201d because the hearing had been closed in January, that that hearing had been \u201cirrevocably closed,\u201d that the commission was not taking \u201cany evidence at this point\u201d and that the commission was \u201cfollowing state statutes exactly,\u201d fourteen citizens still spoke on Frito-Lay\u2019s operations and the great majority was opposed to its operations. During the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d portion, counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Frito-Lay, citing the opening statement of the chairman, objected to Sharp\u2019s proposal to speak, although he also said that he had no objection to members of the public speaking. After all of the members of the public had spoken, the chairman asked if anyone from Frito-Lay wished to make a comment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Walker indicated that, given the chairman\u2019s earlier ruling, Frito-Lay had elected not to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Immediately thereafter, the chairman closed \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d and the commission itself discussed the Frito-Lay application. That same evening, the commission voted to deny the Frito-Lay application by a vote of three to two. The reasons given for its denial were: (1) the application did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 720.4 (c) and (e)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Killingly zoning regulations; and (2) \u201cthe surrounding community has lost faith in Frito-Lay, Inc., due to past performance . . . promises have been made to the community prior to the construction of the facility which were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>kept, which resulted in a loss of confidence in Frito-Lay\u2019s ability to do what it says it will do.\u201d Frito-Lay thereafter appealed to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">At the hearing<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on the appeal before the Superior Court, Frito-Lay claimed that the commission: (1) either failed to act within the statutory time frame or conducted multiple public hearings, which it claimed invalidated any purported commission action, thus resulting in the automatic approval of its application pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-3c<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 8-7d;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (2) acted improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>erly from the outset in requiring an application for a special permit; and (3) acted illegally, arbitrarily or in abuse of its discretion in that the grounds assigned for its denial were not reasonably supported by the record. The Superior Court rejected all of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">On appeal to this court, Frito-Lay claims essentially that the trial court erred: (1) because it did not conclude that the commission failed to complete the public hearing and lawfully decide its application within the mandatory time limits set out in \u00a7 8-7d (a), therefore requiring that its application be approved as a matter of law; and (2) in concluding that the commission had the authority to ignore its own regulations to require it to obtain a special permit pursuant to \u00a7 770 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>of its zoning regulations. Frito-Lay raises a number of subissues under each of these overall claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We turn first to the issues encompassed by Frito-Lay\u2019s claim that its application must be granted as a matter of law because of the commission\u2019s failure to adhere to the mandatory time limits set out in \u00a7 8-7d (a). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Frito-Lay first argues that <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Woolwich, </em>7 Conn. App. 684, 510 A.2d 1358, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 804, 513 A.2d 698 (1986), \u201cdirectly controls\u201d this case because this case involves an application for a special permit and site plan approval on which a hearing is required. It argues that <em>Carr </em>held, in effect, that both the thirty day and sixty-five day time limits referred to in \u00a7 8-7d (a) are mandatory and that a failure to comply with either or both of these limits requires, as a matter of law, that its application be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\"><em>Carr, </em>which was a mandamus action, \u201cinvolve[d] the issue of whether the failure of the defendant [Bridgewater] planning and zoning commission to act upon the plaintiff\u2019s application for a zoning permit for a permitted use of his property within the time constraints set by General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d results in the automatic approval of the application.\u201d <em>Carr v. Woolwich, </em>supra, 684-85. <em>Carr </em>is factually distinguishable from this case. In <em>Carr, </em>the applicant filed his application with the commission on October 11, 1983, which \u201cconsidered\u201d it at its regularly scheduled meeting of December 7, 1983, and then voted to return the plaintiff\u2019s application and accompanying documents to him. On January 4, 1984, the plaintiff appealed to the board of zoning appeals, claiming the action of the commission in returning his application was improper. On March 19, 1984, that board directed the commission to process the application and site development plan. On April 14, 1984, at its regularly scheduled meeting, the commission noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>its receipt of the board\u2019s decision. It, nevertheless, \u201cfailed to take any further action\u201d on the application and had not even done so for almost two years when, on March 14, 1986, the case was argued in the Appellate Court. In <em>Carr, </em>the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s issuance of a mandamus to compel the commission to issue a certificate of approval to the plaintiff. While <em>Carr </em>is useful on the sixty-five day time issue because of its holding that the commission specifically failed to decide the matter within that mandatory limit of \u00a7 8-7d, the <em>Carr </em>court was not presented, for decision, with a factual circumstance concerning the thirty day time limit of that statute. Moreover, there is no indication in <em>Carr </em>that the hearing required by statute, triggering the thirty day limit, was ever noticed and scheduled as it was in this case. <em>Carr </em>does not \u201ccontrol\u201d this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The trial court found that Frito-Lay, by requesting the extension on March 11, 1985, waived the sixty-five day time limit under the statute, thereby rendering it impossible for the commission to act within that sixty-five day period. There is no question that more than sixty-five days had elapsed from January 14, 1985, to March 26, 1985, when the commission rendered its decision. Having requested this continuance beyond what would have been sixty-five days from January 14, 1985, Frito-Lay has no complaint about extending the sixty-five day limit. Although the record does not indicate that Frito-Lay was represented by counsel<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> until March 26, 1985, as a corporate entity, it was, as much as any individual, chargeable with knowledge of the law. <em>M &amp; L Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning &amp; Planning Commission, </em>187 Conn. 232, 244-45, 445 A.2d 591 (1982). Frito-Lay\u2019s action in obtaining the extension to March 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>1985, was a valid waiver of its right to require the defendant commission to make its decision under the statute within sixty-five days after the completion of the hearing of January 14, 1985. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-7d, 8-3c.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Ordinarily, this fact pattern, with the time for decision properly extended beyond the mandatory sixty-five day limit at the request of the applicant, would settle this phase of the matter. Frito-Lay, however, also contends that, the commission\u2019s disregard of the mandatory hearing procedures made the commission\u2019s March 26 vote, after the illegal proceedings of February 11, 1985, March 11, 1985, and March 26, 1985, a nullity. This alleged illegality of continuing to hold hearings after the close of the public hearing on January 14, 1985, it asserts, so tainted the proceedings that it resulted in the inability of the commission ever to render a valid decision within the sixty-five day limit. Thus, it maintains that its consent on March 11, 1985, to extend the time limit does not end this issue, but rather, under the circumstances, requires the automatic granting of its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Frito-Lay\u2019s claim requires that we examine, as the trial court did, the hearings of February 11, 1985, March 11, 1985, and March 26, 1985, to determine their legal significance in this context. The trial court expressly noted that \u201cFrito-Lay\u2019s only credible complaint of untimely action by the Commission [was] the alleged failure to comply with the thirty day limitation of Sec. 8-7d that the \u2018hearing shall be completed within thirty days after such hearing commences.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) In rejecting Frito-Lay\u2019s claim that the post-January 14 \u201cmeetings\u201d constituted separate hearings on its application, the court noted that Frito-Lay had cited <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>184 Conn. 450, 453, 440 A.2d 163 (1981), \u201cfor the proposition [that] the zoning statutes do \u2018not authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>multiple public hearings in connection with a single . . . proposal.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court went on to point out that for it \u201cto conclude multiple public hearings occurred, it must find the Commission improperly received evidence, deprived the applicant of opportunity to rebut such evidence and, in doing so, prejudiced the applicant.\u201d The trial court\u2019s review of the record revealed that there was \u201clengthy discussion, termed citizens\u2019 participation, which occurred more than thirty days after January 14, 1985,\u201d the substance of which \u201cconsisted primarily of discussion of Frito-Lay\u2019s existing operations and was not addressed to the merits of the application or the site plan\u201d and \u201c[t]o this extent receipt of such information [could not] be found to be prejudicial, since the Commission members may legitimately utilize their personal knowledge in reaching a decision.\u201d In any event, the trial court went on to say, \u201cmuch if not all, of what was said concerning Frito-Lay\u2019s existing operations [was] common knowledge within . . . Killingly, as well as immaterial to the application.\u201d It opined, however, that \u201c[t]o the extent argument was addressed to the merits of the application, it merely supplemented the plethora of technical studies and reports properly before the Commission, or was merely cumulative, and [could not] be found to be prejudicial.\u201d Moreover, if it was improper for the commission \u201cto hear from opponents\u201d of this application, the trial court pointed out that it \u201cmust have been equally improper for the plaintiff to present favorable information.\u201d Rather than refraining from submitting evidence more than thirty days after January 14, 1985, as the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tiff claimed, the trial court said that Frito-Lay submitted evidence to the commission as late as March 26, 1985.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court finally concluded that \u201cconsidering any procedural irregularity attributable to the Commission in the light of [Frito-Lay\u2019s] request for an extension of time and in light of the materials submitted to the Commission by [Frito-Lay] after the completion of the January 14 hearing, it cannot be found that [Frito-Lay] was sufficiently prejudiced so as to taint the proceedings and invalidate the action of the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On the other hand, Frito-Lay maintains that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its claim that the commission did conduct multiple public hearings or, at the very least, despite its vote to close the hearing on January 14, 1985, continued the initial hearing well beyond the thirty day limit mandated for its conclusion by General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (a). It argues that the commission repeatedly took testimony, received evidence and heard oral arguments at its meetings of February 11, March 11 and March 26 and that these constituted \u201chearings\u201d under such cases as <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 469-70, 378 A.2d 547 (1977), and <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>5 Conn. App. 520, 524-25, 500 A.2d 338 (1985). Asserting that it did not expressly or impliedly consent to any hearing after January 14, 1985, Frito-Lay maintains that the trial court itself, in its memorandum of decision, relied heavily on \u201ctestimony\u201d and \u201ccontradicting evidence\u201d presented at the meeting of March 11 to support the only valid reason given by the commission to support its denial. This meeting, Frito-Lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>stresses, was one at which it had no representation. In addition, it argues that it is not required to show that prejudice resulted to it because of the commission\u2019s failure to obey the mandatory time limits of \u00a7 8-7d (a). It further contends that these violations are not cured by the commission chairman\u2019s comments at the meeting of March 26 that the testimony given there would not be considered nor by Frito-Lay\u2019s submission \u201cto the Commission and its technical consultants of data and other information requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">There is no dispute that the commission properly noticed and held a public hearing on the Frito-Lay application on January 14, 1985, and that, at the end of that hearing, the chairman declared the public hearing closed. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-3c, 8-7d. It is fair to say that \u201c \u2018[t]he very purpose of [that] hearing was to afford an opportunity to interested parties to make known their views and to enable the board to be guided by them. It is implicit in such a procedure that changes in the original proposal may ensue as a result of the views expressed at the hearing. <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>141 Conn. 349, 358, 106 A.2d 173 [1954] . . . .\u2019 <em>Neuger </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>[145 Conn. 625, 630, 145 A.2d 738 (1958)].\u201d <em>Kleinsmith </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>157 Conn. 303, 311, 254 A.2d 486 (1968). That hearing could properly have been continued and \u201ccompleted within thirty days after [it] commence[d],\u201d but it was not. We, therefore, must consider the legal effect of the \u201chearings\u201d of February 11, March 11 and March 26. We said in <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>supra, that \u201c[a] hearing can be a proceeding in the nature of a trial with the presentation of evidence, it can be merely for the purpose of presenting arguments, or ... it can be a combination of the two. . . . Not only does a hearing connote an adversarial setting, but usually it can be said that it is \u2018any <em>oral </em>proceeding before a tribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>nal.\u2019 . . . Our cases consistently recognize the generally adversarial nature of a proceeding considered a \u2018hearing,\u2019 in which witnesses are heard and testimony is taken. See, e.g. . . . <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 163, 257 A.2d 799 [1969] (public hearing, zoning commission heard evidence and arguments); <em>Kleinsmith </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>[supra] (hearing to permit interested persons \u2018to express their views\u2019).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See also <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra; <em>Colonial Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>133 Conn. 696, 699, 54 A.2d 503 (1947). Applying proper principles to the record before us, what occurred on February 11, March 11 and March 26 were \u201chearings\u201d on the Frito-Lay application, albeit without any sanction in the enabling zoning statutory scheme. After the hearing of January 14, 1985, was held and closed on that date, there could be no further \u201chearings\u201d on Frito-Lay\u2019s application that would be permitted under the enabling statutory scheme on zoning. Cities, towns and the like have no inherent police power; zoning is an exercise of police power, and cities and towns must operate in zoning matters within the enabling statutory scheme. <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>142 Conn. 415, 422, 115 A.2d 328 (1955); <em>Strain </em>v. <em>Mims, </em>123 Conn. 275, 285, 193 A. 754 (1937); 8 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev.) \u00a7 24.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Even extending fair deference to the trial court\u2019s observation, which, like this court, did not hear testimony or take any evidence, we go on to examine its determination of the effect of what occurred at the post-January 14 hearings especially as to the lengthy \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation.\u201d We must look at the trial court\u2019s determination that such participation was primarily discussion of Frito-Lay\u2019s existing functions and was not addressed to the merits of the application. In addition, we examine the trial court\u2019s statement that even if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>did address the merits, they merely supplemented the plethora of technical studies and reports properly before the commission or were merely cumulative. First, neither the trial court nor the defendants point to any statutory or other legal basis for allowing the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d phase of any of these three meetings on the Frito-Lay application,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> once the hearing of January 14, 1985, which was the time and place for such participation, was closed. There is no such basis, and such \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d constituted a \u201chearing\u201d on each occasion. Such participation prominently articulated concerns about the noise, odor, traffic problems and the lack of Frito-Lay\u2019s credibility, all matters that, in practical terms, addressed Frito-Lay\u2019s current application on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On March 26, 1985, an attorney for a resident \u201cintervened,\u201d argued against granting the application, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>introduced a photo of the Frito-Lay plant as an exhibit. The trial court observed correctly that commission members may legitimately utilize their personal knowledge in reaching a decision. See, e.g., <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>189 Conn. 261, 267, 455 A.2d 339 (1983). That, however, is not an acceptable explanation for the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cmuch, if not all,\u201d that was said about Frito-Lay\u2019s \u201cexisting operations\u201d was common knowledge within Killingly, \u201cas well as immaterial to the application.\u201d It was hardly \u201cimmaterial,\u201d especially given the second ground for denying the application, i.e., the community had lost faith in Frito-Lay \u201cdue to past performances,\u201d its \u201cfailure\u201d to keep promises it made before its existing facility was constructed and the resulting loss of confidence in its ability \u201cto do what it says it will do.\u201d Even assuming that much of this was common knowledge, these comments were made at hearings not authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The defendants\u2019 countering arguments are also not persuasive. Following the trial court\u2019s reasoning, they argue that if it was \u201cimproper\u201d for the commission to hear from \u201copponents\u201d of the application, it must have been equally improper for Frito-Lay to present favorable information, which the trial court said that it did, as late as March 26, 1985. They argue that Frito-Lay should be estopped from complaining of new material coming before the commission, pointing first to the minutes of the meeting of February 11, which, it is claimed, consist \u201calmost entirely\u201d of a discussion between Frito-Lay\u2019s representative, Walker, and the commission. Reference to those minutes shows that initially fourteen citizens spoke under the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d section. Immediately thereafter, the chairman indicated that he had some questions to ask Walker, who did speak at some length in response to the chairman\u2019s questions as well as questions from other members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the commission. Reference to those minutes also indicates that these questions and answers dealt in the main with technical matters clearly tied in with the general complaints of the citizens. This is not Frito-Lay\u2019s \u201copening the door,\u201d as the defendants argue, but rather is Frito-Lay\u2019s walking through the door that had been already opened. Where a commission is composed of laymen, we recognize that it is entitled to professional technical assistance in carrying out its responsibilities. <em>McCrann </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 65, 77, 282 A.2d 900 (1971); <em>Yurdin </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 416, 421, 143 A.2d 639, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 894, 79 S. Ct. 155, 3 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On March 11, 1985, nine citizens spoke to the Frito-Lay matter during the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d portion of the meeting. No Frito-Lay representative attended that meeting because of an accident that had occurred at the plant that day. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision quotes at length from what it characterizes as the \u201ctestimony\u201d of the defendant Cunneen himself given at this meeting about his conversations with \u201cseveral areas of New England and New York State that have wood-burning facilities\u201d and noted problems that they were having with such facilities. The trial court then observed that \u201c[Cunneen\u2019s] testimony was echoed by other concerned residents.\u201d What occurred constituted a \u201chearing,\u201d again with no legal sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On March 26, 1985, another \u201chearing,\u201d again without statutory sanction, took place on the Frito-Lay application. Not only did fourteen persons speak to it under the \u201cCitizens\u2019 Participation\u201d portion of that meeting, but that included, certainly for practical purposes, the intervention into the proceedings of an attorney representing Cunneen, who spoke, over the objection of Frito-Lay\u2019s counsel, against the application and introduced an exhibit. We have already referred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>efforts of the chairman from the outset of that meeting, who, having consulted with the commission\u2019s counsel who was present, stated that the commission could not consider what would be said by speakers that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We do not agree with the defendants\u2019 argument that, at the March 26, 1985 hearing, Frito-Lay waived its right to object to any of the citizens\u2019 comments because its counsel listened without objection while \u201ccitizens made their point about the [Frito-Lay] facility,\u201d but only objected when Attorney Sharp began to speak. This is so for two reasons. First, Frito-Lay was entitled to rely on the chairman\u2019s statements that such remarks would and could not be considered by the commission. In this connection, we should state that, despite the multiple hearings after January 14, 1985, the entire record would support the view that the commission had maintained an open mind without having made any prejudgment on the Frito-Lay matter. See <em>Daviau </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>174 Conn. 354, 358, 387 A.2d 562 (1978); <em>Pecora </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 435, 444, 144 A.2d 48 (1958). Second, Frito-Lay fairly viewed this as a \u201chearing\u201d beyond the thirty day limit and this was consistent with its position that its consent went only to the extension of the sixty-five day limit for decision and not to any new hearing. We also do not agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that Frito-Lay waived its opportunity to rebut \u201cany new submissions\u201d at the March 26,1985 meeting. At that time, after all the speakers had concluded, the commission chairman asked Walker if he wished to respond. Walker, with counsel present, declined to do so. Here again, Frito-Lay was entitled to rely on the chairman\u2019s statements that what had occurred would and could not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\u201cThe trial court may not substitute its judgment for the wide and liberal discretion vested in the local authority when acting within its prescribed legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>powers. <em>Farrington </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>177 Conn. 186, 190, 413 A.2d 817 (1979); <em>Summ </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>150 Conn. 79, 89, 186 A.2d 160 (1962). The court must invest such broad discretion in these authorities when determining the public need and the manner of meeting it, because they are closest to the circumstances and conditions which \u2018create the problem and shape the solution.\u2019 <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>159 Conn. 212, 219, 268 A.2d 395 (1970). Thus, the court may grant relief on appeal only where the local authority has acted illegally or arbitrarily or has abused its discretion. <em>McCrann </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>[supra, 74].\u201d <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>186 Conn. 466, 469-70, 442 A.2d 65 (1982). Accordingly, we are fully aware that, in determining claims of error in such matters, \u201c[c]ourts must be scrupulous not to hamper the legitimate activities of civic administrative boards by indulging in a microscopic search for technical infirmities in their action.\u201d <em>Silver Lane Pickle Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>143 Conn. 316, 319, 122 A.2d 218 (1956); <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra. We cannot, however, agree with the trial court\u2019s characterization of the multiple hearing claim as a \u201cprocedural irregularity\u201d under the circumstances. Moreover, the commission itself, having triggered these \u201chearings\u201d after January 14, 1985, in violation of \u201cits prescribed legislative powers,\u201d cannot claim, as the trial court agreed it could,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that the plaintiff was not really prejudiced. Any such claim has no merit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Although \u201c[t]here is a strong presumption of regularity in the proceedings of a public body such as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>municipal planning and zoning commission\u201d; <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 205, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985); that presumption has plainly been rebutted here as the commission, in conducting multiple hearings, did not \u201c[act] within [its] prescribed legislative powers.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Having held that the post-January 14, 1985 hearings were illegal, we turn now to the relief requested by the plaintiff. Despite these statutory violations, the commission did render its decision within the sixty-five day statutory time limitation which started from January 14, 1985, and which had been properly extended. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-3c, 8-7d; cf. <em>Shapero </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>192 Conn. 367, 370, 472 A.2d 345 (1984); <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 363-64, 472 A.2d 336 (1984). We do not believe that the automatic approval of an application, which we have said was mandated in such a case as <em>Vartuli, </em>where the zoning authority did not render its decision within the sixty-five day limitation, is also mandated in this case because of the failure to observe the thirty day limitation. \u201cA statute should be interpreted according to the policy which the legislation seeks to serve.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 538, 441 A.2d 30 (1981); see 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 56.01 through 56.02. Section 8-7d requires \u201ca hearing\u201d and that \u201csuch hearing . . . shall be completed within thirty days after such hearing commences . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 8-3c provides that \u201c[s]uch commission shall <em>decide </em>upon such application . . . within the period of time permitted under section 8-7d [the sixty-five day limitation] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, \u00a7 8-7d provides: \u201cAll <em>decisions </em>on such matters shall be rendered within sixty-five days after completion of such hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is no dispute at all that the commission properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>advertised and held \u201ca public hearing\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c; on January 14, 1985, and that it was formally closed on that date. At that time, the \u201chearing\u201d requirement imposed by statute and the commendable policy of holding \u201ca public hearing\u201d for providing a public forum for citizen input had been satisfied. The commission, however, went further and held additional hearings after January 14, 1985. We do not read this statutory departure by the commission as requiring automatic approval as that does not present the need that this applicant, unlike those relying upon the sixty-five day limitation, \u201cknow with certainty that a definite course of statutory action has been taken by a commission, setting in motion clear avenues of appeal.\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 597, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979), quoted in <em>Merlo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 676, 684, 495 A.2d 268 (1985). In addition, we do not believe that the legislature intended automatic approval of the scenario presented to us. Given this view, we have determined that because the commission did act illegally, we should go no further than to sustain Frito-Lay\u2019s appeal and remand this entire matter to the commission for a new hearing in accordance with law. See <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>178 Conn. 198, 206, 423 A.2d 861 (1979); <em>Bogue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>165 Conn. 749, 753-54, 345 A.2d 9 (1974); see 4 R. Anderson, American Law of Zoning (3d Ed.) \u00a7 27.39, p. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">With this, we discuss briefly our action concerning the grounds that the commission cited as the basis for its decision of denial. Of the two grounds given, both defendants conceded, as the trial court found, that the second ground of denial \u201cwherein the Commission alludes to broken promises and a loss of faith [in Frito-Lay], is insufficient under the law or the regulations.\u201d That leaves one ground for its denial: that Frito-Lay\u2019s application does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 720.4 (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and (e) of the Killingly zoning regulations. Our law is that the action of the commission should be sustained if even one of the stated reasons is sufficient to support it. See, e.g., <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 265; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 25-26, 376 A.2d 385 (1977). This we would be required to do, assuming we were to find support for this remaining ground, had we not already determined the antecedent illegality of the multiple hearings for which the commission bears most, if not all, of the responsibility. \u201cThe over-all actions of the zoning commission must conform to the mandates of the statute,\u201d no matter how fairly and even-handedly the commission may have conducted themselves during all of the hearings. <em>Pecora </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 440. It follows that even were we inclined to the view, as the trial court was, that the one remaining reason was sufficient to support the commission\u2019s decision, that would mean that we would have to overlook and countenance the antecedent failure to comply with the zoning statute. Moreover, appellate review of the sufficiency of any stated reason in these matters does not exist in a vacuum. Such sufficiency is hardly severable in the sense of being separate and distinct from all of the earlier proceedings. It is readily apparent that the trial court\u2019s memorandum, having decided that there had not been multiple hearings, relied, in no small measure, on input from residents. This is proper so long as that input was at a hearing permitted by the zoning statute. The public hearing of January 14, 1985, was that legal public forum. An examination of the trial court\u2019s memorandum reveals that the trial court considered such input given at subsequent \u201chearings.\u201d For example, it quotes at length Cunneen\u2019s remarks at the March 11, 1985 proceedings whose \u201ctestimony,\u201d it points out, \u201cwas echoed by other residents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">While we express no opinion of the validity of this sole remaining ground of denial, we have referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>it because inherent in it is Frito-Lay\u2019s claim that the commission should never have required it to apply for a special permit in 1984. Frito-Lay argues that its plant engineer sought a special permit \u201cbecause he understood one was required.\u201d The record demonstrates that Frito-Lay had made inquiries of the Killingly town officials as early as October, 1984, concerning their \u201cproposed wood-fueled co-generation plant\u201d and were informed of the chronology of steps that it must take, including the filing of a special permit application to that end. Frito-Lay did so and raised no complaint about having to do so until it reached the trial court. In any event, Frito-Lay argues that it had been awarded an approved special permit in 1978 when it had constructed its present facility, that what it seeks to do now does not require a special permit because it is exempt under \u00a7 450.3<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of the regulations and, therefore, the commission is ignoring, without any authority, its own regulations when it requires Frito-Lay to obtain a special permit under \u00a7 770<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We address this only because of the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d tag that Frito-Lay seems to attach to this argument so that it will be clear at the new hearing on remand that the commission has the power to require Frito-Lay to apply for a special permit. We hold that the commission is so authorized. The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>opinion aptly stated sufficient authority when it said: \u201cThe issue, therefore, is whether a co-generation plant intended to house a wood storage silo, wood hog, solid fuel boiler and turbine operator is a mere appurtenance usually required to be above roof level and incidental to a permitted use or a structural alteration of an approved special permit use. Given that the proposed construction of the facility is anticipated to be at least eight months, and contemplates the installation of a boiler, generator, wood hog and silo, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the proposal was either a substantial revision or structural alteration. Consequently, Sec. 450.3 need not be construed so as to exempt the proposed construction from the requirements imposed by Sec. 770 of the Regulations.\u201d We also note that on the application Frito-Lay filed in this case under \u201cProposed Activity\u201d the line designated \u201cNew Construction,\u201d and not the lines designated \u201cAddition\u201d or \u201cAlteration,\u201d is checked. It also wrote under \u201cProposed Activity\u201d the words \u201cCogeneration Plant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Under all the circumstances, justice and fairness require that Frito-Lay\u2019s application, together with the site plan, be remanded to the Killingly planning and zoning commission for a new hearing and proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">There is error, the judgment dismissing the appeal is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\"> At the time of the hearing of Frito-Lay\u2019s appeal in the Superior Court, Richard C. Cunneen moved to be joined as a party defendant and his motion was granted. On March 26, 1985, at a special meeting of the commission, Cunneen, represented by Attorney Gregory Sharp, filed a verified notice of intervention with the commission and was permitted, over objection of Frito-Lay\u2019s counsel, to \u201cintervene\u201d and address the commission. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a). On appeal, the defendant Cunneen has adopted the brief of the defendant commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> The memorandum of decision of the trial court, <em>Noren, J., </em>dismissing the appeal, encompasses twenty-one pages in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> At the time of this application, Frito-Lay\u2019s power needs were supplied by generating steam on its site. By its application, it sought to introduce a wood-fired system which, it claimed, would not only conserve energy resources but would also reduce costs by generating marketable surplus electricity. It maintained that its application would \u201cactually result\u201d in the removal of two existing stacks and the construction of one new \u201cchimney\u201d to serve a new boiler system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> At that time, commission chairman Vincent Baiocchetti said; \u201cAll right, the next item on onr agenda is Citizens\u2019 Participation.

In my business, I\u2019m in a situation where I run into a lot of technical people, I asked a few questions of one person. Would it technically be feasible to take the plant exhaust, with the potato and hot oil odors, and use this air for boiler combustion air, as you can tell from what you\u2019ve heard tonight and other nights, people aren\u2019t really opposed to this woodchip idea, what they\u2019re really opposed to is the smell, that\u2019s been coming, the smell and noise that's been coming since the plant began. That\u2019s really been generated, I think, most the aggravation that you\u2019re hearing from most of the people. Would it be possible to do this thing, I think it\u2019s my understanding that if you\u2019re able to do that, you would eliminate the odor completely, by burning it,\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Later, during this portion, Baiocchetti said to Walker: \u201cOk.

Can, under the regulations and our law, even though there\u2019s been an extension of time to March 26th, the commission legitimately take testimony, hear evidence in the interim? It can\u2019t, can it? Isn\u2019t that where you start, first of all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">\u201cMr. Sharp: The statute\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201cThe Court: Before you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">\u201cMr. Sharp: The statute\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201cThe Court: If they did it, then you go on to weigh prejudice, you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">\u201cMr. Sharp: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">\u201cThe Court: But, legitimately, they can\u2019t do that; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">\u201cMr. Sharp: I would agree with that, your Honor. The difficulty that we get into is the way the statute is phrased. It talks about completing the public hearing within 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-15\">\u201cNow, the public hearing, there are very specific requirements for a public hearing in terms of notice and so on and so forth. To the extent that the commission held a public hearing, as all the parties have agreed, a public hearing was held on January 14 and was adjourned on January 14. Now, what happened after that is in the record. Killingly has a provision where they allow citizens to speak on any number of issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-16\">\u201cThe Court: Not sanctioned by any statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-17\">\u201cMr. Sharp: Not sanctioned by any statute.
