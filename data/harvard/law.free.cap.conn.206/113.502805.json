Kolenberg, appeals from a decision of the trial court rejecting the report of an attorney state trial referee, revoking the reference and rendering judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant, the board of education of the city of Stamford (board), as a mathematics teacher from April, 1974, to June, 1977. He was awarded tenure in March, 1977. In June, 1977, he requested a leave of absence for the 1977-78 school year. This request was granted. At the end of April, 1978, the plaintiff notified the board of his intention to return to work in September, 1978. The assistant superintendent of the board advised the plaintiff that, under the collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tive bargaining agreement between the board and the plaintiffs union, notification of his intention to return to work was required by February 1, 1978,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, as a consequence of the plaintiffs failure to meet that deadline, he had lost his entitlement to reemployment. The plaintiffs teaching position was still vacant at this juncture. Throughout the summer of 1978 and thereafter, the plaintiff sought reinstatement and reemployment for all positions for which he was certified, but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In October, 1978, the plaintiff brought this action against the board, the city of Stamford, Robert W. Peebles, superintendent of schools, and James J. Morris, assistant superintendent of personnel. The first count alleged that the defendants had failed to reemploy the plaintiff following his leave of absence, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 10-151. In the second count, the plaintiff alleged that two teachers had been hired in violation of his rights and he sought a declaratory judgment that their employment contracts were illegal and void. He also sought temporary and permanent injunctions against the defendants and the two teachers and a writ of mandamus to compel the defendants to reinstate him in his former teaching job. Thereafter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>plaintiff amended his complaint to add a third count alleging that Morris had promised him first preference for an opening for a mathematics teacher and had broken that promise, and he added to his prayer for relief a claim for back pay and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Nearly six years after commencement of the suit, the plaintiff requested permission to amend his complaint to add claims of due process violations proscribed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1986, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. The defendants objected to the amendment and the court, <em>Cioffi, J., </em>denied the plaintiff leave to amend. Earlier, the court had stricken the case from the jury docket and ordered that it be tried to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In 1984, the defendants moved for summary judgment on all three counts. The court, <em>Ryan, J., </em>granted the motion as to counts two and three, but denied summary judgment as to count one on the ground that a factual question regarding the plaintiffs tenure status was unresolved and that there was a legal question of whether the board\u2019s refusal to reemploy the plaintiff constituted a termination within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 10-151. The matter was referred to an attorney state trial referee for trial. After trial, the referee issued his report containing thirty-four findings of fact and a memorandum concluding that the plaintiff did not resign his position by failing to meet the February 1 deadline nor was he terminated by the board, and that he remained employed by the board. The referee assessed damages against the board in the amount of $116,899.88 for loss of wages and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Following the denial by the referee of the defendants\u2019 motions to correct the report, the matter came before the Superior Court for judgment. The court, <em>Lewis, J., </em>rejected the report, revoked the reference and rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>judgment for the defendants, holding that \u00a7 10-151 did not apply to the plaintiffs \u201cconstructive resignation\u201d triggered by his failure to meet the February 1 deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The plaintiff appeals raising as claims of error: (1) the manner in which the trial court reviewed, rejected and disposed of the referee\u2019s report; (2) the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the plaintiff to amend his complaint; (3) removal of the case from the jury list; and (4) the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment on count two of the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over counts one and two and should have dismissed the case. Accordingly, we find error only in the court\u2019s disposing of count one by rendering judgment for the defendants and in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on count two. In light of our disposition of this case, we need address only the first and fourth claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">With respect to count one, the plaintiff contends that the court rejected the referee\u2019s report and revoked the reference in a manner inconsistent with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 440 through 443. He argues that the court erroneously acted on the report by rejecting it when there were motions to correct it still outstanding, and that, following rejection, rather than leaving the case to be disposed of by the court, as directed by Practice Book \u00a7 443,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court prematurely disposed of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The defendants argue that the plaintiffs action was not cognizable under General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 and the court, therefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction and appropriately rendered judgment for the defendants. We agree with the defendants that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 10-151,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Teacher Tenure Act, provides for continuing employment of tenured teach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ers, except that a teacher may be terminated for inefficiency or incompetence, insubordination, moral misconduct, medical disability, elimination of the teaching position or loss of the position to another teacher, or other due and sufficient cause. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u00a7 10-151 (d) (1) through (6). The statute establishes procedures for notice to the teacher and hearing of the matter before an impartial panel; General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (d); and affords the teacher the right to appeal the decision to the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Section 10-151 protects a tenured teacher from termination of employment except for cause or elimination of the teaching position. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 240, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). We recognize that not all separations from employment as a teacher are encompassed by the statute. Since, by its terms, the statute contemplates termination initiated by the board of education, a teacher's retirement or voluntary resignation would not trigger the act\u2019s protections. We have also noted that termination of a tenured teacher\u2019s employment under \u00a7 10-151 \u201ccarries with it a suggestion of the teacher\u2019s unsuitability.\u201d Id., 241. We have acknowledged that termination for cause \u201cmay implicate a teacher\u2019s professional standing and reputation for competence, efficiency, and integrity . . . .\" <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 79-80, 434 A.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Here, the plaintiff was denied renewal of his teaching position, not for reasons related to his personal competence, but because he had failed to meet the deadline for notifying the board of his intention to return to work in the following school year. Consequently, he was not terminated for cause within the meaning of \u00a7 10-151. See <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>176 Conn. 630, 635-36, 410 A.2d 461 (1979). Furthermore, access to the courts under the Teacher Tenure Act is possible only on appeal of a decision of the board of education. General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f). In this case, there was no appeal, nor could there have been. Therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, should not have referred it to a referee and should have dismissed the action. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Conn. 492, 280 A.2d 351 (1971) (where statute upon which action is based is inapplicable, trial court is without jurisdiction and reference to referee is improper). Accordingly, it is not necessary for this court to determine whether the trial court properly followed the practice rules invoked by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The plaintiff also argues, for the first time on appeal, that: (1) his tenure is a protected property right under the federal and state constitutions, violated by the non-renewal provision of the collective bargaining agreement; (2) he was not aware of the deadline because he had not been given a copy of the collective bargaining agreement, and that the failure of the board to provide him a copy was itself a violation of the agreement; (3) as a matter of contract law, the deadline provision did not make time of the essence of the contract; and (4) the board did not consistently enforce such deadlines. These issues are not properly before this court because they were not raised below, nor did they arise after trial. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Furthermore, had they been raised below, the trial court would have lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>because they would more appropriately have been advanced in the context of a grievance proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>School Administrators Assn. </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>200 Conn. 376, 382-83, 511 A.2d 1012 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiffs union and the board delineates a formal four step procedure for filing a grievance: the matter is presented, in turn, to the teacher\u2019s principal or immediate supervisor, to the superintendent of schools, to the board of education, and finally, to arbitration. The agreement defines \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201ca claim by a unit member . . . that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the provisions of this Agreement or of the rules, regulations, administrative directives or policies of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Enforcement of the arbitration provisions by the court is provided by General Statutes \u00a7 52-408. Following arbitration, the parties may apply to the court to have the award confirmed, corrected, vacated or modified. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417 through 52-420. Under General Statutes \u00a7 52-421, judgment may be entered upon the award, rendering it enforceable as if it had been rendered in a civil action. General Statutes \u00a7 52-423 affords a right of appeal from judgment on an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The Teacher Negotiation Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-153a through 10-153n; and the arbitration statutes; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424; evidence a preference for resolving disputes between teachers and boards of education through contract grievance proceedings, thereby affording both union and employer an exclusive and uniform method for orderly settlement of grievances. See <em>School Administrators Assn. </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>supra, 381-82. We have held that, \u201cas a matter of state law, parties to a collective bargaining agreement must attempt to exhaust the exclusive grievance and arbitration procedures established in their agreement before resorting to court.\u201d Id., 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The grievance procedures afforded by the collective bargaining agreement were available to the plaintiff to redress the loss of his teaching position. They were an appropriate vehicle for the resolution of his claims, including his constitutional claims. Id., 382-83. In fact, the record contains evidence that a grievance proceeding had been commenced but not pursued. There was testimony that the plaintiffs formal grievance complaint was presented by the then chairman of the union\u2019s grievance committee to Peebles who declined to discuss it on the ground that the matter was in litigation. The union proceeded no further, nor is there any evidence that the plaintiff followed up the matter with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">It is clear that the plaintiff failed to exhaust the grievance and arbitration procedures available to him, thereby depriving the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court, therefore, should have dismissed count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We also hold that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over count two. In that count, the plaintiff sought a judgment declaring that the defendants had improperly and illegally awarded employment contracts to nontenured teachers while denying him reinstatement, and that those contracts were void. In granting summary judgment, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 390 (d) of the Practice Book and that the court thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Section 390 (d) provides that the court will not render a declaratory judgment \u201cunless all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof.\u201d We have required strict adherence to this rule and have held that failure to comply with it is fatal to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>192 Conn. 460, 468-69, 472 A.2d 1261 (1984); <em>Pinnix v. LaMorte, </em>182 Conn. 342, 343, 438 A.2d 102 (1980). \u201cThis rule is not merely a procedural regulation. It is in recognition and implementation of the basic principle that due process of law requires that the rights of no man shall be judicially determined without affording him a day in court and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Benz </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>154 Conn. 74, 77, 221 A.2d 841 (1966); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The plaintiff argues that the issue of noncompliance with \u00a7 390 (d) was not before the court because it was not raised by the defendant and not briefed by either party. This contention is without merit. Since failure to comply with \u00a7 390 (d) implicates subject matter jurisdiction, it can be raised at any point in the proceedings, even on appeal, and by the court. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra; <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Pfeiffer, </em>176 Conn. 540, 545, 409 A.2d 1009 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The trial court, without specifying those persons required to be joined as parties or entitled to reasonable notice of the action, stated that neither count two nor the record as a whole establishes that all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint were joined as parties or notified. The record supports the court\u2019s conclusion. Without ascertaining the identification of all persons falling within the ambit of \u00a7 390 (d), at the very least, in addition to the named defendants, the two teachers whose contracts were under attack by the plaintiff had an interest in the subject matter of the litigation and were entitled to the safeguards afforded by \u00a7 390 (d). The court, therefore, was without jurisdiction over the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss both counts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"> Article 13, \u00a7 II, of the agreement between the board and the Stamford Federation of Teachers, July, 1977, through July, 1980, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">\u201cB.

Nothing in this section or in any other section of the general statutes or of any special act shall preclude a board of education from making an agreement with an exclusive bargaining representative which contains a recall provision. Prior to terminating a contract, a board of education shall vote to give the teacher concerned a written notice that termination of such teacher\u2019s contract is under consideration and, upon written request filed by such teacher with such board within seven days after receipt of such notice, shall within the next succeeding seven days give such teacher a statement in writing of the rea- ' sons therefor. Within twenty days after receipt of written notice by the board of education that contract termination is under consideration, such teacher may file with such board a written request for a hearing. A board of education may designate a subcommittee of three or more board members to conduct hearings and submit written findings and recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tions to the board for final disposition in the case of teachers whose contracts are terminated for the reasons stated in subdivision (5) of this subsection.

If the parties are unable to agree upon the choice of a hearing officer within five days after their decision to use a hearing officer, the hearing shall be held before the board or panel, as the case may be. The impartial hearing panel shall consist of three members appointed as follows: The board of education shall appoint one panel member, the teacher shall appoint one panel member, and those two panel members shall choose a third, who shall serve as chairperson. Within ninety days after receipt of the request for a hearing, the impartial hearing panel, subcommittee of the board or hearing officer, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension, shall submit written findings and a recommendation to the board of education as to the disposition of the charges against the teacher, and shall send a copy of such findings and recommendation to the teacher. The board of education shall give the teacher concerned its written decision within fifteen days of receipt of the written recommendation of the impartial hearing panel, subcommittee or hearing officer. Each party shall pay the fee of the panel member selected by it and shall share equally the fee of the third panel member or hearing officer and all other costs incidental to the hearing. If the hearing is before the board of education, the board shall render its decision within fifteen days after the close of such hearing, and shall send a copy of its decision to the teacher. The hearing shall be public if the teacher so requests or the board, panel or subcommittee so designates. The teacher concerned shall have the right to appear with counsel at the hearing, whether public or private. A copy of the transcript of the proceedings of the hearing shall be furnished by the board of education, upon written request by the teacher within fifteen days after the board\u2019s decision, provided the teacher shall assume the cost of any such copy.
