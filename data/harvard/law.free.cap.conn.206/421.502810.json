The defendant, Dennis Champagne, stands accused of having knowingly engaged in a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-395 (c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Corrupt Organizations and Racketeering Activity Act (CORA), General Statutes \u00a7 53-393 et seq. Pursuant to its authority under General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 (a) (1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court, after a hearing, rendered an order prohibiting the defendant from \u201ctransferring, depleting or otherwise alienating or diminishing\u201d any property that is subject to forfeiture to the state upon his conviction. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>brings this interlocutory appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-401 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming principally that the trial court erred in not allowing him to use a portion of the forfeitable property to pay for attorney\u2019s fees he will incur in defending the CORA prosecution. We conclude that there is error and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. In July, 1980, the defendant purchased a parcel of real estate at 1 Island Brook Avenue in Bridgeport (Island Brook). This property was subsequently leased to D &amp; T Auto Salvage, Inc., a Connecticut corporation engaged in the automobile repair and junkyard business. The defendant was an officer and stockholder in that corporation. In 1985, the defendant sold the real estate and his stock interest in the corporation. As part of the consideration for the sale, the defendant took back a purchase money mortgage<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the amount of $157,000 from the purchaser.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Roughly one year later, the defendant was arrested and charged with racketeering under CORA. The information alleges that the defendant and his associates bought or received stolen cars, which they dismantled and sold at a profit as component parts. The state further charged that this operation, colloquially known as a \u201cchop shop,\u201d was operated at the Island Brook property previously owned by the defendant. As a penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>for operating the \u201cchop shop,\u201d the state seeks the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s interest in this property, represented by his monthly receipt of payments from the mortgagor of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Prior to the commencement of trial on the criminal charges, the state invoked three separate CORA provisions that authorize the freezing of property that is potentially subject to CORA forfeiture. First, under General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 (a) (1), the defendant was prohibited from transferring or depleting any forfeitable property. Second, under General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 (a) (2),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a receivership was established to collect the defendant\u2019s mortgage payments. Third, under General Statutes \u00a7 53-399 (e),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a lien on the forfeitable property in favor of the state was established by filing a lien notice in the land records of Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53-400 (c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant then filed a motion to discharge or modify the CORA lien notice. The filing of such a motion triggers a statutory requirement that a hearing be held, within ten days, at which the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>bears the burden of proving that the property described in the lien notice is subject to forfeiture. General Statutes \u00a7 53-400 (c) (1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion for discharge or modification alleged lack of probable cause to believe that the mortgage payments attributable to the Island Brook property are forfeitable property. The defendant in his motion urged the trial court to hold that the lien was improper because: (1) the defendant\u2019s property was not forfeitable because he had sold his interest in Island Brook before the initiation of the CORA prosecution; (2) the defendant, being otherwise indigent,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> needed access to his mortgage income in order to exercise his sixth amendment right to hire counsel of choice; and (3) the application of CORA to the defendant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>unconstitutionally expose him to an ex post facto legislative enactment. In his brief in support of his motion, the defendant referred to a further ground for exempting the mortgage payments from pretrial garnishment: a statutory exemption for \u201cnet income or profits,\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The trial court declined to discharge the lien. The court found probable cause to believe that the property described in the lien notice was forfeitable. In its rejection of the defendant\u2019s claim that a preprosecution conveyance necessarily sheltered property from the forfeiture provision of CORA, the court relied, at least in part, on established Connecticut law that a mortgagee has an ownership interest in the mortgaged property. The court considered the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to hire counsel of choice to be outweighed in this case by the state\u2019s interest in deterrence of organized crime and in punishment of illegal conduct. The court lastly found no merit in the defendant\u2019s ex post facto challenge, because the information charged the defendant with racketeering activity both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the statute. The trial court did not address the defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to an exemption for \u201cnet income or profits\u201d under \u00a7 53-398 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">On appeal, the defendant renews the claims that he made to the trial court. We will consider first his broad argument that property conveyed in a bona fide, arms-length transaction prior to the initiation of CORA proceedings is per se exempt from forfeiture. We will then turn to a consideration of the more limited contention that the express statutory exemption of \u201cnet income or profits\u201d should be construed to protect the defendant\u2019s alleged sixth amendment right to hire counsel of his own choice. We find error only on the latter, more limited, ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The defendant argues broadly that the forfeiture and pretrial freeze provisions of CORA do not reach property that was transferred prior to the commencement of the prosecution unless the state proves that the transfer was made \u201cwith the intention of preventing its forfeiture\u201d as specified under General Statutes \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under that section, \u201cthe court may set aside\u201d the fraudulent transfer and render appropriate orders \u201creasonably necessary to protect the rights of any innocent party to any such transfer.\u201d This claim of an implied limitation on CORA\u2019s reach finds support, according to the defendant, in the lack of any CORA provision relating the occurrence of forfeiture back to the time the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The state maintains, to the contrary, that the forfeitable property in this case, the purchase money mortgage on the Island Brook property, falls within the direct purview of forfeitures authorized by CORA. CORA authorizes forfeiture of \u201c[a]ny property . . . acquired, maintained or used in violation of this chapter, including profits derived therefrom and the appreciated value thereof, or, <em>where applicable, the proceeds from the sale thereof </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53-397 (a) (1). CORA defines \u201cproperty\u201d as \u201cany property, real or personal, or any interest therein or any beneficial interest of whatever kind.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53-394 (g). According to the state, the set aside provision of \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3) upon which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>relies is an unrelated remedy that comes into play only when the \u201cproceeds from the sale thereof\u201d are patently insufficient in relation to the value of the property that was previously transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The issue before us, therefore, is whether, in light of CORA\u2019s language and purpose, its forfeiture provisions encompass the defendant\u2019s mortgage payments as \u201cproceeds from the sale\u201d of real and personal property that was \u201cacquired, maintained or used\u201d in the commission of illegal racketeering activity. In our construction of the applicable statutory language, our goal is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987). In reaching this goal, we consider first whether the language of the statute yields a plain and unambiguous resolution. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). Any latent ambiguity in the statutory language itself is normally resolved by turning for guidance to the legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The defendant in this case urges us to apply a further maxim of statutory construction: the criminal sanction of forfeiture must be strictly construed. In support of this claim, the defendant asserts that the penalty of forfeiture is \u201cforeign\u201d to our law. In the unqualified form in which this assertion is stated, it is inaccurate. Recourse to forfeiture in certain cases is an ancient, albeit sparingly used, fixture in our criminal jurisprudence, as a brief review of the historical record demonstrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The common law of England recognized two principal types of forfeiture. The val\u00fae of an object, or the object itself, that caused the accidental death of a King\u2019s subject was forfeited to the Crown as a deodand. J. Finkelstein, \u201cThe Goring Ox: Some Historical Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>spectives on Deodands, Forfeitures, Wrongful Death and the Western Notion of Sovereignty,\u201d 46 Temp. L.Q. 169, 197 (1973). The common law also imposed a forfeiture of estate consequent to conviction of a felony or treason. Note, \u201cBane of American Forfeiture Law\u2014Banished At Last?\u201d 62 Cornell L. Rev. 768, 771-72 (1977). This latter penalty had two especially harsh results: the accused was deemed to forfeit the entirety of his personal and real property upon a judgment of conviction; <em>Calero-Toledo </em>v. <em>Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 680-82, 94 S. Ct. 2080, 40 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1974); and his \u201c \u2018blood was corrupted\u2019 so that nothing could pass by inheritance through his line.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grande, </em>620 F.2d 1026, 1038 (4th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Castagna </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 830, 101 S. Ct. 98, 66 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Neither type of forfeiture gained currency in this country. The deodand was rejected largely because it was viewed as a superstitious institution that rested on a fiction that the offending object itself was morally afflicted for having caused death. <em>Parker-Harris Co. </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>135 Tenn. 509, 514-15, 188 S.W. 54 (1916). The broad penalty of forfeiture of estate was also repudiated in Connecticut by the end of the eighteenth century. 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796) p. 405; see also article ninth, \u00a7 4, of the Connecticut constitution of 1818 (\u201cno conviction of treason, or attainder, shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In Connecticut and elsewhere in the United States, forfeiture came to be recognized, not in its common law version, which authorized the wholesale invalidation of property rights, but as an authorized adjunct for the exercise of powers specified in particular criminal statutes. 1 Bishop, Criminal Law (9th Ed. 1923) \u00a7 944.1, p. 695; 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law (7th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Ed. 1851) p. 464; see also note, \u201cBane of American Forfeiture Law\u2014Banished at Last?\u201d supra, 779 n.73 and 795 n.162. Swift described Connecticut law as permitting the seizure of \u201ca specific sum [which] is considered to be the punishment itself, and not the consequence of the judgment.\u201d 2 Z. Swift, supra. That law was exemplified by <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>1 Root (Conn.) 195 (1790), in which the court reviewed a conviction under a statute criminalizing fishing activity near the mouth of the Connecticut River. Any defendant convicted under the statute forfeited \u201cthe seine, ropes and other utensils used in catching fish, contrary to the act.\u201d Id. Instead of seizing the utensils, however, the trial court in <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Lynde </em>assessed a fine equal to the value of the fishing gear. This court reversed, holding that the property itself was subject to forfeiture, not its appraised value. See also <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>90 Conn. 584, 98 A. 121 (1916) (upholding a seizure of a motor boat and eighty rods of gill net); and compare <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>152 U.S. 133, 139-40, 14 S. Ct. 499, 38 L. Ed. 385 (1894) (affirming the police power of states to seize implements used in catching fish in violation of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">While the penalty of forfeiture is therefore not \u201cforeign\u201d to our criminal law, we nonetheless agree with the defendant that such a sanction must be strictly construed. As a general matter, our penal law must be strictly construed to protect fundamental constitutional rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>190 Conn. 496, 505, 461 A.2d 973 (1983); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 411, 93 S. Ct. 1007, 35 L. Ed. 2d 379 (1973). Forfeiture statutes in particular have been narrowly construed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>559 F.2d 975, 991 (5th Cir. 1977). In applying this rule of construction, however, we must not frustrate the evident design of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 630-31, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>We turn now to an application of these principles to the issue before us: Does CORA encompass the defendant\u2019s mortgage payments as \u201cproceeds from the sale\u201d of property illegally \u201cacquired, maintained or used\u201d for racketeering purposes? We conclude that CORA authorizes the state to make such property forfeitable whether or not the state can prove an intent to avoid forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The forfeiture penalty under CORA is broad in scope. The act provides that, upon conviction, the court \u201cshall render a judgment of forfeiture\u201d authorizing the state to seize \u201call\u201d forfeitable property. General Statutes \u00a7 53-397 (b) (1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By its own terms, the act envisions the possibility of having to seize property that no longer belongs to the defendant in its original form. In such situations, the act provides two mechanisms for recapturing the property or the value thereof. If possible, \u201cwhere applicable, the proceeds from the sale\u201d of forfeitable property may be seized directly. General Statutes \u00a7 53-397 (a) (1).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the alternative, the state may seek to set aside a prior fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because this alternative remedy has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the potential for adversely affecting innocent third parties, the court is empowered to issue appropriate orders protecting their interests. General Statutes \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Although the statutory scheme therefore appears, on its face, to create two unrelated and independent mechanisms for vindicating the state\u2019s right to forfeiture, the defendant urges us to construe them as interwoven. He argues that the state\u2019s right to seize \u201cproceeds from the sale\u201d of forfeitable property under \u00a7 53-397 (a) (1) is available only upon proof that the preprosecution transfer that generated the proceeds was made with \u201cthe intention of preventing its forfeiture\u201d as provided in \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3). The \u201cwhere applicable\u201d clause in \u00a7 53-397 (a) (1) is, according to the defendant, a directive to interpolate the intent requirement of \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3) into the \u201cproceeds from the sale\u201d clause of \u00a7 53-397 (a) (1). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The set aside provision in \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3) is addressed to the unique problem of recapturing <em>\u201cproperty previously owned </em>by the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The section thereby provides a mechanism for reaching back to undo transfers that thwart the right of forfeiture. Had the defendant in this case transferred the \u201cproceeds from the sale\u201d of his property to a third party, the state would conceivably have a remedy under the set aside provision. That is not this case. It is undisputed that the defendant is himself receiving the mortgage payments, which clearly come within the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d in \u00a7 53-394 (g).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the defendant continues to possess the \u201cproperty\u201d that is being forfeited, this forfeiture is unaffected by \u00a7 53-397 (b) (3), which applies only to \u201cproperty previously owned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The absence of a specific provision relating the occurrence of forfeiture back to the commission of the offense does not, contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, compel a different conclusion. Under the doctrine of relation back, the state may exercise a right to forfeiture as of the date of the commission of the offense, at which time ownership is said to vest in the government. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>133 U.S. 1, 16-17, 10 S. Ct. 244, 33 L. Ed. 555 (1890); <em>Florida Dealers &amp; Growers Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>279 F.2d 673, 676 (5th Cir. 1960). Under the forfeiture scheme enacted pursuant to CORA, however, this general doctrine has been superseded by a statutory framework for identifying and seizing forfeitable property.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53-397, 53-398.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Our conclusion that bona fide preprosecution transfers are not per se exempt from forfeiture is consistent with CORA\u2019s legislative history. In urging passage of the bill, Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., described a hypothetical racketeer who takes a $50,000 profit gained in a cocaine transaction and invests the money in real estate, which then appreciates in value to $350,000. By subjecting the entire appreciated value of the real estate to forfeiture, he stated, \u201cwe would not allow [racketeers] to profit from their illegal activity.\u201d 25 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1982 Sess., p. 3914. Further, in the House of Representatives, Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated that the forfeiture provision subjected \u201cwhatever ill gained money may be invested in, to forfeiture. There are similar laws in the federal government and some other states as well as Puerto Rico.\u201d 25 H.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Proc., Pt. 14, 1982 Sess., p. 4540. Both statements indicate that the General Assembly intended CORA to track the progression of property \u201cacquired, maintained and used\u201d in illegal racketeering activity. This tracking of illicit funds occurs under federal anti-racketeering law as well because its analagous purpose is to \u201cremove the profit from organized crime by separating the racketeer from his dishonest gains.\u201d <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 28, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983). The trial court correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to discharge the CORA lien on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The defendant\u2019s more limited claim for modification of the CORA lien rests on the statutory exemption contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 (b). He maintains that he is entitled to retain a portion of the mortgage payments because this statute provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the right of the defendant to receive any net income or profits resulting from the use and ownership of such property belonging to him for which there is probable cause to believe is subject to forfeiture under this chapter until a final judgment of forfeiture is rendered.\u201d According to the defendant, at least until a final judgment of forfeiture has been rendered the interest component of each mortgage payment qualifies as \u201cnet income or profits\u201d within this exemption. In opposition, the state asserts that, as \u201cproceeds,\u201d the mortage payments are forfeitable under \u00a7 53-397 (a) in their entirety. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 as a whole expresses a clear legislative design for the balanced judicial supervision of putatively forfeitable property during the preconviction stage of a CORA prosecution. Subsection (a) addresses itself to the jurisdiction of the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Court to render orders preserving the assets of a defendant prior to conviction. A Superior Court may render a freeze order pursuant to subdivision (1) only upon proof of \u201cprobable cause\u201d that the property is subject to forfeiture under the act. An order appointing a receiver under subdivision (2) must conform to established procedures under chapter 920 of the General Statutes. The court is further authorized under subdivision (3) to allow a defendant to transfer or deplete forfeitable property upon the posting of adequate security. The rights of innocent third persons may be protected pursuant to subdivision (4). Each of these subdivisions vests discretion in the trial court to take appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In subsection (b) of \u00a7 53-398, however, the language of the statute is mandatory: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the right of the defendant to receive any net income or profits\u201d arising from his use or ownership of forfeitable property. This reservation of rights may well have reflected a legislative decision that, in light of the presumption of innocence in criminal cases and the severity of the forfeiture penalty upon conviction, a CORA defendant should be afforded some relief during the preconviction phase of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We do not agree with the state that the broad language contained in \u00a7 53-397 (a) is controlling. \u201cAs a matter of statutory construction, specific statutory provisions are presumed to prevail over more general statutory provisions dealing with the same overall subject matter. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 624, 441 A.2d 600 (1981); <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 635, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 359, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); see also 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 46.05. Because the legislature has specifically resolved this issue in favor of the defendant by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>and unambiguous language, we must give full effect to the terms of the statute. <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 399, 512 A.2d 152 (1986); <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 141, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986). We therefore conclude that the defendant is entitled to receive the \u201cnet income or profits\u201d from the mortgage payments in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Our holding does not unreasonably impair the state\u2019s right of forfeiture under CORA. If the defendant is ultimately convicted for having engaged in illegal racketeering activity through the Island Brook enterprise, the state may then acquire the entire remaining \u201cproceeds from the sale\u201d of the property pursuant to \u00a7 53-397 (a) (1). The definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d as \u201cwhat is produced by or derived from something (as a sale, investment, levy, business) by way of total revenue: the total amount brought in\u201d; N. Webster, Third New International Dictionary; certainly encompasses at least the interest component of the mortgage payments currently received by the defendant. To the extent that the state\u2019s seizure is diminished in the interim because of the effect of \u00a7 53-398 (b), we can only conclude that this diminution is the consequence of a legislative decision to balance the competing interests involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Indeed, the legislature\u2019s good judgment is underscored in this case by the implications of the statutory exemption for the defendant\u2019s argument that access to his mortgage payments is constitutionally required in order to protect his sixth amendment right to retain counsel of his choice. A similar constitutional claim arising under forfeiture provisions of the federal anti-racketeering act has not as yet been definitively resolved in the federal courts. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>814 F.2d 905, 918-26 (4th Cir. 1987), rev\u2019d in part en banc sub nom. <em>In re Forfeiture Hearing as to Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered, </em>837 F.2d 637 (4th Cir. 1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Monsanto, </em>836 F.2d 74 (2d Cir. 1987), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>654 F. Sup. 1541, 1556-59 (D. Utah 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>602 F. Sup. 1332, 1348-49 (D. Colo. 1985); see K. Brickey, \u201cForfeiture of Attorneys\u2019 Fees: The Impact of RICO and CCE Forfeitures on the Right to Counsel,\u201d 72 Va. L. Rev. 493 (1986); comment, \u201cRICO and the Forfeiture of Attorneys\u2019 Fees: Removing the Adversary From the Adversarial System?\u201d 62 Wash. L. Rev. 201 (1987). We need not, however, address such a constitutional claim on its merits when the statute itself may contain sufficient redress for the defendant. As is customary, we \u201c \u2018follow the recognized policy of self-restraint and the basic judicial duty to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.' <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>180 Conn. 153, 166, 429 A.2d 841 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 362. It is, nonetheless, relevant to our construction of the statutory exemption that our interpretation avoids placing the forfeiture provisions of CORA in immediate constitutional jeopardy. <em>French </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, </em>203 Conn. 624, 636-37, 526 A.2d 861 (1987); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On the present record, we cannot determine what part, if any, of each mortgage payment is \u201cnet income or profit\u201d within \u00a7 53-398 (b) or whether the moneys that fall within the exemption therein provided will be sufficient to pay the attorney\u2019s fees that the defendant will incur in defending himself from the CORA violations with which he has been charged. A remand is therefore required.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We note initially that the interest component of each payment would fall squarely within the definition of \u201cnet income\u201d under this statutory exception. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 12-213; <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>146 Conn. 644, 648, 153 A.2d 828 (1959). Interest is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ordinarily taxable as net proceeds under federal internal revenue law; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 61, 63 (1982); specifically, interest received on a mortgage debt is taxable as net income. 1 J. Merten, Law of Federal Income Tax (1986) \u00a7 6A.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The mortgage in this case<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> obligates the mortgagor to make 120 monthly payments of $2072.78 on a principal debt of $157,000 to be repaid with interest at the rate of 10 percent. Over the lifetime of the mortgage, the defendant will therefore be entitled to receive a total sum of $248,733.60 over a period of 120 months. Once the principal amount of $157,000 is subtracted, interest accounts for $91,733.60 of the total amount due on the note. The mortgage note does not, however, indicate how the interest is to be apportioned over the life of the loan. We do not know, therefore, what portion of each $2072.78 payment to attribute to interest, and hence to \u201cnet income or profits\u201d under the statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On remand, the trial court is directed to hold a hearing to determine what portion of the defendant\u2019s mortgage payments constitutes interest and thus qualifies for the exemption under \u00a7 53-398 (b) and whether the income made available to the defendant by the statute will suffice to afford him reasonable access to counsel of his choice. If the defendant is dissatisfied with either aspect of this determination, he will have a renewed right to further interlocutory appellate review of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>There is error, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-395 (e) provides: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise to knowingly conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, such enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or through the collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-398 (a) (1) provides: \u201cCOURT orders, (a) At any time in any prosecution under this chapter, the superior court shall have jurisdiction to render and may render the following orders: (1) An order prohibiting the defendant from transferring, depleting or otherwise alienating or diminishing any property of his which there is probable cause to believe is subject to forfeiture under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-401 (a) provides: \u201cappeal of orders, stay of execution, filing of orders, (a) Any order rendered as provided in section 53-398 or 53-400 shall be deemed a final judgment for the purpose of appeal, which, notwithstanding section 54-96, may be taken by the state or the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> A purchase money mortgage is \u201cone taken back by the seller for part of the purchase money.\u201d R.
