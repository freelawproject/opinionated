The plaintiff, Dorothy Polmatier, executrix of the estate of her deceased husband, Arthur R. Polmatier, brought this action against the defendant, Norman Russ, seeking to recover damages for wrongful death. The state trial referee, exercising the power of the Superior Court, rendered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant has appealed from that judgment. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record reveal the following undisputed facts. On the afternoon of November 20, 1976, the defendant and his two month old daughter visited the home of Arthur Polmatier, his father-in-law. Polmatier lived in East Windsor with his wife, Dorothy, the plaintiff, and their eleven year old son, Robert. During the early evening Robert noticed a disturbance in the living room where he saw the defendant astride Polmatier on a couch beating him on the head with a beer bottle. Robert heard Polmatier exclaim, \u201cNorm, you\u2019re killing me!\u201d and ran to get help. Thereafter, the defendant went into Polmatier\u2019s bedroom where he took a box of 30-30 caliber ammunition from the bottom drawer of a dresser and went to his brother-in-law\u2019s bedroom where he took a 30-30 caliber Winchester rifle from the closet. He then returned to the living room and shot Polmatier twice, causing his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">About five hours later, the defendant was found sitting on a stump in \u00e1 wooded area approximately one half mile from the Polmatier home. The defendant was naked and his daughter was in his arms wrapped in his clothes, and was crying. Blood was found on his clothes, and he had with him the Winchester rifle, later determined to be the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The defendant was taken to a local hospital and was later transferred to Norwich Hospital. While in custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>he was confined in Norwich Hospital or the Whiting Forensic Institute. The defendant was charged with the crime of murder pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but was found not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Walter Borden, a psychiatrist, testified at both the criminal and this civil proceeding regarding the defendant\u2019s sanity. In the present civil case Borden testified that, at the time of the homicide, the defendant was suffering from a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia that involved delusions of persecution, grandeur, influence and reference, and also involved auditory hallucinations. He concluded that the defendant was legally insane and could not form a rational choice but that he could make a schizophrenic or crazy choice. He was not in a fugue state. The trial court found that at the time of the homicide the defendant was insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The substitute complaint for the wrongful death of Polmatier alleged in the first count that the death resulted from an assault, beating and shooting by the defendant, and included a second count for exemplary damages and a third count based on negligence. The defendant filed a substitute answer denying all material allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s substitute complaint and asserted three special defenses: (1) as to all counts, the defendant was non compos mentis at the time of the alleged assault and, therefore, not capable of forming the intent necessary for tort liability; (2) the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>count was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-584, the statute of limitations; and (3) as to all counts, the plaintiff or the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was comparatively or contributorily negligent. The trial court determined that the first and second special defenses were inapplicable to this case and that the third special defense had not been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">After a trial to the court, the court found for the plaintiff on the first count and awarded compensatory damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred in failing to apply the following two-pronged analysis to his claim: first, whether the defendant intended the act which produced the injury; and second, whether he intended the resulting injury. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Connecticut has never directly addressed the issue of whether an insane person is civilly liable for an intentional tort.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority of jurisdictions that have con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>sidered this issue have held insane persons liable for their intentional torts. See 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 895J. This rule is reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 283B, which provides: \u201cUnless the actor is a child, his insanity or other mental deficiency does not relieve the actor from liability for conduct which does not conform to the standard of a reasonable man under like circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority rule has been applied to cases involving intentional homicide. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>181 F. Sup. 81 (D.D.C. 1960); <em>Parke </em>v. <em>Dennard, </em>218 Ala. 209, 118 So. 396 (1928); <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Sholty, </em>121 Ill. 660, 13 N.E. 239 (1887); <em>Vosnos </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>43 Ill. App. 3d 834, 357 N.E.2d 615 (1976); <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>123 Kan. 88, 254 P. 348 (1927); <em>Bolen </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>452 S.W.2d 401 (Ky. 1970); <em>Jewell </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>66 N.H. 399, 24 A. 902 (1890); <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Tchernowitz, </em>3 Misc. 2d 617, 155 N.Y.S.2d 1011 (1956); <em>Ballinger </em>v. <em>Rader, </em>153 N.C. 488, 69 S.E. 497 (1910); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>York, </em>233 S.W.2d 347 (Tex. Civ. App. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Commentators trace the majority rule back to the dictum of a seventeenth century English case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority rule is not, however, without criticism. For example, Professor Bohlen has stated: \u201c[W]here a liability, like that for the impairment of the physical condition of another\u2019s body or property, is imposed upon persons capable of fault only if they have been guilty of fault, immaturity of age or mental deficiency, which destroys the capacity for fault, should preclude the possibility of liability. . . . But so long as it is accepted as a general principle that liability for injuries to certain interests are to be imposed only upon those guilty of fault in causing them, it should be applied consistently and no liability should be imposed upon those for any reason incapable of fault.\u201d F. Bohlen, \u201cLiability in Tort of Infants and Insane Persons,\u201d 23 Mich. L. Rev. 9, 31-32 (1924-25). For a similar view, see R. Ague, \u201cThe Liability of Insane Persons in Tort Actions,\u201d 60 Dick. L. Rev. 211 (1956). Nonetheless, we are persuaded by the proponents of the majority rule, especially when the cases in which it has been applied are examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">A leading case is <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>123 Kan. 88, 254 P. 348 (1927). In <em>Seals, </em>the widow of Arthur Seals brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>a civil action against Martin Snow to recover damages for the death of her husband. Several interrogatories were submitted to the jury, including: \u201cWas Martin Snow insane when he shot Arthur Seals? A. Yes. If you answer the last question in the affirmative, was Martin Snow at the time he shot Arthur Seals able to distinguish right from wrong? A. No.\u201d Id., 89. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. In upholding the ensuing judgment, the Kansas Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe defendant challenges the doctrine generally sustained by the courts that an insane person is liable to make compensation for his torts. It is conceded that the great weight of authority is that an insane person is civilly liable for his torts. This liability has been based on a number of grounds, one that where one of two innocent persons must suffer a loss, it should be borne by the one who occasioned it. Another, that public policy requires the enforcement of such liability in order that relatives of the insane person shall be led to restrain him and that tort-feasors shall not simulate or pretend insanity to defend their wrongful acts causing damage to others, and that if he was not liable there would be no redress for injuries, and we might have the anomaly of an insane person having abundant wealth depriving another of his rights without compensation.\u201d Id., 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Like <em>Seals, </em>another homicide case applying the majority rule is <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Sholty, </em>121 Ill. 660, 13 N.E. 239 (1887), where recovery was allowed against an insane person\u2019s estate for the wrongful killing of the plaintiff\u2019s wife. The court reasoned: \u201cThere is, to be sure, an appearance of hardship in compelling one to respond for that which he is unable to avoid for want of the control of reason. But the question of liability in these cases is one of public policy. If an insane person is not held liable for his torts, those interested in his estate, as relatives or otherwise, might not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>a sufficient motive to so take care of Mm as to deprive Mm of opportunities for inflicting injuries upon others. There is more injustice in denying to the injured party the recovery of damages for the wrong suffered by Mm, than there is in calling upon the relatives or friends of the lunatic to pay the expense of his confinement, if he has an estate ample enough for that purpose. The liability of lunatics for their torts tends to secure a more efficient custody and guardianship of their persons. Again, if parties can escape the consequences of their injurious acts upon the plea of lunacy, there will be a strong temptation to simulate insanity with a view of masking the malice and revenge of an evil heart.\u201d Id., 664-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Our adoption of the majority rule holding insane persons civilly liable, in appropriate circumstances, for their, intentional torts finds support in other Connecticut case law. We have elsewhere recognized the vitality of the common law principle that \u201c \u2018where one of two innocent persons must suffer loss from an act done, it is just that it should fall on the one who caused the loss rather than upon the other who had no agency in producing it and could not by any means have avoided it.\u2019\u201d <em>Verrilli </em>v. <em>Damilowski, </em>140 Conn. 358, 360, 100 A.2d 462 (1953), citing <em>Granniss </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>107 Conn. 622, 625, 141 A. 877 (1928); <em>Grissell </em>v. <em>Housatonic R. Co., </em>54 Conn. 447, 461, 9 A. 137 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should have applied a two-pronged analysis to his claim. The first prong is whether the defendant intended the act that produced the injury. The defendant argues that for an act to be done with the requisite intent, the act must be an external manifestation of the actor\u2019s will. The defendant specifically relies on the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 14, comment b, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>for the definition of what constitutes an \u201cact,\u201d where it is stated that \u201ca muscular movement which is purely reflexive or the convulsive movements of an epileptic are not acts in the sense in which that word is used in the Restatement. So too, movements of the body during sleep or while the will is otherwise in abeyance are not acts. An external manifestation of the will is necessary to constitute an act, and an act is necessary to make one liable [for a battery] . . . .\u201d The defendant argues that if his \u201cactivities were the external manifestations of irrational and uncontrollable thought disorders these activities cannot be acts for purposes of establishing liability for assault and battery.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We note that we have not been referred to any evidence indicating that the defendant\u2019s acts were reflexive, convulsive or epileptic. Furthermore, under the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 2, \u201cact\u201d is used \u201cto denote an external manifestation of the actor\u2019s will and does not include any of its results, even the most direct, immediate, and intended.\u201d Comment b to this section provides in pertinent part: \u201cA muscular reaction is always an act unless it is a purely reflexive reaction in which the mind and will have no share.\u201d Although the trial court found that the defendant could not form a rational choice, it did find that he could make a schizophrenic or crazy choice. Moreover, a rational choice is not required since \u201c[a]n insane person may have an intent to invade the interests of another, even though his reasons and motives for forming that intention may be entirely irrational.\u201d 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 895J, comment c. The following example is given in the Restatement to illustrate the application of comment c: \u201cA, who is insane believes that he is Napoleon Bonaparte, and that B, his nurse, who confines him in his room, is an agent of the Duke of Wellington, who is endeavoring to prevent his arrival on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the field of Waterloo in time to win the battle. Seeking to escape, he breaks off the leg of a chair, attacks B with it and fractures her skull. A is subject to liability to B for battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We recognize that the defendant made conflicting statements about the incident when discussing the homicide. At the hospital on the evening of the homicide the defendant told a police-officer that his father-in-law was a heavy drinker and that he used the beer bottle for that reason. He stated he wanted to make his father-in-law suffer for his bad habits and so that he would realize the wrong that he had done. He also told the police officer that he was a supreme being and had the power to rule the destiny of the world and could make his bed fly out of the window. When interviewed by Dr. Borden, the defendant stated that he believed that his father-in-law was a spy for the red Chinese and that he believed his father-in-law was not only going to kill him, but going to harm his infant child so that he killed his father-in-law in self-defense. The explanations given by the defendant for committing the homicide are similar to the illustration of irrational reasons and motives given in comment c to \u00a7 895J of the Restatement, set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Under these circumstances we are persuaded that the defendant\u2019s behavior at the time of the beating and shooting of Polmatier constituted an \u201cact\u201d within the meaning of comment b, \u00a7 2, of the Restatement. Following the majority rule in this case, we conclude that the trial court implicitly determined that the defendant committed an \u201cact\u201d in beating and shooting Polmatier. Accordingly, the trial court did not err as to the first prong of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The second prong of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the trial court erred in failing to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>defendant intended the resulting injury to the decedent. The defendant argues in his brief that \u201c[t]he trial court must satisfy the second prong of its intentional tort analysis with a finding that the defendant acted \u2018for the <em>purpose </em>of causing\u2019 [1 Restatement, Torts \u00a7 13, comment d] or with a <em>\u2018desire </em>to cause\u2019 [1 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 8A] the resulting injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This argument is more persuasive in its application to proof of the elements of crimes than in its relation to civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In the criminal law the \u201cact\u201d and the \u201cintent\u201d of the actor are joined to determine the culpability of the offender. For example, the allegations of the essential elements of murder are as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). The defendant claims that \u201c[i]ntent need not involve ill will or malice, but must include a design, purpose and intent to do wrong and inflict the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the Restatement, \u201cintent\u201d is used \u201cto denote that the actor desires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to cause consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 8A. Comment b to \u00a7 8A of the Restatement provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll consequences which the actor desires to bring about are intended, as the word is used in this Restatement. Intent is not, however, limited to consequences which are desired. If the actor knows that the consequences ar\u00e9 certain, or substantially certain, to result from his act, and still goes ahead, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.\u201d We have stated that \u201c[i]t is not essential that the precise injury which was done be the one intended.\u201d <em>Alteiri </em>v. <em>Colasso, </em>168 Conn. 329, 334, 362 A.2d 798 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">As discussed above, the defendant gave the police and Borden several reasons why he killed Polmatier. Under comment c to \u00a7 895J of the Restatement, it is not necessary for a defendant\u2019s reasons and motives for forming his intention to be rational in order for him to have the intent to invade the interests of another. Considering his statements to the police and to Borden that he intended to punish Polmatier and to kill him, we are persuaded that the defendant intended to beat and shoot him. Because the defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity, it is uncontested in this civil action that he was incapable of forming the intent necessary for criminal responsibility for Polmatier\u2019s death. Under General Statutes \u00a7 52-555,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ful death statute, however, intent is not an essential element of the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The remaining claims asserted by the defendant are that the trial court erred in: (1) finding the defendant liable for an intentional assault and battery where the findings of fact compelled a conclusion that the defendant lacked the requisite intent to commit an intentional assault and battery; (2) finding the defendant liable for an intentional assault and battery in the absence of any fault by the defendant; (3) imposing liability on insane persons for their tortious conduct regardless of fault, without justification on any public policy grounds; (4) applying Connecticut case law that is not conclusive regarding liability of the insane for tortious conduct; and (5) finding the defendant liable in the absence of finding of intent contrary to current Connecticut law and in violation of his right to equal protection of the laws. We have considered these claims and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative defenses, evidence of mental condition, classification, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-13. lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect as affirmative defense, (a) In any prosecution for an offense, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act or acts, lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> The trial court found for the defendant on the second and third counts. As to the second count, the trial court fround that exemplary damages based on reckless, willful and wanton misconduct are not recoverable. The trial court also found that the third count, alleging negligent assault and battery, was encompassed in the first count and did not consider the third count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> Under the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 283B is the following: \u201cComment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\u201ca. If the actor is a child, his mental deficiency is taken into account. See \u00a7 283 A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">\u201cb. The rule that a mentally deficient adult is liable for his torts is an old one, dating back at least to 1616, at a time when the action for trespass rested upon the older basis of strict liability, without regard to any fault of the individual. Apart from mere historical survival, its persistence in modem law has been explained on a number of different grounds. These are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">\u201c1. The difficulty of drawing any satisfactory line between mental deficiency and those variations of temperament, intellect, and emotional balance which cannot, as a practical matter, be taken into account in imposing liability for damage done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">\u201c2. The unsatisfactory character of the evidence of mental deficiency in many cases, together with the ease with which it can be feigned, the difficulties which the triers of fact must encounter in determining its exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tence, nature, degree, and effect; and some fear of introducing into the law of torts the confusion which has surrounded such a defense in the criminal law. Although this factor may be of decreasing importance with the continued development of medical and psychiatric science, it remains at the present time a major obstacle to any allowance for mental deficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201c3. The feeling that if mental defectives are to live in the world they should pay for the damage they do, and that it is better that their wealth, if any, should be used to compensate innocent victims than that it should remain in their hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c4. The belief that their liability will mean that those who have charge of them or their estates will be stimulated to look after them, keep them in order, and see that they do not do harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cc. Insane persons are commonly held liable for their intentional torts. While there are very few cases, the same rule has been applied to their negligence. As to mental deficiency falling short of insanity, as in the case of stupidity, lack of intelligence, excitability, or proneness to accident, no allowance is made, and the actor is held to the standard of conduct of a reasonable man who is not mentally deficient, even though it is in fact beyond his capacity to conform to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> See footnote 3, supra, for the comment pertaining to the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 283B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> The English case is <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>Hobart 134, 80 Eng.

Upon the demurrer to this plea, judgment was given to the plaintiff, the court saying that \u2018no man should be .excused of a trespass\u2019 merely because he did not intend the harm which he had caused, but must show that it was \u2018uterly without his fault,\u2019 and stating as an instance of liability without intention \u2018that if a lunatic kills a man this shall not be a felony,\u2019 because \u2018felony must be done <em>animo fel\u00f3nico.\u2019 </em>\u2018Yet in trespass which tends only to give damages according to a hurt or loss, it is not so.\u2019\u201d F.

In <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>supra, the defendant obtained a judgment against the plaintiff on a cause of action based on the plaintiffs reckless disregard of the rights of others in the operation of a motor vehicle in which the defendant\u2019s intestate was riding as a guest. After the defendant\u2019s judgment the plaintiff was adjudged as bankrupt and was duly discharged of all of his provable debts by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. Thereafter, the defendant threatened to take out execution on the judgment and to levy the same upon the property of the plaintiff and in default thereof upon his body. The plaintiff brought an action seeking to have the defendant enjoined from the threatened action. The trial court granted the injunction. The issue on appeal was whether the plaintiff\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy released him from the judgment. The United States Backruptcy Act provides that \u201c \u2018a discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are liabilities for . . . willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another.\u2019\u201d Id., 533.
