The trial court entered findings of guilty on all counts and sentenced the defendant to an effective term of ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence that had been gathered as a result of a wiretap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>on his telephones and a subsequent search of his apartment by the police. The wiretap had been authorized by an order of the wiretap panel. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d. The search had been conducted pursuant to a subsequently issued search warrant. General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">On his appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant\u2019s principal claim was that the affidavit in support of the state\u2019s application to the wiretap panel contained references to conversations that emanated from his apartment in a two family duplex house located at 200 Westfield Avenue in Bridgeport. Those conversations, he argued, were illegally overheard by an eavesdropping police officer in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. He contended, therefore, that they could not be cited in the affidavit and that, without those conversations, there was insufficient probable cause to justify the issuance of the wiretap order. Information gathered as a result of the wiretap was later used as a principal component of probable cause in an affidavit employed to obtain the search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment. The defendant argued that any evidence that had resulted from the wiretap and the search warrant should have been suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Appellate Court disagreed with the claim that there had been an illegal search, ruling that the conversations in question had not been overheard in violation of the fourth amendment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>10 Conn. App. 7, 12-13, 521 A.2d 204 (1987). It held that the trial court, consequently, did not err when it denied the defendant\u2019s supplemental motion to suppress. On petition, we granted certification limited <em>solely </em>to the following question: \u201cWere the defendant\u2019s rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tion violated by [the trial court\u2019s] failure to suppress statements overheard without the use of any aural enhancement device, by a police officer stationed in an apartment adjacent to that of the defendant?\u201d We agree with the reasoning and result reached by the Appellate Court and will comment further only briefly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The conversations in question were overheard by a detective who was assisting in an investigation of the defendant\u2019s alleged participation in illegal narcotics activity. On the evening of January 6,1984, at the time he overheard the conversations, the detective was in the apartment adjacent to that of the defendant for the specific purpose of maintaining a surveillance of the defendant. It is unquestioned that he was there with the express permission of the tenant of that adjacent apartment. While there, intermittently, over a period of some three hours, from a distance not closer than twelve to eighteen inches to the common wall dividing the two apartments,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the detective overheard incriminating conversations. It is undisputed that the detective did not employ electronic aids or sensory enhancing devices of any kind and that the conversations were heard with the \u201cnaked ear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The general rule is that what a government agent perceives with his or her unaided senses, when lawfully present in a place where he or she has a right to be, is not an illegal search under the fourth amendment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>738 F.2d 538, 543 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>641 F.2d 1321, 1324 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agapito, </em>620 F.2d 324, 330-31 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 834, 101 S.

Ed. 2d 576 (1967), it is clear that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d The protection that the fourth amendment affords \u201cpeople,\u201d however, generally requires a reference to \u201cplace\u201d to determine what degree of privacy can be expected and whether that expectation is one society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>supra, 542; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 137-38 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agapito, </em>supra, 331; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 1052; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisch, </em>474 F.2d 1071, 1078 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 921, 93 S. Ct. 2742, 37 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Persons, such as the defendant, residing in an apartment, or persons staying in a hotel or motel have the same fourth amendment rights to protection from <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures and the same <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy as do the residents of any dwelling. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>supra, 544; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra; <em>Ponce </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>409 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Ponce </em>v. <em>California, </em>397 U.S. 1012, 90 S. Ct. 1241, 25 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1970). That right honors the justifiable expectation that if their conversations are conducted in a manner undetectable outside their room or resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>dence by the electronically unaided ear they will not be intercepted. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>624 F.2d 95, 100 (10th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 954, 101 S. Ct. 361, 66 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1980). The shared atmosphere and the nearness of one\u2019s neighbors in a hotel or motel or apartment in a multiple family dwelling, however, diminish the degree of privacy that one can reasonably expect or that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agapito, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>supra. The occupant of any such facility who speaks in tones discernible to a neighbor or to a neighbor\u2019s invitee who may be expected to be only inches away on the other side of a common wall does not have an objectively reasonable expectation that what is said will not fall on alien ears. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>supra, 1325; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Conversations carried on in any type of residence, or anywhere for that matter, in a tone audible to the unaided ear of a person located in a place where that person has a right to be, and where a person can be expected to be, are conversations knowingly exposed to the public. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Muckenthaler, </em>584 F.2d 240, 245 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>509 F.2d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 967, 95 S. Ct. 1958, 44 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1975); <em>Ponce </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>supra, 625; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Llanes, </em>398 F.2d 880, 884 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1032, 89 S. Ct. 647, 21 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1969); see W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 2.3 (c), p. 392. Conversations knowingly exposed to the public are not within the penumbra of fourth amendment protection. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 351; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Muckenthaler, </em>supra. The type of dwelling is inconsequential except insofar as its physical attributes increase the vulnerability of its occupants to eavesdropping by the unaided ear. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The simple fact is that we \u201cdo not live in a vacuum.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>supra, 542. One who is insensitive to his surroundings and indiscriminate in his conversation bears the risk of being overheard by an eavesdropper. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taborda, </em>supra, 137-38; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 1054; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Llanes, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018It is the kind of risk we necessarily assume whenever we speak.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 303, 87 S. Ct. 408, 17 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1966), reh. denied, 386 U.S. 940, 87 S. Ct. 970, 17 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1967), quoting <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, 465, 83 S. Ct. 1381, 10 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1963) (Brennan, J., dissenting). \u201cEavesdropping from a place where [an] officer has a right to be is a long-accepted technique of crime detection, not outlawed by the Fourth Amendment. If Katz had talked loud enough to be overheard his expectation of privacy would be gone.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The defendant believes that a different rule should apply to multiple family dwellings in general and duplex apartments in particular.

Healey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">concurring. I agree with the result reached and with most of the rationale for reaching this result. I write separately only to articulate briefly my view on some broad language used in the majority opinion that is sweeping with reference to the right and reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In this case, the defendant, despite the fact that the statement involved was made in his own home and not in a transitory housing arrangement such as a hotel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>or motel, \u201ctalked loud enough to be overheard [so that] his expectation of privacy [was] gone.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>509 F.2d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 967, 95 S. Ct. 1958, 44 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1975). As the majority notes, \u201c[o]ne who is insensitive to his surroundings and indiscriminate in his conversation bears the risk of being overheard by an eavesdropper,\u201d so circumstanced as was the police eavesdropper in this case. The facts of this case justify the result reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">I do not agree with the majority when it says that \u201c[p]ersons, such as the defendant, residing in an apartment, or persons staying in a hotel or motel have the same fourth amendment rights to protection from <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures and the same <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy , as do the residents of any dwelling.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Other language in the opinion implies that such a grouping, i.e., hotel, motel or apartment, is constitutionally valid without any distinction as to whether it is transitory or permanent. Indeed, \u201cit is the fact that hotels, as opposed to residences, are truly transitory places.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>738 F.2d 538, 544 (2d Cir. 1984). But as <em>Mankani </em>points out: \u201c[I]t is the transitory nature of such places [hotels and motels], commonly understood as such, that diminishes a person\u2019s justifiable expectation of privacy in them.\u201d Id. That the threshold for determining what is a reasonable expectation of privacy is higher, in the first instance, where one resides and where his \u201ceffects\u201d are than in \u201ctruly transitory places\u201d such as hotels or motels, is illustrated by precedent. For example, \u201cthe sanctity of private dwellings [is] ordinarily afforded the most stringent Fourth Amendment protection\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 561, 96 S. Ct. 3074, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116 (1976); and the fourth amendment \u201cwas intended to protect against invasions of \u2018the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u2019 <em>Boyd </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 630 [6 S. Ct. 524, 29 L. Ed. 746 (1886)].\u201d <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 301, 87 S. Ct. 1642, 18 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It is not wholly correct then to say, or intimate, that the defendant, a resident in an apartment (actually \u201ca duplex apartment in a side-by-side two-family house\u201d in Bridgeport), or persons staying in a hotel or motel have the same reasonable expectation of privacy under the fourth amendment as \u201cdo the residents of any dwelling.\u201d In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>588 F.2d 1046, 1053, reh. denied, 591 F.2d 1343 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 941, 99 S. Ct. 2882, 61 L. Ed. 2d 310 (1979), cited by the majority, for example, the court said that \u201cdespite the fact that an individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights do not evaporate when he rents a motel room, the extent of the privacy he is entitled to reasonably expect may very well diminish.\u201d Then again, \u201cone\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in the home is entitled to a unique sensitivity from federal courts.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>572 F.2d 412, 422 (2d Cir. 1978). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agapito, </em>620 F.2d 324, 331 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 834, 101 S. Ct. 107, 66 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1980), also cited by the majority, the court acknowledges that \u201cthe reasonable expectation of privacy in a hotel room differs from those in a residence.\u201d Because of these recognized constitutional distinctions we should carefully factor the formulation set out in Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.

This, I suggest, has not been sufficiently stressed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Nevertheless, I agree with the result reached. The eavesdropping officer overheard the defendant with his naked ear in a place where he was legally situated.
