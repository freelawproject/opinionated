The defendant, Harry Torres, was originally charged with the crime of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the trial court, <em>Corrigan, J., </em>ruled that the state had failed to establish probable cause to proceed with this charge, the state filed a substitute information charging the defendant with manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the defendant unsuccessfully moved that his case be dismissed or transferred back to juvenile court, he pleaded nolo contendere to the substitute information and was sentenced to a term of twenty years imprisonment to be followed by three years probation. The defendant has appealed the propriety of the proceedings leading to his conviction of manslaughter on the regular criminal docket of the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Court. We find error and remand for retransfer and further proceedings in Juvenile Matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The state recited the following factual basis for the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere at the time it was accepted by the trial court. On November 23, 1983, the defendant became involved in a fight with the victim on Beaver Street in New Britain. The defendant broke away from the fight and shortly thereafter returned with a shotgun. During the ensuing struggle over the shotgun, it discharged a shot, which struck the victim in the chest. Six days later, the victim died of the shotgun wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Although the defendant was only fifteen years old at the time he allegedly committed this offense, the state sought to have him tried for murder. Upon his arrest by warrant on December 29, 1983, the defendant was brought to Superior Court, geographical area number 15, where an information had been filed charging him with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a. The trial court, <em>L. Dorsey, J., </em>ordered him transferred to Juvenile Matters in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, a petition of alleged delinquency was filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-128<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the prosecutor for Juvenile Matters moved to have the defendant transferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>regular criminal docket in accordance with \u00a7 46b-127. The defendant objected to the transfer on the ground that the transfer provisions were unconstitutional. The court, <em>Covello, J., </em>overruled the objection and, on February 15, 1984, after holding the hearing mandated by \u00a7 46b-127, found probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed murder and ordered him transferred to the regular criminal docket.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In subsequent proceedings in the regular criminal docket, the trial court, <em>Corrigan, J., </em>held the probable cause hearing that is constitutionally required on a charge of murder<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that the state had failed to establish probable cause that the defendant had intended to commit murder. The state thereafter, over the defendant\u2019s objection, filed a substitute information charging him with manslaughter with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-55a (a). In response, the defendant moved for dismissal of the substitute information or for transfer of the case back to the docket of Juvenile Matters. The trial court, <em>E. O\u2019Connell, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion on the ground that the statutory transfer scheme did not specify failure to find probable cause as a ground for resumption of juvenile status. The defendant then entered a nolo contendere plea to the manslaughter charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>In his appeal from his manslaughter conviction, the defendant has raised three issues. He claims that: (1) the trial court erred in not dismissing the criminal charge against him or retransferring him to Juvenile Matters; (2) the juvenile transfer judge erred in originally transferring him from Juvenile Matters; and (3) the juvenile transfer judge erred in finding the juvenile transfer statutes constitutional. Our conclusion that the trial court erred in failing to transfer the defendant back to Juvenile Matters after it determined that there was no probable cause to support the charge of murder renders moot the defendant\u2019s additional claims, which we, accordingly, decline to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Prior to turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s first claim, we must determine whether the defendant properly reserved it for review on appeal from the judgment ensuing from his plea of nolo contendere. The defendant proposes three independent bases for review: (1) the defendant\u2019s appeal complies with the provision of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that permits a conditional plea of nolo contendere to reserve issues raised by a motion to dismiss; (2) his claimed right to dismissal or retransfer involves a challenge to the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and can therefore be raised at any time; or (3) this court should review his claim in the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>of its inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice. Because we agree with the first of these assertions of appellate jurisdiction, we need not consider the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Under \u00a7 54-94a, a defendant may enter a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal either from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search and seizure or from the denial of a motion to dismiss. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 415, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 473, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 98, 503 A.2d 136 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state concedes that, in pleading nolo contendere, the defendant in this case relied upon \u00a7 54-94a.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The state argues nonetheless that the motion by which the defendant sought the return of his case to Juvenile Matters is not a motion to dismiss whose denial can be appealed under \u00a7 54-94a.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>state\u2019s reading of the motion, it is either a motion to transfer whose denial is not appealable under \u00a7 54-94a or a motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds whose merits are appealable without regard to \u00a7 54-94a. On the latter construction of the defendant\u2019s motion, the state urges us to hold that a denial of retransfer does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction. According to the state, therefore, no matter how the defendant\u2019s motion is construed, the defendant is precluded from appellate review of its denial by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We decline to take as formalistic a view of the pleading in question as the state would have us espouse. Although not captioned a motion to dismiss, the defendant\u2019s motion requested the trial court to \u201cdismiss the instant case, or make whatever other Order the Court deems appropriate\u201d and set forth as a basis for such relief that the defendant should be held to answer to the charge of manslaughter in the Juvenile Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 et seq. The trial court, moreover, treated the defendant\u2019s motion as a motion to dismiss. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion qualified as a motion to dismiss for the purposes of appellate review under \u00a7 54-94a.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or transfer, we must examine the relevant provisions of the statutes governing juvenile transfers. The parties are in accord that the crucial language for us to interpret is contained in the last two sentences of \u00a7 46b-127, which provide: \u201cUpon the effectuation of the transfer [from the juvenile docket], [a] child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if he were sixteen years of age. If the action is dismissed or nolled or if such child is found innocent of the charge for which he was transferred, the child shall resume his status as a juvenile until he attains the age of sixteen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In its memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court relied on a literal reading of the authorization in \u00a7 46b-127 for resumption of juvenile status. The court held that a finding of lack of probable cause that the defendant had committed murder was not a dismissal, a nolle, or an acquittal. Accordingly, it concluded that the defendant\u2019s case should remain on the regular criminal docket and that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the substitute information filed by the state should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On appeal, the parties have stated the determinative issue somewhat differently than at trial. Does \u00a7 46b-127 contemplate a defendant\u2019s return to juvenile status once a decision has been made that the defendant will not be further prosecuted on the <em>particular </em>charge underlying his transfer to the regular criminal docket or must resumption of juvenile status await final disposition in his or her favor of the case <em>as a </em>whole? The defendant urges us to conclude that a finding of no probable cause to support the charge of murder was the functional equivalent of a nolle or an acquittal on <em>that </em>charge, which entitled him to \u201cresume his status as a juvenile.\u201d The state maintains, to the contrary, that once a valid transfer to the regular criminal docket has occurred, \u00a7 46b-127 anticipates resumption of juvenile status only on future, unrelated occasions in which the defendant is alleged to have engaged in conduct potentially subjecting him to criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In approaching these alternate readings of \u00a7 46b-127, we must take into account the well established rule of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed in a manner that gives effect to the apparent intention of the legislature. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverberg, </em>200 Conn. 367, 370-71, 511 A.2d 336 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986). To discern this intent, we consider the language of the statute as well as its legislative history. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverberg, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>371; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673-74. \u201cMindful of inherent statutory interrelationships, futhermore, we endeavor \u2018to read the statute as a whole and so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible.\u2019 <em>Grodis </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>190 Conn. 39, 44, 459 A.2d 994 (1983).\u201d <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverberg, </em>supra. A penal statute must be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 352, 456 A.2d 305 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Although the last sentence of \u00a7 46b-127, when read in isolation, is not free from ambiguity, when read in conjunction with the juvenile transfer scheme as a whole, \u00a7\u00a7 46b-145,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 46b-126,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 46b-127, the statutory language supports the construction that the defendant urges upon us. Taken together, these statutes reflect the legislature\u2019s intent to correlate the seriousness of an offense charged with the juvenile\u2019s susceptibility to transfer to the regular criminal docket. In the circumstances of this case, the statutes require a construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tion of \u00a7 46b-127 that mandates the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal and the retransfer of his case to the juvenile docket for further consideration of the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The juvenile transfer statutes establish a detailed plan for transferring a case to the regular criminal docket. Two statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 46b-127 and 46b-126, are central to this plan. For present purposes, the more directly relevant statute is \u00a7 46b-127, which provides for mandatory transfer to the regular criminal docket of any juvenile, who was at least fourteen years old at the time of the offense charged, in two sets of circumstances. For a juvenile \u201creferred for the commission of a murder under sections 53a-54a to 53a-54d, inclusive,\u201d transfer follows upon a judicial finding, after a hearing, that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the act for which he is charged.\u201d For a juvenile \u201creferred for the violation of any provision of title 53a which is designated as a class A felony\u201d such a finding of probable cause mandates transfer only if \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>child has previously been adjudicated a delinquent at any age for a violation of any provision of title 53a, which at the time of such violation was designated a class A felony; or . . . for the violation of any provision of title 53a which is designated as a class B felony . . . provided such child has previously been adjudicated delinquent for two violations of any provision of title 53a, which at the time of such violations were designated a class A or B felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">By contrast, \u00a7 46b-126 allows the court to transfer children \u201creferred for the commission of a class A felony, or for any serious juvenile offense designated as a class B or C felony if such child has previously been adjudicated a delinquent for a serious juvenile offense, as defined in section 46b-120,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provided such child has attained the age of fourteen at the time the alleged delinquent act was committed.\u201d For this enlarged class of crimes, however, \u00a7 46b-126 permits a discretionary transfer only when a court, after a hearing, makes findings more extensive than those required by \u00a7 46b-127. Under \u00a7 46b-126, a court must find probable cause not only that the child has committed the crime charged but also that the child is unamenable to treatment in available juvenile care and treatment facilities and that the child has demonstrated his dangerousness to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In transferring the defendant\u2019s case to the regular criminal docket, the trial court, <em>Covello, J., </em>acting pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>suant to \u00a7 46b-127, found only that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed \u201cthe act for which he [was] charged,\u201d the crime of murder. In light of this limited finding, we hold that \u00a7 46b-127 required a transfer of the defendant back to Juvenile Matters after it had been found that there was no probable cause to believe he had committed murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">To conclude otherwise would eviscerate the statutory transfer plan established by the legislature. Permitting the state to substitute a charge of manslaughter under \u00a7 53a-55a (b), a class B felony, would allow it to bypass the statutory safeguards that the legislature has attached to regular prosecutions of juveniles for such a crime. Had the defendant originally been referred to the Superior Court for manslaughter, he could not have been transferred to the regular criminal docket without additional judicial findings under \u00a7 46b-127 with regard to his prior involvement in the juvenile justice system or under \u00a7 46b-126 with regard to his prior history, amenability to treatment, and dangerousness to society. We perceive no basis, and the state has provided none, for treating this defendant differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The inferences to be drawn from the duality of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-127 and 46b-126 serve also to refute the state\u2019s alternate contention that because manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder, a valid transfer of a juvenile on a charge of murder automatically subsumes continued regular criminal proceedings on a charge of manslaughter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The state\u2019s argument over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>states our law of lesser included offenses. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 398-408, 429 A.2d 919 (1980), we reviewed the relationship between a charge of murder and a conviction of manslaughter. That relationship finds its basis in the statutory mandate of \u00a7 53a-45 (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even when that statute is fully applicable, we noted that an instruction on a lesser degree of homicide than that charged would not always be appropriate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 407-408. For present purposes, it suffices to recognize that the legislative mandate of \u00a7 53a-45 (c) must be read in conjunction with the mandate of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-127 and 46b-126. In these latter sections, the legislature established, for juveniles, specific distinctions between lesser and more serious offenses and prescribed transfer criteria reflecting these distinctions. As a matter of statutory construction, specific statutory provisions are presumed to prevail over more general statutory provisions dealing with the same overall subject matter. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 623-24, 441 A.2d 600 (1981); <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 635, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975). We conclude, therefore, that the legislature did not intend the transfer of a juvenile on a charge of mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>der to encompass his subsequent prosecution on a charge of manslaughter when probable cause for the murder charge is found to have been lacking.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>173 Conn. 414, 419, 378 A.2d 528 (1977), does not compel a different result. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>supra, we held with regard to General Statutes \u00a7 17-60a, the precursor of \u00a7 46b-126,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that once a defendant was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court, he lost his juvenile status and the benefits that attended it. The defendant in that case, however, did not contest the Superior Court\u2019s authority over him; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>supra, 416 n.1; consequently, it was unnecessary for us to consider the circumstances under which a defendant could regain his juvenile status.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Our holding comports with the policies underlying the juvenile justice system as a whole. Section 46b-145 provides that \u201c[n]o child shall be prosecuted for an offense before the superior court, nor shall the adjudication of such court that a child is delinquent in any case be deemed a conviction of a crime except as provided in sections 46b-126 and 46b-127.\u201d The General Assembly thus has expressed a preference for shielding children from criminal liability except in clearly circumscribed situations. The additional protections afforded juveniles, which include separation of juvenile matters from other business of the Superior Court; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-122; confidential proceedings; General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u00a7 46b-122; anonymity; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-124; and erasure of police and court records; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-146; demonstrate the legislature\u2019s intent that children accused of wrongdoing be accorded different treatment from adults. Our construction of \u00a7 46b-127 is consistent with this manifest concern.The trial court was thus in error when it denied the defendant\u2019s request to return his case to the docket for Juvenile Matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We are mindful that the defendant has raised claims of error beyond those encompassed by his motion to dismiss or transfer. In our view, however, our disposition of his transfer motion renders further consideration of these claims unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In light of our order that the defendant be transferred back to the docket for Juvenile Matters, we need not consider his second claim that the transfer from the docket for Juvenile Matters to the regular criminal docket was not valid. Even were we to agree that the transfer was invalid, we could grant the defendant no further relief. \u201c \u2018It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisidiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arnold Bernhard &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>194 Conn. 152, 158, 479 A.2d 801 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Macri, </em>189 Conn. 568, 569, 456 A.2d 1203 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">It is likewise unnecessary for us to consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 46b-127. As a result of the relief granted, the defendant is no longer subject to criminal liability pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127. It is not clear, at this juncture, whether the state will seek to have the defendant transferred again to the regular criminal docket on a manslaugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ter charge under either \u00a7 46b-127 or \u00a7 46b-126; it is thus possible that further proceedings will not depend on either statute. In concluding that resolution of the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-127 through the vehicle of this appeal is not appropriate, we \u201cfollow the recognized policy of self-restraint and the basic judicial duty to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>180 Conn. 153, 166, 429 A.2d 841 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate the plea, transfer the defendant back to the docket for Juvenile Matters and dismiss the substitute information.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 defines \u201cchild\u201d as \u201cany person under sixteen years of age.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 46b-127, as amended by Public Acts 1983, No. 83-402, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201c(Formerly Sec. 51-308). child charged WITH MURDER OR FELONY TRANSFERRED TO REGULAR CRIMINAL DOCKET, when.

App. 41, 602 P.2d 871 (1979); <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 A.2d 876 (D.C. App. 1987); <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>United States, </em>521 A.2d 1150 (D.C.

All the cases cited by the state, moreover, involved statutes that differ significantly from the statute at issue in the instant case and framed the issue that they addressed in terms of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over a juvenile defendant. In contrast, we have held that, under our statutory scheme, transfer from the docket of Juvenile Matters to the regular criminal docket does not implicate the Superior Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 331-32, 537 A.2d 483 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-45. murder: penalty; waiver of jury TRIAL; FINDING OF LESSER DEGREE. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201c(c) The court or jury before which any person indicted for murder or held to answer for murder after a hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 54-46a is tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> We need not address today the defendant\u2019s further claims about other scenarios that may develop after a juvenile defendant is transferred to the regular criminal docket on a murder charge.
