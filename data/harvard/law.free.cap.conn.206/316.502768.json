The deficiencies in the defendants\u2019 brief and oral argument are so pervasive and fundamental that they make a mockery of responsible appellate advocacy. The defendants\u2019 brief does not challenge the court\u2019s uncontroverted findings, but the defendants claimed in oral argument that such an attack is \u201cinherent\u201d in their myriad constitutional claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These constitutional claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>totally incoherent and unintelligible. We conclude that meaningful appellate review is precluded in this case, and, therefore, find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On August 6, 1986, the plaintiff, the commissioner of health services, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-491 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 19a-503,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a petition for enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ment seeking to enjoin the defendants from operating two unlicensed health care facilities. The defendants filed an answer and twenty special defenses alleging a cornucopia of state and federal constitutional claims. On December 9, 1986, the trial court granted the plaintiffs application for a permanent injunction. The trial court found: that the named defendant, Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., manages and operates the Youth Challenge Ranch (Ranch) in Moosup, and the Youth Challenge Girls\u2019 Home (Girls\u2019 Home) in Hartford; that the defendant Louie Collazo is the director of the Ranch; that the defendant Christian F. Poulsen, Jr., is the director of the Girls\u2019 Home; that the Ranch is a drug and alcohol treatment facility operating without a license; that the Girls\u2019 Home is a drug treatment facility operating without a license; and that these facilities are required to be licensed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-491 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The court also found that the defendants did not prove their special defenses, which the court summarized as a claim of \u201ca violation of the free exercise of religion clause.\u201d The defendants presented no evidence at the trial and did not cross-examine the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The defendants have challenged none of the facts found by the trial court. In March, 1986, inspectors from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the department of health services made unannounced visits to the Girls\u2019 Home and the Ranch to determine whether they were operating unlicensed facilities. Their investigation disclosed the named defendant corporation\u2019s tax returns which listed, under \u201cProgram,\u201d its licensed facility at its headquarters at 15-17 May Street, Hartford, the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home. The named defendant corporation\u2019s tax returns described the Girls\u2019 Home as a \u201cdrug rehabilitation program.\u201d The brochure given to the plaintiff described the program as a drug program with the purpose of \u201cinstilling in the drug dependent person, the incentive to forsake his drug habit for the pursuit of a new life.\u201d The Girls\u2019 Home provides a supervised and supportive living situation for drug abusive or dependent persons. All nine of the residents of the home at the time of the inspection had current drug abuse problems. The services provided by the Girls\u2019 Home include detoxification from drugs, storage of medication, a supervised and supportive living situation for drug abusive or drug dependent persons, treatment and rehabilitative programs, assessment of the residents\u2019 physical and psychological condition and referral for medical care, psychiatric evaluation and continuing treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The named defendant corporation\u2019s tax returns under \u201cProgram\u201d also listed the Ranch and described it as a \u201cdrug rehabilitative program.\u201d The brochure for the Ranch describes it as a \u201cResident Drug Program\u201d and as a \u201cResidential Rehabilitative program for Troubled Youth particularly those addicted to drugs (alcohol included).\u201d The Ranch is the \u201cPhase II level of treatment\u201d following the induction phase at the May Street facility. Twelve out of thirteen residents had drug histories and nine out of thirteen had alcohol dependency problems. Services provided by the Ranch include: planned treatment and rehabilitation programs inclusive of individual, group, social and domestic counsel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ling; training and vocational rehabilitation; referral for continuing treatment and/or medical care; dietary services; central storage of medication and administration of medication; assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and psychological condition to determine appropriateness for admission; and ongoing assessments to determine a program of the individual toward maintaining alcohol and/or drug free status and learning to return to the community without the use of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In the defendants\u2019 appeal from the judgment based on these findings by the trial court, they have entirely failed to comply with our rules of practice. The defendants\u2019 \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d is in flagrant violation of our rules of practice. Practice Book \u00a7 4065 provides that \u201cthe appellant\u2019s brief shall contain the following .... (c) A statement of the nature of the proceedings and of the facts of the case. The statement of facts shall be in narrative form, and shall be supported by appropriate references to the page or pages of the record or transcript upon which the party relies. The statement of facts should not be detailed or voluminous but must be confined strictly to facts bearing upon the questions raised. An appellant may not rely upon any fact unless it is set forth in his statement of facts or is incorporated into his brief in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201c(d) The argument, divided under appropriate headings into as many parts as there are points to be presented, with appropriate references to the statement of facts or to the page or pages of the record or transcript.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The defendants claim in the statement of facts that \u201cthe question raised in this case of whether government health care orthodoxy preempts the Grace of God is not a new question.\u201d There follows a lengthy quotation from the Bible. There is no statement of facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>narrative form nor is there any reference to the record or transcript upon which the defendants rely. The defendants do not even accept the statement of facts made by the plaintiff based upon the trial court\u2019s unchallenged findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u201cWe are unable to consider the [defendants\u2019] appeal on its merits because of the failure of the [defendants] to provide us with an adequate appellate record. We do not decide issues of law in a vacuum. In order to review an alleged error of law that has evidentiary implications, we must have before us the evidence that is the factual predicate for the legal issue that the appellants] [ask] us to consider. It is the responsibility of the appellants] to provide us with an appellate record that adequately supports [their] claim of error.

The brief merely lists summaries of many cases with no attempt to relate them to the constitutional issues claimed on appeal. The defendants\u2019 overriding claim apparently is that the state\u2019s regulation of their facilities interferes with their free exercise of religion. They cite no facts in the record to establish the religious nature of the two facilities involved in this cas\u00e9. Each of the defendants\u2019 ten claims of constitutional error refers to the \u201cdefendants and their Church Mission congregations.\u201d There is not a shred of evidence in this record as to the existence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>operation of any such church mission congregations. The mere statement by counsel of such a situation at the two unlicensed facilities obviously does not establish any facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">As briefed, none of the defendants\u2019 claims of error raises an issue amenable to appellate review. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-3), </em>3 Conn. App. 194, 197, 485 A.2d 1369, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 801, 491 A.2d 1105 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Healey, J., concurred in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> The defendants\u2019 statement of issues follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">\u201cI.
