We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law de novo while granting <em>Chevron</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>deference to its reasonable interpretations of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-24\">Mora now apparently concedes his inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) but contends that Congress did not intend for such inadmissibility to affect his ability to seek adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i), relying on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla-Caldera v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir.2005), as well as the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Acosta v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 550 (9th Cir.2006). As Mora acknowledges, we have previously upheld as reasonable the BIA\u2019s interpretation that compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 1255(i) does not cure inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 256. This court is aware the Ninth and Tenth Circuits hold otherwise, but that is not the law in this circuit. <em>See Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., </em>151 F.3d 402, 411 n. 3 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-25\">Mora\u2019s arguments are foreclosed. <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 256. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-27\">. <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.
