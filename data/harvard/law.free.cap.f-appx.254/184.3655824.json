Suggs was sentenced to thirty-two years of imprisonment. On appeal, Suggs\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising as potential issues whether the district court fully complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, whether the Government breached the plea agreement by not moving for downward departure, and whether Suggs\u2019 sentence was reasonable. Although advised of his right to do so, Suggs has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">Counsel first raises the issue of whether the district court fully complied with Rule 11, but identifies no error in the Rule 11 proceeding. After a thorough review of the record, we find the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">Counsel next asserts that Suggs provided substantial assistance to the Government and thus the Government was required to move for a downward departure. The Government was not obligated under its plea agreement to file such a motion, <em>see United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000), and there is no indication that it refused to make the motion based on an unconstitutional motive such as race or religion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Rather, Suggs failed a polygraph test, thereby failing \u201cto be fully truthful and forthright\u201d as required under the terms of the plea agreement. Thus, Suggs failed to fully cooperate under the provisions of the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>agreement as required for the Government to consider filing a motion for downward departure. We therefore find the Government did not breach the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Suggs next questions whether his sentence was reasonable. This court will affirm a sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence). We find the district court\u2019s imposition of the statutory mandatory minimum sentences on each count, which were statutorily required to be served consecutively, after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
