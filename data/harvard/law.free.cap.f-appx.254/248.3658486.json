Dr. Scranage claims the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on an alleged oral conferral of immunity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Courts may enforce informal grants of transactional immunity under the concept of equitable immunity where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(1) an agreement was made; (2) the defendant has performed on his side; and (3) the subsequent prosecution is directly related to offenses in which the defendant, pursuant to the agreement, either assisted with the investigation or testified for the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>United States v. McHan, </em>101 F.3d 1027, 1034 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Rowe v. Griffin, </em>676 F.2d 524, 527-28 (11th Cir.1982)). We have reviewed the entire record and find no basis for reversing the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was no agreement between the parties to confer immunity on Dr. Scranage.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
