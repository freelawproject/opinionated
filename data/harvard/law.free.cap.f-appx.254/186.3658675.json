Smith\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that his sentence is unreasonable because, although it is within the guidelines range calculated by the district court and would otherwise be entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), his guidelines range was incorrectly calculated. Namely, Smith asserts that the district court clearly erred in determining his relevant conduct for purposes of calculating his base offense level when it relied on a witness\u2019s prior unsworn statement attributing fifty ounces of cocaine to Smith, rather than the witness\u2019s later sworn testimony at the sentencing hearing attributing only five ounces of cocaine to Smith. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations underlying its drug quantity calculations for clear error. <em>See United States v. Fletcher, </em>74 F.3d 49, 55 (4th Cir.1996). A factual finding will be considered clearly erroneous only \u201cwhen although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). In calculating the amount of drugs to attribute to a defendant, \u201cthe court may consider relevant information ..., provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1021 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks, citation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in calculating Smith\u2019s guidelines range. The district court\u2019s decision to credit the witness\u2019s prior unsworn statement was a credibility determination and is therefore not reviewable on appeal. <em>See Columbus-Am. Discovery Group v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., </em>56 F.3d 556, 567 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cAbsent extraordinary circumstances, we will not disturb a factfinder\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Locklear, </em>829 F.2d 1314, 1317 (4th Cir.1987) (stating that this court will decline to overturn a factual determination founded on witness demeanor and credibility absent compelling evidence to the contrary). Because it was reasonable for the district court to credit the witness\u2019s prior statement, made closer in time to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>events in question and which was against the witness\u2019s penal interest, we conclude that no extraordinary circumstances are present mandating us to disturb the district couit\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
