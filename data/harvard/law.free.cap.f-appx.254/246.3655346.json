He was sentenced to four years on the DUI offense and three years on the remaining count, to be served consecutively. McNair\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether McNair\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Although informed of his right to do so, McNair has not filed a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">McNair did not object to his sentence; thus, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 284 (4th Cir.2003). The Sentencing Guidelines apply to assimilated crimes, and the Guideline sentence for such crimes must fall within the minimum and maximum terms set by state law. <em>United States v. Young, </em>916 F.2d 147, 150 (4th Cir.1990). If, as here, there is no analogous guideline, the provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) control. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2X5.1 comment, (back\u2019d) (2006). In addition, review is limited in this case to whether the sentence was imposed in violation of the law or is plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4) (2000). Given the court\u2019s consideration of McNair\u2019s prior convictions and history of alcohol abuse, as well as the remaining \u00a7 3553 factors, the sentence, which is below the maximum, is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for potential errors and have found none. Therefore, we affirm McNair\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
