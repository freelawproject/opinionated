Hill appeals his sentence following his guilty plea conviction of one count of healthcare fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1347, and one count of distributing or dispensing or causing to dispense a controlled substance, when said act of dispensing and causing to be dispensed was not in the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Hill challenges the amount of drugs attributed to him in calculating his sentence. Hill also challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a non-Guideline sentence as to the latter count\u2014 200 months of imprisonment\u2014which was 49 months above the advisory guideline range maximum of 151 months as calculated in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>We review the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its \u201cinterpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Ponce, </em>917 F.2d 841, 842 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cThe sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cAs a general rule, information in the presentence report is presumed reliable and may be adopted by the district court without further inquiry if the defendant fails to demonstrate by competent rebuttal evidence that the information is materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 287 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see United States v. Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 767 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Hill argues that the district court erred when it based his offense level and sentence on conduct that was not part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. In determining a defendant\u2019s base offense level, the district court may consider drug quantities not specified in the count of conviction if they are part of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Burke, </em>431 F.3d 883, 888 (5th Cir.2005). Relevant conduct includes acts that were part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d or the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d as the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). Hill failed to present any evidence to rebut the information contained in the presentencing report or the evidence adduced at sentencing by Government witnesses regarding the amount of drugs attributable to him. The record reflects that Hill wrote prescriptions for addictive painkillers to patients he had not examined and also billed the patients and their insurance companies. At all times, Hill\u2019s victims were his patients and Hill acted with a common purpose-to dispense controlled substances in a manner not consistent with a legitimate medical purpose and not within the usual course of a physician\u2019s practice. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s factual-finding regarding the drug quantity was not clearly erroneous in light of the record as whole. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Hill also argues that the district court failed to properly consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when it imposed a non-Guideline sentence. Contrary to Hill\u2019s assertions, the district court made specific findings regarding the nature and circumstances of the offense as well as the history and characteristics of the defendant when it found that Hill placed his patients at risk when he left the country and permitted non-medically trained staff to fill out pre-signed blank prescriptions and also permitted them to distribute postdated prescriptions. As the district court found, in light of the degree of the abuse of his position of trust and his medical license, the court also considered the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment. The district court found that Hill\u2019s behavior was more than just abusing his position of trust as a doctor, he was a \u201cdrug dealer with a medical license.\u201d The court also considered the need for adequate deterrence and warned other doctors of the dangers of practicing medicine in the manner the defendant practiced. The court considered the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant in light of the harm that Hill had caused the community and the profession of medicine. The court deviated because it felt that the facts of case fell outside the heartland of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>cases. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d 531, 535-36 (5th Cir.2007). Hill has not shown that the district court misapplied the Guidelines, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, failed to give reasons for the sentence, or considered improper factors in imposing the sentence. Therefore, he has not shown that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. <em>See id </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
