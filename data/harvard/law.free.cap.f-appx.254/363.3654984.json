Ramon-Salgado argues that the district court failed to make adequate factual findings to support its decision to deny him safety valve relief and that the district court erred in denying him safety valve relief based upon its erroneous conclusion that the Government\u2019s objection to the safety valve barred it from granting or even considering the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-22\">Although application of the safety valve pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 was addressed during Roman-Salgado\u2019s sentencing hearing, Roman-Salgado did not challenge the reason the district court gave for denying the safety valve or the failure of the district court to make any factual findings in connection with its denial of the safety valve. Accordingly, we review those particular issues for plain error. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>484 F.3d 735, 744 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414-15 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">The Government\u2019s objection to the application of the safety valve did not preclude the district court from considering the safety valve. <em>See </em>\u00a7 501.2(a)(5); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(5); <em>cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s belief that it did not have the authority to consider the safety valve was error that was plain. Because of the error, the district court failed to factually develop whether Roman-Sal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>gado was entitled to the safety valve. Given the lack of factual development of the record, it is impossible to determine whether the district court\u2019s error affected Roman-Salgado\u2019s substantial rights. Therefore, Roman-Salgado\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case remanded for resentencing for the district court to consider whether he is entitled to the safety valve and resentence him accordingly. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>988 F.2d 537, 543-44 (5th Cir.1993)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We note that the judgment mistakenly states that Roman-Salgado was convicted pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. The record reflects that Roman-Salgado pleaded guilty to a violation of \u00a7 841, but that the conspiracy count under \u00a7 846 was dismissed. Accordingly, on remand, the district court is directed to correct the judgment to reflect that the only offense of conviction is 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING AND FOR CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERROR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
