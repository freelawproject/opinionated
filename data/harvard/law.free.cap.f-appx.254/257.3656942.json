On appeal, the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed the murder conviction but remanded for resentencing on the capital conviction. <em>See State v. Call, </em>349 N.C. 382, 508 S.E.2d 496 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Call was again sentenced to death. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the sentence, <em>see State v. Call, </em>353 N.C. 400, 545 S.E.2d 190 (2001), and the United States Supreme Court denied Call\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>see Call v. North Carolina, </em>534 U.S. 1046, 122 S.Ct. 628, 151 L.Ed.2d 548 (2001). After unsuccessfully challenging his conviction and sentence in state post-conviction proceedings, Call filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 2006). The district court denied relief. We granted a certificate of appealability, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (West 2006), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">On the evening of August 24, 1995, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Call went to the trailer of Macedonio and Gabriel and offered Macedonio twenty-five dollars to help him move furniture. Macedonio told Gabriel that he would \u201cbe right back\u201d and left with Call. <em>Call, </em>545 S.E.2d at 195 (internal quotation marks omitted). Call instead took Macedonio to a nearby corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>field where he robbed him and then \u201cbeat [him] to death with a shovel handle and a tire iron, tied his right foot up around his head, and tied his hands behind his back.\u201d <em>Call, </em>508 S.E.2d at 504. At some point, Call realized that Gabriel would be able to place him with the murder victim that evening and decided to eliminate Gabriel as a witness. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Call returned to the trailer and offered Gabriel twenty dollars to help him move a refrigerator. Gabriel accepted and left with Call in Call\u2019s pickup truck. Call then returned to the cornfield where he unsuccessfully attempted to kill Gabriel as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab8\">[Defendant lured Gabriel outside of the vehicle by telling him the pickup truck was stuck. As Gabriel pushed the bumper of the pickup, defendant picked up an aluminum bat and, after pretending to use the bat to lift the tire, struck Gabriel on the head. Gabriel recovered, stood up, and ran to the edge of a nearby river. Defendant ran after him briefly, then returned to the pickup truck and departed the area. Gabriel then ran into the cornfield and lay on the ground all night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">The next morning, Gabriel swam across the river and sought assistance at area homes. Eventually, Gabriel received a ride home. At approximately 7:00 p.m. on 25 August 1995, Gabriel, through an interpreter, told the trailer park owner, David Shatley, what had happened the previous night. Thereafter, law enforcement officers were contacted, and Gabriel led a search team back to the cornfield to search for [Macedonio]. When the search party arrived at the cornfield, Gabriel excitedly told the same interpreter that defendant had brought him to that location and assaulted him. After walking six to eight rows into the cornfield, law enforcement officers found a baseball cap on the ground and noticed several broken corn stalks. As they continued them search, the officers noticed a plaid shirt near the edge of the cornfield. After walking toward the shirt, the officers discovered that the shirt was on the victim\u2019s body. The victim\u2019s body was partially covered by corn stalks. The officers noted that the victim had suffered severe head injuries. The victim\u2019s right foot was tied up to his shoulder area with a yellow rope, and the victim\u2019s hands were tied behind his back with a white rope. Shatley identified the victim\u2019s body, and Gabriel identified the baseball cap as the one the victim was wearing when he left the trailer with defendant. The officers also discovered a broken stick, similar to a shovel handle, at the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">After the victim\u2019s body was found, the authorities immediately began to search for defendant. Defendant was not found at his residence. However, based on information obtained at defendant\u2019s residence, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant was arrested on 27 August 1995 in a motel room in Monroe, North Carolina. Defendant and his pickup truck were brought back to Ashe County, where officers inventoried the contents of defendant\u2019s pickup truck. Among items inventoried, officers found a bag of clothes and a steel rod that appeared to have blood and ham embedded in it. In addition, officers recovered a motel registration form in the name of \u201cRick N. Finley.\u201d A handwriting expert later determined that the registration form was written by defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Call, 545 S.E.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Shortly after the murder, police interviewed Alan Varden, who was a close friend of Call and his wife Jenny. Varden told the police that Call had discussed robbing Macedonio with him on several occasions and had attempted to recruit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Varden to help. Varden also informed the police that he was at the Call home on the evening of the murder. According to Var-den, Call came home after kidnapping Macedonio, but before returning for Gabriel, and eventually told Varden what he had done. Specifically, Call \u201ctold Varden that he had hit the victim over the head, had broken a shovel handle, and had hit the victim with a tire iron. Defendant also described how he had tied the victim\u2019s right leg and hands behind the victim\u2019s back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196. Call \u201ctold Varden he needed to go back and check the victim\u2019s pulse and that he also needed to get Gabriel,\u201d but Varden again refused to help. <em>Id. </em>Later that evening, Call returned to his home and \u201ctold Varden that he had hit Gabriel with [a] bat [belonging to Varden] but that Gabriel had gotten away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Call packed his clothes to run and he, Jenny and Varden went to Varden\u2019s home, where Call shaved his beard and mustache and left a note declaring that his wife had no knowledge of \u201cwhat might have taken place.\u201d <em>Call, </em>508 S.E.2d at 510 (internal quotation marks omitted). Call also returned the baseball bat to Varden, which Varden wiped clean, and told Varden and Jenny that he was going to Monroe or Charlotte. Varden found Call\u2019s note at his residence and gave it to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">During the guilt phase of Call\u2019s trial, Gabriel testified regarding the events of that evening, including the fact that he last saw Macedonio leaving with Call to move furniture and that Call later lured him to the cornfield under the same pretense, where Call brutally attacked him with the baseball bat. Varden also testified during the guilt phase, relating in detail the conversations he had with Call about the plan to rob Macedonio and his encounters with Call and Jenny on the evening of the murder. Steve Cabe, an agent with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, testified about the investigation of the gruesome crime scene and was also questioned and cross-examined about the statements Varden made to the authorities during that investigation. Agent Cabe\u2019s statements were admitted to corroborate Varden\u2019s incriminating testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">At the conclusion of the guilt phase, Call was convicted by the jury of first-degree murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and under the felony murder rule. The jury also found Call guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon, first-degree kidnapping, and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. At the conclusion of a separate sentencing hearing, the jury recommended a sentence of death. Call was appointed new counsel for his direct appeal. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed Call\u2019s convictions but vacated the sentence of death because the state had been allowed to impeach Call with evidence of his post-Miranda silence. The case was remanded for resentencing only. <em>See Call, </em>508 S.E.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">At the resentencing hearing, held on May 17, 1999, Call was represented by his previous trial counsel, Anthony Lynch and Donald Willey. The state presented a number of witnesses, including Dr. Thomas A. Sporn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy photographs and report prepared by Dr. Robert Thompson. Dr. Sporn testified that Macedonio\u2019s \u201cbody showed a pattern of blunt-force injuries to the head and facial area that could have been caused by a baseball bat, a shovel handle, or a tire iron.\u201d <em>Call, </em>545 S.E.2d at 196. There was \u201csplitting of the victim\u2019s skin and fracturing of the victim\u2019s skull at the forehead and beneath the left eye, as well as splitting and tearing of the skin and fracturing of the skull above the victim\u2019s ear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cDr. Sporn\u2019s opinion with regard to the number of blows the victim received was based, in part, on Dr. Thomp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>son\u2019s assessment that the victim had suffered at least eleven blows to the head.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The state did not, however, seek to reintroduce live testimony by Gabriel or Var-den. Gabriel had returned to Mexico and the state unsuccessfully attempted to return him to the United States on a temporary visa. Over Call\u2019s objection and following a fairly extensive hearing, Gabriel was declared unavailable as a witness and his recorded testimony from the guilt phase was read into evidence. Varden\u2019s guilt-phase testimony was not read into evidence, nor was he called as a live witness. Rather, the state presented Var-den\u2019s version of the events surrounding the murder solely via the testimony of SBI Agent Cabe, who again recounted the substance of what Varden had told him during interviews conducted immediately after the murder. Call\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the presentation of Varden\u2019s statements in this manner, nor was the state asked to demonstrate that Varden was unavailable as a witness. However, Call\u2019s trial counsel did cross-examine Agent Cabe regarding Varden\u2019s statements, as he had done during the guilt phase. Call did not seek to introduce Varden\u2019s recorded testimony from the guilt phase or to call Varden as a live witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">At the conclusion of the resentencing hearing, the jury found four aggravating circumstances: (1) that the murder was committed while Call was engaged in the commission of a kidnapping; (2) that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain; (3) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel; and (4) that the murder was part of a course of conduct in which Call engaged that included the commission by Call of other crimes of violence against another person. The jury found only six of twenty-three submitted mitigating circumstances, found that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances, and recommended a sentence of death, which the trial court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">On direct appeal, Call was appointed appellate counsel, who raised a number of issues but no claim that Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony regarding Varden\u2019s statements violated Call\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. The North Carolina Supreme Court found no error in the resentencing and affirmed the sentence of death, <em>see id. </em>at 210, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>see Call, </em>534 U.S. at 1046, 122 S.Ct. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In 2002, Call was again appointed counsel, who initiated state post-conviction proceedings by filing a motion for appropriate relief (\u201cMAR\u201d) in the North Carolina Superior Court. Call alleged, among other things, that his trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective under the Sixth Amendment for failing to object on Confrontation Clause grounds to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony. Call alleged that his appellate counsel was also ineffective for failing to raise, as plain error, a Confrontation Clause challenge to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">On June 17, 2003, the state court denied relief. The court found that trial counsel could not \u201cbe found ineffective based on a futile objection.\u201d J.A. 310. In addition, the court found that \u201cAgent Cabe\u2019s testimony was a dry second hand account that benefitted Call by minimizing the retelling of the acts establishing Call\u2019s guilt,\u201d and that trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Agent Cabe had been \u201cstrong and effective.\u201d J.A. 311. Thus, the court concluded that \u201c[tjrial counsel performed professionally and competently,\u201d that \u201c[a]ny error or errors that counsel may have made did not prejudice Call,\u201d and that there was \u201cno reasonable probability that, but for the error or errors, there would have been a different result in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>proceedings.\u201d J.A. 819. The court also rejected Call\u2019s claim that appellate counsel was ineffective, noting that \u201c[a]ppellate counsel, an assistant appellate defender specializing in criminal appellate cases, filed an extensive, well researched brief, raising numerous valid assignments of error\u201d and could not be found ineffective based upon an issue that was \u201cwithout merit and that would not have been successful on direct appeal.\u201d J.A. 311. Finally, the court concluded that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence to support the aggravating circumstances underlying Call\u2019s sentence of death.\u201d J.A. 322. The North Carolina Supreme Court denied Call\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>See State v. Call, </em>357 N.C. 579, 589 S.E.2d 130 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In 2004, Call filed a second MAR, asserting that Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Prior to <em>Crawford, </em>an unavailable witness\u2019s statement could be introduced if the statement bore \u201cadequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Crawford, </em>however, the Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of testimonial statements of an unavailable witness if the defendant has had no prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The state MAR court again denied relief, holding that <em>Crawford, </em>issued after Call\u2019s case became final, did not apply retroactively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the court addressed the merits of the claim, reiterating that \u201c[t]he details of Alan Varden\u2019s statement were introduced as a \u2018dry second hand account\u2019 which effectively as possible minimized the retelling of the acts establishing Call\u2019s guilt\u201d and that \u201c[t]rial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Agent Cabe regarding Varden\u2019s statement was effective and without the risk of denials by Varden.\u201d J.A. 341. The court also found it significant that \u201cCall had a prior opportunity to cross-examine Alan Varden\u201d regarding his statements but \u201cmade no attempt to call Varden as a witness or to introduce his prior sworn testimony\u201d at the resentencing hearing, and that \u201c[t]he jury [had already] rejected Call\u2019s attempt to blame Varden during the guilt phase of his trial.\u201d J.A. 341. Finally, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he aggravating circumstances were strongly supported by the details provided by Gabriel Gonzalez, the medical examiner[,] and the witnesses to the gruesome crime scene where Macedonio was found beaten and \u2018hog-tied\u2019 with only nine dollars in his pocket.\u201d J.A. 342. The North Carolina Supreme Court again denied certiorari review. <em>See State v. Call, </em>359 N.C. 71, 604 S.E.2d 916 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254, Call filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court. The district court denied the petition, <em>see Call v. Polk, </em>454 F.Supp.2d 475 (W.D.N.C.2006), and denied a certificate of appealability. We granted a limited certificate of appealability to consider whether Call\u2019s rights to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment were violated by trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Agent Cabe\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>testimony at the resentencing hearing on Confrontation Clause grounds and by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the Confrontation Clause issue on direct appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court as plain error. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The Sixth Amendment requires that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI, and that such assistance be effective, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant is required to demonstrate \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate inadequate performance, the defendant \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d measured by \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate prejudice, Call \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In death sentence challenges such as this, \u201cthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer\u2014including an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence\u2014would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cTo avoid \u2018the distorting effects of hindsight,\u2019 however, \u2018a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Ozmint, </em>494 F.3d 478, 484 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052). \u201cThe defendant (or petitioner) bears the burden of overcoming this presumption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel also extends to the direct appeal of a criminal conviction and requires the same showing of deficient performance and prejudice. <em>See Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 396, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985); <em>Bell v. Jarvis, </em>236 F.3d 149, 164 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). Appellate counsel is accorded a \u201c \u2018presumption that he decided which issues were most likely to afford relief on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell, </em>236 F.3d at 164 (quoting <em>Pruett v. Thompson, </em>996 F.2d 1560, 1568 (4th Cir.1993)). \u201cCounsel is not obligated to assert all nonfrivolous issues on appeal, as \u2018[tjhere can hardly be any question about the importance of having the appellate advocate examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 752, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983)). \u201cWinnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on\u2019 those more likely to prevail, far from being evidence of incompetence, is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy,\u201d and \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to raise a weak constitutional claim may constitute an acceptable strategic decision designed to avoid diverting the appellate court\u2019s attention from what [counsel] felt were stronger claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). In sum, while \u201cit is still possible to bring a <em>Strickland </em>claim based on counsel\u2019s failure to raise a particular claim on direct appeal, ... it will be difficult to demonstrate that counsel was incompetent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cGenerally, only when ignored issues are clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>stronger than those presented, will the presumption of effective assistance of counsel be overcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because the state court decided Call\u2019s Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness claims on the merits, we are constrained to review them in light of the limits on federal habeas review of a state conviction imposed by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d). When a habeas petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d we may not grant relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">A state court\u2019s decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under \u00a7 2254(d) where it \u201capplies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth\u201d by the United States Supreme Court or \u201cconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [that] precedent.\u201d <em>William,s v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Factual determinations made by the state court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and \u201c[t] he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.CA. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (West Supp.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The applicability of the Confrontation Clause in capital sentencing proceedings has not been \u201cclearly established\u201d by Supreme Court precedents. <em>See Maynard v. Dixon, </em>943 F.2d 407, 414 n. 5 (4th Cir. 1991) (noting that the question of whether the Confrontation Clause applies in sentencing proceedings is undecided); <em>cf. United States v. Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 324 (4th Cir.2003) (noting that \u201c[i]t is far from clear that the Confrontation Clause applies to a [federal] capital sentencing proceeding\u201d). However, the question before us is not whether the Confrontation Clause applies to capital sentencing hearings as a matter of federal law. Because North Carolina recognized the general applicability of the Confrontation Clause in capital sentencing proceedings at the time of Call\u2019s resentencing, <em>see State v. Jaynes, </em>353 N.C. 534, 549 S.E.2d 179, 194-96 (2001); <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>341 N.C. 426, 462 S.E.2d 1, 19 (1995), the question before the state MAR court was whether Call\u2019s counsel were constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony on Confrontation Clause grounds and failing to raise the constitutional issue on direct appeal as plain error. The precise question before us, however, is whether the state court\u2019s rejection of Call\u2019s ineffectiveness claims is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedents governing such Sixth Amendment claims. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">We begin with Call\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony as violative of the Confrontation Clause and that the state court\u2019s rejection of this claim was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The basis for the state court\u2019s rejection of this claim is two-fold. First, the state court concluded counsel were not constitutionally deficient for failing to object because any Confrontation Clause objection to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony would have been a \u201cfutile\u201d one. J.A. 810. The state argues on appeal that this is because the Confrontation Clause, as applied by the North Carolina courts, did not prohibit Agent Cabe from testifying about Varden\u2019s statements because Varden had testified during the guilt-phase of Call\u2019s trial and was subjected to cross-examination at that time. Second, the state court concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue was not constitutionally deficient because the introduction of the substance of Varden\u2019s testimony via \u201ca dry second hand account\u201d of Agent Cabe \u201cbenefitted Call by minimizing the retelling of the acts establishing Call\u2019s guilt.\u201d JA. 311. In other words, even if Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony technically violated the Confrontation Clause and would have been excluded had an objection been made, trial counsel\u2019s decision to allow introduction of the substance of that evidence via the \u201cdry second hand account\u201d of Agent Cabe instead of the compelling firsthand testimony of Varden himself was neither constitutionally deficient representation nor prejudicial to Call.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we cannot say that the North Carolina state court\u2019s adjudication of this claim was an unreasonable one, Call is not entitled to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Pursuant to the statute governing capital sentencing proceedings in North Carolina, \u201cthere shall not be any requirement to resubmit evidence presented during the guilt determination phase of the case, unless a new jury is impaneled, but all such evidence is competent for the jury\u2019s consideration in passing on punishment.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-2000(a)(3). Additionally, \u201c[ejvidence may be presented as to any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence, and may include matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances .... Any evidence which the court deems to have probative value may be received.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In the context of a resentencing hearing, this means that \u201cthe State [is] required to resubmit the evidence presented in the original trial in order to have it considered [by the resentencing jury], but such evidence [is] competent as a matter of law.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>462 S.E.2d at 18. The hearsay rules of evidence governing admissibility and exceptions, <em>see </em>N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804, including the requirement that the declarant be deemed \u201cunavailable\u201d as that term is defined therein, are not controlling. <em>See McLaughlin, </em>462 S.E.2d at 18. \u201cInstead, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(a)(3) expressly provides that evidence presented during the guilt determination phase of a capital case is competent and admissible as a matter of law during a capital sentencing proceeding in the same case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">North Carolina also requires its courts to address, if raised, the issue of \u201cwhether the admission of that recorded prior testimony violates defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the federal and state constitutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19; <em>see also Jaynes, </em>549 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>S.E.2d at 195; <em>see also State v. Holmes, </em>355 N.C. 719, 565 S.E.2d 154, 165 (2002) (noting that \u201c[w]hile the Rules of Evidence do not apply to a capital sentencing proceeding [in North Carolina], the constitutional right to confront witnesses does apply\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">At the time of Call\u2019s resentencing, North Carolina applied the \u201cresidual trustworthiness\u201d test of <em>Ohio v. Roberts. </em>\u201cThe principal purpose of [the] confrontation [right was] to secure to the defendant the right to test the evidence of the witnesses against him through cross-examination.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>565 S.E.2d at 165 (internal quotation marks omitted). But, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s mere lack of an opportunity to cross-examine a witness d[id] not necessarily mean ... that the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights were violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court was \u201cconfident\u2014as in the context of hearsay falling within a firmly rooted exception\u2014that \u2018the declarant\u2019s truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of marginal utility,\u2019 the Sixth Amendment\u2019s residual \u2018trustworthiness\u2019 test allow[ed] the admission of the declarant\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 136, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999)); <em>see also Ohio, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. The admission of testimony failing to meet the residual trustworthiness test was reviewed for harmlessness. <em>See Holmes, </em>565 S.E.2d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In this case, Varden testified during the guilt phase, and his testimony was subjected to vigorous and effective cross-examination by Call\u2019s trial counsel. Agent Cabe was also allowed to discuss Varden\u2019s statements during the guilt phase as a prior consistent or corroborating statement, and he too was effectively cross-examined. And both the state and Call were free, under North Carolina rules, to resubmit Varden\u2019s guilt-phase testimony in the re-sentencing proceeding if they had felt it necessary or helpful. Thus, unlike situations in which the state seeks to introduce testimony or statements of witnesses whom the defendant has never had an opportunity to cross-examine, Call in fact had the opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses during the guilt phase, had available to him the recorded testimony (including his own cross-examination) of these witnesses for reintroduction at any time, and cross-examined Agent Cabe during the resentencing hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state contends that, because Call was afforded these opportunities, Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony relating Varden\u2019s statements was evidence \u201ccompetent for the jury\u2019s consideration in passing on punishment\u201d under the statute and, as applied by the North Carolina courts, not violative of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Purely from a Confrontation Clause standpoint, it troubles us that Varden\u2019s recitation of the events surrounding the murder was not resubmitted in the resentencing proceeding via a reading of his prior testimony. Rather, Agent Cabe presented the substance of Varden\u2019s testimony by reading his handwritten notes of the interviews of Varden. The substance was largely the same, but it was nonetheless a different version of those statements. The question before us, however, is not whether we believe that Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause in a capital sentencing proceeding. Nor are we called upon to decide how the North Carolina statute affects North Carolina\u2019s view of the applicability of the Confrontation Clause in this context. Rather, we are constrained to answer a more narrow question: whether the state court\u2019s finding\u2014that trial counsel was not ineffective because an objection under the Confrontation Clause would have been futile in North Carolina\u2014was contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedents governing the right to constitutionally effective assistance of counsel. At a minimum, we think it far from clear that the North Carolina trial court or the North Carolina Supreme Court on appeal would have considered Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony to be a violation of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Even if we were to assume that North Carolina would have considered Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony to be violative of the Confrontation Clause, however, Call would still not be entitled to habeas relief. The state court also found that trial counsel\u2019s failure to lodge an objection was not deficient performance, and did not prejudice Call, because the introduction of the substance of Varden\u2019s testimony via the \u201ca dry second hand account\u201d of Agent Cabe \u201cbenefitted Call by minimizing the retelling of the acts establishing Call\u2019s guilt.\u201d J.A. 311. Having reviewed the testimony of Varden and Agent Cabe in the state court proceedings, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">During the guilt phase of Call\u2019s trial, Varden offered a compelling and damaging first-hand account of Call\u2019s plans to rob Macedonio, including his consideration of possible weapons and crime locations, as well as his attempts to enlist Varden\u2019s help with the crimes. Varden related in detail Call\u2019s return to his home on the evening of the murder, his confession to Varden that he had struck Macedonio in the head, restrained, and robbed him, and his attempt to enlist Varden\u2019s help to kidnap and eliminate Gabriel as a witness to the murder. At one point during his testimony, Varden even left the stand and demonstrated for the jury Call\u2019s description of how he had restrained Macedonio and left him to die in the cornfield, including raising his right foot off of the floor to demonstrate how Call had \u201chog-tied\u201d Macedonio to keep him from running. In stark contrast to this live account of Varden\u2019s encounters with Call and his first-hand account of Call\u2019s brutal treatment of Macedonio and Gabriel, Agent Cabe related the general substance of Varden\u2019s testimony by reading from his notes in an obviously dry, rote fashion, and often in sentence fragments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Clearly, the state\u2019s decision to present the substance of Varden\u2019s statements in this fashion did not afford Call\u2019s counsel the opportunity to repeat the live cross-examination of Varden that it had conducted during the guilt phase. And it is perhaps true, as is now argued by Call, that Agent Cabe\u2019s position in law enforcement might have provided some cloak of validity to Varden\u2019s story. However, we cannot overlook the fact that trial counsel had already attempted and failed to paint Var-den as an uncharged accomplice and unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>liable witness before a jury, and that trial counsel was free at any time to resubmit their cross-examination of Varden in the resentencing proceeding, albeit at the risk that Varden\u2019s direct testimony would be read into the record as well or that the state might then decide to call Varden as a witness. By allowing the substance of Varden\u2019s prior testimony to come in via a second-hand account of Agent Cabe and conducting a \u201cstrong and effective\u201d cross-examination of the latter, trial counsel was able to bring out the points on cross-examination necessary to create doubt in the validity of Varden\u2019s statements without the problem of Varden testifying and repeating live the testimony that was so damning at the guilt phase. As the state MAR court pointed out, \u201c[tjrial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Agent Cabe regarding Var-den\u2019s statement was effective\u201d but \u201cwithout the risk of denials by Varden.\u201d J.A. 341. And, like the state court, we find it significant that Call\u2019s trial counsel had this \u201cprior opportunity to cross-examine Alan Varden,\u201d but \u201cmade no attempt to call Varden as a witness or to introduce his prior sworn testimony.\u201d J.A. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Call\u2019s reliance upon trial counsel\u2019s after-the-fact affidavits concerning their strategies, or lack thereof, regarding Varden\u2019s statements. Call\u2019s lead attorney, Mr. Lynch, filed an affidavit professing no strategic reason for failing to object to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony. Lynch provided no elaboration regarding his thought process in this regard, however, nor did he offer an opinion regarding whether he felt that the decision, in hindsight, was a poor or otherwise deficient one. In contrast, Call\u2019s second-chair counsel, Mr. Willey, filed an affidavit in support of Call\u2019s MAR that was substantially more self-critical.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Mr. Willey, counsel felt that the state had made an inadequate showing that Gabriel was unavailable as a witness, but \u201cmade a strategic decision not to ask for a continuance because we believed that bringing [Gabriel] or the father of the victim into the courtroom would not have helped our client\u2019s case.\u201d J.A. 270. In contrast, Willey asserted that they \u201cbelieved that having Alan Varden in the courtroom would have helped our case,\u201d but \u201cdid not object ... because of the long-standing holding of the North Carolina Supreme Court that the North Carolina Rules of Evidence do not apply to capital sentencing healings.\u201d J.A. 270-71. Unlike Lynch, Willey leads the court to believe that he at least was simply unaware that he could object to Agent Cabe\u2019s hearsay testimony under the Confrontation Clause or otherwise, and he implies that such failure should be deemed constitutionally deficient performance on their part. Having considered the respective affidavits, we find little utility in the representations of either counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">First, it is well-settled that the test of <em>Strickland </em>performance is an objective one; Call was required to demonstrate that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an <em>objective </em>standard of reasonableness\u201d measured by \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">In all such cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (citation omitted). We can discern no good reason to apply a different standard to self-scrutiny by defense counsel of their own assistance. Hindsight within the clarity of defeat fosters such second-guessing and self-criticism, particularly on the part of competent professionals who take seriously their obligation to zealously represent clients charged with capital crimes. The objective test for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment accounts for this understandable tendency and keeps our focus not on what could have been done differently, but on whether what was done was constitutionally effective representation. For the reasons set forth above, the state court\u2019s determination that the performance of Call\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally effective is objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Second, we cannot overlook the fact that trial counsel, despite Willey\u2019s statements in his affidavit, appear to have been aware that North Carolina applied Confrontation Clause protections in capital sentencing proceedings at the time of Call\u2019s resentencing. In fact, trial counsel objected to the introduction of Gabriel\u2019s testimony, presented a lengthy argument regarding the propriety of introducing the testimony under both the North Carolina Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause, and engaged the trial court in a specific discussion of the <em>McLaughlin </em>case and its evidentiary and Confrontation Clause issues. Thus, the objective record indicates that counsel made a conscious decision to object to the reading of the hearsay testimony of Gabriel (who was in Mexico) but <em>not </em>to object to the hearsay testimony of Agent Cabe and risk having Varden brought in to testify in person. And, even if counsel had believed they had no valid objection to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony, they nonetheless made the decision not to pursue the presentation of Varden\u2019s testimony via the reading of his prior testimony (as was done with Gabriel) or to present him live themselves. The fact that Call\u2019s counsel had available the testimony to refute any contradictory evidence, did not do so, and professed no impediment to doing so, is strong evidence that they were satisfied with the dry second-hand account of Var-den\u2019s testimony and were pleased to have Varden <em>and </em>Gabriel, arguably the two most damaging witnesses, both absent from the resentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">To conclude, the state court found that trial counsel were not ineffective because any objection under the Confrontation Clause would have been futile and, in any event, counsel\u2019s failure to object was neither deficient performance nor prejudicial to Call under the circumstances. We cannot say that either determination was an unreasonable one. It is not clear that North Carolina would have considered Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony, presented as it was in a capital resentencing proceeding, to be a violation of the Confrontation Clause. And, in any event, we do not think it deficient performance for defense counsel to choose not to object to materials or testimony that presents the substance of damaging evidence in a more innocuous fashion. Here, Call has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that an objectively reasonable attorney would have objected to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony and, while not required to do so, the state has made a strong showing that an objectively reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>able attorney would have followed the exact path counsel did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">For largely the same reasons, the state court\u2019s rejection of Call\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was also not an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedents governing such claims. The state court rejected this claim on the merits, noting that Call\u2019s appellate counsel \u201cfiled an extensive, well researched brief, raising numerous valid assignments of error\u201d and could not be found ineffective based upon an issue that was without merit and that would have been unsuccessful on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In addition, the state court held that Call failed to demonstrate \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As noted by the state court, the aggravating circumstances in this case were strongly supported by the details provided by Gabriel, Dr. Sporn, and the other witnesses to the gruesome crime scene. And, because Call\u2019s counsel chose not to object to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony, there was simply no need for the state to introduce the recorded testimony of Varden, which all agree could have been admitted by the state court, or to call him as a live witness. As a strategic matter, it might have presented a stronger case for the state, but as a substantive matter, the evidence had been presented and there was no need to present cumulative evidence of Varden\u2019s statements. Had Call\u2019s counsel objected to Agent Cabe\u2019s testimony, and that objection been sustained by the trial court, the state would have been presented with two options: it could have called Varden as a live witness to reiterate the testimony he gave during the guilt phase or it could have asked to have Var-den\u2019s prior testimony read to the jury. The substance of the evidence would have remained the same. And, even if appellate counsel had raised a Confrontation Clause issue on appeal, the appellate court would likely have found no plain error. Accordingly, we also cannot say that the state court\u2019s rejection of Call\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedents governing such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Call\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\">.

In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the court made no mention of a requirement that the state demonstrate unavailability of a declarant for a resentencing proceeding where the declarant had testified in the guilt phase of the same proceeding and defendant\u2019s \"motivation to cross-examine [the declarant] then was the same as his motivation at the new capital sentencing proceeding\u201d. <em>McLaughlin, </em>462 S.E.2d at 19. And in <em>Jaynes, </em>the trial court allowed testimony of a witness in the defendant\u2019s first guilt/sentencing trial to be read to the jury. The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial court had also found that the witness was unavailable to testify at the defendant's resentencing proceeding, a fact that was uncontested, but also noted that \u201d[s]uch evidence would normally be <em>presumed </em>admissible at a later proceeding.\u201d <em>Jaynes, </em>549 S.E.2d at 195 (emphasis added). In <em>State v.
