They were sentenced to 46 months and 37 months of imprisonment, respectively. On appeal, counsel have filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which they state there are no meritorious issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>for appeal, but question whether the district court fully complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting the Crowders\u2019 guilty pleas and whether their sentences are reasonable. With respect to the sentences, specifically, the Crowders maintain that the district court erred in denying their motions for a downward departure and/or variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Because the Crowders did not move in the district court to withdraw their guilty pleas, their challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the mandate of Rule 11 in accepting the Crowders\u2019 guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the Crowders acknowledged that the Guidelines range was properly calculated. The district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced the Crowders after considering the Guidelines range, the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2007) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Thus, we conclude that the Crowders\u2019 sentences, which are within the statutory maximum and the Guidelines range, are reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); see <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and the issues raised in the pro se supplemental brief and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform their clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the clients request that a petition be filed, but counsel believe that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the clients. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
