Because the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order without opinion, we treat the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning as the final agency determination. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(e)(4) (2007); <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Awoyinka contends that the immigration judge should have granted him an adjustment of status because a visa petition for alien worker had been granted to his employer. However, the petition was subsequently revoked. To be eligible for adjustment of status based on employment under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1255 (West 2005 &amp; Supp.2007), an alien must apply for adjustment, be eligible to receive an immigrant visa, and a visa must be immediately available. <em>Perez-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 191, 192 (4th Cir.2007). It is uncontroverted that here, a visa is not immediately available. Therefore, the immigration judge did not err in denying Awoyinka adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Awoyinka also asserts that the immigration judge erred in denying his final motion for a continuance. An immigration judge \u201cmay grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2007). We review the denial of a motion for a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Lendo v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 439, 441 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). We \u201cmust uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a continuance \u2018unless it was made without a rational explanation, it inexplicably departed from established policies, or it rested on an impermissible basis, e.g., invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lendo, </em>493 F.3d at 441 (quoting <em>Onyeme, </em>146 F.3d at 231).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Here, the immigration judge granted a continuance of five months in order to allow Awoyinka to seek reconsideration of the denial of the visa petition. When the immigration judge found no progress on that issue at the next hearing, he concluded that Awoyinka was ineligible for relief from removal, denied voluntary departure, and ordered Awoyinka removed. (JA 10-14). Because the immigration judge gave a rational explanation for his denial of a continuance, and did not rest his decision on an impermissible basis, this claim entitles Awoyinka to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
