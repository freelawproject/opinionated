Background</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Chacon pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. At the change-of-plea hearing, the government proffered, and Chacon admitted, the following facts. The U.S. Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) sighted the Dan Viking motor vessel (\u201cM/V\u201d) in international waters and made contact with the first mate, who officials believed was being coached by one of the seven crew members on board. USCG officials conducted a \u201cspace accountability\u201d inspection of the M/V, locating approximately 2,500 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), all seven members of the crew were aware of the purpose of the trip, and all seven participated in loading the cocaine bales onto the M/V. During an FBI interview, Chacon stated that he was hired by Jimmy Solis to work on the M/V, but Chacon denied knowing about the cocaine. The probation officer noted that all of the crew members were to be held responsible for the entire amount of eo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>caine, but there was no evidence to suggest that any of the crew members held a more culpable role and, therefore, none were entitled to a role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Also included in the PSI was a written statement from Chacon in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">I was working on this ship when [Jimmy] Solis told me there were going to be drugs on board this trip____Since [Jimmy] Solis knew where my family lived, I couldn\u2019t leave the boat, while fearing he might do something to them. [Jimmy] Solis told me that if I didn\u2019t want to make this trip, he was going to send me to a farm in Colombia because the captain told him he couldn\u2019t leave any loose ends. I understood that as a threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In his objections to the PSI, Chacon argued that a minor-role reduction was warranted, and he also requested a downward departure for duress. After listening to a statement from Chacon, and hearing from the government, the court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">I believe the guideline range, as well as the calculation by the Probation Department, including the role in the offense, is correct given the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553, as well as having reviewed the role\u2014excuse me\u2014reviewing the guidelines at [\u00a7 ] 3B1.2, which is the mitigating role, which discuss[es] minimal and minor participant.... [T]he comments and analysis to both of those sections reveal that it will be used infrequently. It is to correct what I think is\u2014and unfortunately this can happen particularly when you deal with an amount that someone is caught betwixt and between them behavior and what may be considered their relevant conduct in terms of a large quantity of narcotics. I don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s the case here. I believe that the guideline range is the appropriate sentence for this particular defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The court sentenced Chacon to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. When the court asked Chacon if he had any objections, Chacon renewed his objections concerning the role reduction and the denial of a downward departure. Chacon now appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating-role reduction and the failure to rule explicitly on his request for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">A. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">We have \u201clong and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant\u2019s offense level should be decreased by two levels if he was a \u201cminor participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 '3B1.2(b). The two-level reduction applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.5). The Commentary further provides that \u201c[t]his section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him <em>substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)) (emphasis added). Chacon bears the burden of showing his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">In <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>this court established a two-part test for whether a mitigating-role reduction is appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 940-45. In applying the first prong, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [ ]he played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which []he has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. In a drag courier context, the amount of drugs involved is a material consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 948. The first prong is often dispositive of the issue. <em>See id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"Agv9\">In the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the district court may assess a defendant\u2019s relative culpability compared with \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, it is possible that none of the participants are minor or minimal participants. <em>Id. </em>The defendant must prove that he is less culpable than most other participants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Here, the record supports the court\u2019s denial of a role reduction because Chacon offered no factual basis upon which to conclude that his actual conduct was any different than the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable. Therefore, Chacon did not meet the first prong of mitigating-role test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that any of the defendants were more culpable than the others. Although Chacon argues, and the government does not dispute, that there were other more culpable crew members, whether Chacon was less culpable than three other crew members is not dispositive because it is possible that none of the four remaining crew members were minor or minimal participants. And Chacon\u2019s assertions that others were more culpable do not meet his burden of establishing that he was entitled to a reduction. Therefore, he also fails to meet the second prong of the mitigating-role test.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">B. Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">Chacon also argues that the district court erred by failing to rale explicitly on his request for a downward departure due to duress under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to apply a downward departure, but we review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether a district court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Pressley, 3</em>45 F.3d 1205, 1209 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[W]hen nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">Because Chacon failed to object specifically to the district court\u2019s purported failure to rule on the motion for a downward departure, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29. \u201cFor an error to affect substantial rights, \u2018the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1343 n. 7 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). We may correct an error meeting the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>criteria only \u201cif it \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The sentencing court \u201cmust-for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter-rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). \u201cTo facilitate judicial review of sentencing decisions and avoid unnecessary remands, we [have noted] that sentencing judges should make explicit findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>881 F.2d 970, 973 (11th Cir.1989). Where the district court fails to make explicit findings, however, meaningful appellate review is not necessarily precluded if the record supports the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We conclude that the district court did not plainly err by failing to rule explicitly on the motion for a downward departure. After hearing Chacon\u2019s arguments, the court implicitly denied the motion when it found that \u201cthe guideline range [was] the appropriate sentence for this particular defendant,\u201d and imposed a low-end guidelines sentence. Chacon acknowledged the denial when he renewed his objection, but he did not object to the manner in which the sentence was imposed or the lack of an explicit ruling on the issue. Thus, although the court failed to deny Chacon\u2019s motion for a downward departure explicitly, the record supports the conclusion that the court did in fact rule on the matter, and Chacon has not shown that the lack of an explicit ruling affected the outcome of the proceedings. Further, because nothing in the record indicates that the court was unaware of its authority to depart downward, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to apply the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">For the above reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-14\">.
