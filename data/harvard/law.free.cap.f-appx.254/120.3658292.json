Nicholas appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review issues of statutory construction <em>de novo. See Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir.2001). We will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-23\">The District Court denied Nicholas\u2019s motion on the grounds that he had three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (the dismissals of W.D. Pa. Civ. Nos. 06-112, 06-98, and 06-201) and had not alleged that he was in \u201cimminent danger.\u201d Two of the strikes on which the District Court relied, however, were dismissals of complaints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that had not yet been entered when Nicholas filed the instant suit. <em>See </em>W.D. Pa. Civ. Nos. 06-112, 06-201. Moreover, Nicholas went on to appeal each of the three dismissals relied on by the District Court, and those appeals were not completed at the time Nicholas filed his complaint. <em>See </em>C.A. Nos. 06-4362, 06-4361, 06-4367. A dismissal does not qualify as a strike for \u00a7 1915(g) purposes unless and until a litigant has exhausted or waived his or her appellate rights. <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Therefore, Nicholas did not have three strikes when the District Court denied his motion, and the District Court erred in requiring him to demonstrate that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury before proceeding <em>informa pauperis </em>at that time. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The fact that this Court has since dismissed Nicholas\u2019s appeals of the aforementioned District Court orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), <em>see </em>C.A. Nos. 06-4362, 06-4361, 06-4367, does not change that result. By its terms, \u00a7 1915(g) governs only the circumstances under which a prisoner may \u201cbring\u201d a civil action <em>in for-ma pauperis, </em>which means that its impact must be assessed at the time a prisoner files his or her complaint. <em>See Abdul-Akbar, </em>239 F.3d at 313; <em>Gibbs v. Ryan, </em>160 F.3d 160, 162-63 (3d Cir.1998). Thus, only the strikes actually earned at the time the complaint was filed are relevant. The statute does not authorize courts to revoke <em>in forma pauperis </em>status if a prisoner later earns three strikes. <em>See Gibbs, </em>160 F.3d at 163 (explaining that Congress \u201climited the \u2018three strikes\u2019 provision to an inmate\u2019s ability to \u2018bring\u2019 an action. Congress could have tied the \u2018three strikes\u2019 bar to an inmate\u2019s ability to <em>maintain </em>an action. It did not do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order and direct the District Coui't to evaluate Nicholas\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>infonna pauper-is </em>in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\">. Nicholas is currently on parole and was granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
