Cordova-Barraza appeals his sentence. He argues that the district court plainly erred by determining that his prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) was for a drug trafficking offense and by sentencing him in accordance with this determination. Cordova-Barraza argues that his prior conviction does not qualify as a drug trafficking offense as that term is used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). We disagree. A comparison of the statute and Guideline at issue shows that a conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1) qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n l(B)(iv)). Cordova-Barraza\u2019s argument to the contrary is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Cordova-Barraza challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
