Prior to Wright\u2019s sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report, which classified Wright as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based on his four prior breaking and entering convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">On appeal, Wright raises two alleged errors. First, he contends the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act to the facts in his case violated his Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Second, Wright alleges the district court erred in failing to determine whether his breaking and entering convictions qualified as burglaries within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2) and were thus predicate offenses for purposes of application of the armed career criminal enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">Title 18, section 924(e) of the United States Code provides for a fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence for an individual who has previously been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment of a year or more, who possesses a firearm, and has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). On appeal, Wright argues that the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement he received violated the Eighth Amendment because his predicate convictions occurred fifteen years pri- or to the current offense when he was eighteen years old and because \u201che does not fit the profile of a recidivist as he had not been at liberty between the qualifying felonies\u201d to demonstrate he was a changed man. Wright\u2019s first argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-18\">The plain language of \u00a7 924(e) does not require an intervening arrest or period of incarceration to impose the fifteen year enhanced penalty but imposes the penalty on anyone who has committed three predicate offenses \u201con occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). This court has already determined that predi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>cate offenses occur on \u201coccasions different from one another\u201d if each prior conviction arises out of a separate and distinct criminal episode. <em>See United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.1995). There is no dispute that these requirements are met in this case. Finally, to the extent that Wright raises a general Eighth Amendment challenge to \u00a7 924(e), this court has already determined that \u00a7 924(e) is neither disproportionate to the offense punished nor cruel and unusual punishment and thus, does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Presley, </em>52 F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318, 323 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Crittendon, </em>883 F.2d 326, 331 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Wright also avers the Government failed to establish that his prior breaking and entering convictions met the definition of burglary as used in \u00a7 924(e) and therefore did not qualify as predicate \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under \u00a7 924(e). As Wright failed to maintain this claim in the court below,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> his argument on appeal is reviewed for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Plain error review requires the defendant to establish that: (1) there was error; (2) the error was \u201cplain;\u201d and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even if the defendant makes this required showing, \u201cRule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)(internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Wright\u2019s failure to timely object to the classification of his prior offenses as violent felonies is fatal to his claim. Contrary to Wright\u2019s contention, the district court was not required to delve, sua sponte, into the circumstances surrounding Wright\u2019s prior convictions, but rather was entitled to rely on undisputed information in the presentence report that bore \u201cthe earmarks of derivation from <em>[Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)] approved sources such as the indictments and state-court judgments from [defendant\u2019s] prior convictions.\u201d <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-5\"> Although Wright\u2019s counsel apparendy questioned whether Wright\u2019s prior offenses were properly classified by the probation officer in the presentence report as violent felonies, this issue was not pursued at sentencing. Accordingly, because the matter was not pursued in open court when Wright and his counsel were afforded the opportunity to challenge the findings in the presentence report, we deem Wright's objection to the classification of his prior offenses as violent felonies to have been abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
