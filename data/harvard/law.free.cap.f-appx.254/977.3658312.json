Burns and 3 Daughters Media, Inc. (\u201c3 Daughters\u201d) (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of a permanent injunction to Centennial Broadcasting, LLC (\u201cCentennial\u201d) enforcing a covenant not to compete between Burns and Centennial. Appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that the covenant\u2019s terms are unambiguous and that Burns failed to comply with those terms. They also challenge the validity of the non-competition agreement on a number of grounds. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">In October 2004, Centennial and Burns entered into an agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d or \u201cAPA\u201d) pursuant to which Burns was to sell Centennial substantially all of the assets, property, and rights of the radio station WLNI-FM (\u201cWLNI\u201d), \u201clicensed by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) to Lynchburg, Virginia.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (J.A. at 10.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 28, 2005, Centennial closed on the purchase of WLNI for approximately $4.4 million. The parties allocated $4.135 million for WLNI\u2019s FCC license, $180,000 for the broadcasting equipment, $50,000 for the tower antenna, and $35,000 for office and miscellaneous equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">As a condition of the sale, the parties entered into an ancillary agreement entitled the \u201cNon-Solicitation and Consulting Agreement.\u201d Centennial paid Burns $25,000 as consideration for his compliance with the covenants contained in the agreement. Only one of the Non-Solicitation and Consulting Agreement\u2019s three primary restrictions is relevant to this appeal. Paragraph 2 (\u201cthe non-competition agreement\u201d) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-14\">Except as provided in the next sentence, Covenantor [Burns] further agrees that at no time during the Restricted Period will he directly or indirectly, whether as owner licensee, principal, agent, consultant, employee, proprietor, partner, lender, or shareholder, director or officer of a corporation (or similar position in any other entity), or in any other capacity, other than as employee or contractor of Buyer, engage in, own, manage, operate, control or otherwise participate in or be in any manner connected with the ownership, operation, management or control of <em>any commercial AM or FM broadcast business at any radio broadcasting station that is included in the Roanoke-Lynchburg Arbitran Metro radio market if such station utilizes a programming format substantially similar to any format used by the Station on the date Buyer acquires the Station; </em>provided, however, that ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation shall not be prohibited solely by reason thereof. Covenantor\u2019s ownership and operation of Radio Stations WMNA-FM and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>WMNA(AM), Gretna, Virginia, are specifically excluded from the restrictions in this paragraph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">(J.A. at 23 (emphasis added).) At the time of the sale, WLNI\u2019s programming consisted primarily of talk shows, although the station also sometimes broadcasted sports events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">In November 2005, Centennial learned through a newspaper article that Burns, acting through 3 Daughters, a company he owns, had purchased the radio station WBLT-AM (\u201cWBLT\u201d) in Bedford, Virginia. WBLT\u2019s signal reached into the area encompassed by the Roanoke-Lynchburg Arbitron Metro radio market.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And, although WBLT had been one of the few music stations remaining on the AM dial, Burns shifted its programming to primarily talk radio upon purchasing the station. Burns told the article\u2019s author that he instituted the format change because he had \u201cbeen very successful with news and talk radio.\u201d (J.A. at 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Centennial believed that Burns\u2019s operation of WBLT as a talk radio station violated the non-competition agreement. Accordingly, on February 17, 2006, Centennial filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against Appellants in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, claiming diversity of citizenship between itself and Appellants and an amount in controversy over $75,000. Centennial\u2019s complaint asserted claims against Burns for breaches of the non-competition agreement, the APA, and the APA\u2019s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Counts I\u2014III) and a claim against 3 Daughters for violations of Centennial\u2019s rights under the APA and the non-competition agreement (Count IV). On the same day, Centennial filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction enjoining Appellants \u201cfrom further use of a Talk programming format\u201d on WBLT. (J.A. at 28, 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">On March 13, 2006, the district court conducted a hearing on Centennial\u2019s motions for a TRO and for a preliminary injunction. Centennial provided evidence that it had monitored WBLT for 24 hours and learned that \u201cit ha[d] 21 hours of syndicated talk and three hours of music.\u201d (J.A. at 128.) Moreover, WBLT was \u201cduplicating a number of talk show programs broadcast on WLNI.\u201d (J.A. at 35.) Burns did not dispute that a number of the talk programs aired on WBLT were the same as those aired on WLNI. He also admitted that the bulk of WBLT\u2019s programming on Monday through Friday was syndicated talk shows. (J.A. at 240.) Burns took issue, however, with Centennial\u2019s assertion, grounded in a list of radio formats set forth in \u201cRadio &amp; Records\u201d (which Centennial described as \u201cthe leading magazine in the radio industry,\u201d (J.A. at 138)), that there existed a single talk radio format which both WLNI and WBLT employed. Burns supplied an article from \u201cTalkers Magazine\u201d (whose slogan is \u201cthe [Bjible of the talk radio business,\u201d (J.A. at 207)) that \u201cbroke [ ] down on-air talk talent to nine major categories,\u201d (J.A. at 73); he argued that each category represented a distinct radio format and that when these categories were used to define WBLT and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>WLNI\u2019s respective formats, the two were not substantially similar. At the close of the hearing, the district court determined that Burns had clearly violated the non-competition agreement and issued a TRO. On March 20, 2006, the district court granted Centennial\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Prior to the March 13, 2006 hearing, the district court had notified the parties that it would \u201cbe considering the possibility of consolidating the request for a preliminary injunction with trial on the merits of the request for a permanent injunction,\u201d but understood that because expert witnesses might be unavailable at the hearing, the parties might need to submit deposition testimony relevant to the merits within a reasonable period after the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (J.A. at 326.) A subsequent Opinion and Order provided that in considering whether consolidation was appropriate, the district court would consider only the evidence offered at the March 13, 2006 hearing, the deposition testimony of Appellants\u2019 expert witness, and Centennial\u2019s rebuttal evidence, if any was offered. If, after considering that evidence, the district court concluded that the language of the non-competition agreement was unambiguous, it would decide the merits of the request for a permanent injunction. If, however, it determined that disposition of the merits required further development of the record, it would permit the parties to conduct further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Accordingly, Burns submitted the deposition testimony of expert witness Michael Harrison, publisher of \u201cTalkers Magazine.\u201d Harrison identified eleven different talk radio formats, but suggested that there were \u201cprobably more.\u201d (J.A. at 576.) According, to Harrison, \u201cradio is a minute to minute competition,\u201d so stations should be compared on a minute to minute basis. (J.A. at 599.) He had not, however, compared WLNI and WBLT in this manner. When asked if it was \u201ca fair statement to say that both of these formats for WBLT and for WLNI are general issues political talk even under [Harrison\u2019s] definitions,\u201d (J.A. at 612), Harrison acknowledged that \u201c[i]t [wa]s possible,\u201d (J.A. at 613), but stated that \u201cit all depends on actually analyzing the actual number of hours that they do the different shows,\u201d and that he had not conducted that analysis. (J.A. at 612-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">As rebuttal evidence, Centennial submitted the deposition testimony of Walter Sabo, CEO of Sabo Media, a programming and management company specializing in profitable contents solutions for talk-radio stations. Sabo listed five formats that he believed existed within the talk radio format and indicated that there were \u201cprobably more.\u201d (J.A. at 733.) Sabo opined that WLNI and WBLT had substantially similar formats, basing his conclusion on \u201c[t]wo things\u201d\u2014\u201cthat many of the [ ] shows cover the same subject area, and ... the way the shows are scheduled.\u201d (J.A. at 707.) He described the content of both stations as being primarily political and the structure of the two stations as \u201camazingly similar.\u201d (J.A. at 709.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">After the deposition testimony was taken, Centennial filed a Motion for a Permanent Injunction Pursuant to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 65(a)(2) and to Render Final Judgment in Favor of Plaintiffs on the Merits. On September 29, 2006, 2006 WL 2850640, the district court granted Centennial\u2019s motion to consolidate trial on the merits with the preliminary injunction hearing and issued an opinion and order permanently enjoining Burns from \u201cparticipating in or being in any manner connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>ed with the ownership, operation, management or control of any commercial AM or FM broadcast business at any broadcasting station that is included in the Roanoke-Lynehburg Arbitron Metro radio market for a period of five years if that business station uses the following programming formats ...: All talk, News/ Talk, Full Service Talk, or Specialized Talk with a focus on current events and/or politics.\u201d (J.A. at 941-42.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 3 Daughters Media was permanently enjoined \u201cfrom the same\u201d so long as Burns remained affiliated with the company. (J.A. at 942.) In a separate order, the district court referred Centennial\u2019s claim for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to a magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Burns and 3 Daughters timely appealed the district court\u2019s order granting Centennial a permanent injunction. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">\u201c[W]e review the grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Virginia Soc\u2019y for Human Life, Inc. v. F.E.C., </em>263 F.3d 379, 392 (4th Cir.2001). In so doing, we review the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. Id. </em>\u201c[A] mistake of law by a district court is per se an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Dixon v. Edwards, </em>290 F.3d 699, 718 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion in granting Centennial a permanent injunction because the district court\u2019s decision rests on erroneous legal conclusions. Specifically, Appellants contend that the district court erred in concluding that the non-competition agreement\u2019s reference to a \u201cprogramming format substantially similar [to that of WLNI],\u201d (J.A. at 23), was unambiguous. The ambiguity of the contract language, according to Appellants, not only compels reversal of the district court\u2019s conclusion that no reasonable jury could find that WLNI and WBLT did not have substantially similar programming formats, but also renders the non-competition agreement unenforceable as violative of Virginia public policy and Burns\u2019s First Amendment rights. Appellants further contend that the Federal Communications Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 310(d) (West 2001), and FCC decisions and policy preempt enforcement of the non-competition agreement. Because Appellants\u2019 contention that the non-competition agreement is ambiguous permeates them arguments on appeal, we first address Appellant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary before considering the question of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">Because this is a diversity suit, we apply the substantive law of the state of Virginia. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>186 F.3d 505, 527-28 (4th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Virgi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>n\u00eda law, when the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, the interpretation of those terms presents a question of law. <em>Musselman v. Glass Works, L.L.C., </em>260 Va. 342, 533 S.E.2d 919, 921 (2000). Whether a contractual provision is ambiguous is also a question of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Virginia considers the language of a contract ambiguous \u201cif it may be understood in more than one way or when it refers to two or more things at the same time.\u201d <em>Video Zone, Inc. v. KF &amp; F Properties, L.C., </em>267 Va. 621, 594 S.E.2d 921, 923 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSuch an ambiguity, if it exists, must appear on the face of the instrument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 924. \u201cParol evidence cannot be used to first create an ambiguity and then remove it.\u201d <em>Cohan v. Thurston, </em>223 Va. 523, 292 S.E.2d 45, 46 (1982). Moreover, \u201ca document is not ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to the meaning of the language employed by them in expressing them agreement.\u201d <em>Amos v. Coffey, </em>228 Va. 88, 320 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Appellants argue that the district court\u2019s finding that the relevant sworn statements and expert testimony were \u201cmutually incompatible and irreconcilable\u201d reveals that the term \u201cprogramming format\u201d in the non-competition agreement is ambiguous. (J.A. at 939.) For further support, they cite to <em>F.C.C. v. WNCN Listeners Guild, </em>450 U.S. 582, 101 S.Ct. 1266, 67 L.Ed.2d 521 (1981), in which the Supreme Court upheld the FCC\u2019s decision to abandon regulation of radio station formats, a policy change grounded in part in the difficulty the FCC had experienced in defining and categorizing programming formats. <em>See Dev. of Policy re: Changes in the Entm\u2019t Formats of Broad. Stations, </em>57 F.C.C.2d 580, 583 \u00b6 12 (1976) (concluding that labeling radio station formats is a difficult task because \u201c[distinctions in this field are extremely hazy and subjective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The district court rejected Appellants\u2019 invitation to look to external sources, rather than the contract itself, to resolve the issue. It found that \u201c[t]he contract refers to the programming format of [WLNI] on the date of transfer of ownership,\u201d and \u201c[o]n that date, [WLNI] had a programming format known to both parties.\u201d (J.A. at 939.) Accordingly, the district court concluded that just because \u201cthe experts ... [did] not agree on the proper pigeonhole into which that format should be placed d[id] not make the contract ambiguous.\u201d (J.A. at 939.) The court reasoned that \u201c[WLNI]\u2019s format may (or may not) defy categorization, but it is possessed of some format which Burns is forbidden to imitate.\u201d (J.A. at 939.) It further determined that the phrase \u201csubstantially similar\u201d was unambiguous, as \u201c[i]ts ordinary and plain meaning can be gleaned by resort to dictionary definitions and common usage.\u201d (J.A. at 939.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">We agree with the reasoning of the district court. The dictionary defines \u201cformat\u201d in the media context as a \u201cgeneral plan of organization, arrangement, or choice of material (as for a television show).\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>492 (11th ed.2004). The non-competition agreement identified a particular general plan of organization or choice of material\u2014that of WLNI\u2019s programming format on the date Burns sold the station to Centennial\u2014with which both parties were familiar. The difficulty of affixing a mutually-agreeable label to the programming format identified in the non-competition agreement does not render the agreement itself ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">We also agree with the district court that, however the two stations\u2019 formats are categorized, no reasonable jury could find that they are not substantially similar. Appellants argue that, under Harrison\u2019s approach to format categorization, the sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>tions\u2019 programming formats could be found to differ because Harrison\u2019s testimony indicates that WLNI and WBLT broadcast-ed substantially different programs during as many as eleven hours of the day. They offer no basis, however, on which to refute the district court\u2019s finding that because \u201c \u2018programming\u2019 is distinct from \u2018programming <em>format, </em>\u2019 \u201d different programs may share the same programming format. (J.A. at 933.) That the two stations did not air the same programs at the same time during a substantial portion of the day does not demonstrate that they do not utilize the same or substantially similar programming formats. The district court found that, under Harrison\u2019s approach, \u201cboth WLNI and WBLT use a General Issues/Political Talk programming format, because each airs talk shows with current events and politics subject matters for a majority of the time and with significant hour-by-hour overlap.\u201d (J.A. at 934.) Appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the differences between the particular programs do not render this finding clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">We therefore agree with the district court that Appellants breached the non-competition agreement, and the differences in the format definitions and modes of comparison advanced by the parties do not render the violation any less clear. Because we conclude that the language of the non-competition agreement is unambiguous, we need not address Appellants\u2019 argument that, under Virginia law, an ambiguous restrictive covenant offends public policy and cannot be enforced. For the same reason, we decline to address Appellants\u2019 contention that the non-competition agreement represents a waiver of their First Amendment rights that cannot be enforced because it is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">We next address Appellants\u2019 contention that federal law preempts the enforcement of the non-competition agreement under state contract law. Under the Supremacy Clause, federal statutes and regulations displace conflicting state law. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2; <em>English v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990) (explaining that \u201cstate law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law\u201d). Such a conflict exists in two circumstances\u2014where \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u201d <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-43, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), and where state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941); <em>Gade v. Nat\u2019l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass\u2019n, </em>505 U.S. 88, 103, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Burns argues that both circumstances are present in this case because enforcement of the non-competition agreement would (1) conflict with and frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 310(d) of the FCA and (2) violate the FCC policy of prohibiting contractual restrictions on radio-formatting discretion. Section 310(d) of the FCA provides that \u201c[n]o construction permit or station license, or any rights thereunder, shall be transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any manner, voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, ... to any person except upon application to the Commission and upon finding by the Commission that the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be served thereby.\u201d 47 U.S.C.A \u00a7 310(d). Further, the FCC has a longstanding policy of requiring that a licensee \u201cretain control over programming content at all times.\u201d <em>In re Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Corp., </em>59 F.C.C.2d 558, 561 (1976). Accordingly, it will not grant licenses to applicants whose contractual obligations limit their ability to maintain ultimate con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>trol over programming decisions. <em>See Cumulus Licensing L.L.C., </em>21 F.C.C.R. 2998, 3005 (2006) (finding that a contractual provision prohibiting a buyer of a radio station (and any successor in interest) from \u201cinstituting an adult contemporary or country program format, or any similar or derivative format ... for a period of five years\u201d improperly infringed upon the buyer\u2019s programming responsibilities and conditioning approval of the parties\u2019 application to transfer the station\u2019s license on the deletion of the restriction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The district court rejected both arguments. It concluded that neither the FCA nor FCC policy preempts the enforcement of the non-competition agreement, because although the FCC will not approve license applications from or transfers to would-be licensees whose programming discretion is unduly inhibited by contractual terms, no FCC rules or decisions purport to alter state contract law or to bind the courts. (J.A. at 937.) To the contrary, the FCC has stated that \u201cthere is no conflict between State and Federal policy as to the covenant not to compete.\u201d (J.A. at 937) (quoting <em>In re Roman, </em>38 F.C.C. 290 (1965)); <em>see also In re Cmty. Broad. of Coastal Bend, Inc., </em>4 F.C.C.R. 3619, 3621 (1989) (stating that \u201cthere is no conflict between state and federal policy as to a covenant not to compete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Again, we agree with the reasoning of the district court. As the district court explained, the FCC has conditioned approval of license transfers on the transferee\u2019s ability to extract himself from non-competition agreements that limit programming discretion precisely because these types of agreements are enforceable. <em>See Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga. v. Carroll, </em>338 U.S. 586, 600, 70 S.Ct. 370, 94 L.Ed. 363 (1950) (stating that \u201c[t]he [FCC] may impose on an applicant conditions which it must meet before it will be granted a license, but the imposition of the conditions cannot directly affect the applicant\u2019s responsibilities to a third party dealing with the applicant\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Thus, whether the non-competition agreement would unduly infringe upon Appellants\u2019 ability to program WBLT was a question for the FCC to resolve in determining whether to approve the transfer of the station\u2019s license. It is not a ground to invalidate the non-competition agreement. We agree with the district court that any conflict between 3 Daughters\u2019s duties as a licensee and Burns\u2019s contractual obligations resulted from Appellants\u2019 failure to inform the FCC of the non-competition agreement\u2019s restrictions and is thus of their own making. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting Centennial a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">In sum, we conclude that the non-competition agreement\u2019s reference to a \u201cprogramming format substantially similar to [that of WLNI on the date of its sale to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Centennial],\u201d (J.A. at 23), was unambiguous. We further conclude that no reasonable jury could find that WBLT\u2019s format was not substantially similar to WLNI\u2019s programming format, and that federal law does not preempt enforcement of the non-competition agreement. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">. The APA initially provided for the sale of two additional radio stations, WMNA-FM and WMNA-AM, \"licensed by the FCC to Gretna, VA\u201d (the \u201cGretna stations\") as well. (J.A. at 10.) In January 2005, however, the parties amended the APA to exclude the Gretna stations from the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">.

Arbitron defines the Roanoke-Lynch-burg radio market \"as encompassing the cities of Roanoke, Lynchburg, Bedford, and Salem, and six Virginia counties: Roanoke, Boutetourt, Bedford, Campbell, Amherst and Appomattox.\u201d (J.A. at 301.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">.

In crafting the injunction, the district court sought to use terms that reflected Burns's understanding of the different types of radio station programming formats. The district court's Opinion and Order defined, in a footnote, the formats that Burns was enjoined from using. It took both the format categories and their definitions from a website on which Burns had relied in an affidavit supporting his response in opposition to Centennial's motion for a preliminary injunction. In the affidavit, Burns used the website in asserting that \"All Talk\" and \u201cNews Talk\u201d were distinct formats and that WLNI used an \"All Talk\u201d format at the time that he sold it. Accordingly, the district court concluded that Bums \"accept[edj [the website]'s breakdown of talk programming formats into All Talk, News/Talk, Full Service, Specialized, and Sports.\u201d (J.A. at 933.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">.
