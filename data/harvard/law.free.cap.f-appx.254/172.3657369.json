Drew\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggested that the district court erred in denying Drew\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, erred in denying Drew\u2019s motion to challenge the validity of the search warrant, and erred in sentencing Drew. Drew filed a pro se supplemental brief questioning whether the district court erred in determining the drug quantities attributable to him, whether the district court erred in failing to differentiate between crack cocaine and cocaine base, and whether the district court erred in refusing Drew\u2019s request for additional voir dire. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">First, the district court did not err in denying Drew\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment because he was never personally served with the initial arrest warrant. Notably, Drew was properly arrested without a warrant upon the discovery of a weapon by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and Drew\u2019s admission that he is a convicted felon. A warrant was only issued later as Drew was being processed by the United States Marshals Service. Moreover, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>makes clear that Drew received all the process he was due. Accordingly, the district court properly found that Drew\u2019s rights were not violated when he was not personally served with the initial arrest warrant, and the court correctly denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Second, the district court properly denied Drew\u2019s motion to test the validity of the search warrant. Drew appears to question whether it is appropriate for federal officials to rely on a state-issued warrant. However, this argument is without merit, as this court has previously approved of the use of evidence seized pursuant to a state search warrant in a federal prosecution. <em>See United States v. Clyburn, </em>24 F.3d 613, 614 (4th Cir.1994). Moreover, the state search warrant complied with the Fourth Amendment because the evidence plainly established a \u201cfair probability\u201d that illegal narcotics would be found in Drew\u2019s motel room, and accordingly supported the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Drew\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Drew also challenges his sentence. This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. However, in imposing a sentence post <em>-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in making its factual findings regarding the amount of drugs attributable to Drew, and thereby properly determined Drew\u2019s guideline range. Moreover, the district court treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Drew only after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and counsel\u2019s arguments. Drew\u2019s 211-month sentence is presumptively reasonable, as it is within the appropriate guideline range and below the statutory maximum sentence. As neither Drew nor the record suggests any information to rebut the presumption, we find that Drew\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Next, Drew\u2019s argument that the district court should have distinguished between crack cocaine and cocaine base is without merit because \u201ccocaine base\u201d and \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d are interchangeable terms. <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>462 F.3d 329, 334 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 697, 166 L.Ed.2d 537 (2006). Although Drew asks that the court reexamine its holding in <em>Ramos, </em>a panel of this court may not overrule a prior published decision of the court. <em>See United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Finally, the district court did not err by failing to ask additional questions regarding racial prejudice during voir dire. During voir dire, the district court informed the jury panel that Drew is African-American, and asked if this would affect anyone\u2019s ability to reach a fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>impartial judgment. Although Drew is a black male, race was not an element of the offense or defense and was not in any way connected with the resolution of relevant facts; thus, racial issues were not \u201cinextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial,\u201d and no specific inquiry into potential racial bias was required. <em>See United States v. Barber, </em>80 F.3d 964, 968 (4th Cir.1996). Moreover, Drew fails to show that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that racial prejudice might have influenced the jury in his trial. <em>See id. </em>at 969-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Drew\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
