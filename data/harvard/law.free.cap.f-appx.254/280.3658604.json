Appellees removed the case to federal district court and filed a 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Remand. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and denied Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Remand,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> finding that ERISA preempted Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and that Plaintiffs had failed to plead that they exhausted their administrative remedies under ERISA and had incorrectly named Kimberly-Clark, rather than the plan administrator, as the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Plaintiffs had worked at Kimberly-Clark since January 4, 1982, and alleged that they were entitled to severance pay pursuant to benefits promised in the Kimberly-Clark Hattiesburg Organization Handbook. The Kimberly-Clark Corporation Severance Pay Plan was effective as of January 1, 1998, and provided, as originally written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Each participant whose employment is involuntarily terminated shall receive Severance Pay; provided, however, that Severance Pay shall not be paid to any Participant who: (a) is terminated for Cause; (b) voluntarily quits or retires; (c) dies; or (d) is terminated as part of a Group Termination ... The Committee [\u201cappointed to administer and regulate the plan] Shall have the sole discretion to determine whether a termination is voluntarily or involuntary, and whether a Participant\u2019s termination is for Cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqP\">The original plan did not allow for severance pay in the event of \u201cthe outsourcing of an Employee to a company other than an Employer\u201d and \u201ca sale or shutdown of a portion of the Corporation.... \u201d To receive severance pay, employees under the plan were required to complete a Severance Agreement and Release for the Committee. It included a formula for calculating severance benefits and Provided that \u201c[a]ny action on matters within the discretion of the committee ... shall be final and conclusive as to all Eligible Employees and other persons claiming rights under the Plan.\u201d The Kimberly-Clark Board administering the plan amended it on September 10, 2004, to disallow severance pay in the event of \u201cany separation or reorganization of the Corporation including, but not limited to, a sale, spin-off or shutdown of a portion of the Corporation\u201d and \u201cthe outsourcing of an Employee to a company other than an Employer.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Because ERISA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1)) grants the federal courts \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d in civil actions involving ERISA plans,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the parties dispute whether or not this plan is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan under ERISA. We do not typically have jurisdiction to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>a district court\u2019s denial of a Motion to Remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, however, because the denial is accompanied by the district court\u2019s granting of the Motion to Dismiss,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s denial of the remand motion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and find that the district court properly refused to remand plaintiffs\u2019 case to state court on the grounds that it was preempted by ERISA. Although, as Plaintiffs argue, a plan does not fall under ERISA simply because a defendant corporation has called it a \u201cplan,\u201d here a plan existed both in label and in practice. To determine whether ERISA governs a benefit plan, we follow a \u201cthree-factor test,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> asking whether: \u201c(1) the plan exists; (2) the plan falls within the safe-harbor provision established by the Department of Labor; and (3) the employer established or maintained the plan with the intent to benefit employees.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To determine the existence of a plan under the first factor, we look to <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which defines the existence of an ERISA benefit plan by an \u201congoing administrative scheme\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as opposed to a \u201cone-time, lump-sum payment triggered by a single event ... [which] requires no administrative scheme whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court suggested that \u201cdetermining the eligibility of claimants, calculating benefit levels, making disbursements, monitoring the availability of funds for benefit payments, and keeping appropriate records in order to comply with applicable reporting requirements\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is evidence of an administrative scheme. The pleadings and the discovery ordered by the district judge in determining whether to grant Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Remand show that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s plan existed. The Kimberly-Clark Corporation Severance Pay Plan, originally and as amended, set forth specific eligibility criteria that disqualified some potential plan participants. The plan and its amended versions provided increasingly detailed formulas for calculating plan benefits, specified how the payment was to be disbursed, and required its Committee to establish \u201ca procedure for handling all claims.\u201d The original plan also specified the Board\u2019s ability to amend the plan, provided it would not increase the annual cost above a certain amount ($1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>million or $25 million if approved and executed by the CEO). Although the form of payment under the plan was to be \u201ca lump sum cash payment ... no more than 90 days\u201d following a participant\u2019s termination, this does not negate the existence of a clear administrative scheme governing the plan. Nor does the fact that the company itself formed and operated the plan through a committee diminish the plan\u2019s administrative nature; in <em>Fort Halifax, </em>the court recognized that \u201can <em>employer </em>that makes a commitment systematically to pay certain benefits\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and takes on administrative duties such as those described above operates a plan as defined by ERISA. And although some lump-sum severance payment arrangements do not fall under ERISA, those arrangements have involved a discrete payment of one benefit that was not distributed according to a plan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendant, to the contrary, has shown that it follows specific administrative procedures under a clearly-defined plan in distributing severance benefits. Where other employers have similarly operated severance pay pursuant to a plan\u2014 providing the terms in an employees\u2019 handbook and policy manual and setting forth eligibility criteria<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2014we and other circuits have found that the plan squarely falls under ERISA, despite being funded by an employer\u2019s general resources rather than a specific trust fund.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Plaintiffs do not contend on appeal that the plan fell within a safe harbor provision. And the plan language itself demonstrates that the plan was intended to benefit employees,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as do the multiple disbursements that Defendant has made to terminated employees under the plan. Because Plaintiffs failed to show how the severance plan was not a benefits plan under ERISA, the district court properly refused to remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Plaintiffs next contend that, in granting Defendant\u2019s 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, the court improperly looked beyond the pleadings in finding that Plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies under ERISA. The court accepted Defendant\u2019s assertion that Plaintiffs had not exhausted their remedies, finding that a plan existed and: \u201cThe burden ... rests with the plaintiffs to first allege, then prove if necessary, exhaustion [through the plan] ... Exhaustion is a prerequisite to bringing suit.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendant attached a copy of its Severance Pay Plan\u2014the amended version, as of September 10, 2004\u2014to its 12(b)(6) motion to show that the plan was governed by ERISA and therefore required exhaustion of remedies, but Plaintiffs argue that the court improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>erly considered the plan because it was not authenticated and was outside of the pleadings. We find that the district court properly considered the plan but erred in dismissing the case on the grounds of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>asking \u201cwhether in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We uphold the dismissal \u201conly if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> More recently, however, the Supreme Court has established a more stringent pleading requirement, finding that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201c[fjactual allegations [under Rule 8(a)(2) ] must be enough to raise a right to relief above a speculative level\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that mere allegations without a suggestion of a loss, for example, and the cause of that loss, are insufficient.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellate courts are \u201cnot bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> When granting a motion to dismiss, district courts must limit their review to the pleadings before them.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">With respect to the exhaustion requirement, we have recognized that \u201cERISA contains no exhaustion requirement whatsoever\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but that \u201cwe [have] adopted the common law rule that a plaintiff generally must exhaust administrative remedies afforded by an ERISA plan before suing to obtain benefits wrongfully denied.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A plaintiff must exhaust his remedies where \u201cthe grievance upon which the lawsuit is based arises from some action of a plan covered by ERISA, and ... the plan is capable of providing the relief sought by the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> More recently, we have more broadly required exhaustion, finding: \u201cA claimant who is denied benefits under an ERISA plan must exhaust all administrative remedies afforded by the plan before instituting litigation for recovery of benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings adequately stated a claim for relief. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that Kimberly-Clark \u201crepresented to each Plaintiff that his or her employment benefits included a right to severance pay\u201d and that they relied upon these representations when they accepted employment with Kimberly-Clark. Further, they alleged that Kimberly-Clark was required to make severance payments within 90 days following Plaintiffs\u2019 termination and \u201cwholly failed to make sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>anee payments to those plaintiffs.\u201d Wrongful denial of benefits is a cause of action under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because their pleadings were based wholly on a general assertion that Defendant denied them promised benefits,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> without relying upon a reference to the plan, Plaintiffs argue that it was improper for the court to find that they were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the district court should not have considered the severance pay plan in its granting of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and determining that Plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under an ERISA plan is without merit. Although district courts \u201cin ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions generally may rely only on the complaint and its proper attachments ... [t]hey are permitted to rely on matters of public record.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And even if the plan was not part of the public record, the court had already concluded that the plan existed and fell under ERISA when it denied the Motion to Remand. It therefore need not have ignored the plan\u2019s existence in making its determination on the pleadings, particularly because the court had to ascertain whether it had proper jurisdiction over the case, and administrative exhaustion is a prerequisite to jurisdiction under ERISA. Furthermore, Plaintiffs, by avoiding any mention of a \u201cplan\u201d in the proceedings, could not avoid the fact that the very severance benefits they claimed had been wrongfully denied were disbursed pursuant to a plan. Despite the court\u2019s proper consideration of the existence of a plan, however, the court\u2019s requirement that plaintiffs plead exhaustion of remedies under the plan was an improper ground for dismissal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Although the complaint fails to allege that Plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss also fails to show how \u201cthe plan is capable of providing the relief sought by the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Due to the fact that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s plan provides no procedures for appealing the denial of benefits, and that the corporation modified its severance pay plan to explicitly exclude severance pay for termination resulting from spin-off, the plan does not appear to provide any remedies to Plaintiffs. We have \u201crecognized an exception to the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies when such attempts would be futile.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Similarly, we have cited the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s finding that \u201cthere are occasions when a court is obliged to exercise its jurisdiction ... the most familiar examples perhaps being when resort to administrative remedies is futile or the remedy inadequate.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Viewing the facts most favorably to the Plaintiffs, the district court should not have required them to plead exhaustion if any attempt at ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>haustion would have been futile. Furthermore, as Defendant concedes, the Supreme Court has recently found\u2014with respect to exhaustion requirements under the Prison Litigation Reform Act\u2014that exhaustion is an affirmative defense,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and that plaintiffs need not \u201cspecially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> to avoid 12(b)(6) dismissal. Although Plaintiffs failed to plead that they exhausted administrative remedies, they need not have done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The district court also erred in finding, when it granted Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, that Plaintiffs were required to sue the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Severance Pay Plan rather than the corporation itself, relying on <em>Musmeci v. Schwegmann Giant Super Mkts., Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Musmeci, </em>we found that where the employer was both the \u201cplan administrator\u201d and \u201cplan sponsor\u201d and the relevant plan has \u201cno meaningful existence separate from\u201d the employer, it was proper to name the employer as a defendant.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings alleged that the \u201cDefendant owned and operated a manufacturing facility ... where each of the named Plaintiffs were employed,\u201d that Defendant promised employees severance benefits \u201corally, in writing, by publication of benefits on a web-site,\u201d and that \u201cdefendant discharged each of the 61 plaintiffs and has wholly failed and refused to make severance payments to those plaintiffs.\u201d This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, could show that suing the plan was unnecessary, as Plaintiffs alleged specifically that the Defendant (not the plan) was responsible for failing to pay the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Remand but REVERSE its grant of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, REMANDING for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
