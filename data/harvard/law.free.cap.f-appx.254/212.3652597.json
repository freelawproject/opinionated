We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s order and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 745 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1147, 166 L.Ed.2d 997 (2007). We lack jurisdiction to consider Chen\u2019s argument that he is eligible for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture based on an alleged fear of punishment for his illegal departure from China or asylum request, because Chen failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by making this argument before the Board. <em>See Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
