An alien who \u201cfails to meet\u201d these procedural requirements may seek a waiver on one of the following grounds: (1) an extreme hardship resulting from the alien\u2019s deportation, (2) a good-faith marriage entered by the alien that was terminated (other than through the spouse\u2019s death), and the alien was not at fault for failing to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 1186a(c)(l), or (3) the alien entered the marriage in good faith but was battered by the spouse, and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the procedural requirements. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">The BIA concluded that Majors met the requirements of \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(A)-(C) because she filed a joint petition with her spouse and joint petitioner and submitted to a joint interview. The joint petition was denied on the merits while Majors was married to her husband. The BIA\u2019s determination that Majors was statutorily ineligible for a hardship waiver is consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">This court will not consider Majors\u2019s argument that her joint petition was filed after the expiration of the two year period of conditional residency provided in \u00a7 1186a(d)(2)(A), and that the Government therefore denied her due process by adjudicating a joint petition over which it had no jurisdiction, because Majors did not raise this argument to the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2001) (concluding that the failure to exhaust an issue creates a jurisdictional bar as to that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Accordingly, Majors\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
