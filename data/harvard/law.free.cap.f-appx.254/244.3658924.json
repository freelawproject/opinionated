Hilliard\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hilliard then obtained new counsel and filed a supplemental brief and joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>appendix. Hilliard has filed a pro se informal brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Hilliard pled guilty after the second day of trial. At the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, Hilliard inquired about receiving a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3El.l(b) (2005 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). At sentencing, the court applied a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and counsel questions whether the failure to add an additional decrease was error. To receive the additional level of reduction, the Government had to move for the reduction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b). The Government was not bound to do so, and there was no agreement for such in the plea agreement. Therefore, the court did not err in failing to award an additional decrease of one offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Hilliard\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief also raises the issue of whether this court\u2019s review of a <em>post-Booker </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentence relying on a presumption of reasonableness results in a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Supreme Court recently upheld the presumption of reasonableness in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of presumption of reasonableness to within-Guidelines sentence). Therefore, this challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Hilliard\u2019s new counsel filed a brief arguing that counsel was ineffective by miscommunicating a plea offer by the Government to the Defendant, resulting in Hilliard not being awarded a third point for acceptance of responsibility. Hilliard\u2019s pro se informal brief raises the same issue. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring his claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>See id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. After reviewing the record on appeal, including the supplemental brief filed by newly appointed counsel, we conclude that the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance and that it would be more appropriate to bring this claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Richardson, </em>195 F.3d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hilliard\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-14\"><em> United States v.
