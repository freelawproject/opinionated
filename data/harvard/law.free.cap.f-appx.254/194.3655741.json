Washington was charged with possession with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>distribute approximately 1.33 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). Washington entered a plea agreement with the United States, and on August 21, 2006, Washington pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. Washington\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver of appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Prior to Washington\u2019s sentencing, the probation office compiled a presentence report and calculated an advisory guidelines range of 151-188 months\u2019 of imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court imposed a sentence of 156 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">On appeal, Washington has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he questions whether he should have been determined to be a career offender and whether his sentence is too long. Washington has also filed a pro se supplemental brief. In his pro se brief, Washington alleges four separate errors: (1) use of his prior convictions to enhance the applicable statutory range violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; (2) he was deprived of competent counsel; (3) his career offender status overrepresents the seriousness of his criminal history and likelihood of recidivism; and (4) the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) support a significantly lower sentence than that recommended by his advisory guidelines range. In response, the Government has filed a brief invoking the waiver of appellate rights in Washington\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">This Court reviews the validity of a waiver de novo, <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000), and will uphold a waiver of appellate rights if the waiver is valid and the issue being appealed is covered by the waiver. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). A waiver is valid if the defendant\u2019s agreement to the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991). Generally, if a district court fully questions a defendant regarding his waiver of appellate rights during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is valid. <em>Wessells, </em>936 F.2d at 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Here, according to the terms of his plea agreement, Washington waived the right to appeal any sentence within the maximum provided in the statute of conviction or the manner in which that sentence was determined on any ground whatever, including those grounds set forth in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742. Washington\u2019s sentence of 156 months is within the statutory maximum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(c) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007). Notably, Washington does not attack the validity of his plea agreement or waiver of appellate rights. At Washington\u2019s Rule 11 hearing, the district court conducted a thorough colloquy with Washington and specifically questioned him about whether he understood he was waiving his right to appeal. The district court properly concluded that Washington\u2019s plea was freely and voluntarily made and accepted Washington\u2019s plea. As Washington knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and as his sentencing claims fall squarely within the terms of his appellate waiver, we dismiss Washington\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore dismiss Washington\u2019s appeal. This court requires that counsel inform Washington, in wilting, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Washington requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\"> To the extent that Washington claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel, his claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir. 1994). Rather, it must be pursued in an appropriate post-conviction proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). Accordingly, Washington\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim must likewise be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
