Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 221 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (affirming conviction but vacating and remanding sentence). At resentencing, the court imposed the same sentence, 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, or the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range of imprisonment. Williams claims the court erred by giving a sentence within the guidelines a presumption of reasonableness and defaulting to a guidelines sentence without giving full consideration to the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) sentencing factors. He also claims the court gave undue weight to acquitted conduct in determining his guidelines sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-20\">After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider that range in conjunction with the factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a), and impose sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. This court reviews a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence to determine whether it is \u201cwithin the statutoi'ily prescribed range\u201d and reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 547. \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007). When conducting a reasonableness review, this court reviews \u201clegal questions, including the interpretation of the guidelines, de novo, while factual findings are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A factual or legal error can render a sentence unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We find the district court appropriately followed the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing procedure. It determined the guidelines range of imprisonment and then considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We find Williams\u2019 sentence reasonable. We further find the court did not give undue weight to Williams\u2019 acquitted conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
