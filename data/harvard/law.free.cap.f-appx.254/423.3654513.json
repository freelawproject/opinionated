Taylor appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. We review a dismissal as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for abuse of discretion and review a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (2005); <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). As the district court dismissed the claims pursuant to both subsections, our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Taylor asserts that the prison clinic staff had access to his health records which show that he had suffered a heart attack prior to his incarceration; therefore the clinic staff had actual knowledge of the risk to his health that would result from delaying proper treatment. He is incredulous that the clinic staff could have given him such substandard treatment but for deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\u201d or when they delay medical care \u201cif there has been deliberate indifference [that] results in substantial hai\u2019m.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>Easter v. Powell, </em>467 F.3d 459, 463 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A prison official acts with deliberate indifference when he \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The facts alleged by Taylor demonstrate that, in the two and a half hours that Taylor was in the prison clinic before being transported to the hospital, the clinic staff tried to ascertain whether Taylor was having a heart attack. They performed an enzyme test and placed Taylor on a cardiac monitor; provided Taylor with oxygen, an analgesic, and an aspirin; and attempted to keep him calm. It appears to be true that the clinic staff wrongly concluded that Taylor was not having a heart attack, but when Taylor\u2019s symptoms did not improve, he was taken to a hospital in an ambulance. (Taylor has no complaint about his treatment in the hospital.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Taylor may have pled facts sufficient to demonstrate that he was the victim of medical malpractice or negligence and that he suffered serious harm as a result; however, unsuccessful medical treatment, negligence, neglect, and medical malpractice do not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Taylor has not pled facts sufficient to demonstrate, if true, that the defendants <em>disregarded </em>an excessive risk to his health. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Taylor\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tion for summary judgment by default is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. lt 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
