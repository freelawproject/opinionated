Following the district court\u2019s order, Lowry filed a motion for a certificate of appealability on June 6, 2006. Ten months later, the district court construed Lowry\u2019s motion as a notice of appeal. Lowry failed to file his motion within the ten-day period in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(A). However, with or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). Lowry filed his motion within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Lowry has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
