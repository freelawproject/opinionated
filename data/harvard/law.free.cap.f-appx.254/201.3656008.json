Duncan was subsequently sentenced to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Duncan asserts two challenges to his conviction, but does not appeal his sentence. Duncan first asserts the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the inculpatory statement Duncan offered to a police officer upon his arrest. Duncan also challenges the instruction given the jury regarding constructive possession. For the reasons set forth below, we reject both assignments of error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-19\">Taken in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2005), the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress established the following facts. On the morning of March 24, 2004, Corporal Travis Fowble of the Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Department observed a vehicle drive toward the end of a dead end street located in a high crime area. After learning the vehicle\u2019s registration had been suspended, as had the driver\u2019s license issued to Duncan, the registered owner of the vehicle, Fowble initiated a traffic stop. Fowble approached the vehicle and spoke with the driver, later identified as Duncan. Because another officer observed what appeared to be a marijuana cigarette on the vehicle\u2019s dashboard, the officers asked Duncan and his two passengers to exit the vehicle and handcuffed them. After confirming their suspicions that the cigarette was in fact marijuana, the officers placed all three men under arrest. The officers did not apprise Duncan of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. In conducting an inventory search of the vehicle, Fowble discovered a loaded .9 mm handgun under the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">While transporting Duncan to the precinct, Fowble received a radio communication from Corporal Price, one of the other officers who had assisted on the scene, inquiring whether Fowble recovered any firearms from the vehicle. Fowble responded that he had in fact seized a firearm, that he believed the firearm had been stolen, and that he further believed the firearm had recently been fired. Immediately after Fowble articulated his response to Price, Duncan spontaneously stated: \u201cThat gun has not been shot. I\u2019ve had that gun for a long time.\u201d Fowble did not respond in any way, and Duncan made no further statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In support of his motion to suppress this statement, Duncan asserted the discourse in Fowble\u2019s police cruiser amounted to the functional equivalent of interrogation and further posited the conversation between Fowble and Price was designed to elicit an incriminating statement from Duncan. Citing <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), the district court concluded <em>Miranda </em>was not implicated because there had been no express interrogation or the functional equivalent thereof. Moreover, the district court categorically rejected Duncan\u2019s contention that the conversation between Price and Fowble was orchestrated to induce Duncan to offer an inculpatory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">After losing his suppression motion, Duncan proceeded to trial. At the conclusion of Duncan\u2019s second jury trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court provided the following instruction regarding the possession element of the charged offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">\u201cTo possess\u201d means to have something within a person\u2019s control. This does not necessarily mean that the defendant must hold it physically. That is having actual possession of it. As long as the firearm was within the defendant\u2019s control, he possesses it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">If you find that the defendant either had actual possession of the firearm, or that he had the power and intention to exercise control over it, even though it was not in his physical possession, you may find that the government has proven possession....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">Proof of ownership of the firearm is not required. To satisfy this element, you must also find that the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm. This means that he possessed the firearm purposely and voluntarily and not by accident or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">Duncan raised no objection to this instruction. The jury subsequently found Duncan guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>I. <em>Denial of Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">As he argued in the district court, Duncan asserts on appeal that his inculpatory statement to Fowble resulted from the functional equivalent of a custodial interrogation, conducted without Duncan being properly informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Statements that result from interrogation by officers are subject to suppression. A person is \u201cinterrogated\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes not only when police expressly question him, but also when the police use any words or actions (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that they should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. However, \u201csince the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Kimbrough, </em>477 F.3d 144, 147 (4th Cir.2007). \u201cThe reviewing court should take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The district court properly denied Duncan\u2019s motion to suppress his statement regarding his possession of the firearm because it was not the product of either express interrogation or the functional equivalent of interrogation. Duncan offered his statement after overhearing Fowble\u2019s discussion with Price regarding the firearm Fowble recovered from Duncan\u2019s vehicle. At no point did Fowble direct any comments regarding the firearm to Duncan. As we explained in <em>United States v. Payne, </em>954 F.2d 199, 202 (4th Cir.1992), \u201cthe <em>Innis </em>definition of interrogation is not so broad as to capture within <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>reach all declaratory statements by police officers concerning the nature of the charges against the suspect and the evidence relating to those charges.\u201d As was the case in <em>Payne, </em>the statement here, which was made by one police officer to another, was simply an \u201cinnocuous\u201d statement to which no response from the defendant was sought or required. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">II. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Duncan next challenges the district court\u2019s instructions regarding the possession element of the felon-in-possession charge. Although Duncan concedes the district court\u2019s instructions accurately stated the law on constructive possession, he maintains these instructions were insufficient because of the prosecution\u2019s erroneous statements to the jury pertaining to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The decision whether to give a jury instruction, and the content of that instruction, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Burgos, 55 </em>F.3d 933, 935 (4th Cir.1995). Where, as here, the appealing party does not object to the jury instruction (or lack thereof) in the district court, this court will review only for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under the plain error standard, Duncan must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. When these conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Duncan fails to carry his burden of demonstrating plain error. We agree with Duncan that the district court\u2019s instruction on constructive possession comported with governing law. As we explained in <em>United States v. Blue, </em>957 F.2d 106, 107 (4th Cir.1992), \u201cto establish constructive possession, the government must produce evidence showing ownership, dominion, or control over the contraband itself or the premises or vehicle in which the contraband is concealed.\u201d (alteration and citations omitted). The district court\u2019s instruction encompassed these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Further, we reject Duncan\u2019s contention that the Government\u2019s closing argument so grossly misstated these principles such that the district court was obligated to further instruct the jury. The Government\u2019s closing argument essentially restated the instruction presented by the district court: that control over the contraband itself or control or ownership of the vehicle in which the contraband is found is sufficient to establish the individual\u2019s constructive possession of the contraband.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We thus affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-15\">. Duncan\u2019s Erst trial ended in a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. Although Duncan attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Payne </em>by emphasizing that the defendant in <em>Payne </em>had in fact been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, this is a distinction without substance. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only when a suspect is in custody <em>and </em>subjected to interrogation. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682. As the district court properly concluded, the custody prong was clearly satisfied here. However, because there was no express interrogation or the functional equivalent thereof, <em>Miranda </em>was not triggered and thus there was no basis for suppressing the incriminating statement Duncan spontaneously and voluntarily offered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. Duncan\u2019s contention that the Government's evidence established nothing more than Duncan's \"mere presence\u201d in the vehicle, thus entitling him to \"mere presence\u201d instruction, is belied by the record. As established by Fowble\u2019s testimony both at the suppression hearing and at trial, the vehicle was registered to Duncan, Duncan was driving the vehicle, and the firearm was found under the driver\u2019s seat, easily within Duncan\u2019s reach and control. These facts fit squarely within the parameters of constructive possession as established in <em>Blue.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
