Mitchell, Louisiana prisoner # 297573, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application, challenging his conviction and sentence for second degree murder and aggravated kidnaping. At issue is whether Mitchell\u2019s convictions for both second degree murder and aggravated kidnaping violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Mitchell contends that he was convicted under the theory of felony murder, and therefore, his conviction for the underlying felony of aggravated kidnaping is an essential element of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), habeas relief may not be granted to any issue that was adjudicated on the merits by the state court unless the state court\u2019s conclusions were \u201ccontrary to\u201d or involved an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court or were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">The state pursued prosecution against Mitchell under both the specific intent murder and felony murder theories. The jury was instructed on both theories, and the verdict did not reveal under which theory Mitchell was convicted. The pursuit of two different murder theories in conjunction with a charge for an underlying felony does not violate clearly established federal law. <em>Taylor v. Cain, </em>227 Fed.Appx. 387, 388 (5th Cir.2007). Additionally, the state appellate court found that the facts presented at Mitchell\u2019s trial supported a conviction for specific intent murder. The state court\u2019s determination is not unreasonable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
