The district court sentenced Coats to a 151-month term of imprisonment on Count 1 and to a concurrent sentence of sixty months on Count 2. Coats appeals his convictions and sentence. His counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the colloquy held in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and the reasonableness of Coats\u2019 sentence. Counsel states, however, that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Coats was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea hearing but does not specify any deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiries. Because Coats did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground raised on appeal, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard). Our careful review of the record convinces us that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Coats\u2019 guilty plea and that any omission on the court\u2019s part did not affect Coats\u2019 substantial rights. Moreover, the district court ensured that Coats entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that the plea was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Counsel also suggests that Coats\u2019 sentence is unreasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), courts must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Here, before the district court reentered the criminal judgment to afford Coats an opportunity to appeal his sentence, <em>see United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39 (4th Cir.1993), the district court resentenced Coats in accordance with <em>Booker, </em>properly calculating the guideline range, appropriately treating the guidelines as advisory, and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Coats\u2019 151-month prison term on Count 1 is the bottom of the guideline range and is below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2007), and his sentence on Count 2 is the statutory maximum of five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3); USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). Finally, neither Coats nor the record suggests any information so compelling as to rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>presumption that a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range is reasonable. We therefore conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
