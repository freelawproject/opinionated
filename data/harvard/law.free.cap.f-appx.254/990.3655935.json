Counsel for Austin has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that he has found no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting that the district court should have reduced Austin\u2019s Guidelines range by three for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (2005), despite his post-plea arrest for unrelated drug activity. Austin has filed a pro se supplemental brief summarily claiming that a federal officer inappropriately arranged for the post-plea state arrest. The Government has declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. After a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing at which Austin admitted his guilt,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the district court adopted the findings contained in the presentence investigation report without objection, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, and sentenced Austin to the low end of a properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number><em>v. Green, </em>486 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Moreover, it was not error for the district court to refuse to apply a three-point reduction to Austin\u2019s Guidelines range because the Guidelines\u2019 commentary explicitly provides that a district court may consider whether the defendant withdrew from criminal conduct when determining whether to apply the three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(b) (2005); <em>see also United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 240 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe decision to grant an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction often depends on the actions of the defendant following his or her arrest or plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Austin in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court for further review. If Austin requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may motion this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Austin. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-17\"> Although it was error for the district court not to discuss the particular portions of Austin\u2019s plea agreement during the Rule 11 colloquy, and this error was plain, we conclude the error did not affect Austin\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
