In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable negleet or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">The district court entered an amended judgment on December 6, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on September 15, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Davis failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We also deny Davis\u2019 motion to strike counsel\u2019s appellate brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-18\"> Davis was accorded the benefit of <em>Houston v.
