R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A); Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2cl 96 (2007); <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). Because McLendon\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit was untimely, that appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Dison, </em>20 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We review a denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Ent., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir. 1994); <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). On appeal, McLendon abandons those claims that the district court concluded were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, he has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting the arguments he made regarding those claims in his post-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">McLendon argues, as he did in his \u201cMotion to Alter Judgment,\u201d that the district court failed to address his claim that his placement in administrative segregation while he was a pretrial detainee in the Harris County jail violated his due process rights. He also argues, as he did in his \u201cMotion to Alter Judgment,\u201d that the district erred in assuming there was a legitimate penological objective for the Harris County jail\u2019s use of restraints while he was exercising. His assertions that his placement in administrative segregation was not reasonably related to assistant district attorney Denise Nasser\u2019s concern that he had mailed a letter to another assistant district attorney\u2019s home and that he was forced to exercise alone in a cage while restrained were not, however, raised in his \u00a7 1983 suit. Based upon the allegations made in McLendon\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, the evidence he submitted in connection with his complaint, and the arguments made in his \u201cMotion to Alter Judgment,\u201d the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McLendon\u2019s post-judgment motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1)\u2014(6); <em>see also Knapp v. Dow Corning Corp., </em>941 F.2d 1336, 1338 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Hess v. Cockrell, </em>281 F.3d 212, 216 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Scott v. Moore, </em>114 F.3d 51, 53 (5th Cir. 1997) (en banc); <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>74 F.3d 633, 645 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Because McLendon\u2019s appeal from the denial of his post-judgment motion is without arguable merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of his appeal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) also counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). McLendon is warned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent' danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
