Although Khan acknowledges his application was not filed within one year of his arrival, he argues that his then-pending application for adjustment of status constituted an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that excused the one-year filing limit. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Although an alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>with lawful status is one example of such an extraordinary circumstance, a pending application for adjustment of status does not change an alien\u2019s illegal status to a legal status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5)(iv); <em>United States v. Elrawy, </em>448 F.3d 309, 314 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, the BIA correctly concluded that Khan had not shown extraordinary circumstances and that his asylum application was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Khan also argues that the BIA erred in affirming the decision of the IJ on the issue of credibility. This court gives great deference to a factfinder\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). This court does not substitute its own judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to \u201cwitness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an IJ\u2019s credibility determination is based on a \u201creasonable interpretation of the record and [is] therefore supported by substantial evidence,\u201d it will be upheld. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). The IJ\u2019s credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The inconsistencies in Khan\u2019s documentary evidence and testimony show that the credibility determination was a reasonable interpretation of the record and, was therefore, supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>The opposite conclusion, that Khan was credible, is not compelled by the evidence. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Khan withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Khan also argues that the BIA and IJ erred in denying him voluntary departure. This court lacks jurisdiction to review a claim that the BIA erred in denying a request for the discretionary relief of voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
