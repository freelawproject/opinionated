Plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order and an injunction from the District Court. Apparently plaintiff made several applications for such orders, for the record discloses that the Court entered orders denying motions for injunction on August 13, 1956, August 15, 1956, August 23, 1956 and August 24, 1956. The notice of appeal is from the order entered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>August 24, 1956, which except as to its date is identical with the previous orders. We also find in the record a notice of an appeal from the order of August 26,1956 which order does not appear in the record. In fact, the filing date of this notice of appeal is August 24, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">No abuse of discretion having been shown in the denial of a motion for a temporary injunction, and it further appearing that said order denying injunction was entered after the conclusion of both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, thus rendering the question moot, the' order denying an injunction must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
