All appellants were convicted of operating a lottery, \u00a7 22-1501, D.C.Code 1951 and possessing numbers slips, \u00a7 22-1502, D.C.Code Supp.1955; five appellants were convicted of having conspired to operate a lottery and sell numbers, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1952); four were also convicted of permitting the maintenance of premises for gambling, \u00a7 22-1505, D.C.Code Supp. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-23\">Appellants\u2019 main contentions are that: (1) items seized from searched premises should not have been admitted into evidence .because the search warrants were issued without adequate probable cause; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>(2) the daytime search warrant for 1628 \u201cO\u201d Street, N. W., was illegally executed in that the return on the warrant indicates it was executed at 6:00 P.M.; (3) the search warrant for 2126 10th Street, N. W., was illegally executed because the officers entered the premises forcibly without the owner\u2019s consent and without giving notice of their authority and purpose; and (4) the five appellants convicted on the conspiracy count should have been acquitted as to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The first two contentions were decided adversely to appellants by the District Court on motions to suppress evidence. The District Court\u2019s opinion, United States v. Bell, D.D.C.1955, 126 F.Supp. 612, carefully considered these two points and we believe reached the correct conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The third contention is that the search warrant for 2126 10th Street, N. W., was illegally executed because the officer, upon receiving no response to his knocking, forced the door open without first giving notice of his authority or purpose. Appellants rely on the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 (1952)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that an officer may \u201cbreak open\u201d a door if he is refused admission after giving notice of his authority and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The record discloses that the officer in charge of the police party ordered a subordinate \u201cto break the door open,\u201d that the subordinate pushed the door \u201cand the door flew open.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">At this juncture we cannot determine on what basis the trial judge ruled adversely on the motion to suppress the evidence seized after and as a result of the entry here described. We are obliged to look at the record as showing an entry by force which under the statute cannot be made unless the officer first gives \u201cnotice of his authority and purpose.\u201d It is not disputed by the officers that as to the actions at 2126 10th Street, they failed to announce that they were police or that they were authorized to enter under a warrant. Having failed by their own admission, to comply with the command of the statute, we must hold the evidence was obtained as a result of the unlawful entry into 2126 10th Street. In Palmer v. King, 1914, 41 App.D.C. 419, 425-426, L.R.A.1916D, 278, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">\u201c * * * when an officer, in the execution of a writ, finds an outer door or window slightly ajar, but not sufficiently so to admit him, he may open the door or window, provided he does not find it obstructed, but if it is fastened or obstructed so as to require force to overcome the obstruction, he may not use such force, for such an entrance would constitute a breaking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">While the entry in the Palmer case dealt with civil process and relied on the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>mon law rather than a statute such as we now have, the rationale of both is substantially the same. Justice Van Orsdel of this court stated the law to be: \u201cHe may enter either an open outer door or window, provided it can be accomplished without committing a breach of the peace; he may <em>then, after request and refusal, </em>break open any inner doors belonging to the defendant, in order to take the goods.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Five premises were raided. The 10th Street house was alleged to be a \u201cmoney drop\u201d, not a principal place of ..business; and the evidence seized there was utterly insignificant compared with the, masses of material seized at other places. Any analysis of the record shows this to be true. So, even if we regard this evidence obtained at 2126 10th . Street as .inadmissible, there remains the question of how this result affects the rights of the appellants. Elimination of the evidence seized at the 10th Street address leaves the Government\u2019s case unshaken, except with respect to appellant Shay, who was arrested at that address. With regard to the others, when all is said and done (using the language of the Supreme Court in the Kotteakos<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> case), we are convinced the error did not influence the jury or at most had but very slight effect. For this reason we affirm as to all appellants except Shay.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Of the fifteen people arrested <em>in </em>these raids only four were arrested at the 10th Street address, but one of these was dismissed, one was found not guilty, and one did not appeal; of those found at the 10th Street address only Shay was convicted and appealed. He was found guilty of operating a lottery and of possessing lottery slips. The slips which he was found guilty of possessing were seized at the 10th Street address. Therefore his conviction should be reversed, and he should be granted a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Appellants\u2019 final contention is that they should have been acquitted as to the conspiracy count of the indictment on the ground that \u201cthe crime of conspiracy as defined in Title 18, \u00a7 371 U.S. Code, is either inapplicable to, merged in or so indistinguishable from [the] lottery statute as to prevent the conviction of appellants on both charges.\" Appellants argue that the conspiracy charge must involve proof of an element not necessary to proof of the substantive offenses and that there are no differences between the crime of conspiracy and the substantive offenses under the lottery laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">If this argument is based on the merger of the conspiracy with the substantive offense, it must be rejected. Whatever validity there may be in the proposition that \u201cwhere * * * concert of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tion between two or more persons is logically necessary to [a crime\u2019s] completion a charge of conspiracy to commit it will not lie against such persons,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this is not such a case. There is no logical necessity for a plurality of agents in order to violate the lottery laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Appellants, however, claim they are not simply making a merger argument but are offering a novel theory. They say that it is impossible to do anything which would constitute a conspiracy to violate the lottery laws without also actually violating those laws; therefore, the lottery laws and the conspiracy statute, when applied in this situation, punish exactly the same conduct, whereas it is necessary that there be an additional element for a conspiracy. This argument cannot be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Assuming that it would be impossible to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 without also violating \u00a7 22-1501, D.C.Code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the converse is not true \u2014 \u00a7 22-1501, D.C.Code, can be violated without violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and the two statutes do not punish precisely the same offense. The additional element needed for the conspiracy is present, <em>i. e., </em>the concerted and associated effort of two or more persons to violate the lottery laws. This case is in fact an excellent example of a situation where the confederation of law violators can be far more dangerous than the single violator. The evidence showed there were 285 number writers who were not apprehended; the five dwellings involved were used as counting houses, places to deposit money, sell numbers and keep \u201crundown\u201d tapes. Thus, the appellants concentrated records and equipment at various places in order to manage their extensive criminal enterprise with the least risk of detection. The conspiracy statute was designed to punish just such concerted action which makes crime \u201ceasier to perpetrate and harder to detect.\u201d Lisansky v. United States, 4 Cir., 1929, 31 F.2d 846, 849. The Supreme Court has said: \u201c * * * For two or more to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">confederate and combine together to commit or cause to be committed a breach of the criminal laws, is an offense of the gravest character, sometimes quite outweighing, in injury to the public, the mere commission of the contemplated crime. It involves deliberate plotting to subvert the laws, educating and preparing the conspirators for further and habitual criminal practices. And it is characterized by secrecy, rendering it difficult of detection, requiring more time for its discovery, and adding to the importance of punishing it when discovered.\u201d United States v. Rabinowich, 1915, 238 U.S. 78, 88, 35 S.Ct. 682, 685, 59 L.Ed. 1211.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">For the reasons stated the judgment as to appellant Shay (No. 12,868) is reversed and remanded for a new trial not inconsistent with this opinion; judgments as to each appellant other than Shay are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">No. 12868 reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">Nos. 12861-7, 12869-71 affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 (1952):</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u201cThe officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">.

United States, 10 Cir., 1934, 73 F.2d 861, 866-867, 96 A.L.R. 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The testimony in this case is almost exclusively that of the police officers who investigated the case. Rather than undertake a detailed analysis of this 2,000 page transcript at this point,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I deem it sufficient to refer, as a fair abstract of the officers\u2019 testimony, to the nine-page affidavit they filed to support their requests for search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The skeletal facts are that the police, suspecting appellant Glover of being a numbers runner, placed him under surveillance and were thereby led to numerous other persons and places, including all of the appellants and the five raided premises. The report of a typical day\u2019s surveillance shows Bossy Glover making a round of calls on a regular circuit, coming out of each place with his \u201cpockets bulging.\u201d Then, the affidavit continues :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201cAbout 2:20 p. m. Glover came out of the rear of 41 L Street, N.W., and about three minutes later the 1941 Studebaker Sedan, K-5921, driven by James Davis, parked in the rear of 41 L Street, N.W. Davis got out of his car, walked over to Glover, and Glover handed him a large brown paper bag, believed to contain number slips, money, or other numbers paraphernalia. Davis then got back in his car and drove off. About 2:30 p. m., Officers Thomas and Jefferson went to the vicinity of Tenth and W Streets, N.W., and at about 2:35 p. m., this date, Officers Thomas and Jefferson observed Bossy Glover, who was known to be picking up numbers, park the Chevrolet Sedan, DC 3-3565 on the north side of the 1100 block of W Street, N.W., walk south through an alley and enter the rear of premises 2126 10th Street, N.W.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">\u201cAbout 2:45 p. m., Nov. 19, 1953, James Shay was seen to enter 2126 10th Street, N.W., with his overcoat pocket bulging, believed to be caused by number slips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">\u201cAbout 2:47 p. m., Nov. 19, 1953, Bernie King was seen walking north in the 2100 block of 10th St., N.W. carrying a large brown paper bag, believed to have contained number slips or numbers paraphernalia, which he took into premises 2126 10th St., N.W.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">\u201cAbout 2:50 p. m., Nov. 19, 1953, Bossy Glover was seen to leave the rear of premises 2126 10th St., N. W., get into his car and drive off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-16\">\u201cAbout 3:13 p. m., November 19, 1953, Moultrie Wilson, a known numbers operator, was seen to drive north on 10th St., N.W., in a 1952 Ford Sedan, DCJ-707, park abreast in this block, and enter premises 2126 10th St., N.W., carrying a small brown paper bag, believed to contain number slips or other numbers paraphernalia. He remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>in these premises about 2 minutes, returned to his car without the bag, and drove off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201cAbout 3:25 p. m., Nov. 19, 1953, George Bell, a suspected numbers writer, was seen to drive north on 10th St., N.W., make a \u2018you\u2019 turn at W Street, N.W., and stop in front of 2126 10th St., N.W., at which time an unidentified colored man who was a passenger on the front seat of this car was seen to carry a brown paper bag, believed to contain number slips, into premises 2126 10th St., N.W. He remained inside about two minutes, came out minus the brown paper bag, got back into the car, and was driven out of the area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Substantially the same confluence of suspects in and about 2126 10th Street, N. W., was observed from day to day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The other important center of the operation (and of a higher echelon, since it was a \u201ccounting-house\u201d) was 1628 O Street, N.W., where Davis would go after meeting Glover. As the District Court said in denying appellants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201cAfter their customary meeting, Glover would enter 2126 10th Street, N.W., and Davis 1628 O Street, N. W., at about the same time other known and suspected numbers operators and certain unidentified persons would come together, raising a fair inference these premises were collection and counting centers where the numbers picked up that day were brought together, tabulated and checked against the winning number of the day, and the winnings allocated for distribution on the next day through the writers, collectors and runners. There was significance also in the time of day, between 2:30 and 3:45 p. m., when these persons would assemble, this being the time when operations at the headquarters of numbers opertions customarily commence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The meetings between Davis and Glover were important, according to the Government, because they \u201clinked the latter with the counting house at 1628 O Street, N.W., Glover never having been observed to have entree in the chain of addresses higher than 1026 [sic] 10th Street, N.W.\u201d Government\u2019s brief, p. 14. A number of other appellants as well appear to have had connection only with the 10th Street money-drop, but not with the O Street counting house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It would seem, then, that the identification of the 10th Street premises as a money-drop was a crucial part of the prosecution\u2019s conspiracy case. The direct evidence upon which that identification was based was the illegally seized evidence we are discussing. It consisted of a paper bag containing $786.13 (including three one-dollar bills used by a police officer in buying a \u201cnumber\u201d from appellant Holsey on the day of the raid) and an adding machine tape; an adding machine; tapes showing computation of a winning number from horse race mutuels; number plays; a book of number slips; a pad of slips used for numbers; a racing sport sheet; two telephones; rolls of adding machine tape; and boxes of coin envelopes.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">The chain with which the prosecution bound together these numerous appellants seems to have had two key links: the O Street counting house and the 10th Street money-drop. That the quarry would remain ensnared despite the broken 10th Street link is something we cannot determine and should not assume. I cannot say from this record that those of the appellants who, like Glover, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>connected to the conspiracy through their contacts with the 10th Street premises would not, within reasonable possibility, have been acquitted but for the illegal evidence. Nor can I say with \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the other conspirators, who were connected to the conspiracy through 0 Street rather than 10th Street, would not have been acquitted if the 10th Street evidence were omitted, Conspiracies, including this one, are not proven by neatly compartmentalized evidence, but rather by an involved and interrelated mass of acts and statements by the various conspirators, the acts and statements of each member being admissible and binding against all the others. As Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in Krulewitch v. United States, 1949, 336 U.S. 440, 453, 69 S.Ct. 716, 723, 93 L.Ed. 790, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axl\">\u201cAs a practical matter, the accused often is confronted with a hodgepodge of acts and statements by others which he may never have authorized or intended, or even known about, but which help to persuade the jury of existence of the conspiracy itself. In other words, a conspiracy often is proved by evidence that is admissible only upon assumption that conspiracy existed. The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury, cf. Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 559 [68 S.Ct. 248, 92 L.Ed. 154], all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction. See Skidmore v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. [2 Cir.], 167 F.2d 54.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWP\">In the instant case, moreover, even the \u201cunmitigated fiction\u201d is absent, for all the evidence was admitted and considered against all the defendants for all purposes. When a prosecutor adds to an indictment a conspiracy count \u2014 \u201cthat darling of the modern prosecutor\u2019s nursery\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 his purpose is to take advantage 0f this very looseness of admissibiltty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among the \u201cleverages obtained by the prosecution through proceeding as for conspiracy instead of as for the substantive offense is that it may get into evidence against one defendant acts or omissions which color the case against all.\u201d Mr. Justice Jackson, dissenting in Lutwak v. United States, 1953, 344 U.S. 604, 623, 73 S.Ct. 481, 492, 97 L.Ed. 593. See also 56 Col.L.Rev. 1112 (1956). In seeking that advantage, the prosecution assumes the risk that error may fatally weaken the entire interlocked structure,</p>\n<p id=\"At\">In addition to conspiracy, some or all of the appellants were convicted of the substantive offenses of (1) operating a lottery, D.C.Code 1951, \u00a7 22-1501, which includes being \u201cconcerned * * *, in any * * * manner,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in * * * promoting, * * * directly or indirectly, any policy lottery, policy shop, or any lottery * * (2) possession of numbers slips, D.C.Code 1951, Supp. III, \u00a7 22-1502, which applies to anyone who shall \u201chave in his possession or under his control,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> any record, notation, receipt, ticket, certificate, bill, slip, token, paper, or writing, current or not current, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>used or to be used in violating the provisions of sections 22-1501\u201d et al.; and (3) permitting maintenance of gambling premises, D.C.Code 1951, Supp. III, \u00a7 22-1505, by which it is \u201cunlawful for any person in the District of Columbia knowingly, as owner, lessee, agent, employee, operator, occupant or otherwise, to maintain or aid or permit the maintaining of any gambling premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In view of the breadth and generality of these statutes, there is an inextricable overlapping of proof between these substantive offenses and the conspiracy charge. Moreover, since the acts and statements of each conspirator are admissible against all, even on an indictment for a substantive offense, People v. Luciano, 1938, 277 N.Y. 348, 14 N.E.2d 433, 435-36, this overlapping must entail all or substantially all of the evidence in this record. \u201cThere is no reason to believe * * * [that the whole mass of evidence] which came before the jury as an organic tissue of proof can be severed and given distributive significance by holding that [it] had a major share in the conviction of some of the [appellants] and none at all as to the others.\u201d Anderson v. United States, 318 U.S. at page 357, 63 S.Ct. at page 602. We have no greater assurance of these substantive convictions than of the conspiracy convictions, had the jury not been given the illegal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">There remain to be discussed only the numbers-selling convictions of appellants Glover and Holsey under D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1501. That section makes it unlawful, generally, to be concerned in any manner in promoting a lottery (as already noted) , or, specifically, to sell or transfer, or possess for the purpose of sale or transfer, any lottery slip or ticket (which sale, transfer or possession are also components and evidence of the more general offense). Glover and Holsey were convicted of both general and specific violations of this section. It may be that convictions for the specific offenses of selling numbers could be reached by the jury on the evidence of the police officers who made the purchases, without any support from any of the more general evidence in the case, especially the evidence illegally seized in the 10th Street raid. Yet, quite apart from the direct effect upon the jury that the illegal evidence may have, it is also by no means clear that the jury would select these two underlings for punishment, if the operators of the counting house and the money-drop were acquitted, and even less clear that the trial judge would have given them as heavy a sentence as he did. We said in Nelson v. United States, 93 U.S.App.D.C. at 23, 208 F.2d at page 514: \u201cMoreover, we think it \u2018unjust and illogical to separate [these] cases\u2019 [citing United States v. Thomson, 7 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 643, 646] by reversing the judgment against the one charged with controlling the illegal enterprise and affirming the judgments against those who did his bidding.\u201d Since Shay\u2019s conviction is reversed, we should at least vacate Glover\u2019s and Holsey\u2019s sentences and remand their cases to the District Court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The majority affirms, as unaffected by the illegal evidence, all the convictions save that of Shay, who was arrested at the 10th Street address. Shay\u2019s conviction under D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1501 for operating a lottery they reverse, because the illegal evidence loomed larger against him than against any of the other appellants. In making that discrimination, the majority must have decided that the testimony of the police officers about Shay\u2019s activities (and about Glover\u2019s statements concerning those activities) did not sufficiently involve Shay as a person \u201cconcerned * * * in any * * * manner\u201d with a lottery operation. With respect to the other appellants, presumably, my colleagues find sufficient untainted evidence to support the convictions. The close weighing of evidence which produces such differentiations is, I think, peculiarly a jury function. I have seldom seen a case where we could not point to evidence which <em>might </em>produce and support a conviction. But testing the prejudicial effect of error by combing the record in search of untainted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>support of the verdict is a substitution of our judgment for that of the jury. Where a jury has convicted on the basis of a certain quantum of evidence, I would only in the clearest of cases hold that it would, beyond any reasonable doubt, have convicted on less.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">.
