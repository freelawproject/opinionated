He considered that the maturity date of the preferred debentures, being \u201c \u2018upon liquidation of the company\u2019 \u201d, did not constitute \u201ca \u2018fixed date\u2019 \u201d or a certain time, as required by the aforementioned statute and the regulation promulgated thereunder. [139 F.Supp. 472].</p>\n<p id=\"b897-19\">We are in accord with his reasoning. In addition to having no fixed maturity date, the debentures in question were not issued for new capital, had a face value nearly ten times the stockholders\u2019 equity, and were junior to the claims of general creditors. We find on the whole record that no other point presented by appellant has been established to gainsay the correctness of the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">Accordingly, the order dismissing the taxpayer\u2019s complaint is ordered to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
