Brownell, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 240 F.2d 634, decided this date. In Coelho\u2019s deportation hearing, in addition to a warrant of arrest, an Immigration Service Form 257 (record of arrival) and a sworn statement, there was introduced into evidence an application by appellant for an extension of his temporary stay as a business visitor, and a subsequent letter by applicant requesting permission to leave the country voluntarily prior to the commencement of a deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">These two documents, in possession of the Immigration Service <em>before </em>appellant undertook to challenge the deportation order, contain every element necessary to sustain his deportability without resort to appellant\u2019s testimony at the deportation hearing or to challenged documents received in evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">On this record Coelho\u2019s deportability is plainly authorized by the statutes. See Bilokumsky v. Tod, 1923, 263 U.S. 149, 44 S.Ct. 54, 68 L.Ed. 221, and Tsimounis v. Holland, 3 Cir., 1956, 228 F.2d 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">The order of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
