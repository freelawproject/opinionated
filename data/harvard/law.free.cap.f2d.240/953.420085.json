They filed joint income tax returns for those years in which they reported approximately $15,000 of income. It is conceded that their actual income during that period was over $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">The Tax Court found that at least part of the deficiency for each of th\u00e9 years in question was due to fraud with intent to evade tax and sustained the imposition of fifty per cent fraud penalties pursuant to Section 293(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 293(b). Petitioners contend that this finding was clearly erroneous because it was based solely upon the admitted understatements of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">It is true that a taxpayer\u2019s admission of a deficiency does not, standing alone, sustain the Commissioner\u2019s burden of proving fraud. However, in view of other evidence in the record, it cannot be said in this case that the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the Commissioner had sustained his burden of proof was clearly erroneous. Drieborg v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">The decision of the Tax Court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
