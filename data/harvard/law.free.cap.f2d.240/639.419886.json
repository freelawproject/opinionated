On November 2, 1953, the wife had obtained a limited divorce on the ground of the husband\u2019s desertion. His desertion, the court then found, began June 2, 1948 and \u201ccontinued for more than two years without interruption or cohabitation and until the present time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">Until it had continued two years, <em>i.e. </em>until June 2, 1950, the desertion was not a cause for divorce. 49 Stat. 539, D.C. Code (1951) \u00a7 16-403. June 2, 1950 was less than five years before the present complaint was filed. Since \u201cdesertion\u201d and \u201cvoluntary separation\u201d cannot exist at the same time, the 1953 decree bars this action. We do not consider whether it would bar a similar action brought more than five years after June 2, 1950 but less than five years after November 2, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">Appellant relies on Parks v. Parks, 73 App.D.C. 93, 116 F.2d 556, and Buford v. Buford, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 156 F.2d 567. Those cases are not in point here, since \u201cThe District Court may put a legal end to marriages which no longer exist in fact only in those eases where the separation has been continuously voluntary on the part of both husband and wife for the statutory period.\u201d Martin v. Martin, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 42, 160 F. 2d 20, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
