He concedes that for a period of approximately seven or eight weeks from April 20, 1954, he \u201cacted solely as de facto president\u201d of Ralph Jaeger, Inc., which was adjudged a bankrupt on July 16, 1954. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>bankrupt was a commercial art studio, and Harris was in the printing business. Harris does not challenge the referee\u2019s findings which show that in April 1954 he came into the bankrupt\u2019s business on a financial reorganization and then ran the financial end of the business, although the formal steps to signalize these changes were never completed. But he was authorized to draw checks on the corporate accounts and did draw such checks; in fact, he \u201cwas undoubtedly acting as if he were president.\u201d So the referee directed that both he and Ralph Jaeger, who had remained active, should prepare the schedules and statement of affairs required of the bankrupt under \u00a7 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 25. Respondent\u2019s sole defense is that on the referee\u2019s findings he ceased to be president sometime between June 20 and June 30, i. e., at least two weeks before the bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Before the Chandler Act this court had held that a bankrupt\u2019s treasurer could be ordered to file the schedules. In re Brockton Ideal Shoe Co., 2 Cir., 200 F. 745, 747. This principle was incorporated into the Act by the Chandler amendments in 1938 which added subdivision b to supplement \u00a7 7a, wherein are set forth the general obligations of a bankrupt to file schedules of his property and creditors and a statement of his affairs. This new provision is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u201c(b) Where the bankrupt is a corporation, its officers, the members of its board of directors or trustees or of other similar controlling bodies, its stockholders or members, or such of them as may be designated by the court, shall perform the duties imposed upon the bankrupt by this title.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 25(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The general language and wide scope of this provision would suggest that it is designed to reach the officers or fiduciaries of a bankrupt corporation, all of whom have a quite positive duty \u201cto aid the honest administration of the estate in all its aspects.\u201d Goldie v. Cox, 8 Cir., 130 F.2d 695, 708. Nothing in the provision or its background suggests that it should be construed so narrowly as to allow of evasion of its salutary purpose by the patent device of resignation just prior to bankruptcy. It is to be noted that the Official Form for the bankrupt\u2019s Statement of Affairs requires answers to inquiries covering a considerable period of time, notably a year as to repayment of loans, assignment of accounts, losses, and personal loans and withdrawals. See paragraphs 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of Form 3, 11 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 53. A commonsense interpretation of the statute according to its intent would avoid reading into it an exclusion of those fiduciaries, only lately retired, who have the most direct knowledge of the matters as to which information is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Respondent relies on a dictum uttered by the majority in In re Bush Terminal Co., 2 Cir., 102 F.2d 471, to the effect that the new subdivision b did not broaden the statute so as to include within its scope a former stockholder or director, \u201cwho is neither at the time of the filing of the petition.\u201d But clearly he reads too much into these words. The dispute which divided the court there was whether a former director and stockholder of a debtor in reorganization, but who had ceased to be such more than three years and a half before the petition, could be examined under both \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 21 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 25, 44. The majority, with Judge L. Hand dissenting, held that he could be examined only under the latter section, i.e., not as an officer. This case, as pointed out by Judge Hand in United States v. Weissman, 2 Cir., 219 F.2d 837, 841, \u201cdid not concern anyone who had been \u2018designated by the court\u2019 to perform the bankrupt\u2019s duties.\u201d In any event, the substantial difference in the time intervals removes all persuasiveness from the claimed analogy.
