Sparrow-Kroll Lumber Co., 1911, 168 Mich. 49, 133 N.W. 938, 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 959; Martin v. Jones, 1942, 302 Mich. 355, 4 N.W.2d 686; Vinson v. Thomas, 1947, 318 Mich. 175, 27 N.W.2d 523, a more recent case decided by the Supreme Court of Michigan, Stewart v. Napuche, 1952, 334 Mich. 76, 53 N.W.2d 676, supports the action of the district judge in declining to direct a verdict for the defendant. In that case, it was held that a master who puts his servant in a position of trust or responsibility, or commits to him the management of his business or the care of his business, is justly held responsible when the servant, through lack of judgment or discretion or when angered or emotionally aroused by the circumstances and occasion, goes beyond the strict line of his duty or authority and inflicts unjustifiable injury upon another.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
