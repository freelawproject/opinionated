International Derrick erected the 265-foot supporting tower and contracted with the defendant, Henry R. Buxbaum, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to raise the mast. Buxbaum furnished his own equipment, including the gin pole which he mounted on top of the tower to support the mast during the lift.</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">The mast had been partially raised when the gin pole suddenly bent and caused the mast to fall to the ground damaging the mast beyond repair. International Derrick, under its contract to complete the operation for the owners of the broadcasting station, purchased a new mast at a net loss to it of $4,365.48. It sought to recover that sum from Buxbaum in a suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judgment was first entered for Buxbaum<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that International Derrick had failed to meet its burden of proof that it was damaged through Buxbaum\u2019s negligence. We reversed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground that the District Court \u201cfailed to take into account the inference of negligence permissible under the Pennsylvania doctrine of \u2018exclusive control\u2019 \u201d and \u201cThat the defendant [Buxbaum] had <em>exclusive control </em>as to the choice of equipment and its use, the timing, and the various details incident to the actual erection of the antenna mast is shown by the undisputed testimony.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) On remand the District Court entered judgment for International Derrick,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to its making the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5-\">No. 18. \u201cAlthough at the time of the accident defendant [Buxbaum] did not have a proprietary type of control of the antenna, <em>it did have a control in the nature of a possessory handling </em>of the antenna for the purpose of its erection in accordance with the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_r\">No. 19. <em>\u201cDefendant had exclusive control as to the choice of equipment and its use, the timing, and the various details incident to the actual erection of the antenna mast. </em>The broadcasting company\u2019s engineer and general manager were present to control possible damage to the equipment during the lifting operation, <em>but neither took any part in the actual supervision.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aad\">The fact that the District Court in Fact-Finding No. 18 found that Buxbaum had \u201cpossessory control\u201d and not \u201cproprietary control\u201d of the antenna mast when it fell and was damaged is the nub of the controversy between the parties on this appeal. That is so because following the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment against Buxbaum, International Derrick instituted attachment sur judgment against the insurer garnishee by reason of the fact that it had issued to Buxbaum a property damage liability policy in connection with \u201cIron or Steel Erection\u201d, and the policy contained a clause (Exclusion G) which excluded liability with respect to \u201cproperty in the care, custody or control of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The insurer invoked the provisions of the exclusion clause in answers filed to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories and plaintiff moved for judgment on the ground that the District Court had not found (in the suit by International Derrick against Buxbaum) that Buxbaum had \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d of the antenna mast at the time of the accident and consequently the exclusion clause is inoperative. The District Court denied the motion on the ground that Buxbaum did have \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion clause of the policy and entered the judgment in favor of insurer which led to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">International Derrick here contends that the word \u201ccontrol\u201d in the policy exclusion clause contemplates \u201cproprietary control\u201d rather than \u201cpossessory handling\u201d so that the exclusion clause does not apply. Insurer urges Buxbaum\u2019s \u201cexclusive control\u201d is within the meaning of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d as used in the exclusion clause and that it consequently applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The distinction suggested by International Derrick is not persuasive, and a finding of lack of control in- this case would be \u201ccontrary to the fact, contrary to the ordinary definition of control quoted by appellee <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and contrary to the settled decisional law.\u201d McLouth Steel Corp. v. Mesta Machine Co., 3 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 608, 612, certiorari denied Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Foster, 348 U.S. 873, 75 S.Ct. 109, 99 L.Ed. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">That the mast was in Buxbaum\u2019s care, custody or control for the purposes of its erection is established by the District Court\u2019s factual finding and for purposes of the policy exclusion it should be no</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">less true that the mast was in Buxbaum\u2019s \u201ccare, custody or control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The scope of the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusion and the coverage afforded by policies of insurance containing such an exclusion are clarified in the decided cases. Where the property damaged is merly incidental to the property upon which the work is being performed by the insured, the exclusion is not applicable. Cohen v. Keystone Mutual Casualty Co., 1943, 151 Pa.Super. 211, 30 A.2d 203; Rex Roofing Co. v. Lumber Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. of New York, 1952, 280 App.Div. 665, 116 N.Y.S.2d 876, appeal denied, 1953, 281 App.Div. 744, 118 N.Y.S.2d 732, 305 N.Y. 932, 112 N.E.2d 288; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Hopper, Tex.Civ.App., 1950, 237 S.W.2d 411; A. T. Morris &amp; Co. v. Lumber Mut. Casualty Ins. Co. of New York, 1937, 163 Misc. 715, 298 N.Y.S. 227. However, where the property damaged is under the supervision of the insured and is a necessary element of the work involved, the property is in the \u201ccare, custody, or control\u201d of the insured. Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Mason-Moore-Tracy, Inc., 2 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 173; L. L. Jarrell Construction Co. v. Columbia Casualty Co., D.C.S.D.Ala.1955, 130 F.Supp. 436; Root Motor Co. v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., 1932, 187 Minn. 559, 246 N.W. 118; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Holmsgaard, 1956, 10 Ill.App.2d 1, 133 N.E.2d 910; John G. Speirs &amp; Co. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, 1948, 84 Cal.App.2d 603, 191 P.2d 124.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In McLouth Steel Corp. v. Mesta Machine Co., supra [214 F.2d 611], we held that where the insured had negligently dropped a large roll grinder which it was in the process of installing in the plaintiff\u2019s plant, the \u201ccare, cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tody or control\u201d exclusion was not applicable. In that case we were compelled to rely upon Welborn v. Illinois National Casualty Co., 1952, 347 Ill.App. 65, 106 N.E.2d 142. This decision has been weakened, however, by the recent case of Maryland Casualty Co. v. Holmsgaard, supra [10 Ill.App.2d 1, 133 N.E.2d 913], where the Illinois Court declared an insurance carrier to be relieved of liability due to a \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusion. In any event, the McLouth decision involves the application of the law of Illinois and need not affect our view of the applicable law of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">That the principles expressed above would be applied in the Pennsylvania courts is indicated by Speier v. Ayling, 1946, 158 Pa.Super. 404, 45 A.2d 385. There Ayling was driving Speier\u2019s automobile with Speier sitting by his side when there was an accident causing damage to the vehicle. The insurance carrier had issued a policy of insurance to Ayling containing an exclusion for damage to property \u201cin charge of\u201d Ayling. In holding that the claim for damage to Speier\u2019s automobile was excluded from coverage under Ayling\u2019s policy, the Court said, 158 Pa. Super, at page 407, 45 A.2d at page 387, \u201c[b]eing in <em>sole </em>control by permission of the owner, the latter\u2019s automobile (property) was \u2018in charge of\u2019 Ayling, the insured.\u201d Buxbaum\u2019s supervision of and authority over the mast with respect to its erection in the presence of the broadcasting company\u2019s representatives is analogous to Ayling\u2019s charge of the car in the presence of Speier, its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In Pennsylvania \u201c * * * it is settled that where the language of the policy is clear and unambiguous it cannot be construed to mean otherwise than what it says. It must be given the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms used * * * The parties have the right to make their own contract, and it is not the function of this Court to re-write it, or to give it a construction in conflict with the accepted and plain meaning of the language used. * * * \u201d Topkis v. Rosenzweig, 1939, 333 Pa. 529, 531, 532, 5 A.2d 100, 101.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">That being so it is clear that in view of the fact that the antenna mast was in the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d of Buxbaum at the time of the accident the District Court correctly held the exclusion clause was operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A-8\">.

Boswell v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 1956, 38 N.J.Super. 599, 120 A.2d 250, can be reconciled with this line of cases.
