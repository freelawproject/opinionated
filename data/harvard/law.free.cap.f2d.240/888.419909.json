C. Code 1951, \u00a7\u00a7 22-1501, 1502, 1505 and 1508. Both were convicted of violation of Title 26 United States Code, \u00a7 7262, in that, within the District of Columbia, they respectively \u201cengaged in the business of accepting wagers\u201d without either having paid an occupational tax. They argue that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to convict them of these last-mentioned counts, because they should have been tried in the Maryland district for having failed to pay the tax to the District Director in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">Cases relied upon, such as Wampler v. Snyder,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are not in point since an income tax return of a District of Columbia resident was required by statute to be filed in Baltimore, irrespective of where the taxpayer earned his income. Thus, when a false return was filed, the violation occurred where the filing took place. The appellants here were not charged with evasion of a tax payable in Baltimore, but with the doing of acts in the District of Columbia which made them liable to pay the special tax of $50 per year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">The applicable statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-18\">\u201cAny person <em>who does any act which makes him liable </em>for special tax under subchapter B of chapter 35 without having paid such tax, shall, besides being liable to the payment of the tax, be fined not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-19\">Congress made it clear that the occupational tax imposed by Section 4411 is \u201can integral part of any plan for the taxation of wagers and * * * essential to the collection and enforcement of such a tax.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Criminal liability does not depend upon nonpayment at a particular place. Hence, the indictment charged that the acts which made Beach and Greene liable to pay the tax occurred here, in the District of Columbia. When proof beyond reasonable doubt established that element of the count, it remained only for the Government to prove similarly that the required tax had not been paid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-20\">We have examined other contentions of the appellants and find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\">. 1933, 62 App.D.C. 215, 66 F.2d 195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-13\">.
