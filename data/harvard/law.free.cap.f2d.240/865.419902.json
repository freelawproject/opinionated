U. S. Atty., with whom Messrs. Oliver Gasch, U. S. Atty., Lewis Carroll, and Robert L. Toomey, Asst. U. S. Attys., at the time brief was filed, were on the brief, for appellees. Mr. Leo A. Rover, U. S.

He thereupon appealed to the Ninth Regional Office of the Civil Service Commission, which, after hearing, affirmed the action of the agency; and he appealed, in turn, to the Civil Service Commission, which affirmed the action of the Regional Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">This civil action was then instituted and, on motion, summary judgment was entered for appellees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\"> This case clearly falls within that line of eases in which this court has held many times that it will not review the action of executive officials in dismissing executive employees, except to insure compliance with statutory requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As in Boylan v. Quarles, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 337, 235 F.2d 834, 835 there was here \u201c[n]o substantial departure from applicable procedures, no misconstruction of governing legislation, nor any like error going to the heart of the administrative determination. * * <em>*\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">Appellant alleges further that the charges were \u201cpicayunish\u201d and inspired by political considerations; and that, his removal having been for political reasons, it was prohibited by Civil Service regulations. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that there was any reliable evidence that the charges were of such nature, this matter was investigated by the Regional Office and by the Civil Service Commission. Both held that the evidence of record disclosed that the decision of the Department in removing him was not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious but was for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service within the meaning of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 851 et seq., and that the evidence did not establish that appellant\u2019s removal was for political reasons, as prohibited by Civil Service regulations. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">We have examined the other contentions urged by appellant and find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-10\">. Memorandum opinion of Judge McGarraghy is reported in Saggau v. Young, D.C.1956, 138 F.Supp. 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-11\">. See, e. g., Blackmon v. Lee, 1953, 92 U.S. App.D.C. 268, 205 F.2d 13; Carter v. Forrestal, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 175 F.2d 364, certiorari denied, 338 U.S. 832, 70 S.Ct. 47, 94 L.Ed. 507.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-13\">. The scant evidence submitted by appellant to show the alleged political nature of the charges was entirely hearsay. After investigation, which we think was procedurally correct, the Ninth Regional Office concluded that \u201cMr. Prull\u2019s hearsay testimony is not sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the adverse action was taken for political reasons rather than for the reasons stated in the letter of adverse decision.\u201d This was affirmed by the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
