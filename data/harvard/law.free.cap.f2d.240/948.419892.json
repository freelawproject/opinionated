Since the article is old, the inventor and plaintiff\u2019s assignor here, a Mrs. Peck, found her new idea in decorated elastic edgings to the leg openings of the garment, each of which came together in an obtuse angle at the front of the leg and was extended up to meet fhe opposite edging at the shield or panel portion in the center. See the illustration given at page 140 of 143 F.Supp. Perhaps it is safer to resort to the words of art used by plaintiff in its brief. Conceding that \u201cup cut banded leg openings and shield-shaped frontal panels were old,\u201d it then asserts that this inventor has \u201cproduced something new and extraordinary; she introduced the banding angle on the front of the thigh, pleasing to the eye, and the harmonious extension of one side of the angle to the frontal panel, also creating in the observer a pleasing impression of taut integration.\u201d And it continues: \u201cMrs. Peck made a notably esthetic thing of a commonplace article, and did so by the simple act of crossing the ends of the banding to form an angle and continuing one side of the angle up to the front panel. If the law will have something which \u2018sparks\u2019 the design as a whole, a \u2018flash of genius,\u2019 that, we submit, is it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">But nevertheless we are constrained to hold that the design does not show invention, and accept Judge Dawson\u2019s persuasive exegesis for that conclusion in his opinion. We add only that the many earlier design patents and catalogue advertisements presented below seem to our mundane eyes quite similar and fully as attractive as this design.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
