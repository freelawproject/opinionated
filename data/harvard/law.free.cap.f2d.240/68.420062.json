All four corporations had identical officers and directors before, and when, plaintiff\u2019s candy was damaged. Defendant resists this claim saying it does not engage in the storing or hauling of merchandise, nor does it solicit business on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The defense can be cast in still another form. Defendant contends plaintiff failed to establish a contractual relationship between itself and the parent, consequently proof of a duty owed by defendant is absent. When plaintiff rested its case, the trial judge dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AxDA\">. Chicago Tunnel Transport Company Piaked ^ plaintiff s candy and it was delivered to the tunnels. A bill of lad-issued marked Chicago Tunnel Term*aaf Company. This record supports f\u00edamtxlff si.case and allowance of the mo-*10n dismiss comP ain^ was un\" warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"A2G\">The record demonstrates existence of four cognate corporations all geared to the activities of one another under the Parent\u2019s control. Under this intimate relationship it would be unjust to fall back on sterile technicalities consisting only of identities of entities as the sole bar to recovery for negIigence by one or more of the subsidiaries.

The appeal presents a striking illustration of subsidiaries actively implementing each other in rendering services to the plaintiff, This parent corporation cannot sit back on its charter and avoid tort responsibility for its delinquent child,</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">The judgment appealed is reversed and remanded with directions to overrule defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and proceed consistent with this opinion,</p>\n<p id=\"Az6\">Reversed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A76\">.
