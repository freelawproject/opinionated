Since this protracted litigation already has elicited three reported opinions from the same District Judge, the Honorable James M. Carter, the opinion just mentioned will be referred to hereinafter as \u201cNo. 3\u201d. The two earlier District Court opinions will be designated by Federal Supplement citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On August 28, 1951, the appellant\u2014 the plaintiff -below\u2014requested a jury trial. On February 20, 1952, the District Judge granted the appellee\u2019s motion to strike that demand. The Court\u2019s action is specified as error. Our present decision is confined .almost entirely to that question alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">2. <em>The Appellant\u2019s Bequest for a Jury Trial Should Have Been Granted</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANJB\">Section 113(b) (1) and (2) of 41 U.S.C.A., which is part of the Contract Settlement Act of 1944, provides for two ways in which a war contractor who is \u201caggrieved by the findings of a contracting agency [here the RFC] * * * may, at his election\u201d either appeal to the \u201cAppeal Board\u201d provided for in Subdivision (d) of the same section, <em>or </em>\u201cbring suit against the United States\u201d in the Court of Claims or in a United States District Court in accordance with \u00a7 1346 of Title 28. Section 2402 of 28 U.S.C.A. specifies that \u201cAny action against the United States under section 1346 of this title shall be tried by the court <em>without </em>a jury\u201d. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">But Section 113(b) (2) specifies'an exception to the non-jury rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201c <em>* </em>* * <em>except that, </em>if the contracting agency is the <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation </em>[the <em>appellee </em>herein], or any corporation organized pursuant to the <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation </em>Act, or any corporation owned or controlled by the United States, the suit shall be brought against such corporation in any court of competent jurisdiction <em>in accordance with existing law.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The statutory distinction made between suits against \u201cthe United States\u201d and those against \u201cany corporation owned or controlled by the United States [including the appellee herein]\u201d, is significant. The only applicable difference between \u00a7 1346 and \u201cexisting law\u201d is that, under Section 2402 of 28 U.S.C.A. a suit <em>against the United States </em>under \u00a7 1346 must be tried without a jury, while under \u201cexisting law\u201d there is no such restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">In other words, the only rational explanation for the excepting clause in \u00a7 113(b) (2) is that, while suits <em>against the United States </em>must be tried without a jury, suits against Government <em>corporations </em>are not so restricted, but are to be tried \u201cin accordance with existing law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">We advance next, therefore, to a consideration of the \u201cexisting law\u201d governing suits for \u201cmonetary compensation\u201d. See 128 F.Supp. at page 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Ordinarily, \u201cthe usual procedure of a District Court in actions at law for money compensation\u201d is one in which \u201cthe right to a jury is an incident\u201d. United States v. Pfitsch, 1921, 256 U.S. 547, 550, 552, 41 S.Ct. 569, 570, 65 L.Ed. 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">\u201c* * * the government does not become the conduit of its immunity in suits against its agents or instrumentalities merely because they do its work.\u201d Keifer &amp; Keifer v. R. F. C., 1939, 306 U.S. 881, 388, 59 S.Ct. 516, 517, 83 L.Ed. 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">While the appellee \u201cacts as a governmental agency in performing its functions * * *, still its transactions are akin to those of private enterprises \u2022and the mere fact that it is an agency of the government does not extend to it the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>immunity of the sovereign.\u201d R. F. C. v. J. G. Menihan Corp., 1941, 312 U.S. 81, 83, 61 S.Ct. 485, 486, 85 L.Ed. 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u201cIn spawning these [governmental] corporations during the past two decades, Congress has uniformly included amenability to law. Congress has provided for not less than forty of such corporations discharging governmental functions, <em>and without exception the authority to-sue-and-be-sued was included. </em>Such a firm practice is partly an indication of the present climate of opinion which has brought governmental immunity from suit into disfavor, partly it reveals a definite attitude on the part of Congress which should be given hospitable scope.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] Keifer &amp; Keifer v. R. F. C., supra, 306 U.S. at pages 390-391, 59 S.Ct. at page 518.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201cBut even the immunity enjoyed by the United States as territorial sovereign is a legal doctrine which has not been favored by the test of time. It has increasingly been found to be in conflict with the growing subjection of governmental action to the moral judgment.\u201d National City Bank of New York v. Republic of China, 1955, 348 U.S. 356, 359, 75 S.Ct. 423, 426, 99 L.Ed. 389.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The first of the two main grounds upon which the decision of the District Court on this jury-trial point is based is that \u201cthe section [113(b)] has been referred to as a method of appealing from the determination of the contracting agency\u201d, and that therefore \u201cin the absence of an express statutory grant, no jury trial is available.\u201d Monolith Portland Midwest Co. v. R. F. C., D.C.Cal., 1952, 102 F.Supp. 951, 953. As we have seen, however, the <em>appeal </em>subparagraph (1) of \u00a7 113(b) is separate and distinct from subparagraph (2), which deals in part with suits brought against RFC \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with existing law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The second ground for the District Court\u2019s holding that the appellant was not entitled to a jury was that an \u201canalogous situation\u201d is found in suits for \u201ccondemnation\u201d; that in such actions, \u201cthere is no constitutional right to trial by jury * * * in the absence of a specific statutory grant.\u201d 102 F.Supp. at pages 953-954, supra. The lower court\u2019s reference to condemnation suits is unfortunate; for while a jury trial is not required in condemnation suits as a <em>constitutional </em>matter, in practice juries have often been used in such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">In Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 6 Cir., 1918, 249 F. 385, 402, a condemnation case, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cFinding the amount of compensation is another term for assessing damages, and this always has been a recognized function of a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">In that case, certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court, 1918, 248 U.S. 576-577, 39 S.Ct. 18, 63 L.Ed. 428, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">Similarly, in Filbin Corporation v. United States, D.C.S.C.1920, 266 F. 911, 916, the Court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\u201cIt would seem absurd to say that, if the United States sued a man on a contract or for a tort, in which it sought to make him pay more than the sum of $20, it could not deprive him of the right to have the issue tried by a jury, and then to say that, if the United States by virtue of any act of Congress desires to wrest from a man, under either requisition or condemnation, property claimed to be worth $1,000,000, * * * on that question, as to the quantum to be paid him, he is not entitled to a trial by jury!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">In United States v. Theimer, 10 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 501, 503 the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">\u201cIt had long been thought that there should be uniformity of procedure in Federal condemnation cases. Prolonged study had been given to the subject by the Advisory Committee of the Supreme Court. Different rules had been proposed, studied, revised and amended over a number of years, all of which finally culminated in Rule 71A [of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.] as it now exists. * * * Throughout all these studies runs the thought <em>that litigants should, have the right of trial by jury of the issue of value except only in extraordinary and exceptional cases and that the commissioner provision of the Rule should be employed only in exceptional cases where because of peculiar circumstances trial by jury was inadvisable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">* <em>* * </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cWe, therefore, conclude that the parties to a condemnation proceeding are ordinarily entitled to a jury under Rule 71A (h) as a matter of right <em>and that where demand is made for the same the judge must grant a jury </em>trial, unless under the facts as they appear in the case because of the character, location, or quantity of the property to be condemned, or for other reasons revealed by the facts of the case, the interest of justice warrants the submission of question of' value and compensation to a commission:\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">And in United States v. Waymire, 10 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 550, 552, Judge Bratton said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cUnder such provision in the rule [71A(h)], any party to a condemnation proceeding is ordinarily entitled as a matter of right to trial by jury of the issue of just compensation for the property taken if demand therefor is made within the time fixed in the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">RFC says that \u201cIt is significant that we have been unable to- find any case in which the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was subject to a trial by jury.\u201d RFC didn\u2019t look hard enough. There is such a case decided by the Supreme Court of a State lying within this Circuit. In R. F. C. v. Lyon, 1934, 179 Wash. 673, 38 P.2d 1029, it is stated that \u201cTrial of the cause to a jury resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendant [Lyon].\u201d The case was affirmed, the Court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">\u201cAll questions of fact are foreclosed by the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of respondent, * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">Finally, the appellee asserts that \u201cEven if there were a right to a jury, it was waived by Monolith.\u201d It is pointed out that Rule 38(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. \u201cprovides that the demand for a jury trial must be served upon the other party not later than ten days after the service of the last pleading directed to an issue\u201d. The appellee\u2019s Answer and Counterclaim were filed on June 18, 1951. The appellant filed its Answer to the Counterclaim and its Request for Jury Trial both on the same day \u2014 August 28, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">The appellee contends that the appellant\u2019s answer to the Counterclaim cannot be considered as being \u201cdirected to the issue , involved in the complaint\u201d, and that therefore the request for a jury trial was filed too late. The appellant, however, correctly points out that the first paragraph of each cause of action of RFC\u2019s Counterclaim incorporates \u201ceach and every admission, denial and allegation contained in [FRC\u2019s] answer\u201d to \u201c[Monolith\u2019s] first, second and third causes of action as though fully set forth herein\u201d. Furthermore, it is pointed out that though Monolith had generally alleged exhaustion of its administrative remedy, Monolith did not plead the RFC Findings in its Complaint. RFC, however, specifically incorporated such Findings in its Answer and Counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">Therefore the \u201clast pleading directed to issue\u201d of Monolith\u2019s Complaint was Monolith\u2019s \u201cAnswer to Counterclaim\u201d and its Request for Jury Trial filed concurrently therewith came within the requirements of Rule 38(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">Accordingly, we hold, that the Court below should have granted the appellant\u2019s request for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">3. <em>The Remaining Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The complaint prays judgment for $247,134.51 for compensation for services rendered and for reimbursement for actual expenditures made by the appellant pursuant to certain agreements; for $130,876.55 \u201cfor reimbursement for actual disbursements and expenditures incurred in connection with the termination of outstanding purchase orders and contracts, completing property records,\u201d etc.; and for $173,131.06 \u201cfor disbursements and expenditures for the protection, maintenance and management of said plant,\u201d etc. This makes a total of $551,142.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In its \u201cFinal Judgment\u201d, the District Court decreed that the appellant \u201cis entitled to judgment on its claims in the sum of $109,322.49, with interest at <em>2Yz% </em>per annum from April 10, 1950, in the sum of $13,206.60, for a total of $122,529.09\u201d; and that the appellee \u201cis entitled to judgment on its injunction bond counterclaim in the sum of $151,-274.96, with interest at 2% per annum from April 10, 1950, in the sum of $14,-616.00, for a total of $165,890.96\u201d; that \u201cthese sums be and are offset,\u201d and that appellant \u201ctake nothing in this action, and [appellee] recover of [appellant] the sum of $43,361.87.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In addition, the complaint asks for $600,000 for the cost of the completion of the alumina plant, and \u201creadying said plant for operation\u201d; for the additional sum of $1,500,000 for the cost of managing and operating that plant during an experimental test period \u201cto determine the feasibility of obtaining large scale production of alumina by use of [appellant\u2019s] process\u201d; and, finally, \u201cin the alternative and in the event that * * * [appellant] is not entitled to the relief prayed for * * *, [appellant] have judgment against the [appellee] in the sum of $7,500,000 as * * * general damages,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We agree with the Court below that these last three claims are not proper under the Contract Settlement Act, <em>supra, </em>but sound in specific performance or breach of contract. No. 3, 128 F.Supp. at page 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In these respects, as well as on the questions of the termination of the contracts, \u201cfair compensation,\u201d etc., we hold that the District Court correctly narrowed the factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">We hold that Congress, in providing in 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 113(b) (2), that suits against the appellee, <em>inter alios, </em>should be tried \u201cin accordance with existing law\u201d, intended that such suits should be tried by jury. The fact that the appellee is specifically mentioned in an <em>excepting </em>clause following a general provision for non-jury suits against the United States in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 1346 and 2402 of 28 U.S.C.A., confirms this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">We also hold that the Court below correctly narrowed the factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Accordingly, the judgment is vacated and the ease is remanded to the District Court with instructions to grant a jury trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-18\"><em>. </em>See also United States v. 1146.32 Acres of Land, D.C.Tex.1955, 132 F.Supp. 681, 682.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
