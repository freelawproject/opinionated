We think it apparent from our original decision that the ruling complained of<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was upheld in reliance upon the Trial Examiner\u2019s statement in the <em>printed record, </em>the Board\u2019s apparent assumption in adoption of his report, and the Board\u2019s argument in brief, that it was referable only to the appropriate inferences to be drawn from respondent\u2019s failure to adduce any evidence, i. e., when testing the sufficiency of the General Counsel\u2019s proof upon the formal motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, since a re-examination of this issue leaves us in considerable doubt as to whether the rule was properly applied only to the motion to dismiss, rather than improperly to an appraisal of the evidence on the merits, the paragraph complained of (footnote 1, supra) and the footnotes thereto are hereby withdrawn. This deletion is intended to avoid any possible implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>from the language used that we intended to displace the conventional rule as to the burden of proof on the merits being upon the General Counsel. See N.L.R.B. v. McGahey, 5 Cir., 233 F.2d 406, 413. But we do not think that any implications from the statements complained of are sufficient to warrant denial of enforcement or remand where, as here, both the Trial Examiner and Board expressly based their findings \u201cupon the entire record,\u201d and certainly this Court predicated its enforcement of the order as based upon findings supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.

N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">With the deletion in the opinion noted, respondent\u2019s petition for rehearing is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-13\">. \u201cFinally, we also reject respondent\u2019s insistence that the trial examiner and Board improperly placed upon it the burden of disproving the discrimination alleged. The remarks complained of, considered in context,13 were clearly referable to the appropriate inferences to be drawn in ruling upon the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the General Counsel\u2019s proof, and as so applied were correct.14\u201d (Footnotes 13 and 14 omitted)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-28\">. For example, in its reply brief the Board argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-29\">\u201cContrary to respondent\u2019s contention, the Trial Examiner applied this test solely to the formal motion to dismiss. He did not apply it to the appraisal of the evidence on the merits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
