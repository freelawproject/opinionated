The fan itself was not defective, but it was improperly installed with the fan-guard facing onto the porch, thus leaving no guard or protection from the side which faced or protruded into the bedroom, and \u201csaid installation was completed and the fan left on the premises of Mrs. Katz for use.\u201d Later on the same day and after the insured\u2019s employees had completed the installation and left the premises, Mrs. Katz, who was then in her bedroom, sustained serious painful and disabling injuries when one or both of her hands came into contact with the blades of the fan. Thereafter, she made demand upon the insured for damages, and the latter thereupon called upon the insurer for defense and/or settlement of the claim. The insurance company denied liability under the terms of its policy whereupon the insured undertook to defend the claim and through his attorneys who were employed for that purpose effected a settlement with Mrs. Katz for $3,500. For services rendered insured\u2019s attorneys were paid $200.00. It was specifically stipulated that the method of installation might have been found to be a negligent method of installation and might have been found to have been the proximate cause of Mrs. Katz\u2019s injuries, and that the amounts paid in settlement of the claim and to insured\u2019s attorneys were both reasonable sums, and were to the best interests of the insured and constituted an acceptable and reasonable settlement of the claim. It was to recover these sums that the present suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The policy in suit is a Comprehensive Liability Policy covering all of the business operations of the insured except those specifically excluded under various endorsements attached to the policy. It provides coverage for bodily injury liability and property damage liability for several places of business in the cities of Gulfport, Biloxi, Pascagoula, and Ocean Springs, Mississippi. On the face of the policy under the heading, \u201cDeclarations\u201d appear: Item 1, which sets forth the name of the insured and shows his business to be \u201cBakery and retail hardware and appliance stores.\u201d; Item 3, which lists coverages, among which only Coverage A. Bodily Injury Liability is pertinent to this case; and Item 4, which recites that \u201cthe declarations are completed on attached schedules designated \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019.\u201d Only Schedule A is involved in this suit and it contains a \u201cDescription of Hazards\u201d as follows: \u201c(a) Premises-Operations (here are typed the locations of five places of business, designated by the general descriptive terms \u201cStores-Hardware-retail\u201d and one place of business designated \u201cBakeries\u201d); * * * (d) Products (Including Completed Oper<em>ations) </em>\u2014 Excluded * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the general heading \u201cConditions\u201d, and in Paragraph 3 thereof entitled \u201cDefinitions\u201d, the policy further provides that the term \u201cproducts hazard\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOAi\">\u201c(1) the handling or use of, the existence of any condition in or a warranty of goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured, other than equipment rented to or located for use of others but not sold, if the accident occurs after the insured has relinquished possession thereof to others and away from premises, owned, rented or controlled by the insured or on premises for which the classification stated in division (a) of the declarations or in the company\u2019s manual excludes any part of the foregoing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">\u201c(2) operations, if the accident occurs after such operations have been completed or abandoned at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>place of occurrence thereof and away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the insured, except (a) pick-up and delivery, (b) the existence of tools, uninstalled equipment and abandoned or unused materials and (c) operations for which the classification stated in division (a) of the declarations or in the company\u2019s manual specifically includes completed operations; provided, operations shall not be deemed incomplete because improperly or defectively performed or because further operations may be required pursuant to a service or 'maintenance agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Attached to and of even date with the policy are several endorsements, two of which are pertinent here. The first endorsement states that the policy does not apply except in connection with the conduct of a business of which the named insured is the sole owner, and provides that \u201cbusiness\u201d includes trade, profession or occupation. The other endorsement involved in this case, numbered BE 468799, provides, in part: \u201cIt is agreed that the policy does not apply: 1. to the products hazard as defined in the policy * * *\u201d In the court below, as here, the insurance company argued that the accident in question was specifically excluded by Endorsement No. BE 468799, but the trial court being of opinion that the policy covered all matters reasonably incidental to the insured\u2019s trade or business, including claims arising from a defective installation of an appliance sold by the insured, rejected the insurer\u2019s contention. In its opinion the court stated that the endorsement \u201cbears the same date as the policy itself so that the \u2018Products Hazard\u2019 clause was never a part of the policy and it does not afford the defendant any basis for a defense to plaintiff\u2019s claim herein.\u201d The court recognized, however, that if the products hazard clause had remained in the policy, it would have given the insurance company a complete defense to the claim of the insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">We think it plain that the trial court erred in rejecting the insurer\u2019s defense, and in awarding judgment to the insured. The endorsement clearly states that it is the products <em>hazard </em>which is excluded, not the definition thereof as appears in Paragraph 3(f) of the Definitions. The endorsement also makes it clear that the products hazard which is excluded is the products hazard \u201cas defined in the policy.\u201d Thus, the \u201cproducts hazard\u201d definition was not \u201cout of the case * * * as if it had not been printed in the body of the policy,\u201d but instead formed an integral part of the typewritten endorsement as if it were set forth therein in full. Assuming without deciding, that the general coverage of insured\u2019s \u201cPremises-Operations\u201d includes liability for the claim in suit, it is hornbook law that the special written limitation embodied in Endorsement No. BE 468799 controls. This being so, and it having been stipulated that the \u201cinstallation was completed and the fan left on the premises for Mrs. Katz for use\u201d, the claim for injuries resulting from the accident which occured after the insured\u2019s installation operations had been completed and abandoned at the customer\u2019s premises fell squarely within and is excluded by the terms of sub-paragraph (2) of the products hazard definition. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-5\">. Other hazards listed as (b) Elevators, (c) Independent Contractors, and (e) Contractual, all of which bear the notation \u201cNone at Inception\u201d, are not involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
