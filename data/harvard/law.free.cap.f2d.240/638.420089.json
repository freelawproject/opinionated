The Commission declined. It said: \u201cThe Congress which delegated to this Commission the power to regulate public utilities has not conferred upon it the power to grant or withhold licenses to operate. That power has been delegated to the Commissioners of the District of Columbia.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b692-19\">Though the question who may limit the number of licenses to operate taxicabs in not free from doubt, we think the Public Utilities Commission was right. D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 47-2301, 47-2331 (e); cf. \u00a7 47-2331 (d) and (f). The District Court\u2019s judgment for the defendants in the present proceeding brought by the operators against the Commission is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
