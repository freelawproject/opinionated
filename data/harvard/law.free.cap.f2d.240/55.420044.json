United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 192, 76 S.Ct. 763. Under the terms of this provision, consideration is denied \u201cin any event\u201d to an application filed by one who already holds a certain number of station licenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held, in effect, that the denial was not absolute, and hence not fatal, because the Commission rules furnished opportunity to seek changes, waivers, or exceptions with respect to any Commission rule, regulation or requirement. It \u201cread the Act and Regulations as providing a \u2018full hearing,\u2019 \u201d 351 U.S. at page 205, 76 S.Ct. at page 771, and remanded the case to this court to \u201cconsider [petitioner\u2019s] other objections to the Multiple Ownership Rules.\u201d Id., 351 U.S. at page 206, 76 S.Ct. at page 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Since the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Multiple Ownership Rules, <em>as adopted, </em>are reconcilable with the Communications Act [47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.] as a whole,\u201d id., 351 U.S. at pages 203-204, 76 S.Ct. at page 770 (emphasis supplied), the issues before us are narrowly limited. We agree with the Commission that no more than the following two objections of invalidity are now open for our consideration: (1) the particular numerical limitations in the rules, and (2) the one per cent ownership provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">With respect to the specific numerical limitations on station licenses, taking television as an example, the Commission said, \u201cThe * * * rules continue in effect the existing limitation on TV station ownership which, in our judgment based on extensive experience with the problems of multiple ownership, have proven practicable and desirable.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our attention has not been drawn to any matters which outweigh this judgment based upon \u201caccumulating insight.\u201d Federal Communications Comm. v. R. C. A. Communications, Inc., 1953, 346 U.S. 86, 96, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470. Hence it may not be upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">Petitioner\u2019s attack upon the so-called \u201cone per cent rule\u201d fails because (1) petitioner has not shown that any injury has resulted or will certainly result therefrom; (2) petitioner can always apply to the Commission for relief from any hardship; and (3) under the \u201cone per cent rule,\u201d interests of less than that amount \u201cneed [not] be considered,\u201d but interests of more than that amount do not necessarily constitute \u201ccontrol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">Petition to vacate order is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\">. Storer Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 1955, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 220 F.2d 204.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">. When this petition for review was filed, the maximum number was five for television stations, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.636, but the rule has since been amended to permit a total of seven stations, two of which, however, must be UHF stations. 19 Fed.Reg. 6099. The maximum number of standard broadcast and FM stations is seven each. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.35 and 3.240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-17\">. Similar considerations of experience, coupled with a design to avoid undue disruption of existing station ownership, were the basis o.f the AM and FM rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
