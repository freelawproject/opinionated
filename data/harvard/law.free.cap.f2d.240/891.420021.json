The trial court directed a verdict for the defendant on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s opening statement. Apparently the court assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the defendant\u2019s negligence was sufficiently alleged, but concluded that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Under all the circumstances disclosed by the opening statement, we think that the issues of negligence and contributory negligence should have been put to proof. Calbreath v. Capital Transit Co., 99 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 240 F.2d 621 (1956), and cases therein cited; see also Tobin v. Pennsylvania R.
