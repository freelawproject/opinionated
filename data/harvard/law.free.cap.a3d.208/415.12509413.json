TerMorshuizen appeal from a summary judgment entered by the Superior Court (Cumberland County,\n   <em>\n    Horton, J.\n   </em>\n   ) in favor of Spurwink Services, Inc. (Spurwink) on the TerMorshuizens' claim for overtime pay pursuant to 26 M.R.S. \u00a7 664 (2018). In this appeal we consider whether interruptions to \"sleep time\" are compensable under section 664. The TerMorshuizens contend that the court erred in considering analogous federal law and in concluding that Spurwink's sleep time policy was reasonable as a matter of law. We affirm the court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The following facts are drawn from the parties' statements of material facts and their stipulated exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. St. Joseph's Rehab. &amp; Residence,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789228\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1283/\">\n    2016 ME 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789228\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1283/\">\n    143 A.3d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] Spurwink is a licensed, nonprofit mental health agency that provides treatment, education, and rehabilitation services to individuals with emotional, behavioral, mental, or intellectual disabilities. The TerMorshuizens were employed by Spurwink and worked as a therapeutic couple at a residential facility in Spurwink's Chelsea program-a day and residential treatment program for children and adolescents with significant emotional and behavioral needs. They worked in this capacity from September 6, 2011, to December 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] As a therapeutic couple, the TerMorshuizens were responsible for \"maintaining a home-like, caring, clean and safe environment, contributing to the continuity of programming within the residential setting, and recognizing and implementing the recommendations put forth by the client's ... treatment plans,\" and administering prescribed medications. (Quotation marks omitted.) Throughout their tenure, the TerMorshuizens cared for a total of eight children-seven females and one male, ranging in age from nine to eighteen-and typically cared for three children at a time. The children had all suffered some type of abuse-physical, sexual, emotional, or some combination thereof-and required near constant supervision during waking hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] Like other therapeutic couples, the TerMorshuizens lived in the residence with the children. They worked a rotating two-week schedule whereby they were in the home for ten consecutive days and eleven consecutive nights and then had four days off. At the start of their employment, the TerMorshuizens were paid for all hours of the ten-day shift except for up to eight hours of sleep time each night and a daily break of three to four hours for eight days of the shift. On July 6, 2012, they signed a new Employee Status Report (ESR) that altered this ten-day shift schedule slightly to provide for seven hours of nightly sleep time and eight daily four-hour breaks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] Also included in the ESR was a reference to Spurwink's written policy providing for compensation for sleep time interruptions that call a therapeutic couple to duty to attend to a client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the interruption\n   prevents the employee from getting five hours of sleep-not necessarily five consecutive hours-the employee is entitled to be paid for all scheduled sleep time hours. This policy was reflected in the TerMorshuizens' ESR. The TerMorshuizens recorded their work hours on timesheets and were responsible for including on the timesheets any sleep time interruptions that required them to directly care for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] On May 4, 2017, the TerMorshuizens brought suit against Spurwink for unpaid wages. They alleged that they are entitled to overtime wages, pursuant to 26 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 664, 670, for all time worked in excess of forty hours per week. They argued that, while Spurwink paid them for all time recorded on their timesheets, including recorded sleep time interruptions, they are entitled to payment for other client interruptions that prevented them from sleeping, which Spurwink had not allowed them to include on their timesheets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] On March 23, 2018, Spurwink moved for summary judgment on the grounds that its sleep time compensation policy was in compliance with federal law, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.23\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), and was reasonable as a matter of law. On June 26, 2018, the court (Cumberland County,\n   <em>\n    Horton, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted Spurwink's motion on each ground. The TerMorshuizens timely appealed the court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

Maine Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610] The TerMorshuizens first argue that the court erred in applying federal law to determine whether certain interruptions to sleep time constitute compensable work under 26 M.R.S. \u00a7 664(3), Maine's overtime provision. They contend that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Crook v. Russell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064860\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/1351/#p1354\">\n    532 A.2d 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1354-55 (Me. 1987) sufficiently defined \"work\" for these purposes and that the Superior Court committed an error of law in distinguishing this precedent and turning instead to analogous federal law. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b611] Section 664(3) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   An employer may not require an employee to work more than 40 hours in any one week unless 1 1/2 times the regular hourly rate is paid for all hours actually worked in excess of 40 hours in that week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   26 M.R.S. \u00a7 664(3). The term \"work\" is not defined anywhere in section 664 or in title 26 more generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 M.R.S. \u00a7 663 (2018). The legislative history of this section is similarly unilluminating. In the absence of a clear statutory definition, we turn first to this state's case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b612] The TerMorshuizens urge that, in\n   <em>\n    Crook\n   </em>\n   , we already defined what constitutes work for purposes of overtime compensation. While we did consider the term in that case, our narrow focus in\n   <em>\n    Crook\n   </em>\n   was whether time spent waiting or \"on call\" by an emergency medical technician (EMT) was compensable under section 664.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064860\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/1351/#p1354\">\n    532 A.2d at 1353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that whether on call time is compensable for purposes of overtime pay turns on whether that time \"is primarily for the benefit of the employer or for the benefit of the employee.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064860\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/1351/#p1354\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064860\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/1351/#p1354\">\n    at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b613] The TerMorshuizens, unlike the EMT in\n   <em>\n    Crook\n   </em>\n   , however, were not on call or free to spend their waiting time however they wished; they were essentially house parents in a residential facility and were required to remain on site overnight to attend to the needs of the children as those needs arose. Given its factual underpinning and the specificity of its holding,\n   <em>\n    Crook\n   </em>\n   provides no guidance here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b614] Moreover, in the case at bar, the parties agreed to a compensation scheme including specific provisions carving out sleep time, generally, as nonwork time with narrow exceptions for time spent actually responding to a client. Given this contractual agreement, and the lack of any guidance from Maine statutory or case law, the Superior Court did not err in turning to federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Me.

The TerMorshuizens argue, in contrast, that a sleep time policy is reasonable only if it provides compensation for any-meaning all-interruptions to sleep caused by a client, regardless of whether the interruptions actually require direct client interaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b622] WHD guidance suggests that a reasonable sleep time policy must compensate employees when sleep time \"is interrupted for duty calls.\" U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter, at 3 (July 27, 2004);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   WHD Field Operations Handbook \u00a7 31b12(e)(1); Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2016-1: Exclusions of Sleep Time from Hours Worked by Domestic Service Employees, at 11 (April 25, 2016).

The language of the policy specifically provides compensation for any call to duty during unpaid sleep time, including \"responding to a client during sleep time\" and instances \"when clients require direct care.\" The TerMorshuizens fully understood the limits of Spurwink's sleep time policy at or around the time they were hired and do not argue otherwise here. The TerMorshuizens signed documentation, as a precondition of their employment, acknowledging the sleep time policy and Spurwink supervisors made it clear to the TerMorshuizens that they would not\n   be compensated for the overnight hours unless they physically got out of bed to provide direct care to the residents. At no point during their employment was the overnight compensation scheme ambiguous or confusing to the TerMorshuizens. Contrary to the TerMorshuizens' arguments, Spurwink's policy of compensating employees for sleep time interruptions only when they are called to duty-e.g., when they have to get out of bed to assist a client-complies with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.23\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and is reasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b624] Therefore, because the language of Spurwink's sleep time policy is clear, the TerMorshuizens acknowledged that they had an unambiguous understanding of its provisions as applied to overnight interruptions, and the policy is in compliance with section 785.23, the Superior Court did not err in determining that Spurwink satisfied its burden to demonstrate that its policy is reasonable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rainey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286618\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/998/342/\">\n    2010 ME 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286618\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/998/342/\">\n    998 A.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court properly relied on section 785.23 to define compensable work in the absence of Maine law clarifying the same, and determined without error that the TerMorshuizens were entitled to overtime compensation only for interruptions during sleep time that actually required them to assist a client, for which, the TerMorshuizens concede, they have already been paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Spurwink's sleep time policy appears in two places: a document entitled \"THERAPEUTIC COUPLE INTERVIEW TOPICS-CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS\" and the TerMorshuizens' ESR.
