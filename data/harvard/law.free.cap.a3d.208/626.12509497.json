The present appeals require us to determine the scope of this duty under unusual circumstances. For approximately one week preceding March 9, 2012, a temporarily homeless\n   man named Willis Goodale lived out of his Jeep at the Montville Service Plaza (service plaza) located on Interstate 395 (I-395) in Montville. On the evening of March 9, after consuming a large amount of alcohol while parked at the service plaza, Goodale drove his Jeep onto I-395, where he caused a multivehicle crash. Benjamin Demond was killed. Demond's young sons, Alexander Demond (Alexander) and Nicholas Demond (Nicholas), were severely injured, as was Andrew Crouch, the driver of another vehicle on the roadway at the time. The present lawsuit was brought on behalf of these victims against the parties responsible for operating and maintaining the service plaza. The theory of negligence underlying the plaintiffs' lawsuit derives from a contract (concession agreement) between the named defendant, Project Service, LLC (Project Service), and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT), which owned the service plaza. The concession agreement imposed the responsibility on Project Service to operate and maintain the service plaza in all respects. Project Service subcontracted the day-to-day operation of the service plaza, or certain portions of it, to the defendant Alliance Energy, LLC (Alliance), which, in turn, subcontracted the operation of the convenience mart, parking area and plaza to the defendant 4MM, LLC (4MM), while retaining control over the fuel service area. As part of the concession agreement, Project Service and its subcontractors agreed not to allow the consumption of alcohol or loitering at the service plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants created a public nuisance by permitting Goodale to loiter and to consume alcohol on the service plaza premises, and also breached a duty owed to passing motorists, arising under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second), to protect them from the increased risk of harm created by the\n   defendants' failure to perform their contractual obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court rendered\n   summary judgment on the plaintiffs' public nuisance claims but submitted their negligence claims to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in the plaintiffs' favor based on its express findings that the defendants were liable in negligence under the principles set forth in \u00a7 324A. The trial court rendered judgment against the defendants in the amount of $ 5,347,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendants contend that their contractual undertaking to prohibit loitering and alcohol consumption at the service plaza did not create a duty to third-party motorists injured off the service plaza premises by a drunk driver who became intoxicated at the service plaza; the plaintiffs, in their cross appeal, contend that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment on their public nuisance claims. We conclude that the defendants' contractual undertaking did not create a duty to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs' public nuisance claims fail as a matter of law. We therefore reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. For approximately one week leading up to March 9, 2012, Goodale, who was temporarily homeless, lived in his Jeep in the parking lot of the service plaza on I-395. The service plaza was owned by the DOT. It was operated and maintained at all relevant times by Project Service pursuant to the concession agreement between Project Service and the DOT. Project Service subcontracted the day-to-day operation of the service plaza, or certain portions of it, to Alliance, which operated the fuel service area but subcontracted the operation of the convenience mart, parking area and plaza to 4MM. The concession agreement provided that Project Service and its subcontractors would\n   not allow the consumption of alcohol or loitering at the service plaza (no alcohol/no loitering provisions).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Goodale was an alcoholic. During the time he lived in his Jeep at the service plaza, he frequented the service plaza's convenience store to buy food and nonalcoholic beverages, to use the bathroom, and to charge his cell phone. During that time, Goodale told a store employee that he would be staying at the service plaza until he could be admitted to the Stonington Institute, a treatment facility for alcohol and substance abuse. Goodale drank one-half gallon of vodka every two days while living at the service plaza, and some of the employees working at the service plaza were aware of his consumption of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 9, 2012, Goodale spent a portion of the day drinking vodka in his Jeep while parked at the service plaza. At some point during the evening, he drove the Jeep from the parking lot onto the on-ramp to I-395 southbound. Goodale felt dizzy and immediately pulled to the shoulder, where he slept for approximately one to one and one-half hours. Upon awakening, Goodale decided to return to the service plaza by driving south a short distance on I-395 to an emergency turnaround in the median of the highway, intending to use the turnaround to access the northbound lanes\n   of I-395 and then drive to the next emergency turnaround to return to the service plaza. When Goodale attempted to cut across the southbound lanes of I-395 to the turnaround, he struck a Nissan sedan being driven by Demond. Demond's sons, Alexander, aged six, and Nicholas, aged four, were in car seats in the backseat of the sedan. The collision caused Demond to lose control of the Nissan, and he veered through the turn-around into the oncoming northbound traffic. Demond's Nissan hit a Ford Explorer driven by Crouch head on, tumbled end over end, hit another vehicle and then came to rest. The results were catastrophic. Demond was killed in the crash, and Alexander, Nicholas and Crouch were severely injured. Testing of a blood sample taken from Goodale one hour after the crash showed that his blood alcohol level was .25 milligrams per deciliter, well over the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs brought this action against Project Service, Alliance and 4MM, among\n   others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second amended complaint alleged that the March 9, 2012 crash was the result of the defendants' negligent conduct, including, among other things, their failure to notify state or local police that Goodale was living at the service plaza and consuming alcohol there, or to take other steps to prevent him from engaging in those activities, as required by the no alcohol/no loitering provisions of the concession agreement and the various subcontracts. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants had maintained a public nuisance by allowing Goodale to live and to consume alcohol at the service plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants all filed motions for summary judgment. Those motions used variations on the same theme\n   to attack the negligence claims, with the common point being that the defendants owed no duty to the plaintiffs under the circumstances. Project Service relied on a number of cases holding that a party in its position has a legal duty to take steps to prevent another person from harming a third party only if the third party is an \"identifiable victim,\" and contended that motorists traveling on I-395 were not identifiable victims under the circumstances. Alliance, for its part, contended that it had no duty to the plaintiffs because it was responsible only for the fuel service area, and Goodale had not consumed alcohol or loitered in that location. Alliance also contended that a person in control of premises has no duty to protect motorists from persons who consume alcohol on the premises but cause harm off the premises. 4MM contended that it had no duty to the plaintiffs because Goodale's criminal conduct, driving under the influence of alcohol, was a superseding cause of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to the public nuisance claims, Project Service contended that those claims failed because they were derivative of the negligence claims. Alliance contended that the claims failed because it had no duty to the plaintiffs and because its \"use of the land did not have a natural tendency to create a danger from motor vehicle accidents on the interstate highway,\" and 4MM contended that a garden variety premises liability claim did not give rise to a public nuisance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs opposed summary judgment primarily on the ground that the no alcohol/no loitering provisions of the concession agreement were \"intended to protect the public, not only at the plaza, but those passing motorists on the highway in proximity to the plaza.\" Their central argument was that the defendants were liable under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second), because, among other reasons, the no alcohol/no loitering provisions gave rise to an \"undertaking\" by the\n   defendants to use due care to prevent harm of this nature from befalling the plaintiffs and other travelers. With respect to the public nuisance claims, the plaintiffs contended that the defendants had interfered with the right of the public to travel on the highway by permitting Goodale to live and to consume alcohol at the service plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At oral argument on the motions for summary judgment, the trial court expressed its views that the issues arising from the negligence claims were \"novel,\" that none of the cases cited by the parties was directly on point, and that \"we're stretching every aspect of tort liability to see whether there is responsibility here.\" The trial court's written memorandum of decision reflects the court's serious engagement with the legal issues presented,\n   as well as the difficulty posed by some of those issues. The trial court initially set forth the general rule that \"[w]hether a duty exists is a question of law for the court ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) To answer that question, the court discussed this court's only decision addressing the applicability of \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second) under Connecticut law,\n   <em>\n    Gazo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stamford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120020\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/245/\">\n    255 Conn. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=765%20A.2d%20505\">\n    765 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), which held that a contractor who undertakes the snow removal duties of a landowner is liable to a plaintiff who slips as a result of the contractor's negligent performance.

The court denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment as to the negligence claims on the ground that \"[t]he finder of fact may conclude that [ \u00a7 324A ] (a) and/or (b) [of the Restatement (Second) ]\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   impose a legal duty on any or all of the defendants for failure to adequately train, supervise, [and/or] implement the [relevant portions of\n   the concession agreement] or otherwise comply with contractual obligations with respect to ... Goodale's loitering and intoxication at the [s]ervice [p]laza.\" (Footnote added.) The trial court granted, however, the defendants' motions for summary judgment with respect to the public nuisance claims, on the ground that \"there is no claim that\n   <em>\n    unreasonable or unlawful\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    use of the defendant\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    ' land\n   </em>\n   interfered with public rights.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs thereafter filed a third amended complaint, which is the operative pleading for purposes of these appeals, in which they reasserted the negligence claims against the defendants. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs' case-in-chief at trial, Alliance filed a motion for a directed verdict in which it renewed its claim that it had no duty to protect the plaintiffs from Goodale's tortious conduct because a person in control of premises has no duty to protect motorists from persons who consume alcohol on the premises and then drive off the premises. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Two particular circumstances regarding the submission of the case to the jury are relevant on appeal. First, although the trial court previously had determined, in its summary judgment ruling, that the existence of a duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs presented a factual issue for the jury, the court instructed the jury at trial that the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs for purposes of determining liability under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second)\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the core jury findings with respect\n   to liability under \u00a7 324A were made in response to written interrogatories. These interrogatories required the jury to determine whether each of the defendants had negligently performed their contractual undertaking pursuant to the concession agreement and safety plan and the various subcontracts, and, if so, whether that defendant's\n   negligence had increased the risk of harm to the plaintiffs beyond that which existed without the contractual undertaking (the determinative consideration under \u00a7 324A [a] ), or induced reliance by the DOT or the plaintiffs (the determinative consideration under \u00a7 324A [c] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury found that the defendants each were negligent, that their negligence increased the risk of harm to the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs or another had relied on each defendant to exercise reasonable care. Accordingly, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants filed timely motions to set aside the verdict and to direct judgment in their favor as a matter of law. In a supporting memorandum, adopted in full by Project Service, Alliance argued that it had no duty to the plaintiffs as a matter of law under \u00a7 324A (a) of the Restatement (Second) because the contractual undertaking to prevent the consumption of\n   alcohol and loitering at the service area did not increase the risk of harm to motorists on I-395 beyond what the risk would have been if there had been no such contractual undertaking. Alliance further contended that it had no duty to the plaintiffs under \u00a7 324A (c) because \"they were not within the scope of persons for whom Alliance had a contractual responsibility, i.e., 'patrons and [e]mployees of the [p]remises,' \" and, therefore, the plaintiffs could not have relied on Alliance to protect them from harm. Finally, Alliance contended that no reasonable juror could have concluded that its negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court denied the defendants' postverdict motions. With respect to the duty issue, the trial court stated that it had already found, in its ruling on the defendants' motions for summary judgment, that \"a legal duty of care existed between the defendants and the plaintiffs as the context of their relationship created the duty.... The contracts created, and the defendants willingly assumed, the duty owed to [the] plaintiffs.\" The court also determined that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendants' representatives had agreed that the no alcohol/no\n   loitering provisions were intended to protect motorists on the adjacent highway because \"[e]ach [of the relevant witnesses] acknowledged that if people consumed alcohol while [at] highway service plazas, they would increase the risk of harm to passing motorists. Each acknowledged that motorists leaving the highway service plaza must travel on or along an interstate highway. Allowing intoxicated motorists to live [i]n highway service plazas, and operate motor vehicles from service plazas onto adjacent interstate highways, intensifies and concentrates the risk of collisions caused by drunk drivers in the area of service plazas.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   These appeals followed. The defendants contend in their appeals that the trial court improperly denied their motions to set aside the verdict and to direct judgment in their favor on the negligence claims because they owed no duty to the plaintiffs and have no liability to them under \u00a7 324A (a) or (c) of the Restatement (Second). The plaintiffs contend in their cross appeal that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor on the public nuisance claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the defendants and disagree with the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first address whether the defendants owed the plaintiffs a duty of care. The defendants argue that the trial court improperly denied their motions to set aside the verdict and to direct judgment in their favor on the negligence claims as a result of the court's improper determination that the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second). Their argument can be summarized succinctly: \"Project Service [and the other defendants] did not contractually undertake a duty to prevent drunk driving on public highways.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the plaintiffs renew\n   their argument, which succeeded in the trial court, that Project Service \"undert[ook] ... for consideration, to render services to another which [it] should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person or his things, when [it] contractually obligated [itself] to operate the ... service plaza in a safe and secure manner for the benefit of its patrons and the traveling public.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The plaintiffs further contend that the jury reasonably could have found that (1) liability attaches under \u00a7 324A (a) because Project Service's failure to exercise due care in the performance of its contractual duties increased the\n   risk of harm to passing motorists, and/or (2) liability attaches under \u00a7 324A (c), because (i) the plaintiffs relied on Project Service to prevent people from drinking at the service plaza and then using I-395 and would have avoided the highway if they had known that Project Service was not exercising due care, and/or (ii) the DOT relied on Project Service to prevent people from drinking at the service plaza and then using I-395, and would have taken precautions itself if not for Project Service's promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our standard of review is well settled. \"Directed verdicts are not favored.... A trial court should direct a verdict only when a jury could not reasonably and legally have reached any other conclusion.... In reviewing the trial court's decision [to deny the defendant's motion for a directed verdict] we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.... Although it is the jury's right to draw logical deductions and make reasonable inferences from the facts proven ... it may not resort to mere conjecture and speculation.... A directed verdict is justified if ... the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside a verdict rendered for the other party.... The foregoing standard of review also governs the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for judgment\n   notwithstanding the verdict because that motion is not a new motion, but [is] the renewal of [the previous] motion for a directed verdict.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adel Wiggins Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491193\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/432/#p102\">\n    327 Conn. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491193\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/432/#p102\">\n    171 A.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Connecticut law, \"[t]he existence of a duty is a question of law and only if such a duty is found to exist does the trier of fact then determine whether the defendant [breached] that duty in the particular situation at hand....

The parties have framed the ultimate question as whether, under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second), Project Service's contractual undertaking to operate the service plaza triggered a duty on its part to protect motorists on the highway from the risk of harm created by persons who consume alcohol on the premises of the service plaza.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In answering this question, we must keep in mind two\n   established principles of Connecticut negligence law.

In other words, the question\n   in this case is whether Project Service, by undertaking a contractual obligation to prevent alcohol consumption and loitering on the premises, assumed a duty of care to off premises highway travelers that the DOT did not have in the first instance. The plaintiffs contend that Project Service's contractual undertaking gave rise to a duty to protect passing motorists from the risk of harm caused by persons who consume alcohol at the service plaza because the no alcohol/no loitering provisions were \"necessary for the protection of\" passing motorists. 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 324A, p. 142 (\"[o]ne who undertakes ... to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person ... is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care\"). They argue that regardless of any limitation on the usual common-law duties of a property owner, Project Service assumed a duty to protect passing motorists because it knew or should have known that its contractual undertaking to prevent alcohol consumption at the service plaza would function to protect such motorists from the foreseeable risk of harm created by persons who consumed alcohol at the plaza and then drove onto the highway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In support of this claim, the plaintiffs cite numerous cases involving a party's contractual undertaking to keep premises safe in which the courts held that the undertaking party had a duty to a third person injured as the result of the negligent performance of the undertaking.

But this pass-through liability, which is imposed by \u00a7 324A (b) of the Restatement (Second), is the one theory of liability under \u00a7 324A that was unavailable to the plaintiffs in the present case, because the DOT itself had no preexisting duty to protect highway travelers from the risk of harm posed by intoxicated drivers off the premises of the service plaza.

The plaintiffs argue that a duty of care arose under the facts of this case because the defendants' contractual\n   undertaking to prevent consumption of alcohol and loitering at the service plaza constituted \"services to another which he should recognize as necessary for protection of a third person\" under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second) and, therefore, created a duty of reasonable care owed to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs contend that\n   <em>\n    foreseeability\n   </em>\n   is the touchstone of duty under \u00a7 324A -once the defendants agreed to the undertaking, they assumed a duty of care to all persons who sustained physical harm as a foreseeable result of the defendants' negligent performance of that undertaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendants propose a very different duty analysis under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second). They argue that their contractual obligation was limited to safe-guarding patrons and employees of the service plaza at the service plaza, period. The defendants contend that, even if harm to passing motorists on the highway was foreseeable, nothing in the concession agreement reflects an\n   <em>\n    intention\n   </em>\n   to safeguard those travelers; no duty to those travelers arose because the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of the contractual undertaking was not to make the highway safe or to protect travelers on the highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After careful consideration, we cannot subscribe entirely to the duty analysis proposed by either side, although, due in part to the idiosyncratic features of the present case, we end up adopting an approach closer to\n   the one proposed by the defendants. Our reservation concerning the defendants' argument is the undue weight it gives to the contractual origin of the duty owed to third parties under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second). The third-party duty imposed under \u00a7 324A is implied in law. It is triggered in the first instance by a voluntary contractual (or gratuitous) undertaking, but the duty owed by the undertaking party under \u00a7 324A, once in existence, is not limited solely by reference to the underlying contract or defined solely by the intentions of the contracting parties. The duty of reasonable care imposed under \u00a7 324A exists regardless of whether there is a contract (the undertaking may be gratuitous) or whether the plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary of the contract. The terms of a contract may be relevant to the existence and scope of an undertaking, but they do not determine whether a duty exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts construing \u00a7 324A consistently have observed that \"liability ... does not arise from, nor is it circumscribed by, the contract [but] arises, if at all, from [the defendant's] undertaking\" to render services to protect another.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bohlken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10678923\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/312/501/#p507\">\n    312 N.W.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507 (Iowa 1981) ;\n   see also\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Protection One Alarm Monitoring, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445331\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/456/243/#p251\">\n    456 F.

Mass. 2006) (\"the scope of [the] defendant's duty to exercise due care cannot be limited merely to the precise boundaries of its contract, but instead are defined by the scope of the undertaking it is performing\"); 2 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 43, reporters' note to comment (h), p. 121 (although \"[t]he existence of a contract may be relevant to the question of whether an undertaking exists ... an undertaking does not require a valid contract, or indeed any contract, as gratuitous undertakings are sufficient\" [citation omitted] ). Although the contract may help to define the scope of the undertaking, \"the congruence between the two need not be perfect,\" and the \"ability of an injured party to recover [does not] rise or fall based on the exact language of the contract (or indeed [on] whether the parties had formed an enforceable contract at all) ....\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Protection One Alarm Monitoring, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This concern, though substantial, does not lead us to conclude that the duty arising under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second) extends to the outer limits of foreseeability, as the plaintiffs would have it. The plaintiffs' pure foreseeability model has superficial appeal because it is simple, it employs a familiar concept of foreseeability used in most negligence cases and, not insignificantly, it is tolerably compatible with the language of \u00a7 324A -\"should recognize as necessary for protection of a third person ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Closer examination,\n   however, gives rise to fundamental concerns that prevent us from adopting foreseeability as the sole determinant of duty under \u00a7 324A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As we have observed, the precise terms of a contractual undertaking will not strictly delimit the extent of the legal duty to protect third parties under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second), but it would be anomalous if the nature and scope of the contractual undertaking were wholly irrelevant to the nature and scope of the duties arising from it. The foreseeability reference in \u00a7 324A is not free-floating but instead is anchored to the reasonable expectations of the undertaking party\n   <em>\n    arising from the services to be performed\n   </em>\n   . See 2\n   Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 324A, p. 142 (referring to \"services ... which [the undertaking party] should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person\"). It makes good sense that the scope of the duties will not be entirely independent of the scope of the undertaking when the undertaking is the original source of the duty. To summarize, under \u00a7 324A, the undertaking party not only will assume duties to third parties expressly set forth in the contract itself, as well as pass-through duties owed by the hiring party that are assigned or transferred to the undertaking party, but also will assume a duty of care to protect third parties from foreseeable, physical harm\n   <em>\n    within the scope of the services to be performed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our conclusion in this regard is fully consistent with the historical origins of \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second) itself. Section 324A derives from the \"modern\" common-law rule, first adopted a century ago, that a defendant who undertakes to perform contractual services to another cannot raise a\n   <em>\n    nonprivity\n   </em>\n   defense against a third person who is injured by the defendant's negligent performance.

App. 2003) (\u00a7 324A embodies \"one of the [well recognized] exceptions to the privity rule\"). The animating principle behind \u00a7 324A recognizes that many modern and contemporary social activities, including commercial activities flowing from contractual undertakings, may have foreseeable effects on strangers to the transaction, and\n   the law sensibly imposes a duty of due care on the undertaking party to protect such persons who are put at increased risk by the negligent performance of the undertaking. The elimination of a privity defense, however, does not eliminate all\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   defenses that an undertaking party may have regarding the nature and scope of the duty imposed; nor does the elimination of privity expand the scope of the duty to third parties without limitation. Section 324A precludes a defendant from arguing that it owes no duty to third parties to the transaction merely because they are third parties. The defendant still can argue, however, that a particular third-party plaintiff belongs to a class that is outside the scope of protection afforded by \u00a7 324A due to the limited scope and nature of the particular undertaking at issue.\n   Under the circumstances of the present case, our task is simplified because the dispute regarding the scope of the duty arises in a very specific context involving third-party harm caused by a drunken motorist. Existing and well established Connecticut common-law rules provide significant guidance under these circumstances. As discussed previously, these rules, which the plaintiffs do not request us to revisit or rescind, exhibit a strong policy against imposing negligence liability for off premises harm caused by drunk drivers. Indeed, the defendants would not be exposed to negligence liability even if they had been operating a bar or liquor store rather than a service plaza, and had poured Goodale the alcohol that caused him to become intoxicated that day. The question presented in these appeals is whether by undertaking a contractual obligation to prevent alcohol consumption and loitering on the premises of the service plaza, the foregoing background common-law assumptions were altered such that the defendants will be deemed to have undertaken an obligation to prevent\n   the risk of harm posed to passing motorists by intoxicated drivers under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In our view, the same policy considerations underlying the preexisting Connecticut common law require, in the context of the present case, either an\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   contractual undertaking or evidence of an\n   <em>\n    unambiguous\n   </em>\n   intention on the part of the contracting parties before the law will impose a duty to protect third persons from off premises harm caused by an intoxicated driver. Unless there is sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the contracting parties actually intended to depart from the preexisting liability rules, or some other basis for imposing a duty-e.g., a special caretaking or supervisory relationship between the defendant and either the primary tortfeasor or the victim-a landowner or possessor who undertakes to prevent the consumption of alcohol as part of its on premises responsibilities does not thereby incur a duty to protect third parties from off premises physical harm caused by a driver who became intoxicated before leaving the premises. The undertaking party's duty to protect third persons from off premises harm under these circumstances, in the absence of an express understanding between the contracting parties or an affirmative duty arising from some other source, is coextensive with the preexisting duty of the property owner under the common law.

There may or may not come a time in the future when those common-law rules change in response to policy developments\n   relating to the serious social problem of drunken driving. This case presents no occasion to consider the issue. In the absence of an express contractual provision or evidence of an unambiguous intention on the part of the contracting parties, we can perceive no reason why the policy considerations underlying our existing common-law rules of premises liability should automatically or presumptively be abrogated when a party's contract with a property owner includes an obligation to prevent alcohol consumption on the premises, without more. We therefore conclude that the duty proposed by the plaintiffs will not arise unless the parties to such a contract agree to expand the undertaking party's obligations beyond what is imposed by the existing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There is no evidence in the present case that the parties intended contractually to alter or extend the existing common-law rules holding that a party in the defendants' position has no duty to protect off premises travelers from the risks posed by intoxicated drivers who consumed alcohol while loitering at the service plaza. The contractual documents themselves do not mention or suggest the existence of any such duty. The documents establish only that Project Service undertook a contractual obligation to prohibit alcohol consumption and loitering at the service plaza, to notify the police of any consumption of alcohol or loitering, and to train all subcontractors and employees of subcontractors to comply with those contractual obligations. There is no reference to highway travelers or their protection in connection with the no alcohol/no loitering provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply put, no aspect of the contract\n   expresses an actual intention to protect highway motorists from the risk of harm created by alcohol consumption by individuals at the service plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nor does any extrinsic evidence presented by the plaintiffs demonstrate any such contractual intent. The\n   plaintiffs submitted the deposition testimony of Paul Landino, the chief executive officer of Project Service, to support their contention that \"[i]t was understood by Project Service ... that the reason for [the no alcohol provision of the concession agreement] was the obvious danger to patrons of the service plaza and motorist on the adjacent ... highway.\" Landino's testimony unquestionably supports the conclusion that the danger by its very nature is\n   <em>\n    foreseeable\n   </em>\n   , that is, that Project Service knew, or should have known, that a person who drove after consuming alcohol at the service plaza-or anywhere else-posed a foreseeable risk of harm to motorists on the roads. It is also reasonably clear that Project Service believed that preventing alcohol consumption at the service plaza could in one sense reduce the risk of such harm on the portion of the highway immediately adjacent to the service plaza.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   But evidence that harm to motorists was a\n   <em>\n    foreseeable\n   </em>\n   result of the negligent failure to prevent alcohol consumption at the service plaza is not sufficient to establish that the no alcohol/no loitering provisions were included in the contract with the intention of protecting\n   highway\n   travelers. Because Connecticut common law clearly establishes a rule of nonliability in this context, the plaintiffs were required to demonstrate that the parties to the undertaking had an actual intention to protect motorists when they included the no alcohol/no loitering provisions in the concession agreement. On this record, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the parties to the concession agreement had such a specific intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The plaintiffs also submitted evidence at the summary judgment stage showing that loitering and alcohol consumption were ongoing problems at service plazas in this state while Project Service was operating the service plaza. In one inspection report, the DOT advised the operator of a service plaza that it had removed a sleeping homeless person from the service plaza and that \"the hassle free experience at this plaza is your responsibility.\" In another inspection report, the DOT noted that the manager of the McDonald's restaurant at a service plaza wanted the operator of the service plaza \"to remove [a] homeless man as [his presence] reduces sales and makes potential customers uncomfortable.\" In yet another inspection report, the DOT advised the operator of a service plaza that a \"drunk man was harassing one of the [McDonald's restaurant] employees at the drive [through] window.\" Other inspection reports noted the presence of panhandlers and beggars at service plazas. These inspection reports do not provide the necessary evidence of contractual intention to create a jury issue. To the contrary, they tend to confirm the defendants' position that the purpose of the no alcohol/no loitering provisions was to ensure the safety and comfort of customers and employees of the service plaza. The reports cast no light on whether there was a specific intention to protect highway travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We conclude that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding that the contracting parties had the specific intent to protect passing motorists from the risk of harm created by the consumption of alcohol at the service plaza. Because we hold that proof of such an intention is required in the particular context of this case, we must reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the plaintiffs' negligence claims and remand the case with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendants on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We recognize that the plaintiffs and their families have suffered a horrible tragedy, through no fault of their own. The plaintiffs' harm was caused by a wrongdoer, Goodale, who is morally and legally culpable for the unspeakable loss caused by his conduct. Although we understand the plaintiffs' desire to hold accountable all entities who might have contributed to their loss, we conclude for the foregoing reasons that the imposition of liability on the defendants is inconsistent with the present state of Connecticut law. Accordingly, we must reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is unnecessary to reach the other grounds for reversal of the plaintiffs' negligence claims advanced by the defendants, but we do so briefly to demonstrate that the flaws contained in the plaintiffs' theory of liability run deep, and the judgment would not be saved even if we were to assume that Project Service undertook a duty to protect passing motorists from the risk of harm posed by intoxicated drivers. These additional grounds relate to the specific predicates to liability necessary under subsections (a) and (c) of \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 324A (a) of the Restatement (Second) imposes liability only if the defendants' negligent conduct\n   <em>\n    increases\n   </em>\n   the risk of harm to the third party, in this case the passing motorists on I-395. See 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 324A (a), p. 142 (person is liable for failure to perform undertaking with reasonable care if \"his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm\"). The plaintiffs claim that the defendants increased the risk of harm to them by negligently performing their undertaking of preventing the consumption of alcohol at the service plaza. They contend that if the defendants had done their job properly, the harm would have been prevented, and so their negligent performance increased the risk of harm. The flaw in this logic is concisely identified in\n   <em>\n    Jain\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11188678\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/617/293/\">\n    617 N.W.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Iowa 2000), in which the Iowa Supreme Court, analyzing a virtually identical increased risk element found in \u00a7 323 of the Restatement (Second), observed that \"the increase in the risk of harm required is not simply that which occurs when a person fails to do something that he or she reasonably should have. Obviously, the risk of harm to the beneficiary of a service is always greater when the service is performed without due care. Rather ... [liability exists] only when the defendant's actions increased the risk of harm to [the] plaintiff relative to the risk that would have existed had the defendant never provided the services initially. Put another way, the defendant's negligent performance must somehow put the plaintiff in a worse situation than if the defendant had never begun performance.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11188678\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/617/293/\">\n    Id., at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We find\n   <em>\n    Jain\n   </em>\n   persuasive as applied to the circumstances in this case and, therefore, reject the plaintiffs' suggestion that the negligent performance of an undertaking itself ordinarily will satisfy the increased risk requirement of \u00a7 324A (a) of the Restatement (Second). As the court in\n   <em>\n    Jain\n   </em>\n   recognized, under the plaintiffs' interpretation, the \"increased risk\" element contained\n   in \u00a7 324A (a) would become an illusory requirement because the failure to exercise reasonable care when performing an undertaking that is necessary for the protection of third persons will\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   increase the risk to such persons over the level of risk that would have existed\n   <em>\n    if the undertaking were performed non-negligently\n   </em>\n   . We agree with the court in\n   <em>\n    Jain\n   </em>\n   that, in the ordinary case under \u00a7 324A (a), a plaintiff must establish that the contracting party increased the risk of harm over the level of risk that would have existed if there had been no undertaking at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There is no evidence in the present case that the defendants' acts or omissions did anything to increase the risk of harm within the meaning of \u00a7 324A (a) of the Restatement (Second). We reject, in this connection, the plaintiffs' claim that the defendants placed the plaintiffs in a worse position than they would have been\n   in the absence of any undertaking because the defendants \"made the [service] plaza an attractive option to Goodale\" by permitting him to charge his cell phone in the convenience store, to use the restroom facilities and to purchase food. These allegations, even if true, do nothing to show that the conditions at the service plaza became\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   dangerous under the defendants' operation than before Project Service engaged in the undertaking, or that the defendants made the service plaza a\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   attractive option to Goodale than\n   it would have been if Project Service had never undertaken to prevent loitering and alcohol consumption in the first instance. Because there is no evidence that the plaintiffs were placed in a worse position than they would have been if there had been no undertaking in the first instance to prevent the consumption of alcohol at the service plaza, the increased risk requirement of \u00a7 324A (a) was not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We likewise would conclude that liability under \u00a7 324A (c) of the Restatement (Second) has not been established on this record because there is insufficient evidence that either the DOT or passing motorists relied on the defendants to protect travelers on I-395. See 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 324A (c), p. 142 (person is liable for failure to perform undertaking with reasonable care if \"the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking\"). The plaintiffs assert that Demond and Crouch \"likely would have avoided I-395 had they known [that] Project Service ... [was] allowing an intoxicated alcoholic to live out of his car at the service plaza\" but have cited no evidence that would support such a finding. Nothing in the record establishes that Demond or Crouch believed that alcohol consumption at the service plaza was not permitted or that they would have avoided I-395 if they had been aware that the defendants could not always be depended on to enforce such a prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A more substantial question under \u00a7 324A (c) of the Restatement (Second) is whether the DOT, by requiring Project Service and its subcontractors to prohibit loitering and alcohol consumption on the premises, relied on them to protect drivers on I-395 from the physical harm caused by drivers who might become intoxicated by consuming alcohol at the service plaza. It is not inconceivable to us that the DOT might wish to pursue the laudable goal of enhancing highway safety by including a provision, expressly reflecting that intention, in\n   its service plaza concession agreements. If it did so, and if the undertaking party agreed, then, assuming that the DOT has authority to impose such a contractual term,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   the DOT's reliance on the undertaking party's performance presumably would trigger the undertaking party's liability to third parties under \u00a7 324A (c). But there is no evidence of any such intention here, as we previously have discussed in our duty analysis. The no alcohol/no loitering provisions say nothing about highway safety, there is nothing elsewhere in the contract to support a conclusion that the provisions were intended to enhance highway safety, and no witness testified that the DOT included the provisions to further that objective or relied on the defendants to help achieve it. Again, in the absence of such evidence, we will not presume reliance under the circumstances of this case in light of the well\n   established, preexisting common-law rules that inform our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In summary, we conclude that the defendants' undertaking to prevent alcohol consumption and loitering at the service plaza, standing alone, did not constitute an undertaking to protect passing motorists from the risk of harm created by persons who consumed alcohol at the service plaza and then drove, thereby giving rise to a duty to such motorists under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second). We also conclude that the plaintiffs have not established that the defendants increased the risk of harm to them within the meaning of \u00a7 324A (a), or that the plaintiffs or the DOT relied on the undertaking for the purposes of \u00a7 324A (c). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly denied the defendants' motions to set aside the verdict and to render judgment\n   in their favor on the plaintiffs' negligence claims, and we reverse the judgment as to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We next address the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' public nuisance claims. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants created a public nuisance by creating \"an environment that allowed and encouraged Goodale to loiter and [to] consume alcohol at the ... service plaza for over a week.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The standard of review is not disputed. \"In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party....

Subsection (b) is strictly a \"pass-through\" provision, which, as we discuss subsequently in this opinion, imposes liability on an undertaking party based on that party's assumption of a preexisting duty owed by the original duty holder. See 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 324A (b), p. 142 (1965). Subsection (b) evidently was charged out of this case because the plaintiffs made no claim that the original duty holder, the DOT, had a preexisting duty to protect them from the risk of harm created by persons who consumed alcohol at the service plaza and then drove onto the highway. Although the jury was instructed that it could not hold Project Service liable under subsection (b) of \u00a7 324A, no such instruction was provided as to Alliance or 4MM.

On the facts of this case, the duties and liabilities of the other defendants derived from Project Service's undertaking. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Accordingly, if Project Service had no duty or liability to the plaintiffs, then it necessarily follows that the other defendants had no duty or liability to the plaintiffs. In light of our conclusion that Project Service owed no duty and incurred no liability to the plaintiffs, we need not consider the secondary argument of Alliance and 4MM that they did not owe the plaintiffs a duty even if Project Service did.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Three observations should be noted at this point to avoid unnecessary analytical confusion. First, the discussion here is focused on the threshold question of whether a\n    <em>\n     duty\n    </em>\n    is owed to plaintiffs under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second), not the question of establishing\n    <em>\n     liability\n    </em>\n    once that duty is found to exist. If a duty is owed, liability under \u00a7 324A for breach of the duty is determined by reference to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of \u00a7 324A. But the duty question comes first under \u00a7 324A, the same as it does in other areas of tort law, and this threshold inquiry must not be overlooked in cases under \u00a7 324A in which the scope of that duty is disputed. Second, as we discuss subsequently in this opinion, as in other areas of tort law, there are some circumstances in which policy considerations will be dispositive of the duty analysis, regardless of what conclusion would follow under \u00a7 324A alone. Third, it is important to keep in mind that an undertaking party can acquire an \"ordinary\" duty of care to others, directly and without regard to \u00a7 324A, by acts or omissions that\n    <em>\n     create\n    </em>\n    (rather than only increase) a risk of harm to others. See 2 Restatement (Third), Torts, Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a7 43, comment (d), p. 115 (2012) (distinguishing acts that\n    <em>\n     increase\n    </em>\n    risk of harm, which are controlled by revised version of \u00a7 324A, and acts that create risk of harm, which are governed by usual rules governing negligence).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    To be clear, the discussion here related to a duty to protect in the context of off premises harm.

Our reversal of the judgment in the plaintiffs' favor on the negligence claims and our remand to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendants as to those claims places the plaintiffs in the same position they would have occupied if the trial court had ruled against them on those claims. If the defendants had prevailed on all counts, the plaintiffs obviously would have been entitled to appeal the adverse rulings on all counts, whether the rulings had come at the same time or at different stages of the proceedings in the trial court.
