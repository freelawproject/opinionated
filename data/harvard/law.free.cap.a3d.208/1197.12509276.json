The principal issue in this appeal is whether it would be improper to impute to the debtor a transfer of the debtor's assets by the debtor's agent under the law of agency. The act directs courts to apply the law of principal and agent unless such law is \"displaced by\" the provisions of the act. General Statutes \u00a7 52-552k.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant Stephen McGee used a power of attorney granted to him by his elderly mother, the named defendant, Helen McGee (Helen), to transfer to himself funds from Helen's checking account, claiming that Helen had authorized him to reimburse himself for various services that he had provided or was continuing to provide to her. As a consequence of those transfers, Helen had insufficient assets to pay her debt to the plaintiff, Geriatrics, Inc., the owner and operator of a nursing home in which Helen resided for a period of time. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the trial court insofar as it rendered judgment in the defendant's favor on counts alleging fraudulent transfer under CUFTA and unjust enrichment. We conclude that the trial court, in rejecting the plaintiff's CUFTA claim, improperly failed to consider and apply agency principles when it decided that Helen's assets\n   had been transferred by a \"third party,\" the defendant, and not by the debtor, Helen. We further conclude that, in light of certain unrebutted evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim. Therefore, we reverse in part and affirm in part the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts. In late 2012, the defendant began to manage Helen's finances under a power of attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In February, 2013, Helen was admitted to Bel Air Manor, a skilled nursing home operated by the plaintiff, and she agreed to pay for residency and related care. The defendant was not a party to this agreement. Although Medicare and private insurance paid Helen's expenses for the first\n   nine months at Bel-Air Manor, she began accumulating debt once those benefits were exhausted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June, 2015, the plaintiff commenced the present action against Helen\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendant. In the counts brought against Helen, the plaintiff alleged that Helen had breached the residency agreement and had been unjustly enriched by her failure to pay in excess of $153,000 for services provided to her to date. In the counts against the defendant, the plaintiff alleged that Helen had transferred assets to the defendant, an \"insider\" under CUFTA; that those transfers left Helen with insufficient assets to pay her debts; that those transfers were made with the intent to hinder Helen's creditors; and that the defendant had provided nothing in exchange for the funds he received. The plaintiff alleged that this conduct constituted a fraudulent transfer in violation of CUFTA and resulted in the defendant's unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant admitted in his answer that Helen had transferred assets to him but denied the other substantive allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff introduced checks drawn on bank accounts in Helen's name, signed by the defendant with the designation \"POA\" (power of attorney). Some of the checks named various businesses as payees;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   forty-eight of the checks, issued over a three year period and totaling approximately $73,000, named the defendant or his wife as payee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant did not testify at trial. He was unavailable due to illness, and his deposition was admitted into evidence by stipulation. In that deposition, the defendant testified that, in late 2012, he began to manage Helen's finances under a power of attorney agreement that Helen had given. He testified that various checks likely had been or were issued as payment for his power of attorney services, for which he charged $600 a month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant testified that he and Helen had made a verbal agreement that he would receive monthly fees for such services, and that the power of attorney agreement reflected that he could charge fees. The defendant also testified that he had cared for Helen before she was admitted to Bel Air, and that he and Helen had a verbal agreement that he could take \"whatever's due [to him]\" for the personal care that he had provided. The defendant estimated the value of that care to be approximately $230 per day, based on the rate for comparable professional services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   No testimony was received from Helen. She died a few months before trial commenced in September, 2016, and was never deposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Helen's interests were represented by counsel throughout the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   No cross claim was made on Helen's behalf against the defendant asserting either that he lacked authority to make the transfers to himself on her behalf or that he otherwise engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with these transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the parties filed posttrial briefs, the court issued an order directing the plaintiff to file a supplemental brief clarifying the specific provisions of CUFTA on which it was relying and the factual and legal basis for each such claim. The court permitted the defendant to file a responsive supplemental brief. The plaintiff's supplemental brief asserted that the evidence at trial satisfied four statutory grounds- General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e (a) (1) and (2), and 52-552f (a) and (b). The court did not ask the parties to address, and neither party's brief did address, the significance, if any, of the fact that the transfers had been executed by the defendant pursuant to a valid power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the breach of contract count against Helen on the basis of a stipulation in which Helen's counsel conceded liability on that count. The court rendered judgment for the defendant on all counts brought against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the trial court made the following findings of fact, which were based solely on the defendant's deposition testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Helen's\n   health first began to deteriorate, the defendant moved into her home to provide twenty-four hour a day care. He mainly\n   offered physical aid, such as cooking and ordering groceries, bathing her, dressing her, and dealing with her incontinence. The defendant's wife assisted with Helen's care. This arrangement lasted for approximately two years. At that point, the defendant was no longer able to care for Helen because of his own debilitating disease and hired private caretakers to provide home care for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Helen was admitted to Bel-Air Manor in early 2013, the defendant and his wife continued to provide care to Helen in the form of managing her personal and financial affairs. At this time, the defendant held power of attorney for Helen and the power of attorney provided the defendant with access to the bank accounts in which Helen's Social Security and pension benefits were electronically deposited. The defendant exercised the power of attorney to pay some of his mother's past and present expenses directly to her creditors. From March, 2013 to March, 2016, the defendant, \"acting under the power of attorney for Helen,\" also wrote checks to himself and to his wife totaling approximately $73,000. The defendant and his wife used those funds to compensate themselves for the care that they had provided to Helen before and after her admission to Bel Air, to pay the defendant $600 a month for services as power of attorney, and as reimbursement for money loaned to Helen or spent on her behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the basis of these facts, the court reached the following conclusions. With regard to the fraudulent transfer claim, although all of the parties' filings and argument to the court proceeded from the view that Helen transferred the assets, the trial court on its own initiative raised the issue of whether the defendant himself was the transferor was with regard to these transactions in light of his testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that it was not Helen, the debtor, who had actually executed the transfers, but instead it was the defendant, a \"third party transferor.\" The court raised the issue because of language in CUFTA that provides for recovery when there is a transfer \"made ... by a debtor\"; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e and 52-552f ; and which defines \"[d]ebtor\" as \"a person who is liable on a claim.\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (6). The court then reasoned \"that the act does not apply to the alleged transfers at issue in this case because [the defendant] is not a debtor of the plaintiff\n   as that term is defined in the act, and the plain and unambiguous language of the act does not apply to third-party transferors.\" The court did not appear to consider whether the defendant's status as Helen's attorney-in-fact distinguished him from third parties generally. The court cited cases reasoning that the act could apply to a transfer made by a third party if the debtor \"participated\" in the transfer but found\n   no evidence that Helen had \"participated in any fashion in the claimed fraudulent transfers ....\" Accordingly, the trial court held that the plaintiff had failed to make out a claim under CUFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With regard to the unjust enrichment claim, the trial court agreed that the plaintiff had a right to Helen's assets because of its contract with her, but it found that the defendant also had a right to those assets because of the services and loans he had provided to Helen before and after the debt to the plaintiff arose. On the basis of these facts, the court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove it had \"a better legal or equitable right\" to Helen's assets than did the defendant. The trial court therefore held that the plaintiff had not established that the defendant was unjustly enriched at the plaintiff's expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court with regard to the CUFTA and unjust enrichment counts rendered in the defendant's favor. We transferred the appeal from the Appellate Court to this court. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) ; Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin with the fraudulent transfer claim. The plaintiff advances several arguments as to why the trial court improperly determined that there was not a transfer by Helen, as debtor, and therefore no liability under CUFTA. We need only reach one of those arguments, namely, that the trial court improperly failed to consider the defendant's status as Helen's attorney-in-fact and to apply agency principles in its analysis of the plaintiff's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Whether CUFTA's requirement that the fraudulent transfer be \"made by the debtor\" encompasses a transfer made by a debtor's attorney-in-fact presents a question of statutory interpretation, to which we apply well established rules of construction and exercise plenary review. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z (plain meaning rule);\n   <em>\n    Canty\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20546\">\n    304 Conn. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557-58,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20A.3d%20280\">\n    41 A.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (general rules of construction aimed at ascertaining legislative intent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CUFTA provides relief to an unsecured creditor when there has been a \"transfer made ... by a debtor\" and that transfer is \"fraudulent ....\" General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e and 52-552f. Although the present case turns on the first requirement-the trial court never reached the second-statutory meaning is always contextual. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z (directing court to consider related statutes to ascertain meaning). Therefore, we consider the framework of the entire act before turning to the specific question raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To establish that a transfer is fraudulent, the creditor may, but need not, prove actual fraudulent intent. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-552e (a) (1) and (b) (transfer made with \"actual intent to hinder, delay\n   or defraud any creditor\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liability also can be established on\n   the basis of constructive fraud when a transfer of the debtor's assets occurs after the creditor's claim arose and other circumstances are present, including that the debtor has not received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer, that the transfer renders the debtor insolvent (i.e., greater debts than assets), and/ or that the transfer is made to an insider, such as the debtor's relative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 52-552e (a) (2) ; General Statutes \u00a7 52-552f (a) and (b) ; see generally\n   <em>\n    Badger State Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9015091\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/276/312/#p328\">\n    276 Wis. 2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9015091\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/276/312/#p328\">\n    688 N.W.2d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (\"[I]ntent is difficult to prove, and the drafters of the [Wisconsin] Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act included provisions addressing transactions that might be considered wrongful toward creditors even if a debtor's intent to hinder, delay, or defraud is not proven. The focus in constructive fraud shifts\n   from a subjective intent to an objective result. Proof of constructive fraud simply entails proof of the requirements of the statute.\" [Footnotes omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ). When a creditor proves that a fraudulent transfer has occurred, the court may order avoidance of the transfer to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim, or may order various remedies to secure the asset from being dissipated. See\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-552h. Defenses and various other protections are available to a transferee who has taken the assets in good faith and under certain other circumstances. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-552i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Significantly for purposes of the present case, the act makes clear that its provisions are not the exclusive source of law governing fraudulent conveyances. General Statutes \u00a7 52-552k provides in relevant part: \"Unless displaced by the provisions of [this act], the principles of law and equity, including ... the law relating to principal and agent ... supplement the provisions of said sections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   That common-law principles and defenses supplement CUFTA is consistent with our recognition that CUFTA \"is largely an adoption and clarification of the standards of the common law of [fraudulent conveyances],\" except that the act's remedies are broader than those available under the common law.

Guidance as to what the phrase \"displaced by\" means is available in a comment to an identical provision in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) incorporating common-law principles and defenses. See General Statutes \u00a7 42a-1-103 (b) ; see also General Statutes \u00a7 50a-64 (incorporating same supplementary principles for\n   Uniform Foreign-Money Claims Act, General Statutes \u00a7 50a-50 et seq. ). That\n   comment explains that these common-law principles would be displaced if they were inconsistent with a provision of the UCC or the UCC's principles and policies. See comment (2) to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 1-103, Conn. Gen. Stat.

Without such protection for creditors, [c]reditors would generally be unwilling to assume the risk of the debtor's fraudulent transfers.\" [Footnotes omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ). The words of this court regarding our original fraudulent conveyance statute apply equally to CUFTA: \"As the statute was enacted for the suppression of fraud, the advancement of justice and the promotion of the public good, it should be liberally and beneficially construed to suppress the fraud, abridge the mischief and enlarge the remedy ....

Given that the failure to apply the law of agency would create an easy end run around the act, and frustrate the ability of creditors to secure payment for debts owed to them, application of agency principles is manifestly consistent, not inconsistent, with the policies underlying the act.

There is no provision in CUFTA that explicitly or even implicitly provides that acts of the debtor's agent shall not be imputed to the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nor do we infer any inconsistency from the fact that the act applies to \"[a] transfer made or obligation\n   incurred by a debtor\"; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e and 52-552f ; and defines a debtor, unsurprisingly, as \"a person who is liable on a claim.\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (6).

Agency law dictates when an agent's acts shall be imputed to the principal and the limited circumstances under which an agent can be liable for a principal's debt. See, e.g., 2 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7\u00a7 6.02 through 6.04, pp. 28-55 (addressing agent's liability when principal is unidentified or undisclosed or lacks capacity to be party to contract). Surely, we would not disregard agency principles and hold that the\n   <em>\n    debtor\n   </em>\n   was not liable on the claim simply because the obligation was executed by the debtor's authorized agent.

The trial court credited this \"unrefuted evidence.\" It found that the defendant used the money from Helen's accounts to compensate himself for the care he had provided before she was admitted to the plaintiff's facility and for the continued management of her personal and financial affairs, and to reimburse himself for money he had spent on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Critically, the trial court concluded: \"As between the plaintiff and [the defendant], the plaintiff has not proven that it has a better legal or equitable right to the funds of Helen ... that were paid to [the defendant] and/ or his wife.\" In other words, although the plaintiff proved that it had a \"recognized\" interest in Helen's\n   assets, it did not prove that its interest should be \"accorded priority over the interest of [the defendant], under the law of the jurisdiction.\" 2 Restatement (Third), Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, supra, \u00a7 48, comment (i), p. 159. The plaintiff could have met this burden by presenting evidence to discredit the defendant's testimony or by pointing to substantive law or equitable factors that would have given its interest priority over that of the defendant. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Nile\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285291\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/390/#p402\">\n    432 Mass. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.E.2d%201153\">\n    734 N.E.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (beneficiary of contractual agreement with third party accorded priority over recipients of testamentary gift from third party);\n   <em>\n    Peirce\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peirce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11484207\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/994/193/#p200\">\n    994 P.2d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (Utah 2000) (party with contractual right to third party's assets accorded priority over recipient of inter vivos gift from third party). It declined, or neglected, to do so. Indeed, implicit in the court's findings is the recognition that the defendant's interest accrued in large part before the plaintiff's interest began to accrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The plaintiff contends, however, that \"no evidence\" supports the trial court's factual finding that the defendant had an interest in Helen's assets. More particularly, it asserts that the defendant's deposition testimony\n   was \"self-serving,\" vague at points, and uncorroborated by a written contract, a promissory note, receipts, or witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiff's claim founders under well settled law. The plaintiff is bound by its stipulation that the deposition testimony could be submitted for the court's consideration. Once in evidence, the trial court was permitted to rely on it to the same extent as if the defendant was present and testifying. See Practice Book \u00a7 13-31. Undoubtedly there are facts in the record and evidentiary gaps that reasonably could lead another trier of fact to find the defendant's testimony in whole or part not credible. This court, however, \"cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses\n   .... Rather, [i]t is within the province of the trial court, when sitting as the fact finder, to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence .... [I]t is within the province of the trier of fact to accept or reject parts of the testimony of a single witness.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Gabriella A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20775\">\n    319 Conn. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20948\">\n    127 A.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The trial court therefore was free to credit the defendant's deposition testimony, as well as to take into account the absence of a cross claim by Helen alleging that the defendant improperly transferred assets to himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, it was the plaintiff's burden to prove that its rights were superior to those of the defendant. The trial court's factual finding that the defendant had an interest in Helen's assets was supported by the record and, therefore, was not clearly erroneous. As such, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiff failed to prove it had \"a better legal or equitable right\" to Helen's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The judgment is reversed with respect to the count of the plaintiff's complaint alleging a violation of CUFTA and the case is remanded for a new trial on that count; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, ROBINSON and ECKER, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   D'AURIA, J., with whom MULLINS and KAHN, Js., join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although I agree with part II of the majority's opinion, I disagree with part I. I would affirm the judgment of the trial court on both the Connecticut Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (CUFTA or act); General Statutes \u00a7 52-552a et seq. ; and unjust enrichment counts of the complaint, and therefore respectfully dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The issue we are asked to determine is whether CUFTA applies to a transfer of a debtor's assets made by the debtor's attorney-in-fact with no participation by the debtor. Under CUFTA, a transfer can only be fraudulent \"as to a creditor\"; General Statutes \u00a7 52-552e (a) ; if it is \"made by a debtor ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552f (b). Relying on this language and decisions from out of state interpreting identical statutes, the trial court concluded that CUFTA did not apply to a transfer made solely by a third party, such as the attorney-in-fact of a debtor, with no participation from the debtor. Because the trial court found that \"all of the transfers at issue were made by [the defendant Stephen McGee (Stephen) ]\" and that \"[n]one were made by [Stephen's mother, the named defendant, Helen McGee (Helen) ],\" and because the court found no evidence that Helen \"participated in any fashion in the claimed fraudulent transfers,\" it concluded that the plaintiff, Geriatrics, Inc., had failed to make out a claim under CUFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The majority reverses the trial court's judgment in favor of Stephen on this count. I disagree and instead would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With few exceptions, which I will note, I have no quarrel with the majority's factual recitation. The trial court's findings are sparse, at least in part, because the live testimony in the case was brief (it was a one-half day trial) and because the trial court's ruling on the CUFTA count (that Stephen was not a \"debtor\") is ultimately a legal issue. Another explanation for the sparse record could be the plaintiff's failure to develop its case, including by failing to present a clear legal theory for proceeding against Stephen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To many dispassionate readers, the facts of this case might resemble a familiar family experience. An elderly parent is in failing health. Rather than move the parent immediately to a nursing facility, a child chooses to care for the parent himself, eventually moving into her\n   home. This choice comes at significant cost to the child. As the parent's health worsens, the parent and child agree that to continue this arrangement and keep the parent at home as long as possible, the child must assume greater charge of the parent's\n   needs-health and financial. No one begrudges the caregiver some compensation for his efforts to keep the parent in the home or for reimbursement for food, bills and other necessities paid out of his own pocket. Record keeping, however, is spotty at best and the timing of payments varies. Of course, no one knows how long the parent will live or how long the child will be able to provide the care. Eventually, though, the parent's needs exceed what the child can provide, the parent is moved to a nursing home, and the parent's remaining assets are \"spent down\" to qualify for government assistance. If at any point there is a gap in the payments to the nursing home or a delay in routing the government benefits to the nursing home-even due to the nursing home's own actions-the parent will become a debtor of the nursing home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Stephen's case resembles this fact pattern. In February, 2013, after caring for Helen for several years, Stephen's own health deteriorated, and Helen was admitted to the plaintiff's skilled nursing home, Bel Air Manor, where she agreed to pay for residency. Medicare initially covered much of her expenses. It is fair to assume that Helen and Stephen (and perhaps the plaintiff) believed she would remain eligible for Medicare throughout her stay. But two efforts to qualify for continued benefits failed, and the plaintiff refused to assist Stephen in applying, despite his requests. Finally, a third application was granted, but only with a penalty. Throughout those delays, debt to the plaintiff accumulated, and at the time of her death, Helen owed the plaintiff about $208,000. Stephen was not a party to\n   Helen's contract with the nursing home and was not liable to the nursing home for Helen's debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Given the trial court's finding that Helen began accumulating debt once government benefits were stopped, it is perhaps fair to assume she had other creditors at the end of her life. This appeal involves only one creditor, her nursing home. The count on which I disagree with the majority involves that creditor's allegations of fraud. Because the case was tried to judgment, there is no need to construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Lyme Land Conservation Trust, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Platner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489665\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/666/#p755\">\n    325 Conn. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489665\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/666/#p755\">\n    159 A.3d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"[i]n reviewing factual findings [of a trial court] ... we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court's ruling\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). In fact, the trial court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove \"that it has a better legal or equitable right to the funds of Helen\" and therefore refused to find that Stephen had been unjustly enriched at the plaintiff's expense. Although the trial court agreed that the plaintiff had a rightful claim to Helen's assets because of its contract with Helen, it also found that Stephen had a rightful claim to those assets because of the services and loans he had provided to Helen before and after her debt to the plaintiff arose. The court made no findings that the payments Stephen received were somehow illegitimate. Rather, the trial court specifically found that on this record the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that its claim was superior to Stephen's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Therefore, Stephen's compensation and reimbursement, which the trial court found that he was entitled to, is only potentially subject to CUFTA because of its timing. Had he received these funds before his mother's debt began to accumulate or had her Medicare coverage never lapsed, there would be no claim. Indeed, the plaintiff did not appear to argue to the trial court that Helen was even aware of-much less colluded with Stephen in making-the transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CUFTA permits creditors to set aside or void certain transfers of a debtor's assets when those transfers are made with the purpose of frustrating the creditor's ability to collect its debt. General Statutes \u00a7 52-552a et seq. Not all transfers that frustrate creditors are fraudulent transfers under CUFTA, however. Instead, CUFTA sets out four distinct bases for fraudulent transfer liability, each with its own distinct elements. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e and 52-552f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   One basis for liability requires proof of actual fraudulent intent. General Statutes \u00a7 52-552e (a) (1) (transfer made with \"actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor\"). The other three require only constructive fraud, in which fraud is presumed under the circumstances. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-552e (a) (2) (transfer made without debtor \"receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange,\" leaving debtor with few assets or inability to pay debts); General Statutes \u00a7 52-552f (a) (transfer made while debtor was insolvent or causing debtor to become insolvent and debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value); General Statutes \u00a7 52-552f (b) (transfer to insider of debtor when insider had reason to believe debtor was insolvent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A transfer does not, however, fall within any of these four bases for liability unless it was \"made by a debtor ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552f (b) ; see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-552e (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The transfers at issue in the\n   case before us were actually carried out by Stephen, pursuant to a power of attorney executed by Helen, and the trial court found that Helen did not participate in any of them. On these facts, I agree with the trial court that the transfer at issue was not \"made by a debtor\" within the meaning of CUFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To determine the meaning of the statute at issue, we look first to its text, giving any undefined term its ordinary meaning. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (a) and 1-2z. Neither the plaintiff nor the majority contend that the term \"debtor\" in \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e and 52-552f is ambiguous. Therefore, extratextual evidence of the legislature's intent is not relevant. Neither under \u00a7 1-2z is it relevant whether the majority's conclusion \"best serve[s]\" the \"policy underlying the act ....\" Finally, although it might be expedient to call CUFTA a \"creditor-protection\" statute, in my view such shorthand is no more useful to the exercise of statutory construction than calling the Bankruptcy Code a \"debtor-protection\" statute. In truth, like many acts-including\n   uniform acts-CUFTA reflects a legislative balance of policies. Our challenge is not to advance policy, but to divine the legislative will from the statutory text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are admonished by the legislature to construe the provisions of this uniform act \"to effectuate their general purpose to make uniform the law ... among states enacting them.\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Although, admittedly, not many courts have confronted the issue before us, those that have addressed it in any detail have uniformly taken a position contrary to the majority.

Super. 2003). Although the majority's reasoning is plausible, its conclusion is not so obvious that any other court-or the plaintiff itself-has made the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The act defines a \"debtor\" as \"a\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   who is\n   <em>\n    liable\n   </em>\n   on a\n   <em>\n    claim.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (6). The term \"person\" extends to \"an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, organization, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust or any other legal or commercial entity.\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (9). \"Liable\" is not defined in the act, but means \"[r]esponsible or answerable in law; legally obligated\"; Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) p. 1055; or \"obligated according to law or equity\"; Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 1993) p. 715. And a \"claim\" is defined as \"a right to payment ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The phrase \"made by\"-modifying \"a debtor\"-is also relevant, signaling that the debtor caused the transfer and that the debtor was not passively acted on by the transfer (e.g., \"a transfer involving a debtor\"). It also specifies that we are to focus on who made the transfer. The subject is the actor, rather than the status\n   of the property (e.g., \"a transfer of the debtor's assets\") or the result (e.g., \"a transfer for the debtor's benefit\"). Thus, construed according to its plain meaning, the act in my view refers only to transfers actually made, in some capacity, by the party who owes the debt. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Nor does the definition of \"transfer\" change this. I agree with the majority that CUFTA's definition of \"transfer\" is unquestionably expansive. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (12). But that definition is informed by the qualifiers-\"made by a debtor\"-that follow. Even for \"indirect\" transfers, which the majority asserts occurred in this case, participation by the debtor is an essential predicate: \"An example of an indirect transfer is when A has a claim against B, and instead of B paying A directly for the claim,\n   <em>\n    A directs B to pay C\n   </em>\n   .... In such a scenario, the debtor never has possession of the funds, but\n   <em>\n    directs a third party to transfer\n   </em>\n   those funds to a recipient.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    In re FBN Food Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6108540\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/671/#p683\">\n    175 B.R. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 683 (Bankr.

As stated previously, a \"transfer\" may be \"indirect.\" See General Statutes \u00a7 52-552b (12).

As the trial court found: \"[A]ll of the transfers at issue were made by Stephen McGee, under a power of attorney from his mother. None were made by Helen McGee.\" Therefore, Stephen was not the \"debtor\" inasmuch as he was not \"liable on a claim\" to the plaintiff. Additionally, even if we were to construe CUFTA under some set of circumstances to reach transfers made by a third party at the behest of the debtor, as have some courts discussed previously, the trial court observed that \"the plaintiff does not allege, and the evidence does not show, that Helen McGee participated in any fashion in the claimed fraudulent transfers ....\" Stephen was not acting as Helen's alter ego, nor did Helen \"direct or orchestrate\" or \"cause\" Stephen's transfers in such a way that the court could attribute the transfers to her. Because the transfers at issue in this case were not \"made by a debtor,\" in my view, the plaintiff failed to make out a claim that Stephen was liable under CUFTA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As construed by the majority, Stephen's transfers are attributed to Helen regardless of whether she participated\n   in (or even knew about) them. Under General Statutes \u00a7 52-552k, the supplementary provisions of CUFTA on which the majority relies: \"the principles of law and equity, including ... the law relating to principal and agent,\" supplement CUFTA, \"[u]nless displaced\" by other provisions of the act. In this light, the majority relies on the rule that a principal is presumptively bound by the acts of an attorney-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    Kindred Nursing Centers East, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235149\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/125/165/#p167\">\n    125 Conn.

But strict application of agency principles is inconsistent with the limited reach of the language in CUFTA, which states that the transfer must be \"made by a debtor\"; General Statutes \u00a7 52-552f (b) ; as well as with the general approach to third-party transfers this court and others use, and with the approach that every court to consider the issue has taken with respect to attorneys-in-fact. In my view, even under \u00a7 52-552k, when a court has found that the principal did not otherwise participate in the transfer, the phrase, \"made by a debtor,\" \"displace[s]\" agency law to the extent that a principal is automatically held liable for a transfer by its agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Just because CUFTA does not provide a remedy does not mean one is not available, though. For example, a nursing facility may require \"an individual, who has legal access to a resident's income or resources available to pay for care in the facility, to sign a contract ... to provide payment from the resident's income or resources for such care.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r (c) (5) (B) (ii) (2012) ; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Sunrise Healthcare Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Azarigian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1368427\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/76/800/#p810\">\n    76 Conn.

In fact, the plaintiff's \"Resident Admissions Agreement\" contemplates a \"responsible party\" who agrees to undertake certain duties on behalf of \"the resident\" and bears personal financial liability for failure\n   to do so. Stephen was not named a responsible party in the agreement. More generally, a plaintiff in a breach of contract case can also obtain a prejudgment remedy on a showing of probable cause, thereby preserving the defendant's assets before any transfer to a third party. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a and 52-278d. Or a breaching principal might have a cause of action against its attorney-in-fact for improperly transferring assets.

An exhibit submitted by the plaintiff listed only those transfers made to the defendant or his wife.

Although there is no universal rule, several bankruptcy cases hold that actual fraudulent intent by the debtor's agent may be imputed to the debtor if the agent is the transferee of the assets and retains substantial control over the debtor. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     In re Tribune Co.

Sommer, Collier on Bankruptcy (16th Ed. 2009) \u00a7 727.02 [4], p. 727-23 (\"A transfer of the debtor's property by an agent or employee with general authority upon the subject will bar the debtor's discharge if the transfer was made within the statutory period with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If the fraud is not perpetrated by the debtor or the debtor's authorized agent, it cannot be the basis of an objection to the debtor's discharge.\"). We note that the facts in the present case might meet this standard in any event, given Helen's dementia. See footnote 7 of this opinion. As we previously indicated, the trial court in the present case never addressed the question of whether the transfer was fraudulent because it concluded that there was no transfer subject to the act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    What the trial court meant when it found that Helen did not \"participate\" in the transfers is unclear. The trial court did not address in any manner the legal implications arising from the power of attorney agreement, and, therefore, we must assume that its references to participation meant some other facts, presumably specific direction from Helen for the defendant to make particular transfers or to take payment for a specific service rather than Helen's grant of general authority to issue checks and to take compensation/ reimbursement. Insofar as the trial court relied on cases applying this participation exception to third-party transfers, without regard to agency, we do not find these cases relevant to the present case. We observe, however, that the adoption of this exception in response to policy concerns is in tension with any purported \"plain meaning\" of the provisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    We similarly do not view cases from this court addressing third-party transfers under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the predecessor to the current act, helpful.

Nothing the plaintiff ever submitted to the trial court cited General Statutes \u00a7 52-552k, on which the majority principally relies. The plaintiff's complaint based the CUFTA claim on General Statutes \u00a7 52-552h, which is merely a remedial provision. The plaintiff's pretrial and posttrial briefs reference General Statutes \u00a7 52-552 only generally-a statute that was repealed in 1991-without citation to a specific provision of CUFTA. After pretrial briefing, a trial and posttrial briefing, the trial court issued an order indicating that it was still \"unclear\" about \"which specific provision\" of CUFTA \"the plaintiff claims the defendant Stephen McGee violated.\" It therefore ordered the plaintiff to file a supplemental brief clarifying its position. The plaintiff complied, and for the first time, cited General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-552e and 52-552f, which are CUFTA's provisions on liability. In its motion to reargue to the trial court, the plaintiff again failed to mention any provisions of CUFTA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Nor in its briefing to this court did the plaintiff mention \u00a7 52-552k. It did, however, mention the concept of agency, asking this court to accept its argument under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. I take its invocation of the plain error doctrine, which provides an avenue for reviewing\n    <em>\n     unpreserved\n    </em>\n    claims, as a concession that this claim was not preserved.

This can perhaps be explained by the fact that the UCC governs all commercial transactions while CUFTA creates a cause of action for fraud.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    As the majority admits, the authorities it relies on reach their results \"without any analysis ....\" The majority \"surmise[s]\" that \"the parties in these cases were operating under the same logical assumption reflected in the parties' pleadings in the present case, that the act of the agent would be imputed to the principal as a matter of law.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    In my view, this assumption is a logical stretch, both in the present case and in the cases \"without any analysis ....\" In the present case, the plaintiff's complaint never mentions the terms agent, principal or impute. In fact, as discussed previously, the plaintiff never mentioned principles of agency until its brief before this court, in which it invoked the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ; and it has never mentioned the supplementary provisions of CUFTA, General Statutes \u00a7 52-552k. See footnote 1 of this concurring and dissenting opinion. Given that the cases that provide any analysis whatsoever (\n    <em>\n     Folmar &amp; Associates, LLP\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Methodist Manor Health Center, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Presbyterian Medical Center\n    </em>\n    , as well as Connecticut trial court cases) go against the plaintiff's and the majority's position, and would have easily been found if searched for, the better explanation in the out-of-state cases with no analysis is that the parties simply did not consider the issue. Although the majority is perhaps free to arrive at the conclusion it does today, it does so against the weight of considered authority and on a theory the plaintiff did not pursue before the trial court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    At the time Helen granted Stephen a power of attorney, Connecticut's statutory short form power of attorney provided that when the principal \"confer[s] general authority,\" it \"shall be construed to mean that the principal authorizes the agent to act as an alter ego of the principal with respect to any matters and affairs not enumerated\" in the power of attorney agreement. General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 1-55. The power of attorney agreement used by the parties in this case is not in the record, however. Therefore, it is unclear whether Stephen executed the transfers pursuant to a general authority, and, if so, whether Helen authorized him to act as her alter ego in such cases.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The majority argues that courts in bankruptcy cases simply presume that the conduct of a debtor's agent is attributable to a debtor and instead focus only on whether the intent of the agent is attributable to the debtor. But some courts do, in fact, analyze whether conduct was attributable to the debtor, before addressing intent. E.g.,\n    <em>\n     In re Maletta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6511964\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/159/108/#p116\">\n     159 B.R. 108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 116 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1993) (\"The transfers of the $83,600 bonus funds in February and March of 1990 were within one year of the commencement of this case .... [\n    <em>\n     T\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     hose transfers were made by the defendant or authorized by him\n    </em>\n    ....\" [Citation omitted; emphasis added.] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The plaintiff argues that Stephen admitted in his answer that Helen transferred the assets and that this admission bound the trial court. But this portion of Stephen's answer can neither be construed as an acknowledgement that Helen actually transferred the funds herself nor that Stephen's transfer of the funds was attributable, as a matter of law, to Helen. The first interpretation is contrary to the record, and the trial court therefore was entitled to find to the contrary. \"[A] court may be justified in deviating from any such admission if [it is] unsupported by the underlying facts in evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Dreier\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Upjohn Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"692363\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/196/242/#p248\">\n     196 Conn. 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 248,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=492%20A.2d%20164\">\n     492 A.2d 164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1985). No evidence suggests that Helen actually made these transfers herself, and the plaintiff did not argue as much. The second interpretation suggests a legal conclusion, and thus, did not bind the trial court in its factual findings. See\n    <em>\n     Borrelli\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Zoning Board of Appeals\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050417\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/106/266/#p271\">\n     106 Conn.

Whether a transfer made by a third party is attributable to a debtor is, at least in part, a question of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
