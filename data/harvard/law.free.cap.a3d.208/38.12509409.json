Because we conclude the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his plea, we reverse\n   the order denying his motion and remand for that hearing. We also vacate defendant's sentence on account of the court's failure to address the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   factors after determining to impose an extended-term sentence and remand for resentencing, if necessary, following the hearing on defendant's motion to withdraw his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2013, defendant and two confederates, Chinikka Lockhart and Mohamed Kamara, agreed to arm themselves with a gun and go to the home of Mario Lombardo, Jr. to steal his marijuana. After Lombardo answered the door to Lockhart, defendant and Kamara stepped inside while Lockhart slipped back onto the porch. Defendant pointed the gun at Lombardo while Kamara rifled Lombardo's pockets. After Kamara wrested the marijuana from Lombardo, Lombardo fell backward as Kamara turned to flee. Before following Kamara out the door, defendant shot Lombardo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The bullet struck Lombardo in the head, shattering his skull. After several surgeries and a year in the hospital, Lombardo, twenty-two years old at the time of the shooting, remains grievously injured. He is paralyzed on one side and cannot speak. Defendant claimed he shot Lombardo after seeing him reach toward his waistband, presumably for a gun. The State claimed defendant shot Lombardo to prevent him from identifying his assailants. Both the robbery and the shooting were captured, at least partially, on security cameras mounted in Lombardo's porch and front hall. Defendant can be seen firing the shot that struck Lombardo, but Lombardo is not visible in the frame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was indicted on charges of second-degree conspiracy to commit armed robbery and robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1 (count one); first-degree armed robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1 (count two); first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1 (count three); first-degree attempted murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-1 and N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2) (count four); second-degree unlawful\n   possession of a weapon, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b)(1) (count five); second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a)(1) (count six); fourth-degree resisting arrest, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-2(a)(2) (count seven); third-degree hindering apprehension or prosecution of oneself, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-3(b)(4) (count eight); and third-degree hindering apprehension or prosecution of another, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-3(a)(7) (count nine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant, twenty-nine years old at the time of these offenses, was extended-term eligible. He had been convicted of third-degree theft committed in 2005, when he was twenty-one years old, and sentenced to probation in 2006. In 2009, he violated probation by committing a drug offense. He pleaded guilty to the violation of probation and to third-degree possession of CDS and was sentenced in March 2010 to five years in State prison with a two-and-a-half-year parole ineligibility term. Because both crimes were committed within ten years of the offenses for which defendant was being sentenced in 2016, he qualified for extended-term sentencing as a persistent offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:44-3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Near the time of defendant's arraignment, the State offered to recommend a sentence of fifty years in exchange for defendant pleading guilty to conspiracy, armed robbery, robbery, attempted murder and unlawful possession of a weapon. Defendant rejected that offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That is where negotiations stood for nearly three years. On May 11, 2016, however, the first assistant prosecutor wrote to defendant's counsel confirming their \"recent conference\" at which defendant \"presented the State with a counter offer of twenty (20) years in a New Jersey State Prison.\" The letter confirmed the State's rejection of that offer but stated the writer \"will present to the [victim's] family, a counter offer which will mandate the defendant serving approximately thirty (30) years in a New Jersey State Prison.\" What happened next is detailed in two \"affidavits\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   presented by defense counsel, the first assistant deputy public defender and her second chair, then an assistant deputy public defender, now a lawyer in private practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Those lawyers aver that they attended a pre-trial conference on June 13, 2016, where they discussed their plea negotiations with the prosecutor in the chambers\n   of the trial judge. They contend \"[t]he State's final offer was a thirty-year sentence subject to an eighty-five percent parole disqualifier under the No Early Release Act-a sentence that would have required Mr. Hooper to consent to be sentenced as a persistent offender, in other words, [to] a discretionary extended term.\" Counsel claim they responded by advising that defendant \"was interested in a plea but not 30 years.\" The first assistant deputy public defender further claims she told the prosecutor she \"would never advise [her] client to accept a plea that called for a discretionary extended term, particularly given his minimal prior record.\" Indeed, she had written to defendant days earlier advising she intended to argue defendant was not extended-term eligible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response to her unwillingness to recommend defendant agree to be sentenced to an extended term, counsel avers the prosecutor suggested defendant could enter a guilty plea to multiple counts of the indictment with consecutive sentences. The defense lawyers claim the judge interjected \"that he did not see it as a 'consecutive case,' \" characterizing it \"as a 'robbery gone bad,' \" and \"that this case would not result in consecutive sentences given the facts and\n   circumstances.\" Counsel claim that following that conference, they \"were confident that [the judge] would not run the counts consecutively, should Mr. Hooper choose to plead without a sentencing recommendation from the State.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, they met with their client three days later and \"advised him that if the [j]udge finds that he meets the statutory criteria as a persistent offender, he could receive as much as the State's thirty year offer, but that the [j]udge was almost assuredly going to sentence him to something between ten and thirty years in State prison.\" The first assistant deputy public defender averred she told defendant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   that an open plea would result in a sentence between 10 and 30 years, but would ultimately be left to [the judge]. We told him that since the current plea offer was 30 years, it was highly unlikely that the [j]udge would go above that number. We told Mr. Hooper that the [j]udge is never bound by plea offers, but since we had a conference, [the judge] was aware of the sentence that the State was recommending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on the advice of his counsel, defendant pleaded guilty the next day to all the counts in the indictment with no recommendation from the State. In the course of providing a factual basis for his plea, defendant agreed with his counsel that when the \"robbery was concluded, there was some sort of struggle at the end of it.\" Defendant further agreed that he \"perceived\" the victim to be \"reaching for something,\" which defendant thought \"may have been a weapon\" and thus shot him with the intent of killing him before the victim \"kill[ed] [him] first.\" Defendant indicated he understood \"the law of self-defense would not be available to [him] at trial\" because, not only was he in the victim's home, he was \"obviously, the initial aggressor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judge engaged defendant in a thorough plea colloquy, in which he advised defendant his maximum sentencing exposure was sixty-one-and-a-half years, but if the court granted the State's extended-term motion, it could sentence defendant to life in prison. The judge confirmed defendant had spoken with his counsel \"about that possibility\" and that counsel had answered all of his \"questions about that possibility.\" The judge also took pains to\n   ensure defendant understood what pleading \"open\" entailed, emphasizing \"[s]o there's no expectation of you getting a 10 or a 15 or a 10 or a 30. It's - right now, it's completely open.\" Defendant agreed with the judge that defense counsel answered all his \"what if\" questions and had given him \"their best prediction of what may or may not happen in this case, based on their many years of experience\" and that he was satisfied with their work on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prior to sentencing, the prosecutor filed a brief seeking a seventy-five-year prison term, including a fifty-five-year extended term for attempted murder and a consecutive twenty-year term for armed robbery, and supplied the court with the video of the robbery and shooting. The judge granted the State's motion for an extended term, rejecting defense counsel's argument that because defendant was resentenced on his 2006 theft conviction in 2010 following his violation of probation, on the same day he was sentenced on his conviction for possession of CDS, he effectively had only one prior conviction and was thus not extended-term eligible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The judge also rejected counsel's argument that defendant shot Lombardo because defendant thought Lombardo was going for a gun, or that the court was bound to accept \"[defendant's] version of the facts.\" Stating he \"reviewed the videotape a number of times,\" the judge ruled he was entitled to judge defendant's credibility \"like any other witness,\" and did \"not [accept] Mr. Hooper's belated proffer that this was - self-defense.\" He thus rejected defendant's contention that mitigating factor four, substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify defendant's conduct, though failing to establish a defense, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(4), was\n   present and found aggravating factors three, the risk defendant would commit another offense; six, the extent of defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which he has been convicted; and nine, the need to deter, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3), (6) and (9), and no mitigating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The judge merged for sentencing purposes defendant's convictions for conspiracy, robbery, armed robbery and possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose and imposed an extended twenty-five-year prison term \"on those counts,\" subject to the periods of parole ineligibility and supervision required by the No Early Release Act, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. Concluding defendant shot the victim \"purely gratuitous[ly]\" after the robbery was completed, the judge declined to merge defendant's convictions for attempted murder and armed robbery, and further found that\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   , most notably its injunction against \"free crimes,\" supported a consecutive sentence of a twenty-year NERA term on defendant's conviction for attempted\n   murder.\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   , 100 N.J. at 643,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20A.2d%201239\">\n    498 A.2d 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The judge imposed a second consecutive extended term of twelve years for unlawful possession of a weapon, with six years of parole ineligibility under the Graves Act, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a), a concurrent four-year extended term for resisting arrest and consecutive seven-year extended terms on defendant's convictions for hindering apprehension or prosecution of himself and another to be served concurrent to one another, for an aggregate sentence of sixty-four years in State prison, forty-four of which were to be served without eligibility for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The judge explained the factor driving the sentence was that the offenses were committed while defendant was on parole. Addressing the aggravating factors, the judge found \"it's not a question of if [defendant] will commit another crime, it's when he would commit another crime.\" Stating he had \"no expectation and no hope\" the sentence imposed would deter defendant, the judge expressed his expectation\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   that the sentence I will impose - and I know the word will get out to the community; the media is not here because the media has priorities that are not always correct, and they don't always report on stuff that goes on in the\n   courthouse. But I know that the number I impose today will go out. And by this evening, people in New Brunswick will know what number it is, and they're going to go, damn. Damn. Because that's the reaction I want from the sentence that I give: Damn, that's serious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   And maybe, just maybe, some other knucklehead out in New Brunswick, or anywhere else in this county, will think twice about doing what this defendant did. So the [c]ourt is putting extraordinary emphasis on deterring others from violating the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Five days after the initial sentencing, and before the judgment of conviction was entered, the judge corrected and restated the sentence by reducing the twelve-year extended term for unlawful possession of a weapon to an ordinary maximum term of ten years with five years of parole ineligibility, reducing the four-year extended term for resisting arrest to an ordinary term of eighteen months and reducing the two seven-year extended terms for hindering prosecution to ordinary maximum terms of five years each, thus bringing the sentence into line with N.J.S.A. 2C:44-5(a)(2), which \"expressly and unequivocally states that no more than one extended term sentence may be imposed in a single sentencing proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034979\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/217/594/#p605\">\n    217 N.J. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034979\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/217/594/#p605\">\n    92 A.3d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The judge also clarified the three counts for resisting and hindering would run concurrent to one another but consecutive to the merged counts, as well as to the successive consecutive terms issued on the counts for attempted murder and unlawful possession of a handgun and imposed appropriate fines and penalties not imposed when the judge pronounced the sentence. The amended sentence thereby reduced defendant's aggregate sentence to sixty years, leaving the parole ineligibility term of forty-four years unchanged. The judge filed an amended judgment of conviction the following week to specify the sole extended term was imposed on merged count two, defendant's conviction for armed robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597896\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/195/431/#p437\">\n    195 N.J. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597896\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/195/431/#p437\">\n    950 A.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (underscoring the need to explain imposing an extended term on a particular count).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant filed a prompt motion to withdraw his plea, supported by the \"affidavits\" of his counsel described above and his\n   own certification. Defendant described the \"several communications\" with his counsel that prompted his decision to\n   plead to the indictment, including the June 3, 2016 letter in which counsel \"predicted that based on their interpretation of the law [his] sentence for all charges would be between 10 and 20 years NERA.\" He also described his meeting with his lawyers on June 16, 2016, in which they urged him to plead to the indictment without a recommendation from the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant claimed he did not recall counsel advising him at that meeting \"that the State would recommend that a custodial term not exceed 30 years with 85% parole ineligibility,\" but did remember \"them telling [him] that under no circumstances would the [c]ourt sentence [him] to greater than 30 years.\" He averred counsel \"further advised that based on conversations with the [c]ourt in chambers[,] the [c]ourt was likely to sentence [him] to a sentence significantly less than 30 years if [he] pled to the Indictment.\" Defendant claimed he relied on his counsel's \"legal knowledge to believe that [he] was not extended term eligible nor facing consecutive sentencing for the separate charges on the Indictment\" when he waived his right to trial and entered an open plea to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Public Defender's Office appointed outside counsel who briefed and argued the motion on defendant's behalf. Designated counsel contended the representation defendant received from the Public Defender in connection with his plea was \"grossly deficient.\" He argued plea counsel erroneously believed, and argued to the court, that the court was confined to defendant's version of the facts in imposing sentence and could not consider other information, such as the video, which contradicted his story.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Counsel also contended plea counsel \"improperly relied, apparently, on conversations that took place in chambers which led them to believe that [defendant] was not going to get a consecutive sentence\" and erroneously concluded \"that somehow [defendant] was not eligible even to be considered as extended term eligible, when ... he clearly was.\" Counsel argued plea counsel should have, at the very least, made a motion to have the court decide whether defendant was extended-term eligible before counseling him to enter an \"open\" plea and not waited to test their legal theory until defendant's sentencing date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Designated counsel further asserted plea counsel never explained to defendant that he could accept the State's thirty-year offer and argue for less time. Instead, he claimed \"[t]he direct opposite was conveyed to [defendant], which was if you accept the 30 years, that's what you're going to get, you can't do better.\" Plea counsel thus erroneously advised defendant\n   he had no realistic exposure to a sentence longer than the thirty years the State was offering, but \"[t]he only way you can do better is to plead open\" to the entire indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Designated counsel pointed out that had defendant entered a negotiated plea in exchange for a recommended thirty-year sentence the court subsequently determined it could not impose, defendant would have been permitted to withdraw his plea. He argued the same result should apply here where defendant, based on bad advice, rejected a thirty-year sentence the court obviously\n   thought inadequate, resulting in defendant pleading \"open\" and the court sentencing him to a term twice as long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Contending defendant did not \"validly give up his right to a trial\" but only pleaded guilty based on patently erroneous legal advice, designated counsel argued defendant should be permitted an immediate evidentiary hearing on his application to withdraw his plea based on his counsel's ineffective assistance. Counsel advised the court he was ready to proceed as plea counsel were present in court and prepared to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The court declined to entertain defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance or \"treat[ ] this as a [motion] for post-conviction relief,\" declaring such claims \"premature.\" The judge rejected any suggestion that counsel's impression of a conversation in chambers somehow converted the open plea to a conditional one, stating \"there was no representation by the [c]ourt in any way, shape, or form, in any setting, in chambers or in court, as to what the sentence would be.... Conversation is not a representation.\" The judge also rejected counsel's suggestion that the court should have permitted defendant to withdraw his plea upon concluding the thirty-year sentence the State was willing to recommend was inadequate, notwithstanding that defendant had rejected the State's offer, stating no case imposed such a responsibility on a sentencing court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Slater\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   factors, the judge concluded defendant had not asserted a colorable claim of innocence, the existence of the open plea \"militate[d] against him\" and prejudice to the State was \"not an overwhelming issue, so it [did] not drive.\" The judge stated the focus was on\n   <em>\n    Slater\n   </em>\n   's second factor, defendant's reasons for withdrawing his plea. The judge characterized those\n   reasons as defendant's lawyers' \"predictions as to what the law may be, not affirmative misstatements of the law,\" which predictions \"did not bear fruit\" and were not sufficient to justify relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We removed defendant's appeal from the limited sentencing calendar under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:9-11 to a plenary calendar at defendant's request.

This opinion should not change that. It holds only that when the record in the trial court contains the facts necessary to evaluate a defendant's claim that his counsel's ineffective assistance resulted in his guilty plea, the court must consider the claim on the plea-withdrawal motion and not defer it to a PCR proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We turn now to consider counsel's reliance on comments the trial judge allegedly made in chambers about the sentence. Although we agree with the judge that no published case imposed an obligation on him to permit defendant to withdraw his plea\n   after the court determined it could not sentence him to the thirty-year recommended term defendant rejected in favor of an open plea, we are nevertheless concerned about the fairness of what occurred here.\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:21-1 permits a court to allow a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea after sentencing in order to correct a \"manifest injustice.\" The Supreme Court has made clear \"[t]hat discretionary determination necessitates a weighing of 'the policy considerations which favor the finality of judicial procedures against those which dictate that no man be deprived of his liberty except upon conviction after a fair trial or after the entry of a plea of guilty under circumstances showing that it was made truthfully, voluntarily and understandably.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the Rule is not invoked and the court is not \"invited in,\" as it was not here, a defense attorney cannot responsibly counsel a client in reliance on a judge's comments about a potential sentence. Because defendant was not entitled to rely on the judge's comments about a potential sentence, he could not hope to enforce a conditional sentence based on the judge's remarks. The Rule should not, however, relieve a judge of the obligation to speak carefully about any potential sentence whether in chambers or on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Thus, although defendant cannot compel the court to take any action based on its remarks about the sentence outside the confines of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:9-3(c), the judge should, nevertheless, consider whether counsel's reliance on those remarks, whether reasonable or not, caused them to seriously misadvise their client.

We should accept nothing less in ourselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We conclude our discussion on this point with a final observation. The alleged remarks by the judge that the case did not appear one to justify consecutive sentences, on which defendant's lawyers claim they relied to counsel defendant to reject a recommended thirty-year sentence and instead enter an open plea to the indictment, were made before the court viewed the video of the robbery and shooting in preparation for entering sentence. Viewing the video after the plea, which the judge said he watched \"a number of times,\" apparently caused him to change his mind about whether this was indeed a \"robbery gone bad.\" If that was the case, and the judge's view about an appropriate sentence was greatly altered by evidence beyond the facts described in defendant's allocution, defendant would be entitled to challenge the reliability of that evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He may thus do so on remand in the event he is not permitted to withdraw his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   That brings us to defendant's sentence. Although we agree defendant was extended-term eligible, we also note he was\n   twenty-nine years old at the time of these offenses and only minimally qualified based on his two prior third-degree convictions for theft from a person and drug possession. The court initially imposed four extended terms in sentencing defendant, an obvious violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:44-5(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
