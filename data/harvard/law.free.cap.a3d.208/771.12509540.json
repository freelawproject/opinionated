Gould's probation, which had been imposed as part of his 2014 sentence for aggravated operating after habitual offender revocation (Class C), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2558(2)(C) (2018). At a hearing, Gould admitted that he had violated his probation, and the trial court (Penobscot County,\n   <em>\n    A. Murray, J.\n   </em>\n   ) ordered that he serve twenty-eight months' incarceration, with probation to terminate. Gould did not take a direct appeal from the court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1207(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] In November 2017, Gould filed a petition for post-conviction review in the trial court asserting that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at the probation revocation hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2129(1) (2018). The court (\n   <em>\n    Anderson, J.\n   </em>\n   ) summarily dismissed the petition because the post-conviction review process is available to review \"post-sentencing proceedings,\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2122 (2018), but a revocation of probation is, by statute, not a \"post-sentencing proceeding,\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2121(2) (2018). Gould filed an application to appeal the dismissal of his petition, and we granted a certificate of probable cause. M.R. App. P. 19(a)(2)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] Gould contends that (1) he had a right to the effective assistance of counsel at the revocation hearing, and (2) \"the post-conviction statute must authorize a process\" through which \"deprivation of that right can be litigated.\" We agree with Gould's first contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petgrave v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20ME%2072\">\n    2019 ME 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12509408\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/208/371/\">\n    208 A.3d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Concerning the second, although we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing Gould's petition seeking post-conviction review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, we recently announced in\n   <em>\n    Petgrave\n   </em>\n   a procedure by which a defendant who contends that he or she received ineffective assistance of counsel at a probation revocation hearing may pursue that claim by filing a properly supported motion for a new trial pursuant to M.R.U. Crim. P. 33.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-16. Accordingly, Gould may file a motion for a new revocation hearing in the trial court complying with that procedure within thirty-five days following the entry of our mandate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Judgment summarily dismissing petition for post-conviction review affirmed. Gould may file a motion for a new probation revocation hearing in the trial court within thirty-five days of the issuance of our mandate.\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
