On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that his trial counsel had not provided ineffective assistance by failing (1) to litigate adequately the issue of\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   whether the two underlying criminal cases against the petitioner should have been joined for trial, (2) to object to opinion testimony from a witness on an ultimate issue of fact with respect to the criminal charges in one of the underlying cases, (3) to present expert testimony that could have offered an alternative innocent explanation for the sexual assault allegations against the petitioner, and (4) to attend the petitioner's presentence investigation interview with a probation officer. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The petitioner was charged in two cases alleging sexual assault that were joined for trial. After a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted, in both cases, of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A), and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2).

J's mother resided with the [petitioner] and three of J's maternal siblings, all minors, in a nearby city. Sometime in February, 2009, J went to her mother's residence for an overnight visit. J's mother, the [petitioner], and the three other children were present in the residence during J's stay. On the night of her visit, J went\n   to sleep in her sisters' room, where she shared a bed with two of her siblings. J later awoke to find the [petitioner] sitting on\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   the floor touching her 'front private area.' When the [petitioner] realized that J was awake, he apologized to her. J's mother then called for the [petitioner], prompting him to leave the room. Later that night, the [petitioner] returned to the bedroom. He woke J and instructed her to go to another bedroom in the residence. J proceeded to go into the other bedroom, alone, and went back to sleep. The [petitioner] then entered the other bedroom. He shut the door, positioned himself on top of J and 'went up and down.' The [petitioner] then cut a hole in J's underwear and initiated sexual contact with J's intimate areas. Following her encounter with the [petitioner], J went into the bathroom and felt a 'wet' sensation in and around her intimate parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The next day, J returned to her uncle's home crying and ostensibly nervous. Sometime later, J told her uncle's girlfriend that she was having 'a problem.' J explained how the [petitioner] had 'told her to go to sleep and to lay ... face down,' and how he had cut her pants. J also told her uncle that the [petitioner] had tried to 'abuse her' the night she stayed at her mother's home. J's uncle subsequently contacted the social worker at J's school. The social worker met with J, and J explained what occurred on the night she stayed at her mother's residence. After meeting with J, the social worker reported the incident to the Department of Children and Families (department). The department, in turn, contacted the police. Thereafter, J and her uncle went to the police station where J explained to the police how the [petitioner] had made inappropriate contact with her on the night she stayed at her mother's residence. The police subsequently initiated an investigation into the incident and sought out J's mother and the [petitioner] for questioning. When the police arrived at the mother's residence, the [petitioner] ran out the back door. J's mother, however, agreed to accompany\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   the police to the station for questioning. During questioning, J's mother indicated that during J's most recent visit, J had told her that she woke up with holes in her underwear. J's mother also indicated that one of her other daughters had reported waking up with holes in her underwear on several occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The jury reasonably could have found the following facts with respect to the charges in the second case, involving the victim, G. G was ten years of age in February, 2009, and one of J's siblings. G lived with her mother and the [petitioner] on a permanent basis. After speaking to her mother in connection with J, the police questioned G. G told the police that on certain nights, the [petitioner] would come into her room and tell her to change her sleeping position. In the mornings that followed the [petitioner's] nighttime visits, G woke up to find holes in her underwear and pants, always in the vicinity of her intimate areas. These holes were never present when she went to sleep, but appeared after she woke up the next morning. She was uncertain of what caused the holes to appear, but believed that her cat caused the holes in her clothing because her cat previously had ripped holes in her sister's clothing. She explained that the holes in her clothing appeared only during the time the [petitioner] lived in the residence. She usually would give the underwear to her mother so she could mend them or throw them away. G revealed to police that she was wearing a pair of the mended underwear during questioning and that the dresser at her mother's residence contained many pairs of the underwear that still had holes in them or had been mended by her mother. With the mother's\n   permission, the police took possession of the underwear G wore at the time of questioning. The police subsequently obtained and executed a search warrant on the mother's residence. During the search, the police seized twelve additional pairs of underwear and two pairs of pants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   that either had holes in them or appeared to have been mended. In addition, the police seized two pairs of scissors. The thirteen pairs of underwear and two pants seized by the police subsequently were submitted for forensic analysis. The forensic analysis of the clothing revealed that the two pants and six out of the thirteen pairs of underwear had holes consistent with being cut by a sharp blade, not ripped. The holes in each item were located between the rear end and genital area. DNA analysis revealed that the [petitioner's] semen was present on the inside and outside of three pairs of G's underwear and one pair of her pants. The [petitioner] could not be eliminated as the source of semen present on another pair of underwear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The [petitioner] was arrested on March 5, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to J's case, the state, in a substitute information, charged the [petitioner] with one count of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-70 (a) (2), one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A), and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2). With respect to G's case, the state, in a substitute information, charged the [petitioner] with one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A), and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Before trial commenced, the state moved for a consolidated trial on the charges in both cases.

The jury found the [petitioner] guilty of all charges in G's case. The court sentenced the [petitioner] to a total effective term of thirty years of imprisonment.\" (Footnotes in original.)

On October 12, 2016, the petitioner, represented by counsel, filed the operative amended petition. In the amended petition, the petitioner alleged that Attorney Tina Sypek D'Amato rendered ineffective assistance by failing (1) to adequately investigate, research, and educate herself about the issues unique to child sexual assault cases; (2) to object to the joinder of the two cases for trial; (3) to consult with an expert and present a suggestibility defense or an alternative innocent explanation as supported by expert testimony; (4) to object to testimony from Detective Cathleen Knapp that, in her opinion, G was a victim of sexual assault; (5) to attend the petitioner's presentence investigation interview; (6) to adequately cross-examine, impeach, or otherwise challenge the testimony of J, G, or their uncle; (7) to adequately pursue the production and disclosure of confidential and privileged materials related to J; and (8) to present evidence of a custody dispute between J's mother and J's uncle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By memorandum of decision issued on August 17, 2017, the habeas court denied the amended petition, concluding that the petitioner did not meet his burden of establishing either deficient performance or prejudice with respect to his first, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth claims of his operative amended complaint. The court additionally concluded, without determining that deficient performance had been rendered by Attorney D'Amato, that the petitioner did not meet his burden of establishing prejudice as to his second and fourth\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   claims.

Guided by these principles, we turn to the specific claims made by the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We first address the petitioner's claim that the habeas court erred in concluding that he was not prejudiced by his trial counsel's alleged failure to litigate adequately the issue of whether the two underlying criminal cases against the petitioner should have been joined for trial. The petitioner raises three arguments in regard to the court's analysis of prejudice, namely, that (1) the habeas court misapplied the factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501389\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/714/#p722\">\n    204 Conn. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201260\">\n    529 A.2d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), to this case, (2) he was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to litigate adequately the joinder issue regarding his compelling need to testify in the case involving G and his equally compelling need to refrain from testifying in the case involving J, and (3) the court failed to consider that, had the issue been litigated at the petitioner's criminal trial, he would have prevailed in his direct appeal. Because we conclude that the evidence in both cases was cross admissible, these arguments are not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The petitioner's trial counsel, Attorney D'Amato, \"did not file an objection to the state's motion for joinder between December, 2009, when the state filed it, and September, 2011, the time of the [petitioner's] trial. In addition ... the parties discussed the motion both in chambers and before the court. In chambers ... [Attorney D'Amato] had suggested that there would not be a lot of argument regarding the motion. Then, when\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   the court heard the parties on the motion, [Attorney D'Amato] expressly stated that there was no objection to the motion. After the court granted the motion, [Attorney D'Amato] did not indicate any disagreement with the court's decision.

Attorney D'Amato testified that no other evidence could provide an explanation for the presence of the petitioner's semen on G's underwear, and that, if G's and J's cases against the petitioner were not joined, it would have been important to allow the petitioner to provide his explanation during G's case. Attorney D'Amato also testified that, in regard to J's case, the petitioner did not want to testify, she did not want the petitioner to testify for fear of him being charged with perjury, and that, in her experience, having an interpreter involved, as would have been necessary during the petitioner's testimony, would have made\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   the petitioner appear insincere.

[Our Supreme Court] has recognized, however, that improper joinder may expose a defendant to potential prejudice for three reasons: First, when several charges have been made against the defendant, the jury may consider that a person charged with doing so many\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   things is a bad [person] who must have done something, and may cumulate evidence against him ....

In addition, because of the similarity of the evidence in both cases, evidence from one case that may have been introduced in the other would have been unlikely to arouse the jurors' emotions.

Specifically, the court stated in its charge to the jury: \"Now, other misconduct. In a criminal case in which the defendant is charged with a crime ... exhibiting [aberrant] and compulsive criminal sexual behavior, evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Now, with regard to [the petitioner's previous conviction], evidence of that offense on its own is not sufficient to prove the [petitioner] guilty of the crime charged in the information.... It's very important that you keep that in mind....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The [previous conviction] is offered to show that the [petitioner] had an unusual disposition, that is, a sexual interest in children.... Now, that's all you can use it for .... [The conviction] is claimed evidence of a motive for the crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The foregoing instructions to the jury were appropriate in the context of the petitioner's criminal trial, and would also have been appropriate had the cases involving J and G not been joined. As such, even if the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   cases involving J and G had not been joined, the evidence in one case would have been admissible in the other to prove that the petitioner had a propensity or a tendency to sexually assault adolescent girls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With this in mind, the remaining arguments that the petitioner makes on appeal in regard to joinder are unpersuasive. The petitioner's argument that he had a compelling need to testify in the case involving G, but did not have a similar need to testify in the case involving J, is belied by the fact that the evidence in both cases was cross admissible. Specifically, the evidence that the petitioner's semen was found on G's underwear could have been introduced in J's case. As such, the petitioner's purported need to testify in G's case to explain how his semen got on her underwear similarly would be needed in J's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additionally, the petitioner's contention that the proper argument and preservation of the joinder issue at his criminal trial would have led to a more favorable outcome in his direct appeal must also be rejected. Because the evidence, as previously described, was cross admissible, there was no likelihood that the petitioner's conviction would have been reversed on direct appeal, even if Attorney D'Amato had objected on the grounds that the petitioner now argues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that an objection to joinder would have changed the outcome of the petitioner's criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that his trial counsel had not provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to opinion testimony from a witness on an ultimate issue of fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   with respect to the criminal charges in one of the underlying criminal cases. Specifically, the petitioner claims that he was prejudiced by Attorney D'Amato's failure to object to Knapp's testimony in which Knapp expressed her opinion that G was a victim of sexual assault. The petitioner argues that this testimony unfairly gave rise to an inference that he was guilty of sexual assault. The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, argues that the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was prejudiced in light of the substantial circumstantial evidence admitted at trial. We agree with the respondent that the petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During the state's redirect examination of Knapp, the prosecutor questioned Knapp about her experience in conducting forensic interviews with children in child sexual assault cases. Subsequently, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: ... The defense attorney asked you what was in your mind as to whether or not [G] was a victim ... do you remember those questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"[Knapp]: Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Now, [G] never says that the [petitioner] did something bad to her, undisputed.

And how about the fact that [G's] sister, J, had said, I woke up and somebody was cutting my underwear, the [petitioner], and he put his penis through the hole and then [J] felt wet in [her] butt.

Well, I shouldn't ask that. Okay. That's it. Thank you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The habeas court concluded that the petitioner failed to establish that he was prejudiced by Attorney D'Amato's failure to object to Knapp's testimony without deciding whether that failure constituted deficient\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found that there was substantial evidence against the petitioner in the underlying criminal case apart from Knapp's testimony. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the present case, Knapp was repeatedly questioned during the state's redirect examination regarding whether she believed G was a victim. The petitioner argues that Knapp's testimony was unduly prejudicial because there was no direct evidence of abuse in the case involving G. This argument is similar to that made by the petitioner in his direct appeal before this court. In that appeal, the petitioner raised an insufficiency of the evidence claim and argued that the evidence in G's case \"merely establishe[d] that at some point G wore the underwear, at some point a hole was cut in them, and that at some point the [petitioner's] semen was wiped on the underwear. In addition, the [petitioner] contend[ed] that [i]t is only after the state implores the jury to consider J's independent ... testimony, together with the [evidence of the petitioner's prior misconduct] from ten years earlier, that the state is able to prevail with an argument ... that the [petitioner]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    must have\n   </em>\n   had sexual contact with G.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cancel\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414865\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/86/\">\n    149 Conn.

This court rejected the petitioner's claim and concluded that, in light of the evidence presented at trial, \"the jury reasonably could have inferred that the [petitioner] entered G's bedroom at night and cut holes in her underwear for purposes of sexual gratification, just as he did with J.... It also was reasonable for the jury to infer that the [petitioner], when he cut holes in the area of G's underwear corresponding to her intimate parts, made sexual contact with G's intimate parts for the purposes of sexual gratification.... Moreover, the jury reasonably could have inferred that either depositing semen on a child's underwear or entering a child's bedroom as she slept at night for purposes of cutting [holes in] her underwear constituted a situation likely to impair the morals of a child.\" (Citations omitted.)

It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.... There is no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence as far as probative force is concerned.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1955196\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/183/225/#p227\">\n    183 Conn. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=439%20A.2d%20305\">\n    439 A.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981). The jury reasonably could have relied on the statements by both J and G, the DNA analysis that revealed the presence of the petitioner's semen on the inside and outside of G's underwear and clothing, the numerous pairs of G's underwear and pants with holes that had been cut by a sharp object between the rear end and genital area, the independent testimony from J that indicated she also had holes in\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   her underwear, and the videotape of J's forensic interview, to conclude that the petitioner had sexually assaulted G just as he did with J. Moreover, even if the cases involving G and J had not been joined, as previously discussed in part I of this opinion, the evidence in both cases was cross admissible as evidence that the petitioner had a propensity to engage in the sexual conduct with which he was charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Accordingly, because there was no reasonable probability that, had Attorney D'Amato successfully objected to Knapp's alleged opinion testimony that G was a victim of sexual assault, the result of the proceeding would have been different, we conclude that the petitioner failed to prove that he was prejudiced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that Attorney D'Amato had provided effective assistance despite failing to present expert testimony that could have offered an alternative innocent explanation for the sexual assault allegations against him. Specifically, the petitioner claims that Attorney D'Amato's failure to consult with a forensic psychologist regarding the suggestive influence that may have been present in J's forensic interview, particularly in light of J's developmental issues and the ongoing custody dispute between J's mother and uncle, constituted deficient performance by which he was prejudiced. The respondent argues that the petitioner failed to prove that Attorney D'Amato's performance was deficient and that he suffered prejudice. We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During the petitioner's criminal trial, Knapp testified regarding her initial conversation with J at the Waterbury police station prior to J's forensic interview. From her initial observation, Knapp became aware of J's developmental issues. In obtaining information from\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   children, the Waterbury Police Department's guidelines called for conducting forensic interviews with children between the ages of three and nine, and typically taking statements from children aged ten and older. Although J was eleven years of age at the time of her complaint, Knapp believed that a forensic interview was necessary for J because of concerns with her cognitive abilities. During their initial conversation, J had stated to Knapp, without prodding, that the reason she was there was because the petitioner had touched her where he was not supposed to. The conversation lasted for approximately twenty-five minutes to one-half hour, and the information that Knapp gleaned from J was consistent with what Knapp had learned from other individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Knapp also testified as to the Waterbury Police Department's general guidelines in conducting forensic interviews and as to how J's interview was conducted. The forensic interview consisted of nonleading, nonsuggestive questions in a one-on-one environment. The interview was conducted in a specialized room within a facility that specializes in the behavioral health of children and families. The forensic interviewer was a child interview expert with the Waterbury Child Abuse Interdisciplinary Team, which oversaw sexual assault cases in the area. The interviewer and J were alone in the room while law enforcement officials, including Knapp, and department officials watched the interview from the other side of a one-way mirror. The interview was videotaped and audiotaped, which was standard practice. Knapp also testified that she spoke with J's mother on the day following the forensic interview, and that she had provided information that was consistent with information that had been elicited during the forensic interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   During the habeas trial, Attorney D'Amato testified that she did not consult with any expert witnesses in preparation for the petitioner's criminal trial, and that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   she knew J had developmental issues and was enrolled in special education classes. Attorney D'Amato had reviewed J's forensic interview, but did not consider consulting with a forensic expert because it did not seem necessary given the overwhelming evidence against the petitioner, including the petitioner's previous criminal history, the scissor cut holes in the underwear, evidence of the petitioner's semen on G's underwear, and the independent statements from J and G. Attorney D'Amato also had understood the role of suggestibility in child sexual assault cases, and recalled that she had seen J's forensic interview several times and that it did not seem to be suggestive or violate any forensic interviewing protocols. Attorney D'Amato also recalled that at the time of the petitioner's trial there had been a custody dispute between J's mother and uncle for custody of J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The petitioner also presented the expert testimony of Nancy Eiswirth, a forensic psychologist. Dr. Eiswirth defined the concept of suggestibility and how it relates to children, and described how individuals with lower IQs tend to be more suggestible than others. Dr. Eiswirth testified that, generally, suggestibility is relevant in the context of child allegations of sexual assault because it helps with understanding how an allegation came about. Specifically, a review of any preforensic interview contacts that a child may have had is critical to judging whether a question in an interview is leading. Additionally, there is a tendency, particularly among children with low IQs, to want to please or agree with others, or to just answer a question even if they do not understand it. Dr. Eiswirth also reviewed J's forensic interview. Dr. Eiswirth found that J's statements during her forensic interview regarding what may have happened when J was asleep were important because a child may misinterpret what happens when that child is asleep or in a dream state. Dr. Eiswirth also testified\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   that there was not much questioning during J's forensic interview about people she talked to, but acknowledged that J had stated that she talked to her uncles, her grandmother, and her mother, in addition to other people. Dr. Eiswirth referenced several times that, during the forensic interview, J had exhibited behavior that indicated that she was trying to please the interviewer. Dr. Eiswirth did not recall any questions that would have ruled out suggestibility. Dr. Eiswirth noted several instances that could have been indicative of suggestion, such as J going to her sister's room and talking to her sister, and then subsequently speaking\n   with the department worker. Dr. Eiswirth, however, did not make a determination about J's level of suggestibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The habeas court concluded that Attorney D'Amato's failure to present testimony from a mental health expert at the petitioner's criminal trial did not constitute deficient performance and that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was prejudiced by such failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \"[J]udicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.

She was aware of J's developmental issues and of the role that suggestibility could have in child sexual assault cases. After reviewing the videotape of the forensic interview several times and finding no suggestibility present, however, she determined that there was no legitimate reason to retain an expert or pursue a suggestibility defense strategy because of the overwhelming evidence against the petitioner. She found, rather, that the best strategy at trial was to focus on the defense that the petitioner had not sexually assaulted or penetrated anyone, and noted that the defense had obtained a not guilty verdict on the charge of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Additionally, although Dr. Eiswirth provided testimony on suggestibility in general and on the potential\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   for suggestibility in J's forensic interview, she did not make a determination that J was influenced during the interview or that the interview was improperly conducted. Rather, as demonstrated by Knapp's testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial, the interview conformed to guidelines specified by the Waterbury Police Department and was conducted in an impartial manner by\n   an expert in child sexual assault interviews. The information obtained from the interview also was consistent with information that Knapp had obtained from other witnesses. As such, the petitioner has failed to overcome the presumption that Attorney D'Amato's decision not to present the testimony of an expert, in light of the other evidence presented, fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. See\n   <em>\n    Ricardo R.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12504528\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/198/630/#p798\">\n    185 Conn.

As such, we need not reach the prejudice prong as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that his right to the effective assistance of counsel was not violated due to Attorney D'Amato's absence from the petitioner's presentence investigation interview with a probation officer, who thereafter prepared a report for the trial court. Specifically, the petitioner claims that his counsel's allegedly\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   improper absence from the interview constituted deficient performance and that he was prejudiced because he had made harmful comments during the interview that his counsel, if present, would have advised him not to make and which adversely affected the subsequent sentence handed down by the court. The petitioner also claims that prejudice should be presumed because the presentence investigation interview is a critical stage of the proceedings, and his counsel's absence constituted a complete denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment. Because we conclude that the presentence investigation interview is not a critical stage of a criminal proceeding, the petitioner was not entitled to the effective assistance of counsel during this interview and, accordingly, we agree with the habeas court's rejection of this claim, albeit on alternate grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Attorney D'Amato provided uncontroverted testimony that she inadvertently was absent from the petitioner's presentence investigation interview because she had gotten lost on her way to MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, where the interview took place. During the petitioner's sentencing, however, Attorney D'Amato indicated that she and the petitioner had discussed the interview and that she had reviewed the presentence investigation report. Moreover, Attorney D'Amato asked the court to strike any denials that she believed the petitioner may have made during the interview because she had not been present, even though the petitioner had informed her that he did not make any statements about what had happened during the presentence investigation interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   act on Attorney D'Amato's request or refer to the petitioner's presentence investigation report during sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   After analyzing the petitioner's claims under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the habeas court found that trial counsel's absence from the petitioner's presentence investigation interview did not constitute deficient performance and that the petitioner failed to prove prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all\n   <em>\n    critical stages\n   </em>\n   of a criminal proceeding.

The petitioner argues, nonetheless, that\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    governs the analysis of the issue of joinder that he raised in his direct appeal and, thus, that there was a reasonable probability that, had Attorney D'Amato properly preserved the issue for appellate review, the petitioner's convictions would have been reversed on direct appeal. The petitioner's claim before this court, however, alleges that his trial counsel failed to litigate adequately the joinder issue\n    <em>\n     at the time of his criminal trial\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    As previously discussed, our case law at the time of the petitioner's criminal trial\n    <em>\n     recognized a clear presumption in favor of joinder\n    </em>\n    . See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Ellis\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5303364\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/270/337/#p374\">\n     270 Conn. at 375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20A.2d%20676\">\n     852 A.2d 676\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Attorney D'Amato decided not to object to joinder on the basis of the law as it existed at the time of the petitioner's criminal trial. To conclude, on the basis of\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    , that the petitioner was prejudiced by his counsel's alleged failure to adequately litigate the joinder issue at his criminal trial would be tantamount to requiring Attorney D'Amato to have argued legal principles not yet established at the time of that trial.
