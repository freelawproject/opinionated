After the officer was in the apartment, he told Hussein that he was issuing him a criminal summons and that Hussein \"ha[d] to sign the summons.\" The officer emphasized, however, that the summons simply established a court date for Hussein and that signing it was not an admission of guilt. After Hussein repeatedly refused to sign the summons, the officer said, \"Okay, you don't want to sign the summons, you're under arrest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Hussein then attempted to \"run,\" but the officer \"grabbed ahold of\" Hussein and twisted his arm into what the officer described as an \"arm bar.\" Despite the arm bar, Hussein punched the officer in the face. As the officer persisted in attempting to arrest Hussein, he tried to pin\n   Hussein to the floor of the apartment, but Hussein kept \"flailing and fighting violently.\" At some point during these events, the officer noticed that Hussein's sister was filming the arrest on her cellphone. The officer called for backup as he attempted to subdue Hussein. Shortly thereafter, additional officers arrived and took Hussein into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] The State charged Hussein with refusing to sign a criminal summons (Class E), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 15-A(1), refusing to submit to arrest by physical force (Class D), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 751-B(1)(B), and assault (Class D), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 207(1)(A) ; Hussein pleaded not guilty to all charges. During pretrial discovery, Hussein produced his sister's cellphone video of the arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] On July 19, 2018, two weeks after a jury had been selected, and one day before the trial was to start,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the State filed a motion in limine requesting that it be permitted to \"inspect the entire recording.\" The State requested that, absent a showing by Hussein that the video captured the entire incident, the video \"be excluded from the trial\" because it would be \"misleading for the jury to see a video capturing only the incident after the warnings were given to the defendant regarding his failure to sign the criminal summons, after the defendant attempted to flee the room, and after the assault of [the arresting officer].\" The court viewed the video with counsel for the State and Hussein and subsequently denied the State's motion-all on the same day it was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] On the next day, July 20, 2018, the court held a one-day jury trial. The State's case relied exclusively on the testimony of the arresting officer and one of the other officers who had responded to the arresting officer's request for assistance. At trial, the arresting officer testified that he had seen Hussein's sister record a portion of the arrest on her cellphone. Hussein's counsel then attempted to authenticate the video through the officer. Although the officer acknowledged that the recording fairly and accurately represented a portion of his interaction with Hussein, the court excluded the video, reasoning, \"With respect to the attempt to authenticate this particular piece of evidence through [the officer], given his testimony as to his belief that it is not complete, [the] [c]ourt will sustain the State's objection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hussein asked the court to reconsider its ruling, but the court again sustained the State's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] Hussein's counsel then told the court that he wanted to use the video to impeach the arresting officer's testimony. The court sent the jury out of the courtroom and had the arresting officer review the video again. The officer again testified that the video fairly and accurately represented what happened during the period of time captured on the video. Hussein's attorney asked the arresting officer a series\n   of questions about the video, and then indicated that he was ready to have the jury brought back. When the jury returned, Hussein's counsel continued in his cross-examination of the arresting officer, and, although the jury had not seen the video, what the video showed was discussed in great detail in front of the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q: Corporal ..., in the full two minutes leading up to the moment that the other officers secure Mr. Abdiaziz-excuse me, Mr. Hussein in handcuffs, he did not-he, in fact, did not punch at you, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A: He could not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: But the specific answer to the question is he did not punch at you, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: Yes. He could not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: And he, at most, had his right leg or his right knee drawn up, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A: Yes, he had his right leg, yup, shoved into my side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: And, in fact, he did not kick you, did he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: He's trying to push me off with his leg, yeah. Be more specific with me 'cause you're not letting-you're asking me did he kick me. I-once I had him pinned and I got my body weight on him, he's got his leg up into my ribs, and I'm keeping my body weight on there so he doesn't drive me because he's trying to fight free. He's not-he's not complying. He's still fighting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If you looked at what your question is ... I can't honestly answer your question with a yes or no because he was still fighting on the floor. He's got his leg up. It's in my ribs and I've got him pinned with my body weight. If I was up, yeah, he probably could have kneed me with his knees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: But he didn't?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: He couldn't because I had my body weight on him. Yes. Yes, he did not knee me is what you're asking because I did not allow him to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: So he didn't strike you with his knee, and he didn't kick you with his feet, did he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: In the last portion of the video, no, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: The two minutes up to the time that the other officers secured him, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: Beyond that, he has a pen in his left hand that whole two minutes, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: No. I think that come from the trash can and th[e]n went flying over. I just see the video the other day. I just viewed this and he has a pen in his hand laying on the floor. Where it came from I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: But a moment ago I asked you he has a pen in his hand this whole time, right, and you said yes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: Well, you're saying the whole time. What is the whole time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q: The two minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A: For this video, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: He has a pen in his hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A: Well, I-I want to disagree with you because what I see on the video is once I've got him pinned on the floor-and we can see a portion of the video, not the whole two minutes-then you see a pen in his hand because there was trash on the floor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: Are you now changing your testimony from a moment ago where you said he did have a pen in his hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: No, I'm not. I'm answering your question. You asked, Did he have a pen in his hand for the whole two minutes? I don't know. I can't answer that. I only see the last portion of this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: Is it true that in the two minutes leading up to the time the other officers secure Mr. Hussein he has a pen in his left hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: He has a pen in his hand at the very end of your video, yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: And a few moments ago I asked you to confirm that he has a pen in his hand, right? I asked you that question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: If I understood your question right, you stated it for the entire video, for the two-minute video he had a pen in his hand; and I answered no to that because all I see a pen in his hand is at the very last. I don't know how much time he has a pen in his hand. That's the last part of it. The very first part of it when I was fighting with him he did not have a pen in his hand, so I don't know how to answer you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: Did you see him pick a pen up from the trash?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: I really can't tell you that. I know the trash can went flying over and debris spewed all over the floor because it was-it was in front of us. It may have been an opportunity for him to pick up a pen, but he did not have a pen when I first grabbed ahold of him. He did not have a pen in his hand until we went to the floor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q: In the final two minutes leading up to the moment when the other officers put handcuffs on Abdiaziz, he has his left hand like this, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A: His left hand and he's on his shoulder. As we're trying to get him on the ground, he is laying on his left shoulder with this arm pinned down with a pen in his hand and I have his other arm like this and I have my body weight on him. That's the last part of the video that I see that he has a pen and it was probably-may have been my pen dropped in the altercation. I don't know that. But he's pinned on the ground like this, and he's got a pen in his left hand, yes. He's laying on the ground and I've got him pinned and I see the video, he actually had control of a writing utensil, whether it was a pencil or a pen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q: And, specifically, he's got it with his thumb holding it, right, like this? You can see-you saw the pen in his hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A: When we watched this video, I'm not paying much attention to where-how he holds the pen. I just know he has an object in his hand and it looks like a pen and it looks like one of my gray big pens that I sign summonses with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q: His left hand is open facing you, right, in that two minutes we're talking about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A: Is it open? He's in possession of the last part of it with a pen. That's what you've been asking me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q: But the question is-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A: In the beginning he had nothing in his hand. When he was pinned up against the wall in a sitting position, he would not comply. He had nothing in his hand. He had his hand out trying to brace against the wall as I've got his right arm locked in an arm bar hold and he's trying to use that as leverage and I had to continue to put pressure on him to get him down to a partial subline (sic) position where he's laying and his arm is out, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q: The question I'm asking you is can you confirm that in that two minutes his left hand is open facing you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A: I'd have to review it again. I just know that I watched the video and we're fighting into the wall and it's not clear until the camera gets to a certain position and then you see his hand with a pen in it. I don't-I don't recall seeing\n   his hand with a pen in it the whole time because I never gave him a pen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q: Are you denying that his hand was open like this facing you in that final two minutes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A: Sometime in the last two minutes, yes, his hand was probably open, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q: And it's not only open but drawn in like this, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A: He's laying on his side so I-I would say so. I don't know how he's got it extended. I'm on top of him so. And I only see his hand out there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q: And multiple times he said, I'll sign the summons, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT: Objection's sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q: [Arresting Officer], you had Abdiaziz-in that two minutes we're talking about you had Abdiaziz in an arm bar the entire time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q: And you were in the kitchen, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b69] At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Hussein guilty of all three counts. On July 30, 2018, the court entered a judgment on the verdict, sentencing Hussein to ten days in jail and a fine of $ 500.00 for assault, seven days in jail-to run concurrently with the ten days-for refusing to submit to arrest, and twenty hours of public service for refusing to sign the criminal summons.

Implicit is conscientious judgment directed by law and reason and looking to a just result. Consequently, if the trial judge misconceives the applicable law or misapplies it to the factual complex, in total effect the exercise of legal discretion lacks a foundation and becomes an arbitrary act.

Accordingly, on November 10, 2017, a Lewiston police officer went to Hussein's residence to attempt to serve the summons. At the residence, the officer advised Hussein that he was issuing a criminal summons and that Hussein had to sign the summons. The officer emphasized that the summons, and signing the summons, simply established a court date and that signing the summons was not an admission of guilt. Despite this advice, Hussein repeatedly refused to sign the summons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   [\u00b626] Because he refused to sign the summons, the officer indicated that he had to arrest Hussein. Hussein then attempted to flee, but the officer grabbed Hussein's arm, at which point Hussein punched the officer in the face. In punching the officer in the face, Hussein committed the Class C felony of assault on an officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 752-A (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   [\u00b627] Hussein and the officer then continued to struggle, causing them both to end up on the floor of the apartment, with the officer on top of Hussein. At some point after the charged crimes had been committed, and after Hussein and the officer were on the floor, another occupant of the apartment began video recording the struggle, using a cellphone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   [\u00b628] Sometime prior to trial, the State learned of the existence of the cellphone video recording, sought to inspect it, and moved that the video be excluded from the trial. At several points before and during the trial, the parties debated whether the video should be allowed to be offered into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   [\u00b629] The record to support Hussein's offer of the video into evidence included the testimony of the arresting officer and another officer as to the events at the apartment, the video itself, and representations-but no testimony or affidavits-by Hussein's counsel as part of an offer of proof, M.R. Evid. 103(a)(2), (b), seeking to admit the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   [\u00b630] Although the trial court ultimately decided that the video should not be admitted, it permitted extensive examination of\n   the officer regarding the events that appeared on the video, with that examination quoted in the Court's opinion. Court's Opinion \u00b6 8. That examination, consistent with the video itself, indicates that Hussein and the officer were struggling on the floor for approximately two minutes while the recording was going on and that, during that time, Hussein, at some point, possessed a pen. Hussein's counsel argued that Hussein's possession of the pen and statements heard on the video demonstrated that Hussein, after initially refusing to sign the summons and being subject to arrest, was indicating a willingness to sign the summons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   [\u00b631] The Court holds, surprisingly, that because the officer's testimony purportedly \"fairly and accurately represented the events\" shown on the video and properly authenticated the video, M.R. Evid. 901(b)(1), the trial court's refusal to admit the video was \"an abuse of discretion.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   [\u00b632] In my view, the trial court did not err in refusing to admit the video. And even if, as the Court concludes, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the video because it deemed the video not properly authenticated, that error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 52(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b633] The Court's opinion itself describes the officer's testimony regarding the events that occurred and are depicted on the video and notes that the officer testified that the video \"fairly and accurately represented the events shown in the scene.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6 13. If the officer's testimony represented that the video fairly and accurately described the events shown regarding the struggle that occurred in attempting to arrest Hussein after the crimes had been committed, then the video could properly have been excluded as repetitive of testimony already given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [\u00b634] Further, and more importantly, there is no dispute that the video recording began only after Hussein had refused to sign the summons, attempted to flee, punched the officer in the face, and refused to submit to arrest-the crimes with which he was charged and convicted by the jury. The only relevance of the video was to show the continuing struggle to arrest Hussein after he had refused to submit to arrest, to indicate minor discrepancies between the after-the-crimes events as depicted on the video and the officer's testimony about those events, and to provide support for Hussein's claim that, with a pen, he was attempting to indicate to the officer that he was then willing to sign the summons. Hussein's prior attempt at flight, refusal to sign the summons, and punching the officer in the face had ended any chance that Hussein would not be arrested well before the video of the struggle with the officer had begun and Hussein had made his belated offer to sign the summons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   [\u00b635] Because the video did not demonstrate major discrepancies in the officer's descriptions of the crimes committed, and was irrelevant to the crimes with which Hussein was charged-being a recording only of events after the crimes had been committed-the trial court properly excluded the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   [\u00b636] Although the trial court indicated that its reason for excluding the video was lack of proper authentication, M.R. Evid. 901(b)(1), all relevant factors must be considered in determining whether-or not-the court abused its discretion in excluding the video. The abuse of discretion determined by the Court may be found only when the appellant demonstrates that the trial court, in discretionary decision-making: (1) considered a factor prohibited by law; (2) declined to consider a legally proper factor under a mistaken belief that the\n   factor cannot be considered; (3) acted or declined to act based on a mistaken view of the law; or (4) expressly or implicitly found facts not supported by the record according to the clear error standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
