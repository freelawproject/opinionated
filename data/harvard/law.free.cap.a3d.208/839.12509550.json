Betting on a human life in that way, with the hope that the person will die soon, not only raises moral concerns but also invites foul play. For those reasons, state law allows a policy to be procured only if the benefits are payable to someone with an \"insurable interest\" in the person whose life is insured. N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1(b). The beneficiary can be the insured herself, a close relative, a person, corporation, or charity with certain financial ties to the insured, or select others. N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises out of certified questions of law from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. We consider whether the swift transfer of control over a life insurance policy and its benefit, from a named beneficiary who had an insurable interest to investors who did not, satisfies New Jersey's insurable interest requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Here, a group of investors paid for a life insurance policy through a trust. The insured was a stranger to them. When the policy was issued, the insured's grandson was the beneficiary. About five weeks later, the trust was amended and the strangers who invested in the policy became its beneficiaries. In short, the insurable interest requirement appeared to have been satisfied at the moment the policy was purchased, but the plan from the start was to transfer the benefits to strangers soon after the policy was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The policy in question is known as a \"STOLI\" -- a stranger-originated life insurance policy. Because such policies can be predatory and may involve fraud, other states have adopted legislation that bars them. We now consider STOLI policies as a matter of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We find that STOLI policies run afoul of New Jersey's insurable interest requirement and are against public policy. It would elevate form over substance to conclude that feigned compliance with the insurable interest statute -- as technically exists at the outset of a STOLI transaction -- satisfies the law. Such an approach would upend the very protections the statute was designed to confer and would effectively allow strangers to wager on human lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the certified questions, we find that STOLI policies are against public policy and are void ab initio, that is, from the beginning. We also note that a party may be entitled to a refund of premium payments depending on the circumstances. Among other relevant factors, courts should consider a later purchaser's participation in and knowledge of the original illicit scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We draw the following facts from the opinions of the Third Circuit and the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In April 2007, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada received an application for\n   a $ 5 million insurance policy on the life of Nancy Bergman. The application listed the Nancy Bergman Irrevocable Trust dated 4/6/2007 as the sole owner and beneficiary of the policy. Nancy Bergman signed the application as the grantor of the trust, and her grandson, Nachman Bergman, signed as trustee. The trust had four additional members. All of them were investors, and all were strangers to Ms. Bergman. The investors deposited money into the trust account to pay most if not all of the policy's premiums. The original trust agreement provided that any proceeds of the policy would be paid to Nachman Bergman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Bergman was a retired middle school teacher. Sun Life received an inspection report that listed her annual income as more than $ 600,000 and her overall net worth at $ 9.235 million. In reality, her income was about $ 3000 a month from Social Security and a pension, and her estate was later valued at between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although Ms. Bergman represented that she had no other life insurance policies, five policies were taken out on her life in 2007 from various insurance companies, including Sun Life, for a total of $ 37 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sun Life issued the $ 5 million policy in question on July 13, 2007. At the time, the trust was the sole owner and beneficiary. The policy had an incontestability clause that barred Sun Life from challenging the policy -- other than for non-payment of premiums -- after it had been \"in force during the lifetime of the Insured\" for two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 21, 2007, about five weeks after the policy was issued, Nachman Bergman resigned as trustee and appointed the four investors as successor co-trustees. The trust agreement was amended so that most of the policy's benefits would go to the investors; they were also empowered to sell the policy on their own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   More than two years later, in December 2009, the trust sold the policy to SLG Life Settlements, LLC, for $ 700,000. The investors received nearly all of the proceeds from the sale. Afterward, a company named LTAP acquired the policy for a brief period, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. obtained it in a bankruptcy settlement in or about 2011. Wells Fargo continued to pay the premiums. It claims to have paid $ 1,928,726 through a combination of direct premium payments and loans to LTAP to pay premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Nancy Bergman passed away in 2014 at age 89, Wells Fargo sought to collect the policy's death benefit. Sun Life investigated the claim, uncovered the discrepancies noted above, and declined to pay. Instead, Sun Life filed an action in the District Court and sought a declaratory judgment that the policy was void ab initio as part of a STOLI scheme. Wells Fargo counterclaimed for breach of contract and sought the policy's $ 5 million face value; if the court voided the policy, Wells Fargo sought a refund of the premiums it paid and funded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court partially granted Sun Life's motion for summary judgment. The court found that New Jersey law applied and concluded \"that this was a STOLI transaction lacking insurable interest in violation of [the State's] public policy.... As such, it should be declared void ab initio.\" The court also granted Wells Fargo's motion to recover its premium payments. The court reasoned that \"Wells Fargo is not to blame for the fraud here\" and that \"[a]llowing Sun Life to retain the premiums would be a windfall to the company.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Wells Fargo appealed the determination that the policy was void, and Sun Life cross-appealed the order to refund the premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Third Circuit noted that \"[n]o New Jersey state court has considered\" the issues at the heart of this case: \"whether STOLI arrangements violate the public policy of New Jersey, and if they do, whether the affected insurance policies are rendered void ab initio.\" The circuit court also observed that \"[i]f the Policy is declared void ab initio, then the nature of the remedy available to the parties is another unresolved question of New Jersey law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To resolve those \"difficult question[s] of New Jersey public policy\" and law, the Third Circuit certified two questions of law to this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) Does a life insurance policy that is procured with the intent to benefit persons without an insurable interest in the life of the insured violate the public policy of New Jersey, and if so, is that policy void ab initio?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) If such a policy is void ab initio, is a later purchaser of the policy, who was not involved in the illegal conduct, entitled to a refund of any premium payments that they made on the policy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We accepted both questions pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:12A-5.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505953\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/201/1267/12505953/\">\n    236 N.J. 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505952,12505953\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/201/1267/\">\n    201 A.3d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

From its earliest days, there have been concerns about who can purchase a policy on the life of another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Geoffrey Clark,\n   <em>\n    Betting on Lives: The Culture of Life Insurance in England, 1695-1775\n   </em>\n   13-14 (1999). In 1419, for example, the Venetian Senate outlawed wagers on the Pope's life and nullified many speculative bets about \"how long the reigning pope would live.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Elsewhere in Europe in the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries, \"[t]he frequent association of life insurance with gambling and other disreputable practices prompted governments to prohibit its practice without exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In England, life insurance \"was legally unrestricted [until] well into the eighteenth century.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. By then, it had \"bec[o]me so much a mode of gambling (for people took the liberty of insuring any one's life, without hesitation, whether connected with him, or not, ...) that it at last became a subject of Parliamentary discussion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (quoting James Allan Park,\n   <em>\n    A System of the Law of Marine Insurances\n   </em>\n   490 (1787)). From those discussions, \"the first appreciable regulation of life insurance\" emerged, along with the concept\n   that the policyholder must have \"a financial interest (a so-called 'insurable interest') in [the] life or event\" to be insured.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Section One of the Life Assurance Act of 1774 provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   no insurance shall be made by any person or persons, bodies politick or corporate, on the life or lives of any person, or persons, or on any other event or events whatsoever, wherein the person or persons for whose use, benefit, or on whose account such policy or policies shall be made, shall have no interest, or by way of gaming or wagering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [14 Geo. 3 (1774\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   48), https://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo3/14/48?view=plain.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A contract without an insurable interest would be \"null and void.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   \"The goal of the 1774 Act ... was to allow people to get the benefits of life insurance while eliminating the betting on human life it encouraged.\" Susan Lorde Martin,\n   <em>\n    Life Settlements: The Death Wish Industry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Syracuse%20L.%20Rev.%2091\">\n    64\n    <em>\n     Syracuse L.

In such a case, the plain language reading of the statute that Wells Fargo advances can lead to absurd results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Consider a policy that strangers financed or caused to be procured for Mary's life. When the policy is issued, Mary's daughter is the named beneficiary or the trustee of an irrevocable trust that owns the policy. The trust thus has an insurable interest at the time the contract for the policy is made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1(a). But the strangers actually have a side agreement with Mary or her daughter to transfer control of the trust, the beneficial interest in the policy, or ownership of the policy, at a later time. In short, the outside investors who funded the policy effectively control it from the start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   If the investors cause the daughter to transfer her interest to them a month, a day, or an hour after the policy is issued, it would elevate form over substance to suggest that the policy satisfies the insurable interest requirement. At most, there is only feigned compliance with the requirement that an insurable interest exist \"at the time when [the] contract was made.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1(b). In reality, Mary and her daughter satisfy the requirement\n   in name alone. The policy is a cover for a wager on Mary's life by a stranger. It therefore violates public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   STOLIs commonly involve life insurance policies procured and financed by investors -- strangers -- who have no insurable interest in the life of the insured yet, from the outset, are the ultimate intended beneficiaries of the policy. In other words, in a classic STOLI situation, a stranger who hopes the insured will die soon causes the policy to be procured and collects the death benefit. That type of arrangement runs afoul of New Jersey's insurable interest requirement and the statute's purpose. It also counters the principle underlying the requirement: the individual with an insurable interest \"must have an interest in the continued life of the insured rather than in his early death.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Nat'l Life Assurance Corp. v.

N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1(c) addresses the recovery of moneys already paid under a contract that violates the insurable interest requirement. It creates a cause of action for the insured or her estate\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a death benefit has been paid. Section (d) insulates insurers from liability when they rely on an applicant's statements about her insurable interest. Neither section allows for enforcement of a policy that lacks an insurable interest. Nor do the sections contain language that suggests they are the exclusive remedies when the absence of an insurable interest arises after two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Sections (a)(4) and (a)(5) of N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1 also inform the meaning and scope of the insurable interest requirement. Section (a)(4) expressly allows corporations to insure their directors, officers, employees, and others. Section (a)(5) similarly enables nonprofit or charitable entities to insure their directors and others, including their supporters. Under (a)(5), a director, supporter, or\n   other insured must either sign the application for insurance, which names the charitable entity as\n   the owner and beneficiary, or \"subsequently transfer ownership of the insurance to the entity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Those detailed sections were added to the insurable interest statute in 1991.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1991,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   369. The Sponsor's Statement noted that \"the principle of insurable interest was founded on the idea that the person purchasing the policy should have such a real and substantial interest in the property or person insured as would prevent the policy from being a mere wager on the insured event.\"\n   <em>\n    Sponsor's Statement to A. 4957\n   </em>\n   2 (\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   1991,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   369). The statement added, however, that \"[o]ver the years, many states have expanded the concept of insurable interest for the purpose of life and health insurance to reflect current trends in investment and the development of innovative insurance products,\" and that the time had come to broaden New Jersey's definition of insurable interest in part \"to afford New Jersey residents greater access to the myriad policy and investment options already available in other states.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Notably, despite the pro-investment aim of the 1991 amendments, the Legislature did not modify or loosen the insurable interest requirement beyond the particular areas that sections (a)(4) and (a)(5) address. Both sections reveal that when the Legislature meant to expand the insurable interest requirement to allow transfers that would satisfy the requirement, the Legislature acted with precision and care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Finally, we note that an incontestability provision does not bar a challenge to a STOLI policy. As discussed earlier, insurance contracts that are contrary to public policy cannot be enforced despite an incontestability clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tulipano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"418220\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/57/269/#p277\">\n    57 N.J.

Other situations might also raise concerns. Imagine, for example, that Mary's daughter procured the above policy, paid the policy premiums for a few months, and then transferred her role as trustee, or the ownership or beneficial interest in the policy, to a group of strangers in exchange for full reimbursement and some compensation. Suppose as well that Mary's daughter intended to do so from the start. That arrangement likewise might be little more than a cover for a wager on Mary's life for the benefit of strangers, and it raises questions about the manner in which the policy was procured. The transfer could also result in a challenge under the Viatical Settlements Act, N.J.S.A. 17B:30B-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A number of considerations could affect the validity of the policy: the nature and timing of any discussions between the purchaser and the strangers; the reasons for the transfer; and the amount of time the policy was held; among other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   If the purchaser and investors discussed an arrangement in advance, a third party without an insurable interest may have caused the policy to be procured -- even if no firm agreement had yet been finalized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 17B:24-1.1(b) (stating that \"[n]o person shall procure or\n   <em>\n    cause to be procured\n   </em>\n   \" a policy without an insurable interest) (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Wells Fargo and LISA both stress that the Legislature could have -- but did not --\n   impose a good faith intent requirement on the purchase of life insurance policies. Nonetheless, if a person with an insurable interest takes out a policy because he has an agreement to sell it to a third party, the transaction could be as much of an attempt to circumvent the insurable interest requirement as if a stranger had funded the policy at the outset. In either\n   event, the aim of the insurable interest requirement would be thwarted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Timing may also be a relevant factor. By way of comparison, the Viatical Settlements Act restricts for two years the sale of lawfully purchased policies to people who lack an insurable interest. N.J.S.A. 17B:30B-10(a). The Act addresses a different set of circumstances -- typically, the sale of a life insurance policy at a discount, by an elderly or ill person -- and the Legislature imposed limits to guard against the abuse of vulnerable individuals. Likewise, in the related context of this matter, the less time the policy owner held the policy before transferring it to a stranger, the greater the likelihood the policy violates public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Courts cannot devise a bright-line rule for the type of transaction this second hypothetical presents. The area is best addressed by the Legislature and DOBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Thirty states have enacted anti-STOLI legislation to date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-443.02\">\n    Ariz.

To decide the appropriate remedy, trial courts should develop a record and balance the relevant equitable factors. Those factors include a party's level of culpability, its participation in or knowledge of the illicit scheme, and its failure to notice red flags. Depending on the circumstances, a party may be entitled to a refund of premium payments it made on a void STOLI policy, particularly a later purchaser who was not involved in any illicit conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   We note that the District Court considered equitable principles and fashioned a compromise award based on the record before it. We do not comment on the award itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we answer both parts of the first certified question in the affirmative: a life insurance policy procured with the intent to benefit persons without an insurable interest in the life of the insured does violate the public policy of New Jersey, and such a policy is void at the outset. In response to the second question, we note that a party may be entitled to a refund of premium payments it made on the policy, depending on the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   JUSTICES LaVECCHIA, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, and TIMPONE join in CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   JUSTICE ALBIN did not participate.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    States have the authority to regulate insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201012\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson &amp; Johnson v.
