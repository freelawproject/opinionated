The dispositive issue\n   in the appeal is whether the court properly concluded that the plaintiff lacked standing to commence this action. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff set forth the following allegations in its complaint. In August, 2011, the plaintiff owned property located at 11 High Street in Suffield, which the defendant insured for, inter alia, property damage, loss of income and fair rental value. On or about August 28, 2011, the property suffered wind and water damage during a hurricane. As a result, the plaintiff claimed to have sustained damages for lost income and lost fair rental value, and made an insurance claim to the defendant. The defendant declined to pay the plaintiff's claim. In August, 2013, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant. Its complaint set forth claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It sought money damages, interest, attorney's fees, costs, and any other relief deemed appropriate by the court. The defendant filed an answer and raised several special defenses on January 8, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 6, 2017, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-30. Specifically, the defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring its claim for lost rental income for two commercial units at the property because the plaintiff had sold the property to a third party on January\n   10, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had assigned any insurance money for any damages existing at the time of the January, 2012 real estate closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, it stated: \"[The] [p]laintiff's assignment of its rights to any potentially recoverable insurance proceeds to [the third party] unequivocally extinguished [the] [p]laintiff's corresponding right to recover those amounts. [The]\n   [p]laintiff, therefore, lacks standing to maintain this action on its own behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 6, 2017, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss. It argued that the loss of rental income occurred\n   before the formation of the real estate purchase agreement. The plaintiff further claimed it was \"classically aggrieved in that it has a specific interest in the claimed insurance proceeds ... [and] suffered a loss due to the breach of contract by the [defendant] and has standing to bring this action.\" It also contended that it had retained an interest in the damaged units as a result of its decision to exercise a leaseback provision as set forth in the real estate purchase agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 27, 2018, the court,\n   <em>\n    Shapiro, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision granting the defendant's motion to dismiss. It first addressed the defendant's argument that the plaintiff had assigned the rights to the insurance proceeds to the third party pursuant to the terms of the real estate purchase agreement. It specifically explained: \"An assignment is a transfer of property or some other right from one person (the assignor) to another (the assignee), which confers a complete and present right in the subject matter to the assignee.... Succession by an assignee to exclusive ownership of all or part of the assignor's rights respecting the subject matter of the assignment, and a corresponding extinguishment of those rights in the assignor, is precisely the effect of a valid assignment.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) The court concluded that a valid assignment had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court was not persuaded by the plaintiff's arguments that (1) it was entitled to the insurance proceeds\n   because the damage had occurred before it entered into the real estate purchase agreement with the third party and (2) the execution of the leaseback provision in the real estate purchase agreement established its interest in the property such that it had standing. The court also rejected the plaintiff's claim that a separate agreement with the defendant entitled the plaintiff to any insurance moneys. Indeed, the plaintiff had failed to provide the court with a copy of this alleged separate agreement. The court granted the defendant's motion, concluding that \"the plaintiff lacks standing in the present case because, by virtue of the assignment, it has no legal interest in alleged insurance proceeds that are due and payable on account of damage to the [property].\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We carefully have examined the record and the briefs and arguments of the parties, and conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. Because the trial court's memorandum of decision thoroughly addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt that court's well reasoned decision as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on the issues.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Transportation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Bay Ins.

The plaintiff alleges that it is entitled to payments under an insurance policy issued by the defendant concerning a commercial building. It contends that the loss which is the subject of the action predated the purchase\n   agreement relied on by the defendant, and, in the agreement, the plaintiff retained the right to continue to use or rent the two units in the building which are the subject of the claim. Additional references to the background are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.... When standing is put in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of the issue .... Standing requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a [party] ordinarily establishes ... standing by allegations of injury.

It reflects that the plaintiff intended to assign its right to the insurance proceeds to Capital. Section 12 of the agreement provides: \"[Liberty Transportation, Inc.] assumes all risk of loss or damage to the Premises until closing and [Capital] assumes same upon closing.\n   <em>\n    If any damage to the premises shall not be restored prior to closing\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Capital\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    shall be required to close title to the premises and shall receive in an amount not to exceed the purchase price all insurance monies recovered or recoverable on account of such damage\n   </em>\n   . In the event of damage or loss [Liberty Transportation, Inc.] shall immediately notify [Capital] thereof and furnish to [Capital] a written statement of the amount of insurance, if any, payable on account thereof.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The express and unambiguous language of \u00a7 12 evinces the fact that Capital-to the exclusion of the plaintiff-would solely possess the right to insurance proceeds that are \"recovered or recoverable\" on the basis of any unrestored damage to the premises. This fact compels the conclusion that the plaintiff intended to assign its right to such proceeds to Capital. Accordingly, the first element of a valid assignment is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, the subject matter of the assignment between the plaintiff and Capital is adequately identified. As previously stated, \u00a7 12 of the agreement provides in relevant part: \"If any damage to the premises shall not be restored prior to closing [Capital] shall be required to close title to the premises and shall receive in an amount not to exceed the purchase price all insurance\n   monies recovered or recoverable on account of such damage.\" The unambiguous language of \u00a7 12 describes what is being transferred (the right to all insurance proceeds that are recovered or recoverable on the basis of any unrestored damage to the premises) and to whom it is being transferred (Capital). In light of these details, the subject matter of the assignment between the plaintiff and Capital is capable of identification. Accordingly, the second element of a valid assignment is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, the two elements of a valid assignment are satisfied in the present case because the express and unambiguous language of \u00a7 12 of the Agreement (1) compels the conclusion that the plaintiff intended to assign its right to the insurance proceeds to Capital, and (2) adequately identifies the subject matter of the assignment, the right to all insurance proceeds that are recovered or recoverable on the basis of any unrestored damage to the premises. Accordingly, the plaintiff validly assigned its right to such proceeds to Capital pursuant to agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The plaintiff argues that it did not assign its right to the insurance proceeds because the property damage for which the insurance proceeds are sought occurred before the plaintiff and Capital entered into the Agreement, and \u00a7 12 of the Agreement does not cover property damage that occurred before the Agreement was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As stated previously, \u00a7 12 of the Agreement provides in relevant part: \"\n   <em>\n    If any damage to the premises\n   </em>\n   shall not be restored prior to closing [Capital] shall be required to close title to the premises and shall receive in an amount not to exceed the purchase price all insurance monies recovered or recoverable on account of such damage.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 12 does not expressly draw a distinction between unrestored damage to the premises that occurred before the execution of the Agreement, and such damage that occurred after the plaintiff and Capital entered into the Agreement. Moreover, the use of the word \"any\" to modify the phrase \"damage to the premises\" has the effect of broadening \u00a7 12 to cover unrestored damage to the premises, regardless of whether such damage occurred either before or after the Agreement was executed by the plaintiff and Capital.

Accordingly, the plaintiff's first argument is inconsistent with the plain language of \u00a7 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiff also asserts that the interest which the plaintiff retained in the property's rental units pursuant to \u00a7 17 of the Agreement provides the plaintiff with standing in the present case. Any property (leasehold) interest that the plaintiff retained in the rental units is separate and distinct from any contractual right that the plaintiff allegedly has in the insurance proceeds. In the present case, the plaintiff is seeking to vindicate its alleged contractual right in the insurance proceeds, not a purported property interest. Thus, the alleged interest\n   that the plaintiff retained in the property's rental units does not provide the plaintiff with standing in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiff also argues, without documentation, that there is evidence of a separate agreement between the plaintiff and Capital concerning the damage to the two units. The Agreement provides, in paragraph 18, that it may not be modified, except in writing, and signed by the parties thereto. In addition, it contains an integration clause, in paragraph 21, which states, \"This agreement contains the entire contract between the parties hereto and no oral statements or promises and no understandings\n   not embodied in this writing shall be valid or binding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The statute of frauds, General Statutes \u00a7 52-550,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   bars actions based on agreements pertaining to real property which are not in writing and signed by the party to be charged.
