The defendants, Natiello and Timothy Sutera (Timothy S.),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal following the trial court's denial of their motion to set aside the verdict or for remittitur. On appeal, the defendants claim that (1) the trial court committed harmful error by giving a jury instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and (2) the jury verdict was improperly influenced by sympathy for the plaintiff. We conclude that the first claim is unreviewable and the second claim is without merit. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the summer of 2012, the plaintiff agreed to assist Timothy S. in repairing the soffit on the building. Timothy S. supplied the majority of the equipment, including the scaffolding and ladders, needed to make the repairs. Timothy S. repaired the soffit while standing on the scaffolding using materials that the plaintiff had prepared at ground level. At the time of the accident, Timothy S. and the plaintiff had been working on the project for approximately three weeks. The day before the accident, they moved the scaffolding and ladders to the opposite side of the building, but due to the lateness of the hour, they decided to stop working and continue the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Timothy S. and the plaintiff agreed to begin work at approximately 12 p.m. on September 24, 2012, the day of the accident. The plaintiff arrived at the property at the agreed upon time, but Timothy S. was delayed. At approximately 2 p.m., the plaintiff went to lunch because Timothy S. still had not arrived. During his lunch break, the plaintiff consumed one twenty-four\n   ounce beer with his meal. When he finished his meal, he returned to the property and observed that Timothy S. still was not present. The plaintiff elected to climb the ladder to access the scaffolding and examine the soffit that they would be repairing next. While the plaintiff was on the scaffolding, it gave way, and he and the scaffolding fell to the ground. A tenant who heard the crash found the plaintiff lying on the ground. He was taken to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries. A blood test taken at the hospital revealed that his blood alcohol content was between 0.07 and 0.10 percent. As a result of the fall and injuries he sustained, the plaintiff is a paraplegic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 14, 2014, the plaintiff served a four count complaint on the defendants. The first two counts set forth specific allegations\n   of negligence, as to each defendant, regarding how the scaffolding was erected and secured on the premises, and how the defendants failed to train, warn, and supervise the plaintiff regarding use of the scaffolding. The third and fourth counts alleged negligence, again as to each defendant, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The defendants pleaded a number of special defenses alleging, inter alia, that the plaintiff's own actions were the proximate cause of his injuries and that he failed to exercise proper care when using the scaffolding. During a six day jury trial, the plaintiff and Timothy S. testified that they were uncertain whether the scaffolding was attached securely to the building on the day of the accident. The plaintiff's expert witness, however, testified that, on the basis of a reasonable degree of professional certainty, the scaffolding was not secured at the time of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The expert further testified that he did not \"know\n   every single component, exactly at what point [the scaffolding] started to tilt or started to fail, but ... one way or the other ... [the scaffolding] was not erected properly or we [would not] be here today.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the conclusion of evidence, the plaintiff's counsel requested that the court charge the jury on the theory of res ipsa loquitur in addition to premises liability, stating: \"[T]here's testimony from the defendant that he set up the scaffolding and [the plaintiff's] involvement in the setup was relatively minor in that he only brought over pieces of the components and [roped] them up to the defendant, who after receiving the components, put it together.... [R]egardless of [the plaintiff's] use of the scaffolding, that's not the cause of why it collapsed. The reason why it collapsed was because it was not secured to the house, so there is sufficient evidence for a res ipsa [loquitur] charge to go to the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendants objected to this charge, arguing that an instruction on res ipsa loquitur was inappropriate given the evidence presented at trial. Specifically, they contended that because the plaintiff's expert testified with respect to the cause of the collapse, there was direct evidence of the defendants' negligence presented to the jury sufficient to preclude an instruction on res ipsa loquitur. Despite the defendants' objection, the court included an instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which provided: \"[I]n certain circumstances, the very happening of an accident may be an indication of negligence. We have the doctrine called res ipsa loquitur which, in Latin, means the thing speaks for itself. It is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of the injury in the absence of direct\n   evidence in how the defendants behaved.... [The] [\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    laintiff's voluntary act or neglect contributing to the occurrence,\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    however\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    , prevents the inference from being drawn\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) After the court instructed\n   the jury, the jury was given a single verdict form and a set of interrogatories that did not request separate verdicts as to each count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury returned the following verdict: \"[T]he jury finds the issues for the plaintiff, Nathaniel Sutera, as against the defendants, Deborah Natiello and Timothy [S.] ....\n   <em>\n    Comparative fault\n   </em>\n   .... The plaintiff, Nathaniel Sutera, 50 percent; the defendants, Deborah Natiello and Timothy [S.], 50 percent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the jury returned the verdict, the defendants filed a motion to set aside the verdict or for remittitur, claiming that the res ipsa loquitur charge was improper because, among other things, direct evidence of the defendants' negligence had been presented at trial. The defendants further argued that the verdict was improperly swayed by sympathy for the plaintiff, resulting in a compromise verdict. The court denied the defendants' motion. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendants first claim that the giving of the jury instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur constitutes harmful error. Specifically, they argue that, among other things, because there was direct evidence\n   of the defendants' negligence presented at trial, the court erred in concluding that the doctrine applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the defendants argue that the instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was harmful because it likely misled the jury as to the burden of proof and, at a minimum, must have confused the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the plaintiff argues that review of the defendants' claim is barred by the general verdict rule. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that, because the defendants assented to a general verdict form and did not request specific interrogatories with respect to each count, the general verdict rule applies. Under the unique facts of this case, where res ipsa loquitur was pleaded as a separate cause of action, without objection from the defendants, and separate jury interrogatories asking the jury to set forth the basis of its verdict were not provided to the jury, we conclude that the general verdict rule applies and, therefore, the defendants' claim of instructional error is unpreserved and not reviewable.\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the claim. In opposing the defendants' motion to set aside the verdict or for remittitur, the plaintiff argued that the res ipsa loquitur instruction was proper given the underlying facts of the case and, additionally, that review of the defendants' claim\n   was barred by the general verdict rule. In its memorandum of decision, the court agreed with the plaintiff and explained that the case law in which the application of the doctrine was deemed improper addressed circumstances where the factual basis for negligence was clear, whereas, in the present case, there were no independent witnesses and the plaintiff had little memory of the event. The court also agreed that, despite any error with respect to the res ipsa loquitur charge, the jury's verdict could be upheld under the proper and unchallenged premises liability theory of recovery. The court stated: \"The defendants do not challenge the propriety of the [verdict on the] negligence counts, just the res ipsa [loquitur] counts. Even if the res ipsa [loquitur] counts should have been [stricken] ... the verdict should be sustained under the general verdict rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The general verdict rule operates to prevent an appellate court from disturbing a verdict that may have been reached under a cloud of error, but is nonetheless valid because the jury may have taken an untainted route in reaching its verdict.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H.N.S.

Despite the defendants' claim that application of the rule is inappropriate under the present circumstances, it is not in dispute that the defendants failed to provide interrogatories to\n   the jury that disclosed the grounds for its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the fact that interrogatories were submitted to the jury, by itself, is insufficient to preclude the application of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Next, the defendants claim that, because the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not a separate cause of action, the general verdict rule should not apply, despite the fact that the plaintiff pleaded it in separate counts. The following legal principles are relevant to the resolution of the defendants' claim. In\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court \"reconsidered the applicability of the general verdict rule in an endeavor to make it more\n   certain 'as to when it applies and when it does not.' \"\n   <em>\n    Suarez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dickmont Plastics Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69210\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/255/\">\n    242 Conn. 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 n. 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20838\">\n    698 A.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), quoting\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burns,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757651\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/782/#p801\">\n    225 Conn. at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=626%20A.2d%20719\">\n    626 A.2d 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the court articulated five distinct scenarios wherein the rule would apply. The first of those five scenarios is\n   <em>\n    the denial of separate counts of a complaint\n   </em>\n   . In the present case, it is undisputed that the plaintiff's complaint alleged separate counts under premises liability and res ipsa loquitur, and that the defendants subsequently denied each of those counts in their answer. The defendants' claim, therefore, falls squarely within the first scenario contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff and the error claimed on appeal implicates only one of the possible routes the jury could have taken in reaching its verdict, we conclude, for the aforementioned reasons, that the general verdict rule applies here and, thus, prevents us from reviewing the defendants' claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant next claims that the jury improperly was influenced by sympathy for the plaintiff given the nature of his injury, as evidenced by its verdict and the resulting award. Specifically, the defendants argue that the jury's finding of comparative negligence is indicative of a compromise verdict. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"When reviewing both a motion to set aside the verdict and a motion for remittitur, the trial judge must review the evidence from the viewpoint of sustaining the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Levine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    418 Meadow Street Associates, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20701\">\n    163 Conn.

In\n   <em>\n    Niles\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   this court addressed the nature of the remand in a case where \"liability and damages [were] 'inextricably interwoven' \"; id., at 700,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20A.2d%201352\">\n    548 A.2d 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; a legal issue materially distinct from the defendants' claim now presented on appeal. In the court's discussion of the issue, however, it made the following relevant observation: \"[T]here is little fear that the jury was motivated by sympathy for one party\n   <em>\n    since it found both parties had been negligent\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20A.2d%201352\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In spite of the defendants' general assertion that\n   <em>\n    Niles\n   </em>\n   supports their claim that the verdict was affected by improper considerations,\n   <em>\n    Niles\n   </em>\n   supports the proposition that when a jury finds a plaintiff comparatively negligent, it also can weigh against any suggestion that the jury was influenced by sympathy. We agree with the court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Niles\n   </em>\n   and conclude that the fact that the jury found the plaintiff partially responsible for his injuries suggests that the jury was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   swayed\n   by sympathy and that it did not return a compromise verdict.

Moreover, our review of the record does not reveal any timely challenge to the court's premises liability charge. Because the defendants attempt to raise the issue for the first time on appeal as a predicate to their claim that the improper res ipsa loquitur instruction was harmful, we decline to consider it further.

If a trial court determines that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable, it should thereafter instruct the jury to compare the negligence of the plaintiff, if any, with that of the defendant to decide what percentages to attribute to each party consistent with the comparative negligence statute.\"\n    <em>\n     Giles\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New Haven\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325798\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/228/441/#p455\">\n     228 Conn. 441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 455,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=636%20A.2d%201335\">\n     636 A.2d 1335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1994).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Connecticut is a modified comparative negligence jurisdiction.
