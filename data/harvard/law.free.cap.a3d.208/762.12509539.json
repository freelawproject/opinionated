King's adopted child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(2) (2018). Young argues that the court abused its discretion in declining to hold a hearing to determine disputed facts and in concluding that King's refusal to allow Young to adopt the child was dispositive of the issue of whether King understood, acknowledged, or accepted that, or behaved as though, Young was a parent to the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(3)(C) (2018). We clarify the process, vacate the judgment, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The court stated in its judgment that, for purposes of its standing determination, it accepted the statements contained in the affidavits that Young submitted on the question of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Except where indicated otherwise, the following facts are drawn from those affidavits and from the procedural record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] Young and King began dating in 2004. In 2005, the couple purchased a house together in Limerick, and King, as a single prospective adoptive parent, applied to adopt a child through an adoption agency. Young and King had decided to adopt together but were told by the adoption agency that although they would be identified as a couple in internal documents, his name could not be mentioned in international documents because many countries required potential adoptive parents to either be a single woman or an established married couple. The plan, according to Young, was for him to adopt the child after King first adopted the child as a single parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] In 2007, King accepted a referral to adopt a six-month-old child from India. In February 2008, the couple travelled to India to bring the child back to their home in Limerick. King adopted the child in December 2008 but then told Young that she was not going to allow him to also adopt the child. Nevertheless, the three continued to live in their home until November 2011. King agrees in her affidavit that, during that time, Young played with the child, cooked for the family, and transported the child to and from daycare. Young avers that he was involved in raising the child in many other ways, including contributing to the child's healthcare by paying for her chiropractic appointments out of pocket, to the child's daycare by giving King a check every month to cover half of the costs, and to the child's participation in certain activities by enrolling the child in gymnastics camp, inter alia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] King at some point began dating a new partner, and in November 2011, she and the child moved into King's new partner's home, which is located approximately 150 miles from Limerick. Young remained in the Limerick house and kept the child's bedroom there intact, leaving most of her belongings, including her cat, at the house. For several years following the move, the child generally spent every other weekend\n   with Young at the Limerick house, as well as some time during school vacations and summers. In March 2016, when the Limerick house was sold, Young purchased a new house that included a bedroom for the child. By April 2018, Young's opportunities for visitation with the child had become increasingly inconsistent, and he brought a complaint for a determination of parentage, parental rights, and responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] King moved to dismiss Young's complaint for lack of standing to be determined a de facto parent. Based on the filings, the court agreed and dismissed Young's complaint for lack of standing. The court found that because King did not allow Young to adopt the child and did not otherwise regard Young as the child's father, Young failed to show that King understood, acknowledged, or accepted Young as a co-parent, and Young therefore lacked standing to seek an adjudication of de facto parenthood. Young moved for reconsideration on the issue of standing and for a hearing, which the court denied, again finding that had King behaved as though Young were the child's father she would have allowed him to become an adoptive parent. Young appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1901(1) (2018) ; 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 104 (2018) ; M.R. App. P. 2A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67] Young argues that the court erred by determining that he failed to establish standing. The court made its standing determination pursuant to the de facto parentage framework prescribed in the Maine Parentage Act (MPA),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(3) (2018). \"We examine the legal aspects of a court's standing determination de novo and review for clear error the factual findings underlying that determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Lamkin v.

To demonstrate standing, the claimant must satisfy, by a preponderance of the evidence, the statutory elements laid out in section 1891(3) of the MPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2072\">\n    2018 ME 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15, 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497394\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/837/\">\n    186 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The standing determination is a multi-step process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   First, the claimant is required to file an affidavit along with the complaint, stating \"specific facts\" that track the elements of a de facto parenthood claim. [ 19-A M.R.S.] \u00a7 1891(2)(A). Next, the adverse party may file a responsive affidavit along with a responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(2)(B). Finally, the court is to review the parties' submissions and either make a determination based on the parties' submissions whether the claimant has demonstrated standing, or, \"in its sole discretion, if necessary and on an expedited basis, hold a hearing to determine disputed facts that are necessary and material to the issue of standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(2)(C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The claimant has the burden to present persuasive evidence of the elements of standing-meaning that the proof must be by a preponderance-\"irrespective of whether the court adjudicates the issue based on the papers or on evidence presented at a hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 24, 26.

We have recognized that a legal parent can refuse to allow a claimant to adopt a child yet still consent to the parental role that the claimant has played in the child's life. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Kilborn v. Carey\n   </em>\n   , we reasoned that a legal parent \"implicitly, if not explicitly, consented to and encouraged [a claimant]'s parental role\" when the legal parent \"admitted that he only saw his daughter twice over the course of four years, he was not there for many of her firsts, and he respected the role that [the claimant] played in her life during that time.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793860\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/461/\">\n    2016 ME 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793860\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/461/\">\n    140 A.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Even though \"he did not wish to allow the child to be adopted, he was not opposed to [the claimant] effectively serving as her father.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. We held that this evidence established that the legal parent intended for the claimant to be a parent to the child \"despite [the legal parent]'s peripheral presence and objection to formal adoption.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b610] Although Young concedes that King did not allow him to adopt the child, that does not necessarily mean that she did not otherwise understand, acknowledge, or accept that \"a bonded and dependent relationship has been established between\" the child and Young, or behave as though Young was a parent to the child. 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(3)(C) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   American Law Institute,\n   <em>\n    Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.03, cmt. c (2002) (\"Failure to adopt the child when it would have been possible is some evidence, although not dispositive, that the legal parent did not agree to the formation of the de facto parent relationship.\"). To determine whether Young presented persuasive evidence of the statutory requirements, the court was therefore required to review all of the facts proffered by the parties in their affidavits that were material to the issue of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b611] Given that many of the other facts material to the issue of standing\n   were contested by the parties and that, if believed, Young's version of the facts could have led to a finding that he had standing, the court should have held a hearing to determine those disputed facts. As we have stated, the court acts within its discretion by declining to hold a hearing on standing when the assertions in the petitioner's affidavits, even if accepted as true, could not support a conclusion that the petitioner has standing.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2072\">\n    2018 ME 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497394\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/837/\">\n    186 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that, as is true here, where the standing determination will rest on the resolution of material facts that the parties have disputed in their affidavits, a hearing will be necessary to allow the court to hear from witnesses and evaluate evidence in order to adjudicate those contested facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b612] Thus, although the decision of whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing is within the sole discretion of the court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(2)(C), the conflicting facts presented by the parties' affidavits created bona fide issues of material fact relating to whether King \"behaved as though [Young] is a parent of the child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497394\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/837/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(3)(C).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351887\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/637/106/#p109\">\n    637 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (Me. 1994) (stating that \"the allowance of attorney fees and costs rests within the sole discretion of the Probate Court\" and that \"[t]he general standard of reviewing a Probate Court's decision on a request for fees ... is the 'abuse of discretion' standard\" (quotation marks omitted));\n   <em>\n    Most v.

For example, Young claims in his affidavit that King allowed the child to call him \"Dad\" or \"Daddy,\" King purchased Father's Day cards for the child to give to Young, and King allowed others in the community, such as the child's daycare provider, to understand Young to be the child's father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(2)(A).

For the first four years of this visitation schedule, when the child was with Young on the weekends and during extended visits, the child lived in the same house and in the same bedroom where she had spent the first three years of her adopted life in Limerick. Young had maintained the child's bedroom and took care of the child's cat following his split with King.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056489\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/1020/#p1024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(3)(B)-(D).

Up until April 2018, the child referred to Young as her father; in a birthday card sent from the child to Young on January 13, 2018, the child wrote: \"Happy birthday to a dad I love and a dad I will always love and I will never stop loving you DaD because I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056489\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/532/1020/#p1024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(C), (E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b624] Notwithstanding the presence of disputed facts, the above narrative of undisputed facts constitute sufficient prima facie evidence of all of the elements contained in \u00a7 1891(3). The focus must be on the relationship between Young and the child, not on the relationship between King and Young. It is undisputed that Young, King, and the child lived together as a family in Limerick, and the child considered Young to be her father. After King moved to Hampden with the child, this relationship continued. The seven years of visitation present in this case is no different than the relationship that is commonplace with divorce cases. There is no dispute that the child considered Young to be \"Daddy\" during those many years. For these reasons, Young has presented prima facie evidence to establish standing to bring a de facto parentage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b625] Standing is a preliminary hurdle that putative de facto parents must overcome to get their day in court where they must prove by clear and convincing evidence the elements pursuant to \u00a7 1891(3). Under the statute, a finding of standing in no way establishes those elements; it is simply a gatekeeping function to ensure that only legitimate cases of de facto parenthood proceed. After satisfying the standing requirement, the putative de facto parent must prove by clear and convincing evidence the necessary elements under \u00a7 1891(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b626] At this juncture of the case, the undisputed facts present a legitimate claim of de facto parentage.
