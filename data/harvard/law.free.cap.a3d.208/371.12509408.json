We do so being mindful of two primary considerations: (1) the Legislature has provided by statute that review of a revocation of a defendant's probation \"must be by appeal to the Law Court,\" 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1207(1) (2018) ; and (2) for that appeal to be meaningful, we must have a sufficiently well-developed record to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b62] In August 2016, after Jonathan Petgrave pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful possession of a scheduled drug (Class B), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1107-A(1)(A)(2) (2018), the trial court (Aroostook County,\n   <em>\n    Hunter, J.\n   </em>\n   ) entered a judgment and commitment imposing a sentence of three years' imprisonment with all but 120 days suspended, two years of probation, a $ 500 fine, and payment of $ 120 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] One year later, the State moved to revoke Petgrave's probation, alleging that he had committed a serious domestic violence assault. While that motion was pending, the State filed a second motion to revoke, alleging that Petgrave was unlawfully in possession of a firearm. Petgrave entered denials to both motions and counsel was appointed to represent him. The court (\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) then changed venue to Penobscot County on Petgrave's motion. On December 19, 2017, following an evidentiary hearing on the first motion to revoke, the court (\n   <em>\n    Campbell, J.\n   </em>\n   ) found that Petgrave had violated his probation. At a dispositional hearing the court fully revoked Petgrave's probation and ordered\n   that he serve the two years, eight months remaining on his underlying sentence. It declared the second motion to revoke moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Petgrave requested a certificate of probable cause to appeal pursuant to M.R. App. P. 19, asserting that there was insufficient evidence to establish either that he was on probation at the time of the alleged assault or that the assault occurred. We denied the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] While that request was pending, Petgrave, with new counsel, filed a petition for post-conviction review in the trial court alleging that his counsel had been ineffective at the revocation hearing in failing to call unspecified witnesses and in \"fail[ing] to present a proper defense.\" The court (\n   <em>\n    Anderson, J.\n   </em>\n   ) summarily dismissed the petition, determining that pursuant to 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2121(2) (2018), \"post-sentencing proceedings which are proper to challenge on post-conviction review do not include revocation of probation hearings.\" (Alterations and quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 70(b). The court concluded that Petgrave's remedy for any claim of error arising from the revocation hearing was to seek a discretionary appeal pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1207(1), as he had already done. Petgrave appealed from the summary dismissal of his petition and we granted a certificate of probable cause. M.R. App. P. 19(a)(2)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A. Petgrave's Right to Effective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] Petgrave asserts that beyond the bare right to have counsel represent him at the hearing, he had a due process right to the\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   assistance of counsel. The State agrees, as do we. The Legislature grants a person accused of violating probation the right to counsel, including the right to court-appointed counsel if the person is indigent, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1205-C(4) (2018),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we recently held in another context involving the potential deprivation of liberty that \"where a state statute affords an individual ... the right to counsel, the legislature could not have intended that counsel could be prejudicially ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Henry B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12330399\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/824/\">\n    2017 ME 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12330399\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/824/\">\n    159 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Applying the same rationale here, we conclude that Petgrave had the right to have counsel assist him effectively before his probation was revoked and he was subjected to further incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B. The\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] Petgrave next urges that the question of whether he received effective assistance at the revocation hearing should be answered by applying the two-part test first articulated by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), which applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at criminal trials,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fahnley v.

Statutory Construction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b69] The post-conviction review process, 15 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2121 - 2132 (2018), is, as the trial court concluded, unavailable in the case of a probation revocation. By statute, post-conviction review is available to review \"post-sentencing proceedings occurring during the course of sentences.\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2122. A probation revocation hearing would ordinarily qualify. The Legislature, however, has unambiguously said that \"revocation of probation\" is not a \"post-sentencing proceeding.\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2121(2). Accordingly, the post-conviction review process-which is, \"except for direct appeals from a criminal judgment, [the] exclusive method of review ... of post-sentencing proceedings,\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2122-is not an available mechanism for the defendant to seek a remedy in this case. For that reason, the trial court, correctly applying the statutory and case law existing at the time, dismissed Petgrave's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b610] The unavoidable conclusion that the post-conviction review process found in Title 15 is not available to Petgrave is reinforced in the Criminal Code, where the Legislature has declared that \"[r]eview of a revocation of probation ...\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be by [discretionary] appeal to the Law Court.\" 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1207(1) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 19(a)(2)(B). Having a discretionary appeal as the only available avenue for appellate review creates an insurmountable obstacle for Petgrave, however, because for more than twenty years we have maintained a bright-line rule that in a criminal context we will not consider claims of ineffective assistance on direct appeal, but rather will only consider such claims following a post-conviction review hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v. Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12007888\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/698/521/\">\n    1997 ME 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12007888\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/698/521/\">\n    698 A.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Troy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968716\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/1064/\">\n    2014 ME 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968716\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/1064/\">\n    91 A.3d 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). As a result of the prohibition in section 1207(1) and our holding in\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   , it would initially appear that Petgrave is deprived of an opportunity to obtain meaningful review, including an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his probation revocation matter. We must therefore look elsewhere to identify the avenue for such a claim to be pursued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   D. Habeas Corpus\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b611] \"The statutory remedy of post-conviction review, 15 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2121 - 2132, was intended to fully replace and implement the constitutional right of post-conviction habeas corpus as it pertains to a post-sentencing proceeding that occurs during the course of an offender's sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    James v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8186878\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/953/1152/\">\n    2008 ME 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8186878\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/953/1152/\">\n    953 A.2d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 2122 specifically states that post-conviction review \"replaces the remedies available pursuant to post-conviction habeas corpus, to the extent that review of a criminal conviction or proceedings were reviewable, [and] the remedies available pursuant to common law habeas corpus, including habeas corpus as recognized in Title 14, sections 5501 and 5509 to 5546.\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b612] Section 2122 further states that the post-conviction review chapter is \"construed to provide relief for those persons required to use this chapter as required by the Constitution of Maine, Article I, Section 10.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8186878\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/953/1152/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Article I, section 10 of the Maine Constitution states, in pertinent part, that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\n   <em>\n    shall not be suspended\n   </em>\n   , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\" (Emphasis added). Thus, where the writ of habeas corpus was available pursuant to article I, section 10 to protect fundamental rights-including the right to effective assistance of counsel-the rule of construction stated in section 2122 confirms that habeas corpus relief remains available for Petgrave because he is not a person who is \"required to use this chapter,\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2122, to address his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a probation revocation matter. We now discuss the specific procedure to be used in order to afford relief in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   E. Procedure for Raising an Ineffective Assistance Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613] Because Petgrave's claim is barred from both avenues in which we would ordinarily consider assertions of error occurring in a criminal proceeding-i.e., from post-conviction review by statute and from direct appeal by the\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   rule-we today recognize an exception to the broad rule articulated in\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   and hold that in the specific context of a discretionary appeal taken from a probation revocation judgment, a defendant may assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel using the procedure described below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The procedure we announce satisfies two important objectives, in that it affords a defendant fundamental fairness by allowing an ineffective assistance claim in the context of a probation revocation proceeding to be heard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hunt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12149036\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/911/\">\n    2016 ME 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12149036\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/911/\">\n    151 A.3d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he Due Process Clause prohibits deprivations of ... liberty ... without fundamental fairness\" (alteration and quotation marks omitted)), and it provides us with a fully-developed evidentiary record, similar to that resulting from a post-conviction review hearing, on which to consider such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b614] Rule 33 of the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure provides that a trial court \"on motion of the defendant may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of justice.\" We acknowledge that the rule is generally intended to be a vehicle to remedy injustices arising from the trial itself and is not explicitly directed at post-sentencing proceedings. That said, we conclude that in this circumstance of an individual whose probation has been revoked, the principles underlying Rule 33 justify the establishment of a process that affords a meaningful opportunity to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The motion must be filed within thirty-five days after the entry of the judgment, or within seventy days after the entry of the judgment if the motion is based on the ground of newly-discovered evidence. Those time limitations balance the defendant's need for an adequate opportunity to review the record of the hearing, possibly with new counsel, against \"legitimate state interests in promoting timely resolution of criminal charges [and] protecting the finality of judgments\" in a post-conviction matter.\n   <em>\n    Loi Van Ngo v.

Thus, by statute, the post-conviction review process, which is, \"except for direct appeals from a criminal judgment, [the] exclusive method of review ... of post-sentencing proceedings,\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2122 (2018), appears, at least superficially, to not be available to provide the petitioner a remedy in this case. However, and as we noted in\n   <em>\n    Kimball\n   </em>\n   , section 2122 further states that the post-conviction review chapter must be \"construed to provide ... relief for those persons required to use this chapter as is required by the Constitution of Maine, [a]rticle I, [s]ection 10.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7902438\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/490/653/\">\n    490 A.2d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b626] Where the writ of habeas corpus was available pursuant to article I, section 10 to protect fundamental rights, the rule of construction stated in section 2122 indicates that habeas corpus relief remains available and could not be eliminated by enactment of the post-conviction review laws.\n   <em>\n    Kimball\n   </em>\n   , our 1961\n   <em>\n    Opinion of the Justices\n   </em>\n   , and the post-conviction statute's own rule of construction require that the post-conviction review statutes be interpreted to provide the trial courts with a residue of authority to conduct an evidentiary hearing in the nature of a habeas corpus proceeding. This authority is preserved by Me. Const. article I, section 10, when an individual may be subject to restraint and ineffective assistance of counsel is alleged to have occurred in a probation revocation proceeding. No specific rule need be referenced to provide the petitioner such an evidentiary hearing, nor any\n   new process need be announced; the process is available as a matter of constitutional right, and has been for 200 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b627] Because the trial court summarily dismissed Petgrave's petition, apparently without recognizing its residual authority to afford Petgrave an evidentiary hearing in the nature of a habeas corpus proceeding, the trial court may have erred.
