We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history and facts, as alleged in the plaintiff's operative complaint or as undisputed in the record, are relevant to our resolution of the appeal. From about December 15, 2014 through August 19, 2015, Shames-who was at all relevant times a physician\n   employed by the University of Connecticut Health Center, of which the John Dempsey Hospital (hospital) is a part\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -provided medical care and treatment to the decedent, who was the plaintiff's fianc\u00e9e and domestic partner. The decedent died on October 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June, 2016, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-147,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff filed a notice of\n   claim with the Office of the Claims Commissioner seeking permission to sue the state for damages on the basis of injuries he claimed to have suffered, including emotional distress and loss of consortium, stemming from medical malpractice allegedly committed against the decedent by Shames and the hospital. By way of a memorandum of decision dated February 23, 2017, the Claims Commissioner, absent objection, authorized the plaintiff to sue the state for damages of up to $ 500,000 for alleged medical\n   malpractice by general surgeons or other similar health care providers who constitute state officers and employees, as defined by General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 4-141, of the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 26, 2017, the plaintiff, representing himself, commenced the present action against Shames and the hospital. In his original two count complaint, the plaintiff raised claims sounding in bystander emotional distress directed to Shames and the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 25, 2017, Shames and the hospital filed a motion to dismiss the action, which was accompanied by a separate memorandum of law, asserting that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's bystander emotional distress claims. Specifically, they asserted that the plaintiff's claim directed to Shames was barred by sovereign immunity and/or by statutory immunity pursuant to \u00a7 4-165, and that the plaintiff could not pursue a bystander emotional distress action in the absence of a wrongful death action commenced by the decedent's estate, which had not brought a wrongful death action or received authorization from the Claims Commissioner to commence such an action. In addition, Shames and the hospital argued that the plaintiff improperly had brought suit against the hospital because the plaintiff had received authorization from the Claims Commissioner to sue the state only. On October 11, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion to substitute the state as a party defendant in lieu of the hospital, which the trial court granted on October 24, 2017. On October 23, 2017, the plaintiff filed an objection and a separate memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to dismiss. On November 6, 2017, the defendants filed a reply brief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which they argued\n   additionally that the decedent's estate would be time barred from bringing a wrongful death action as a result of the expiration of the subject matter jurisdictional limitations period set forth in \u00a7 52-555.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 13, 2017, the plaintiff filed his operative two count complaint raising claims sounding in bystander emotional distress directed to each of the defendants. He alleged, inter alia, that Shames had administered ineffective treatments to the decedent for approximately eight months and that, notwithstanding the lack of improvement in her condition, Shames had failed to alter the course of the treatments or to take \"further diagnostic action as is consistent with standard practice,\" which constituted a substantial factor in the decedent's death. The plaintiff additionally alleged that he had been harmed by Shames' conduct and by the state's breach of its duty to the decedent to ensure that the state's agents, servants, and/or employees acted as \"reasonably prudent medical professionals.\" More particularly, the plaintiff alleged that he had sustained injuries stemming from his \"contemporary sensory perception of observing and/or experiencing the demise of the decedent, the decedent's suffering, the decedent's health deteriorating, the decedent's pain and suffering,\n   the administration of life support and, ultimately, [the decedent's] death ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 4, 2017, the court heard argument on the defendants' motion to dismiss. On February 9, 2018, the court granted the motion to dismiss. With respect to the plaintiff's bystander emotional distress claim directed to Shames, the court concluded that (1) to the extent that the plaintiff was suing Shames in Shames' official capacity as an employee of the hospital, which was an agent of the state, the plaintiff's claim was barred by sovereign immunity, and (2) to the extent that the plaintiff was suing Shames in Shames' individual capacity, the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory immunity pursuant to \u00a7 4-165. In addition, without limiting its analysis to the plaintiff's claim against the state, the court concluded that the plaintiff's bystander emotional distress \"claims\" were derivative claims that were not viable absent a predicate wrongful death action commenced by the decedent's estate, which had not commenced such an action and, as a result of the expiration of the limitations period set forth in \u00a7 52-555, could not commence such an action. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss is well settled.

Specifically, he asserts that the facts pleaded in his operative complaint were sufficient to demonstrate that Shames' conduct was reckless and, thus, that Shames was not protected by statutory immunity under \u00a7 4-165. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 4-165 (a) provides: \"No state officer or employee shall be personally liable for damage or injury, not wanton, reckless or malicious, caused in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment. Any person having a complaint for such damage or injury shall present it as a claim against the state under the provisions of this chapter.\" \"In other words, state employees may not be held personally liable for their negligent actions performed\n   within the scope of their employment.... State employees do not, however, have statutory immunity for wanton, reckless or malicious actions, or for actions not performed within the scope of their employment.

Shames' conduct in treating the decedent over the course of approximately eight months, as pleaded by the plaintiff in his operative complaint, did not \"[tend] to take on the aspect of highly unreasonable conduct, involving an extreme departure from ordinary care, in a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weiner\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20592\">\n    154 Conn.

In addition, the plaintiff's conclusory use of the terms \"reckless\" and \"recklessly\" in describing Shames' conduct was not sufficient to establish that Shames' actions were reckless.

A specific allegation setting out the conduct that is claimed to be reckless or wanton must be made.\").

Specifically, he asserts that (1) his claim against the state was viable as a freestanding claim and was not dependent on the existence of a predicate wrongful death action commenced by the decedent's estate, and (2) the court's dismissal of his claim was improper because his failure to join the decedent's estate in the\n   present\n   action did not implicate the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first turn to the plaintiff's contention that his bystander emotional distress claim against the state was not dependent on the existence of a wrongful death action brought by the decedent's estate but, rather, was viable as a freestanding claim. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's bystander emotional distress claim against the state was a derivative claim that could not be brought in the absence of a predicate wrongful death action commenced by the decedent's estate. We agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its decision granting the defendants' motion to dismiss, after concluding that the plaintiff's bystander emotional distress claim directed to Shames was barred by sovereign immunity and by statutory immunity, the court stated: \"Turning to [the plaintiff's] bystander emotional distress claims, the defendants argue that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over these claims because they are derivative of the wrongful death [action] that was not brought, and due to the expiration of the statute of limitations established by [ \u00a7 52-555 ], now cannot be brought on behalf of [the decedent's] estate.

[Our Supreme Court's] statement reflects the premise, which the plaintiff does not challenge, that an action for loss of consortium, although independent in form, is derivative of the injured spouse's cause of action .... Although the noninjured spouse has a right to choose whether to bring or to forgo a derivative consortium claim ... there is logical appeal to linking that right to an existing viable claim by the injured spouse.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

The court stated: \"It is inherent in the nature of a derivative claim that the scope of the claim is defined by the injury done to the principal. The party pursuing a derivative cause of action may have a claim for special damages arising out of that injury, but he may not redefine the nature of the underlying injury itself. In the ordinary physical injury case, a person pursuing a derivative claim may be unable to proceed if the injured spouse's rights were compromised by that spouse's comparative responsibility for the injury.... It follows that, in the case of medical malpractice, a person pursuing a derivative claim may be barred from bringing suit if the injured spouse gave informed consent to the professional procedure that caused the patient's condition to change.\" (Citations omitted.)

The court proceeded to note that the record did not disclose why the plaintiff's former spouse had declined to sue the defendant and surmised that the former spouse, inter alia, may not have believed that the defendant's treatment had injured her. Id., at 94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20347\">\n    735 A.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court stated: \"We are not prepared to hold that a derivative cause of action may proceed upon the mere possibility that the plaintiff's spouse may have sustained an injury that resulted from negligent or intentional misconduct on the part of a psychiatrist.... A derivative cause of action for loss of consortium does not confer surrogate authority on the noninjured spouse to pursue a claim that does not yet exist. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff cannot pursue an action for loss of consortium in the absence of any basis in the record for a finding that his former spouse was injured as a result of her treatment by the defendant.\" (Citation omitted.)
