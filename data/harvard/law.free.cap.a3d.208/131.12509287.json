Wood (Appellant) appeals from the judgment of sentence entered at Docket Number CP-06-CR-0001758-2017 (1758-2017) for failure to comply with registration requirements\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as required under Pennsylvania's Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the judgment of sentence entered at Docket Number CP-06-CR-0001382-2013 (1382-2013) following the revocation of his probation for failing to register pursuant to SORNA. Appellant argues that the application of SORNA to his case constituted an unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   punishment because he committed the sex offense to which he pled guilty at Docket Number 1382-2013 prior to SORNA's effective date. After careful consideration, we reverse Appellant's conviction for failure to comply with registration requirements and vacate his judgment of sentence at Docket Number 1758-2017. Additionally, we reverse the trial court's order finding Appellant in violation of probation and vacate the judgment of sentence imposed after the trial court revoked his probation at Docket Number 1382-2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 13, 2013, Appellant entered a negotiated guilty plea at Docket Number 1382-2013 to one count of statutory sexual assault\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   after his stepdaughter, who was under 14 years of age, reported that Appellant sexually abused her on three to four occasions in 2012, with the final incident occurring near the end of August of that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following Appellant's guilty plea, the trial court ordered Appellant to submit to an evaluation by the Sexual Offenders Assessment Board (SOAB). The SOAB determined that Appellant was not a sexually violent predator. Appellant, however, was classified as a Tier III sex offender under SORNA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9799.14(d)(3). On October 29, 2013, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 9 to 23 months of imprisonment followed by five years of probation. Additionally, as a Tier III offender, the trial court directed Appellant to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sex offender for the remainder of his life.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9799.15(a)(3). Appellant did not file a direct appeal from his judgment of sentence at Docket Number 1382-2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 31, 2017, while Appellant was still serving his sentence of probation at Docket Number 1382-2013, the trial court issued a bench warrant for Appellant's arrest for failing to comply with the conditions of his probation, namely, by failing to register as a sex offender pursuant\n   to SORNA. Appellant was subsequently arrested and charged at Docket Number 1758-2017 with one count of failure to comply with registration requirements and one count of failure to verify his address, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4915.1(a)(1), (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Appellant entered a negotiated plea of guilty at Docket Number 1758-2017 to a single count of failure to comply with registration requirements. The same day, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 18 months to 5 years of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court proceeded immediately to a hearing on Appellant's violation of probation on the underlying statutory sexual assault conviction at Docket Number 1382-2013, triggered by his failure to register under SORNA. Appellant waived his right to a formal\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gagnon II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing, and admitted to violating his probation by failing to register and by incurring a new conviction. The trial court entered an order finding him in violation of his probation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 6/29/17, at 7-8. The trial court revoked Appellant's probation and re-sentenced him to 18 to 60 months of imprisonment, concurrent with the sentence imposed for his conviction of failure to comply with registration requirements at Docket Number 1758-2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 19, 2017, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued its Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

On appeal, Appellant argued that his sentences at Docket Number 1758-2017, for failure to comply with registration requirements, and at Docket Number 1382-2013, for violation of his probation by failing to register under SORNA, were illegal in light of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Appellant asserted that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   declared SORNA's registration provisions punitive, and thus, the retroactive application of SORNA's registration provisions to Appellant when he committed sexual offenses prior to December 20, 2012 - SORNA's effective date - violated the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 20, 2018, this Court certified this case for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) In consideration of Appellant's having committed the relevant crimes in 2012, all prior to December 2012, whether the enactment date or the effective date of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\"), 42 Pa.C.S.[A.] \u00a7\u00a7 9799.10 - 9799.41, controls for purposes of offenses committed between\n   the enactment date and the effective date?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) Whether there is an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation to a defendant who is sentenced under SORNA for criminal acts committed after the enactment date of SORNA (December 20, 2011) but before the effective date of SORNA (December 20, 2012)?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) Whether this Court must address if the Act of Feb. 21, 2018, P.L. 27, No. 10 (HB 631 of 2017; \"Act 10\"), applies in the instant case and all cases governed by SORNA and, if so, whether Act 10 renders the registration provisions of SORNA non-punitive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) If Act 10 applies in the instant matter, whether Act 10's potential effects on Appellant, as a result of the crimes having been committed in 2012, but all before December 2012, violate the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Order Directing\n   <em>\n    En Banc\n   </em>\n   Certification, 4/20/18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin by addressing the first two issues, as they are dispositive of this appeal. Appellant argues that he should not be subject to SORNA's registration and reporting requirements. Appellant asserts that although the General Assembly enacted SORNA on December 20, 2011, prior to the time he committed his crimes in August 2012, SORNA did not go into effect until December 20, 2012. Therefore, Appellant contends that the application of SORNA to his case violates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

The Court concluded that SORNA violated\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibitions under both the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1223. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court reasoned that despite the legislature's designation of SORNA as a civil remedy, it was punitive in nature, and consequently, SORNA, as a criminal penalty, fell within the third\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Calder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   category (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , application of the statute would inflict greater punishment on the appellant than the law in effect at the time he committed his crimes).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1196, 1218. Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated the portion of the judgment of sentence that required the appellant to comply with SORNA. While\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is not a majority decision, the concurring opinion joins the Supreme Court's lead opinion to the extent it concludes that SORNA is punitive and that it was unconstitutional as applied to the appellant, in violation of both state and federal\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Like\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , this case implicates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions because application of SORNA's registration requirements would impose greater punishment on Appellant than the law in effect at the time he committed his crimes.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1195-96. Specifically, Appellant argues that his sentence for failure to comply with registration requirements was illegal pursuant to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends that at the time he committed the underlying offense of statutory sexual assault in August 2012, he would have been subject to then-effective Megan's Law III under which statutory sexual assault was not a registerable offense, rather than the lifetime registration and reporting requirements of SORNA.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 9795.1 (expired). Appellant asserts that the application of SORNA retroactively inflicted upon him a punishment greater than what he would have been subjected to under the law in effect at the time he committed the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, although his guilty plea and sentence for statutory sexual assault occurred after SORNA's effective date, Appellant contends that for purposes of an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   analysis, the date upon which the crime was committed is dispositive, and not the date of conviction, entry of a guilty plea, or sentencing. While his subsequent offense of failure to comply with registration requirements occurred after SORNA's effective date, he asserts that he cannot be found guilty of the offense of failure to register because the registration requirement itself was unconstitutional under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Consequently, he further argues that his sentence for violating his probation for failing to register is likewise illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Commonwealth counters that although SORNA became effective on December 20, 2012 (after Appellant committed his offenses), SORNA was enacted one year earlier on December 20, 2011 (before Appellant committed his offenses). Thus, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant had sufficient notice of SORNA's impending registration requirements at the time he committed his offenses, and consequently, there was no\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As Appellant argues, this Court has held that the critical inquiry for determining whether the application of SORNA to a convicted sex offender violates\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibitions is the date of the offense.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

If we relied on the enactment date as the trigger for application of SORNA, it could potentially result in different registration and reporting requirements for sex offenders who committed the exact same crime on the exact same day. If one of those offenders committed a sex offense in early 2012 and was convicted and sentenced prior to December 20, 2012, SORNA could not apply because it was not yet effective.

This improperly gives\n   effect only to the dates of the offenders' convictions and sentencing when we have explicitly held that the date of the offense is the relevant inquiry when determining whether an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation has occurred.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Horning\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501100\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/193/411/#p417\">\n    193 A.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To apply SORNA to offenders whose crimes were committed before its effective date would increase punishment for sexual offenses from the punishment which existed at the time of the offense.

The Majority tries to salvage\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   as being distinguishable from this case upon the basis that this Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was simply attempting to honor the legislature's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I would overrule\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety, because it is clear after today's holding that no part of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   opinion remains good law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority, however, distinguishes\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   because\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   addressed a statute that expressly applied only to offenders sentenced after its effective date. Thus, according to the Majority, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kizak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   decision honored the legislature's intent.
