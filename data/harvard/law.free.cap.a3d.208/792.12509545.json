We affirm the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b62] On August 14, 2012, a surgical oncologist at EMMC removed a noncancerous\n   polyp from Michael's colon. Michael was discharged from EMMC four days later, on August 18, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] On August 20, 2012, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Michael went to the EMMC emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. At 7:00 p.m., Michael was seen by the on-call surgeon-St. Jean. Because he believed Michael was suffering from a postoperative ileus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   St. Jean ordered a CT scan of Michael's abdomen to rule out the possibility of active bleeding or an anastomotic leak.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Michael had a CT scan taken of his abdomen at 9:30 p.m. Approximately one hour later, a radiologist interpreted the results of the CT scan and concluded that there was evidence of moderate to severe abdominal ascites,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which were \"concerning for developing infection versus phlegmonous\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   changes.\" The report was faxed to EMMC at 10:37 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] At approximately 8:00 the following morning, August 21, 2012, Olivos reviewed the CT scan of Michael's abdomen taken the previous night. In his report, Olivos identified pelvic ascites, noted some dots of air in the ascites near the liver, and also stated that \"[t]here [were] no findings to suggest an anastomotic leak.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] At approximately 9:40 p.m. on August 21, 2012, Michael was observed by a second surgeon-one of St. Jean's partners-to have fast, shallow breathing, pain, and a distended and tender abdomen; based on these symptoms, this second surgeon determined that Michael's condition warranted immediate exploratory surgery. She began the surgery at 10:55 p.m. and, in the course of that surgery, discovered a small anastomotic leak, which she believed had infected the fluid and blood in the abdomen, causing Michael's \"septic state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] After this second surgery, Michael was hospitalized until October 1, 2012. While hospitalized, Michael was intubated for a prolonged period of time and eventually underwent a tracheostomy. Michael also developed deep venous thrombosis and was diagnosed with a stroke during the hospitalization at EMMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Procedure\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] In May of 2015, the Holmeses filed notice of their professional negligence claim against EMMC, St. Jean, Northeast\n   Surgery of Maine, Spectrum, and Olivos\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Superior Court (Penobscot County) pursuant to the Maine Health Security Act (MHSA), 24 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2501 - 2988 (2018), alleging one count of medical malpractice in connection with the complications that Michael suffered after he arrived at EMMC on August 20, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   24 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2853, 2903 ; M.R. Civ. P. 80M(b). On November 18, 2016, a hearing was held before the prelitigation screening panel at which all parties introduced evidence and presented expert witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2854 ; M.R. Civ. P. 80M(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] On December 15, 2016, the Holmeses filed their complaint for medical malpractice against St. Jean and Olivos in the Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2859. After the completion of discovery, Olivos and St. Jean each separately moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 56. In the documents filed in support of, and in opposition to, the motions, the parties referred to the deposition testimony of the general surgeon and neurologist whom the Holmeses had designated as expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b610] At his deposition, the general surgeon testified that had the anastomotic leak been identified and treated during the evening of August 20, 2012, some harm to Michael could have been avoided, including the prolonged hospitalization, prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, and deep venous thrombosis. Specifically, he testified that it was \"more likely than not\" that Michael \"would have had fewer postoperative complications\" had the second surgery occurred twenty-four hours earlier, at approximately 8:00 p.m. on August 20, 2012. The neurologist testified at his deposition that had the second surgery occurred sooner, it was more likely than not that Michael could have avoided the stroke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b611] After a hearing, by order dated May 21, 2018, the court denied St. Jean's motion, but granted Olivos's motion. In its order granting a summary judgment for Olivos, the trial court referred to the deposition testimony from the Holmeses' expert witnesses. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, Dr. Olivos did not become involved in the matter until well after the time [the surgical expert] testified was critical to avoiding ... some of the significant complications suffered by Mr. Holmes. On this record, the Court concludes that plaintiffs cannot adequately establish through expert testimony that it is more likely than not that any negligence attributable to Dr. Olivos and Spectrum Medical Group caused harm to Mr. Holmes....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   To be clear, however, the Court does not accept, and does not rule, that the passage of 8:00 pm on August 20, 2012 was an absolute \"cut off\" point for the establishment of adequate causation. The standard to be applied is \"more likely than not.\" Sepsis brought on by the kind of bowel leak at issue here is clearly a progressive condition with worsening effects, as plaintiffs' expert has\n   testified, and medical intervention would be warranted sooner than later. The Court simply concludes that the involvement of Dr. Olivos is too removed in space and time, well after a period plaintiffs' expert testified was a critical juncture, such that it is unreasonable to allow a jury to make the requisite finding of proximate cause. The Court believes a jury's deliberation on the involvement of Dr. Olivos would venture into the realm of conjecture or speculation disapproved of in\n   <em>\n    Merriam.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merriam\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

On June 21, 2018, the jury returned a verdict for St. Jean,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one week later the court entered a judgment on the verdict. The Holmeses timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1851 (2018) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b613] The Holmeses argue that the court erred in granting Olivos's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Holmeses assert that there was \"evidence in the record upon which a factfinder could reasonably decide that Dr. Olivos'[s] negligent reading of the critical CT scan caused delay in necessary treatment\" and that this delay was a proximate cause of Michael's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b614] \"We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, and consider both the evidence and any reasonable inferences that the evidence produces in the light most favorable to the party against whom the summary judgment has been granted in order to determine if there is a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Grant v.

Evidence is sufficient to support a finding of proximate cause in the medical malpractice context if the evidence and inferences that may reasonably be drawn from it indicate that (1) the defendant's negligent conduct played a substantial part in causing the injury, and (2) the injury was either a direct result or a reasonably foreseeable consequence of that conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b618] Here, the trial court correctly determined that, based on the undisputed facts, the Holmeses failed to establish a prima facie case for negligence against Olivos. Michael's anastomotic leak began before he arrived at EMMC's emergency room on August 20, 2012. Olivos did not review the CT scan of Michael's abdomen until 8:00 a.m. on August 21, 2012; this was approximately fifteen hours after Michael arrived at EMMC and approximately twelve hours after the time identified by the Holmeses' surgical expert-8:00 p.m. on August 20, 2012-when the surgery needed to have been completed in order to avoid Michael's postoperative complications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b619] Although the trial court, quite properly, did not take 8:00 p.m. on August 20, 2012, as the absolute point in time for the establishment of adequate causation, the experts' opinions-including the statements by the Holmeses' surgical expert-informed the court's decision and must inform ours. In the Holmeses' opposing statements of material facts filed in response to Olivos's statements of material facts and motion for summary judgment, the Holmeses repeatedly referred to their own surgical expert's deposition. In those statements, the Holmeses asserted as undisputed facts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [the expert] clearly testified that, more likely than not, because the medical condition was progressive and developing, effectively a sliding scale applied wherein surgery performed earlier than [the second surgeon's] actual surgery would have had some benefit in terms of improving the potential for a better outcome, or as [the expert] stated, the \"sooner the better.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Holmeses also referred to the deposition testimony of their neurology expert. Crucially, however, the Holmeses do not cite to any record evidence showing that these experts explained what role, if any, Olivos's allegedly negligent reading of the CT scan played in the development of Michael's postoperative complications. Although the Holmeses are correct that \"absolute certainty\" is not required,\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   evidence is, and the record presented is\n   insufficient to provide any basis for a determination that Olivos's conduct played a role in Michael's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b620] Nearly twenty years ago, we stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [R]easonable foreseeability does not equal causation. To support a finding of proximate cause, there must be some evidence indicating that a foreseeable injury did in fact result from the negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Proximate cause is generally a question of fact for the jury, but the court has a duty to direct a verdict for the defendant if the jury's deliberation rests only on speculation or conjecture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   For purposes of our analysis here, [the doctor's] negligence is established. We assume also that [the doctor's] negligence created a reasonably foreseeable risk of [the patient's] damages. The issue is whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that it is more likely than not that [the doctor's] negligence played a substantial part in bringing about [the patient's] extended period of pain and [damages].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Merriam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243509\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/757/778/\">\n    2000 ME 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243509\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/757/778/\">\n    757 A.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).
