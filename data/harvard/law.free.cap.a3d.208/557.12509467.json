The plaintiff, Cranston Police Retirees Action Committee (CPRAC or plaintiff), initiated this litigation against the City of Cranston (the City), Mayor Allan Fung, and the members of the Cranston City Council (collectively, defendants), alleging a litany of claims ranging from constitutional violations to statutory infringements. A Superior Court justice, sitting without a jury in a trial held over six days in November 2015, found in favor of the defendants on all counts. The plaintiff now raises several issues for our consideration related to the trial justice's rulings on an assortment of motions and her findings of fact and conclusions of law. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n </history>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1937, the City established a pension fund for members of its police and fire departments. By the mid-1980s, the pension fund had become a significant financial concern. In the early 1990s, Mayor Michael Traficante met with police and firefighter union leaders in an attempt to address the problem. Ultimately, in 1996, the City passed two ordinances based on an agreement reached with the unions, creating a two-tiered pension system (the 1996 ordinances). The 1996 ordinances, No. 96-54 for firefighters and No. 96-56 for police officers, provided that all members of the police and fire departments hired\n   after July 1, 1995, would be enrolled in the state's pension system. Additionally, those members with five or fewer years of service could elect to stay in the City's pension plan or enroll in the state's pension system. For the members remaining in the City's pension plan, the 1996 ordinances provided for a minimum 3 percent compounded COLA, or, alternatively, a percentage equal to that of a contractual increase for active members. The unions bargained for this COLA to match the benefits that were being offered under the state's pension plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The fiscal issues related to the City's pension plan did not subside with the passage of the 1996 ordinances. By July 1, 1999, the unfunded accrued liability of the City's pension plan exceeded more than $ 169 million. The City's pension liability remained an issue throughout the early 2000s. Mayor John O'Leary, who succeeded Mayor Traficante, borrowed against the pension fund in his final year in office to pay the then-retirees' health care costs and base pensions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When Mayor Fung took office in 2009, the City was in \"dire\" fiscal condition. At that time, Cranston faced a severe economic recession that was affecting all parts of the country. As such, the City experienced high unemployment rates and over $ 1 billion in decreased property values. Moreover, state aid decreased substantially between 2007 and 2011, and two devastating floods in the spring of 2010 also inflicted a financial toll on the City. In order to improve its financial situation, the City made cuts to personnel, eliminated city vehicles, and increased health care co-shares for its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, the General Assembly passed the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act (RIRSA), G.L. 1956 chapter 65 of title 45, legislation focused on promoting the sustainability of municipal pension systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-65-2. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-65-4, a municipality's pension plan would be in \"critical status\" if \"as determined by its actuary, as of the beginning of the plan year, a plan's funded percentage for such plan year is less than sixty percent (60%).\" A municipality administering a plan in \"critical status\" is required, under RIRSA, (1) to give notice of such status to plan participants and other listed individuals and entities and (2) to submit a funding improvement plan detailing the municipality's strategy for emerging from that status. Section 45-65-6. A commission within the Department of Revenue that had been set up under the statute established guidelines for the funding improvement plans, suggesting that, \"[g]enerally, the funding improvement period should not exceed 20 years with the plan emerging from critical status within that timeframe.\" Municipalities not in compliance with the statute faced a reduction in state aid. Section 45-65-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mayor Fung's administration analyzed the health of the City's pension system during his first term. By June 30, 2011, the unfunded accrued liability of the pension plans had risen to $ 256 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2012, the pension system was funded at only 16.9 percent, meeting the definition for \"critical status\" pursuant to \u00a7 45-65-4. In accordance with \u00a7 45-65-6, Mayor Fung sent a\n   letter to all pensioners enrolled in the City's pension system informing them of the \"critical status.\" The City next put together an \"alternative funding improvement plan consistent with the [requirements of \u00a7 45-65-6].\" In doing so, the City considered a number of options, including raising taxes, cutting more personnel, and eliminating city services. Additionally, in September 2012, Mayor Fung met with City pensioners to keep them apprised of the pension situation and also to propose a ten-year COLA suspension as the preferred method of raising the plan from critical status. Thereafter, Mayor Fung presented the COLA suspension plan to the City Council in two proposed ordinances in October 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after, Mayor Fung withdrew the proposed ordinances in favor of negotiations with the plan participants, and, in the months that followed, he met with the police and firefighter unions and persons who represented the City's police and firefighter retirees. After meeting with the unions and retirees, the City's actuaries ran twenty to thirty additional scenarios for plans to lift the pension system from critical status. Ultimately, however, the City enacted two ordinances on April 23, 2013 (the 2013 ordinances)-No. 2013-5, governing police retirees, and No. 2013-6, governing fire retirees-suspending the minimum 3 percent COLA for ten years, beginning July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the passage of the 2013 ordinances, The Cranston Police Department Retirees Association, Inc., and Local 1363 Retirees Association filed suit against the City on behalf of retirees enrolled in the City's pension plan, alleging that the 2013 ordinances violated the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The parties reached a settlement agreement, and a final consent judgment was entered in December 2013. The agreement provided for a COLA suspension in alternating years for ten years, and a 1.5 percent COLA payment in years eleven and twelve. Each retiree was given the opportunity to opt out of the settlement agreement and to retain the right to pursue civil claims against the City. The members of CPRAC are retirees enrolled in the City's pension system who opted out of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Pretrial Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 28, 2013, plaintiff filed an eight-count complaint in Superior Court against the City, Mayor Fung, and the members of the Cranston City Council.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint included allegations of violations of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, a state statute, and breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants filed a motion to\n   dismiss six of the eight counts, as well as an answer to the complaint. The trial justice granted defendants' motion to dismiss in part, dismissing counts VI and VIII of the complaint. During the course of discovery, defendants filed a motion for a protective order to prevent plaintiff from deposing city councilmember John Lanni, Jr. On September 15, 2015, the trial justice granted defendants' motion on the basis that Lanni enjoyed the privilege of legislative immunity, and that the topics about which plaintiff sought to question Lanni were related to his position as a legislator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the month prior to trial, the parties filed several motions for summary judgment. On October 9, 2015, the Non-City defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all remaining counts. One week later, the City filed a motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff's Takings Clause claim. The plaintiff filed its own motion for summary judgment on October 19, 2015, seeking summary judgment on its claims based on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and on the violation of the Rhode Island Open Meetings Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 46 of title 42 (the OMA). The City also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and OMA counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial justice heard arguments on all four summary judgment motions at a hearing held on November 2, 2015. On that same day, the trial justice issued a decision from the bench, granting summary judgment in favor of the Non-City defendants on all counts, and in favor of the City as to\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and the Takings Clause claim. The trial justice reserved judgment on the OMA claim until November 6, 2015, when she rendered a bench decision granting summary judgment in favor of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The City had also filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to determine the appropriate burden of proof for the Contract Clause claim. The trial justice heard arguments on this motion at the November 2, 2015 hearing, and rendered a bench decision on November 6, 2015. The trial justice relayed that she would employ a burden-shifting analysis on part of the Contract Clause analysis, with specific burdens of production on each party at each stage of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Those amounts were repaid to the pension fund the following year.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    One of the biggest factors contributing to this unfunded liability of the plan was historic underfunding of the plan due to the City's failure to pay 100 percent of its annual required contribution (ARC). Mayor Fung testified that the ARC is the amount that the City is supposed to contribute to the pension plan as determined by City actuaries \"after reviewing the plan, all the plan participants, the funding of the plan, [and] the investments[.]\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    The complaint named John Lanni, Jr., Donald Botts, Jr., Mario Aceto, Michael J. Farina, Michael W. Favicchio, Paul H. Archetto, Richard D. Santamaria, Jr., Sarah Kales Lee, and Steven A. Stycos, in their capacity as members of the Cranston City Council. The named members of the city council, along with Mayor Fung, will be referred to hereafter as the \"Non-City\" defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    In count I, plaintiff sought a declaration that the 2013 ordinances violated the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The plaintiff alleged a breach of contract claim and constitutional violation of the Takings Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions in count II. In count III, plaintiff alleged that the enactment of the 2013 ordinances by the mayor and city council members was facially unconstitutional, and sought a declaratory judgment to that effect. Count IV of the complaint alleged that the enactment of the 2013 ordinances was barred by the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    and that the ordinances were thus void\n    <em>\n     ab initio\n    </em>\n    . Count V of the complaint asked for equitable or injunctive relief. In counts VI and VII, plaintiff alleged a violation of civil rights pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and 1988, and the Open Meetings Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 46 of title 42, respectively. Finally, in count VIII, plaintiff alleged that defendants violated the fiduciary duty owed to retirees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Three days before trial, the City sought leave to amend its answer to the complaint to specifically deny some of plaintiff's allegations and to formally add an affirmative defense. The City contended that these amendments would simply ensure that its pleading conformed to the positions that it had taken throughout the litigation and to evidence the City intended to introduce during the upcoming trial. The trial justice granted the City's motion to amend on the morning the trial began, over plaintiff's objection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     Trial\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    On November 9, 2015, the first day of trial, three counts of plaintiff's complaint remained: violation of the Contract Clause, breach of contract, and injunctive relief. Sixteen witnesses testified over the course of five days. Their testimony is summarized below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The plaintiff presented testimony from nine members of CPRAC, two former Cranston mayors, and an actuary, who provided expert testimony. The City presented testimony from the current mayor, the City's finance director, an actuary, and a current Cranston firefighter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Glenn Gilkenson, president of CPRAC, testified first. Gilkenson retired from the Cranston Police Department in 2008 after twenty-five years of service. Gilkenson testified that, according to the collective bargaining agreement under which he retired, he received a pension and COLA adjustments. According to Gilkenson, after the 2013 ordinances passed, he spoke to a few retired police officers and firefighters who were in the same situation, and they decided to form a nonprofit organization, CPRAC, to fight the suspension of their COLA benefits. Gilkenson testified that CPRAC started with seventy-five members, and, at the time of trial, had seventy-one members. Gilkenson testified that it was CPRAC's policy and strategy to not negotiate with the City with respect to a reduction of the COLA, and he also stated that the COLA freeze had impacted his personal finances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Following Gilkenson's testimony, plaintiff presented eight other members of CPRAC as witnesses over the course of the first two days of trial: retired firefighter Vincent Matrumalo and retired police officers Edward Walsh, William Lynch, David Greene, Robert Davies, Charles Galligan, Edward Evans, and Vincent Maccarone. Similar to Gilkenson's testimony, these CPRAC members consistently testified that they had believed they would receive COLA benefits for life, and that the suspension of the COLA benefit had a significant financial impact on their lives. Each of the CPRAC members' collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) were admitted as trial exhibits. Each CBA, beginning in 1997, provided for COLAs to the pension benefits at a rate of at least 3 percent, compounded on July 1 of each year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The plaintiff then called Michael Traficante, mayor of Cranston from 1985-1999, to the stand. Mayor Traficante testified that he became aware of the City's pension crisis as early as 1984, when he served as city council president. He further testified about negotiations with the police and firefighter unions in the mid-1990s to address the pension crisis. According to Mayor Traficante, the City explored many alternatives to address the pension liability aside from moving the pensioners into the state system, including a pension bond or supplemental tax, but ultimately decided that moving the pensioners into the state system was the best course of action. The plaintiff also called Mayor Traficante's successor, John O'Leary, to testify. Mayor O'Leary served as mayor from 1999 until 2003. Mayor O'Leary testified that, in his final year as mayor, he borrowed money from the fire and police pension fund as a one-time allocation to pay for retirees' health care costs, and that the debt was repaid the following year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The City's current mayor, Allan Fung, took the stand next, having been called by defendants. Mayor Fung testified that, just after he took office in 2009, he examined the City's fiscal condition and discovered that it was \"very dire.\" According to Mayor Fung, the economic recession of the late 2000s had taken a toll on the City, as it had on other cities across the country, and made it difficult for the City to raise revenue. Additionally, Mayor Fung testified, the City experienced two devastating floods in 2010, and state aid decreased dramatically in the first few years of his administration-by $ 18 million between 2007 and 2011. Mayor Fung testified that he felt that if the City did not address the financial crisis, Chapter 9 bankruptcy \"could be a very real possibility[.]\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Mayor Fung further testified about the critical status of the City's pension system as of 2011, stating that, at its lowest point, the system was funded at only 16.9 percent, with $ 256 million of unfunded\n    accrued liability. He testified that a combination of factors led to this situation, including the compounded COLAs for municipal retirees and historic underfunding of the entire municipal pension system. Mayor Fung testified that his administration considered many alternatives to determine the best solution for emerging from \"critical status\" within the twenty-year guideline. In addition to a ten-year suspension of the COLA, Mayor Fung testified, the City implemented wage freezes, layoffs of City employees, tax increases, health care co-share increases, and expense reduction, in order to raise revenue during its financial crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Robert Strom, finance director for the City, testified next for defendants. Strom reiterated Mayor Fung's statements that the City had suffered a financial crisis during the first few years of the Fung administration. Strom further testified that he believed that the City would face serious consequences if the twenty-year guideline for emerging from \"critical status\" was not met, including reduced or eliminated state funds, which were instrumental to the City's budget. Strom also testified that raising taxes on the City's residents would not resolve the pension system's problems because the City would need to raise taxes so substantially that it would have been unfair and unsustainable, considering the fact that the City already had one of the highest tax rates in the state.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The plaintiffs called their retained expert, William Fornia, to the stand on the penultimate day of trial.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Fornia testified that he is an actuary by profession and had been a pension consultant for several large consulting firms for many years prior to starting his own company. Fornia testified that, based on his expert analysis of the actuarial reports commissioned by the City, the COLA suspension caused an average loss of $ 210,000 per retiree. Fornia further testified that the City's pension problems were foreseeable and predictable, and that the City had not chosen the least drastic remedy available when it chose to suspend the COLAs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    After the plaintiff rested, the City called two more witnesses to conclude the testimony at trial: expert witness Daniel Sherman, an actuary, and Paul Valletta, Jr., a current Cranston firefighter and president of the firefighters' union. Sherman rebutted some of plaintiff's expert's conclusions, particularly with respect to the pension system's shortfall calculation and the COLA change alternatives. Valletta testified about the negotiations between Mayor Fung and the unions and retirees prior to the passage of the ordinances. The trial ended on November 17, 2015.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    On July 22, 2016, the trial justice issued a written decision resolving, in favor of the City, the claims for violation of the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, breach of contract, and injunctive relief. The details of her decision that are salient to the issues plaintiff raises on appeal will be discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    . Final judgment in favor of all defendants was entered on August 4, 2016.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     Posttrial Motions\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Following entry of final judgment, the City filed a motion for costs. The plaintiff objected and filed a motion to stay consideration of the bill of costs until plaintiff's appeal was decided by this Court. The trial justice heard argument on the motions on October 13, 2016, when she summarily denied\n    plaintiff's motion to stay and awarded costs to the City in the amount of $ 9,717.85.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     Issues on Appeal\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Before this Court, plaintiff challenges several pretrial decisions, some of the trial justice's findings and conclusions after trial, and the posttrial award of costs in favor of the City.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Specifically, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) finding that the 2013 ordinances did not violate the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions; (2) misapplying the burden of proof in the Contract Clause analysis; (3) misconceiving and misapplying expert testimony; (4) granting summary judgment in favor of the City as to the Takings Clause,\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    , and OMA claims; (5) granting defendants' motion for a protective order as to Councilmember Lanni; (6) granting summary judgment in favor of the Non-City defendants on all counts; (7) granting the City's motion to amend its answer shortly before trial; and (8) summarily dismissing plaintiff's motion to stay and granting, in part, the City's motion for costs. We will take each issue in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     Contract Clause\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The trial justice concluded that the 2013 ordinances suspending plaintiff's members' COLAs did not violate the Contract Clauses of the United States or Rhode Island Constitutions. Before this Court, plaintiff claims two errors as to the trial justice's Contract Clause analysis. First, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in the determination and application of the burden of proof at trial. Second, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in ultimately finding in favor of the City on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    This Court has held that we \"will apply a\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    standard of review to questions of law that may implicate a constitutional right.\"\n    <em>\n     Goetz v.

When the trial justice ruled on the City's motion\n    <em>\n     in limine\n    </em>\n    regarding the burden of proof for plaintiff's Contract Clause claim, she set out the following rubric: (1) \"[p]laintiff bears the burden of production in establishing [whether the state law has substantially impaired a contract] beyond a reasonable doubt\"; (2) if plaintiff meets that burden, \"the burden of production shifts to the defendant to prove\" that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary to fulfill a significant and legitimate public purpose; and (3) \"[t]hereafter, a plaintiff may, of course, rebut with evidence that the legislation was not reasonable and necessary * * * beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The trial justice further stated that the City's burden with respect to demonstrating a reasonable and necessary legitimate public purpose would be satisfied by credible evidence. The trial justice also stated that she would use a \"less deference\" standard in evaluating the City's argument whether the legislation was reasonable or necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    On appeal, plaintiff asserts that, despite her articulated rubric, the trial justice gave \"nearly complete deference\" to the City regarding the degree and necessity of the contractual impairment. The plaintiff argues that the City should have been required to demonstrate, at the very least, a preponderance of the evidence, rather than \"credible evidence,\" regarding its justification for the impairment; and plaintiff contends that the correct standard in this case should actually be clear and convincing evidence. For its part, the City argues that the trial justice should not have shifted the burden of production at all, but that she ultimately reached the correct conclusion.

In her decision following trial, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff had met its burden of establishing that the 2013 ordinances substantially impaired the contractual rights of plaintiff's members beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial justice specifically found that the 3 percent COLA was a vested right under the contract,\n    and that the \"cumulative impact [of the 2013 ordinances] to the individual was substantial.\" Moreover, the trial justice found that the City had demonstrated a significant legitimate public purpose: \"to remedy the fiscal emergency and keep at bay threatened cuts in state aid which would inexorably worsen the fiscal situation.\" The trial justice also concluded that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary, finding that the City presented sufficient evidence that it had considered alternatives, a more moderate course was not available, and the 2013 ordinances were reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances because they were \"circumscribed, temporary, precipitated by a fiscal emergency, and prospective.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The City argues that the trial justice erred in concluding that plaintiff proved the existence of a contractual right and that, therefore, the 2013 ordinances could not have substantially impaired a contractual obligation.

However, the evidence at trial demonstrates that the City's predicament grew out of more than its continued contractual obligations under CBAs and its failure to\n    adequately fund the pension system.

The trial justice listened to the testimony of several witnesses-whom she deemed credible-who testified to that effect. Indeed, Mayor Fung testified that the City considered raising taxes, making more cuts to city personnel, and drastically reducing city services. Mayor Fung also testified that, in order to meet the City's obligations under the funding improvement plan with these alternative measures, the budget cuts or tax raise would need to be significant.

The 2013 ordinances did not eliminate the COLA benefit altogether, and only affected COLAs not yet made available to retirees.

The City also argues that, because this was a bench trial, plaintiff was not harmed if, in fact, the trial justice elevated form over substance, because she ultimately weighed the testimony.

The trial justice first indicated that she gave weight to Fornia's opinion that the loss caused by the ordinance was material.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    As to his opinion about the significant and legitimate public purpose of the 2013 ordinances, the trial justice gave Fornia's testimony \"little weight\" and clearly articulated the problems she saw in his calculations relating to his testimony on this issue. Finally, the trial justice gave no weight to Fornia's opinion that the City did not choose the least drastic alternative, stating: \"Mr. Fornia's opinion did not consider the feasibility of raising taxes, the decline in state aid, or RIRSA's requirements. * * * As such, this opinion is unsupported.\" The trial justice, sitting without a jury, was entitled to make credibility determinations and weigh the evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gregoire\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800425\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/182/#p191\">\n     138 A.3d at 191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

While we note that there were many objections as to the form of questions and as to evidentiary foundation during trial, it did not appear that Fornia's testimony was substantively limited in any significant way. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial justice's handling of the plaintiff's expert at trial, or in her analysis of his testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     Takings Clause\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    One month prior to trial, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's Takings Clause claim. In support of their motion, defendants argued that plaintiff's members did not have a \"constitutionally protected property interest in a lifetime, uninterrupted three-percent COLA.\" The defendants further argued that, even if plaintiff's members had a constitutionally-protected interest, the 2013 ordinances temporarily suspending their annual COLA did not constitute a taking. In its objection to the motion, plaintiff asserted that issues of material fact precluded summary disposition as to this particular claim. The trial justice issued a decision from the bench following a hearing, concluding that \"a COLA is a vested benefit\" and therefore was a property right for the purpose of the Takings Clause. Ultimately, however, the trial justice found that \"the changes to the plaintiff's COLA benefits do not constitute an illegal taking[,]\" and she granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in ruling that no unconstitutional taking occurred. The plaintiff argues that the trial justice improperly treated the COLA benefits as \"unearned future compensation, or some type of state-created entitlement\" and further incorrectly analyzed the issue as a regulatory taking as opposed to a physical taking. The plaintiff also argues that genuine issues of material fact as to the City's subjective intent and the ordinances' impact, necessity, and superfluity should have precluded the entry of summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The defendants counter that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the 2013 ordinances \"were prospective, temporary, impaired only a portion of the benefits provided under the collective bargaining agreements, and were part of a larger public program seeking to stabilize the City's finances,\" and thus the trial justice did not err in granting summary judgment. Additionally, defendants argue that plaintiff did not demonstrate a disputed material fact with respect to the City's legislative findings supporting the ordinances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    It is well settled that \"[t]his Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    , employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.\"\n    <em>\n     Cancel v.

Indeed, the trial justice found, as part of her Contract Clause analysis, and we agree, that the cumulative impact of the COLA suspension on CPRAC's members was significant.

The City did not \"physically invade or permanently appropriate any of the [retirees'] assets for its own use.\"\n    <em>\n     Connolly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200102\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/211/#p225\">\n     475 U.S. at 225\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200102\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/211/#p225\">\n     106 S.Ct. 1018\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, the government action was motivated by a critical need to improve the health of the City's pension system. Indeed, the legislative findings codified in the 2013 ordinances state that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    \"It is in the best interests of residents, individual employees, retirees and beneficiaries of the City of Cranston to maintain a viable and sustainable local police and fire pension plan and to develop a reasonable alternative funding improvement plan to emerge from 'critical status' as required by Rhode Island General Laws section 45-65-6.\" Providence Code of Ordinances \u00a7 2013-6 (Apr. 23, 2013).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Thus, given that it is undisputed that the 2013 ordinances effectuate only a limited suspension of a small part of the overall pension retirement benefits, and that the 2013 ordinances were prospective, we agree with the trial justice that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's Takings Clause claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    <strong>\n     D\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Res Judicata\n     </em>\n     &amp; Estoppel\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Prior to trial, plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the count of its complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the 2013 ordinances were void\n    <em>\n     ab initio\n    </em>\n    because prior litigation challenging changes made to retiree pension benefits through ordinances enacted by the City in 2003 precluded future legislative changes to pensions made outside the collective bargaining process.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    The plaintiff in the\n    instant case alleged in its complaint-and argued in its summary judgment motion-that the Superior Court's decision in the prior litigation (the 2005 decision) meant that the 2013 ordinances were void from their inception based on the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    . The defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the 2005 decision was not binding on the trial justice and that\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    did not apply to the present dispute. After the hearing on these cross-motions, the trial justice concluded that\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    did not apply to the enactment of the 2013 ordinances, denied plaintiff's motion, and granted defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Before us, plaintiff switches the focus of its preclusion claim, arguing that collateral estoppel bars defendants from defending the 2013 ordinances because the 2005 decision clearly stated that defendants could modify retirees' benefits only through a collective bargaining process. The plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred by allowing defendants to relitigate the issue of whether pension benefits could be changed through ordinances rather than through a collective bargaining process. The plaintiff also asserts that there are no meaningful distinctions between the instant litigation and the prior litigation. The defendants, for their part, argue that the issues are different in the instant litigation as compared to the prior litigation because the two sets of ordinances do not change the pension benefits in the same way and the cases were litigated on different legal principles. The defendants also assert that the 2005 decision cannot be applied to prospectively restrain the City from exercising its police powers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    As we have stated earlier in this opinion, we review an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cancel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497610\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/187/347/#p349\">\n     187 A.3d at 349\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We begin and end our discussion of this issue by concluding that plaintiff's collateral estoppel argument is not properly before us. The plaintiff's claim in its complaint, as well as its argument in connection with its motion for summary judgment, focused exclusively on\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    , and the trial justice resolved the parties' cross-motions after considering the arguments set forth regarding\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    . There is no indication that the trial justice also considered the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

Because plaintiff did not raise the doctrine of collateral estoppel before the trial justice and does not argue the principles of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    before us on appeal, plaintiff's arguments challenging the trial justice's decision on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on this claim are not properly before us.

The plaintiff alleged-and provided uncontroverted evidence-that the Attorney General's office had concluded that the Cranston City Council had indeed violated the OMA by entertaining new business during the March 25, 2013 meeting, when the agenda had not listed any items under the \"new business\" heading. The defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff did not have statutory standing to bring the OMA violation claim in Superior Court. The defendants also argued that the proposed changes to the ordinances were not discussed or enacted at the March 25 meeting, and therefore\n    there was no harm from failing to include this item on the printed agenda.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The trial justice heard oral argument on this issue at the summary judgment hearing on November 2, 2015, and rendered a decision from the bench on November 6, 2015. The trial justice found that plaintiff lacked statutory standing to file a complaint in Superior Court alleging a violation of OMA because the statute explicitly limits the right to file a complaint in Superior Court to \"individuals,\" and plaintiff is a group.

Thus, the statutory requirement that an individual be 'aggrieved' by a violation of the OMA does not require that a plaintiff allege some harm to his or her economic or property interests, but rather that his or her right to be 'advised of and aware of' the performance, deliberations, and decisions of government entities was, or may be, violated.\"\n    <em>\n     Tanner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939636\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/784/#p792\">\n     880 A.2d at 793\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 42-46-1 and 42-46-8).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The OMA provides in \u00a7 42-46-8 for the \"[r]emedies available to aggrieved persons or entities.\" To determine who has standing to pursue these remedies, we need to consider two paragraphs within \u00a7 42-46-8. Paragraph (a) provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    \"Any citizen or entity of the state who is aggrieved as a result of violations of the provisions of this chapter may file a complaint with the attorney general. The attorney general shall investigate the complaint and if the attorney general determines that the allegations of the complaint are meritorious he or she may file a complaint on behalf of the complainant in the superior court against the public body.\" Section 42-46-8(a).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Paragraph (c) provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    \"Nothing within this section shall prohibit any individual from retaining private counsel for the purpose of filing a complaint in the superior court within the time specified by this section against the public body which has allegedly violated the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that if the individual has first filed a complaint with the attorney general pursuant to this section, and the attorney general declines to take legal action, the individual may file suit in superior court within ninety (90) days of the attorney general's closing of the complaint or within one hundred eighty (180) days of the alleged violation, whichever occurs later.\" Section 42-46-8(c).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    In our view, \u00a7 42-46-8 is clear and unambiguous. Individuals and entities have standing to file a complaint with the Attorney General, and the Attorney General has the discretion to file a complaint on behalf of the complainant (individual or entity) in the Superior Court. Section 42-46-8(a). Individuals have the additional option to skip the Attorney General's office and file a complaint directly in Superior Court. Section 42-46-8(c). The trial justice read paragraph (c) as limiting the grant of statutory standing to individuals; according to the trial justice, entities such as plaintiff, a nonprofit corporation, do not have standing to file a claim in Superior Court. We agree. The plain language of \u00a7 42-46-8(c) includes \"the individual\" only and is silent as to entities of the state. We therefore conclude that plaintiff, as a nonprofit corporation, does not have standing to pursue a claim in Superior Court for violation of the OMA. Accordingly, judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants on plaintiff's OMA violation claim is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    <strong>\n     F\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    <strong>\n     Legislative Immunity\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The plaintiff also challenges both of the trial justice's pretrial rulings that were based on the doctrine of legislative immunity: (1) the grant of defendants' motion for a protective order concerning the deposition of defendant Lanni, a member of the Cranston City Council; and (2) the grant of\n    defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the Non-City defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The doctrine of legislative immunity extends from the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution and the similar \"speech in debate\" clause of the Rhode Island Constitution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S. Const., art.

The defendants argued that Lanni was protected from deposition by the privilege of legislative immunity, and that his testimony would not be relevant to the central issue of the case. The plaintiff objected to defendants' motion, arguing that the topics plaintiff sought to cover in Lanni's deposition were outside the scope of legislative immunity, including \"information concerning the various police and firefighter Collective Bargaining Agreements, the general financial condition of the City, the actions of actuarial consultants, City spending, and budget * * *.\" The plaintiff also argued that it was entitled to ask Lanni about subjects listed as accomplishments and future goals on his campaign website.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The trial justice granted defendants' motion on the basis that Lanni enjoyed the privilege of legislative immunity, and that the topics plaintiff sought to question Lanni about were related to his position as a legislator. Specifically, the trial justice held that: \"Much of what [CPRAC] requests-information relating to police and firefighter Collective Bargaining Agreements, financial conditions and spending of the City, and actuarial reports-can be easily obtained.\" The trial justice also found that the subjects related to statements on Lanni's campaign website were \"less clearly within legislative immunity[,]\" but that the privilege applied because \"the information from that website is, in substance, material relating to Mr. Lanni's legislative duties.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in granting defendants' motion\n    because the protective order was excessive in scope and prevented plaintiff from deposing Lanni on subjects that should be considered outside the protection of legislative immunity.

The proposed amended answer included an additional affirmative defense: that the City exercised its police power when it enacted the 2013 ordinances. The plaintiff objected to the amendment on the basis that it was untimely and prejudicial because plaintiff would not have time to conduct additional discovery about the new affirmative defense prior to trial. The trial justice held a brief hearing on the City's motion on the morning of the first day of trial. At the hearing, the City argued that the exercise of its police power had been a dominant theme throughout the pretrial proceedings and that formally adding this affirmative defense to its answer merely ensured that the pleading conformed to the evidence. The trial justice granted the motion to amend, concluding that plaintiff had not demonstrated any prejudice that would be caused by the proposed amendments to the answer because the issue of the City's police power had been at the forefront since the beginning of the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Before us, plaintiff argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she allowed the City to amend its answer on the first day of trial because plaintiff was \"extreme[ly] prejudice[d]\" by the surprise of the additional affirmative defense and had no time to conduct discovery on this new defense. The plaintiff also faults the trial justice for not asking the City why the amendment was requested so close to the beginning of the trial. The City responds that plaintiff has not adequately explained how it was prejudiced, and therefore, if there was any error in granting the motion to amend, the error was harmless.

The plaintiff objected to the bill of costs, arguing that the request was excessive because some of the transcripts were generated from witness depositions that were not used during the trial. The plaintiff also filed a motion to stay consideration of the bill of costs until after the appeal was decided by this Court, arguing that the City would not be entitled to these costs if plaintiff prevailed on any of the issues raised in its appeal. The City objected to the motion to stay, arguing that plaintiff had not established that it was entitled to the stay pending appeal. The City also argued that, because an award of costs generates an appealable order, principles of judicial economy dictated that the bill of costs should be decided immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The trial justice held a hearing on October 13, 2016.
