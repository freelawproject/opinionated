Landowners seek to build a medical clinic in a residential zoning district. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Landowners own a two-acre property in the R-3 High Density Residential Zoning District located in North Strabane Township (Township). The North Strabane Township Zoning Ordinance (Zoning Ordinance)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   allows a medical clinic as a conditional use in an R-3 District as long as it is \"established in conjunction with, part of and adjacent to an assisted living facility, independent living facility, life care community or nursing home.\" ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7 1303.34(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 13, 2017, Landowners challenged Section 1303.34(B) of the Zoning Ordinance as impermissibly restrictive. In their application to the Zoning Board, Landowners stated, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Requirements that medical clinic in an R-3 Zoning District be affiliated with nursing home, assisted living facility and the like. The requirement constitutes exclusionary or restrictive zoning and is therefore unenforceable. [Landowners] cannot develop property desired due to restrictive language of [the Zoning] Ordinance. Applicable Zoning Ordinance language also discriminatorily restrictive. Language creates hardship not of Landowners making.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reproduced Record at 20a (R.R. __). The Zoning Board held a public hearing on September 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hearing, Landowners asserted that Section 1303.34(B) constitutes \"de facto exclusionary and restrictive zoning\" and requested that the Zoning Board interpret Section 1303.34(B) as \"invalid, illegal, [or] unenforceable.\" Hearing Transcript, 9/6/2017, at 8; R.R. 52a. In support, Landowners pointed out that the requirement that a medical clinic be allowed only in conjunction with a life care community conflicted with the Zoning Ordinance's definition of a \"medical clinic,\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any establishment, including mobile diagnostic units, where persons receive medical, dental, chiropractic and surgical diagnosis, treatment and counseling under the care of a group of licensed medical doctors and dentists and their supporting staff, where said patients are not provided with board or room or kept overnight on the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7 201. Landowners asserted that it is impossible to develop a medical clinic that complies with both Section 201 and Section 1303.34(B). Further, medical clinics located in the C-1 Highway Commercial and C-2 Regional Commercial Districts are not subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 1303.34(B). All these \"inconsistencies,\" according to Landowners, rendered the requirements in Section 1303.34(B) invalid and unenforceable. Hearing Transcript at 15; R.R. 59a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Landowners also challenged the extensive acreage for a medical clinic in the R-3 District required by Section 1303.34(B). A life care community requires 20 acres, and an assisted or independent living facility requires five acres. ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7\u00a7 1303.5(A), 1303.29(A). Landowners asserted that there was no parcel in the R-3 District large enough to accommodate a clinic and facility as required in Section 1303.34(B). Landowners maintained that Section 1303.34(B) is\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusionary to the extent it precludes a stand-alone medical clinic in an R-3 District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alternatively, Landowners sought a variance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting an unnecessary hardship\n   created by the \"restrictive and [ ] unenforceable nature of the language in and associated with an R-3 [District].\" Hearing Transcript at 20; R.R. 64a. When the Zoning Board questioned Landowners about the type of facility they proposed, they responded that \"at this time there isn't anything definite. We would do whatever to fit in.\" Hearing Transcript at 12; R.R. 56a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Zoning Board did not take evidence at the hearing, explaining that it would decide only \"whether the [O]rdinance needs an interpretation\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It's a strictly legal issue. And I don't see any need to offer any testimony. I want to keep this thing as simple as possible.... We're not here to say whether [Landowners] can do it or not. We're here to say whether the [O]rdinance needs an interpretation in our mind to correct a deficiency that [Landowners] say[ ] exists in our [O]rdinance. And which allow [them] to put a medical clinic in a R-3 [D]istrict. [They are] saying what the Supervisors did in requiring it to be attached to another type of facility is improper.... It's the legal issue involving whether the [O]rdinance is subject to interpretation. That's the issue in this case and that's what we'll decide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hearing Transcript at 30-31; R.R. 74a-75a. The Zoning Board continued the hearing to October 4, 2017, to allow Landowners to submit a legal memorandum, which they did, reiterating that the Zoning Ordinance is exclusionary and that construction of a medical clinic consistent with Section 1303.34(B) would cost \"additional millions of dollars.\" R.R. 95a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 4, 2017, the Zoning Board voted to uphold the Zoning Ordinance and deny Landowners' request for a variance. The Zoning Board concluded that the Zoning Ordinance is not exclusionary, noting that stand-alone medical clinics are permitted in C-1 and C-2 Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In denying Landowners' request for a variance, the Zoning Board made the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4. The proposed variance is for a use variance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   6. [Landowners] appeared with counsel and offered testimony and exhibits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   9. [Landowners] wish to use the property for a medical clinic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   10. [Landowners] do not plan to establish the clinic in conjunction with, part of and adjacent to an assisted living facility, independent living facility, life care community or nursing home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Board Decision at 2-3; Findings of Fact \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 9, 10. The Zoning Board held that Landowners did not show an unnecessary hardship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Landowners appealed to the trial court, challenging the Zoning Ordinance conditions attached to the medical clinic in an R-3 District as so restrictive as to constitute\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusionary zoning. Landowners further argued that the Zoning Board denied them a full and fair opportunity to make their case for a variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a decision of May 10, 2018, the trial court affirmed the Zoning Board's decision. It concluded that the Zoning Ordinance is not\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   exclusionary because it permits a medical clinic as a conditional use in an R-3 District, and it permits stand-alone medical clinics in the C-1 and C-2 Districts. As to\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusion, the trial court held that Landowners failed to prove that the Zoning Ordinance effectively excludes a legitimate use. The trial court rejected Landowners' claim that no lot in the R-3 District has enough acreage to accommodate a medical clinic and affiliated\n   facility, noting that a nursing home requires only two acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to Landowners' argument that the Zoning Board denied them a full and fair opportunity to present their case for a variance, the trial court observed that Landowners were given two hearings and an opportunity to submit a memorandum. This satisfied due process. Landowners did not prove any of the requirements for a variance, which requires more than mere economic hardship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Landowners have appealed to this Court, and they raise two issues for our review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, they argue that the trial court erred, asserting that the conditions for a medical clinic in an R-3 District constitute\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusionary zoning. Second, they argue that the Zoning Board denied them a full and fair opportunity to present their request for a variance. We address these issues\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Validity Challenge to the Zoning Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In their first issue, Landowners offer several arguments in support of their contention that the conditions for a medical clinic in an R-3 District constitute\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusionary zoning. Requiring a medical clinic to \"be established in conjunction with, part of and adjacent to an assisted living facility, independent living facility, life care community or nursing home\" precludes mobile diagnostic units, which are not permanent structures. ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7 1303.34(B). Landowners argue that no property in the R-3 District is large enough to accommodate a clinic and assisted living facility, and this makes Section 1303.34(B) of the Zoning Ordinance exclusionary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the Zoning Board did not address the \"improper distinction\" between stand-alone medical clinics that are permitted in C-1 and C-2 Districts without the Section 1303.34(B) condition. Landowners Brief at 9. Landowners maintain that the conditions in Section 1303.34(B) are manifestly unreasonable and effectively preclude a medical clinic in the R-3 District, despite its purported authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A zoning ordinance enjoys a presumption of constitutionality and validity. The challenging party has the \"heavy burden of establishing its invalidity.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

A\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusion exists where an ordinance purports to allow a use but, when applied, in actuality prohibits the use throughout the municipality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    In re Bartkowski Investment Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6894114\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/106/230/6894114/#p238\">\n    106 A.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014).

This is correct. Section 801 of the Zoning Ordinance states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   In the R-3 High-Density Residential District, only the following uses are authorized:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   B.

In turn, Section 1303.34 provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   uses that are listed in any zoning district as a conditional use or use by special exception shall comply with the applicable standards and criteria specified below for that use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   34.

Section 1303.34(B) does not effect a total prohibition of stand-alone medical clinics, and we reject Landowners' argument that the Zoning Ordinance is exclusionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Landowners next argue that Section 1303.34(B), which does not apply to medical clinics in C-1 and C-2 Districts, is arbitrary and unreasonable because it does not advance the purpose of the R-3 District.

Nature of the Variance Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Zoning Ordinance sets forth the standards for obtaining relief from its requirements. Section 1805 states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The [Zoning Board], upon appeal, shall have the power to authorize variances from the requirements of this chapter and to attach such conditions to the variance as it deems necessary to assure compliance with the purposes of this chapter.\n   <em>\n    A variance may be granted if all of the following findings are made\n   </em>\n   , where relevant in a given case:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   B. That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance necessary to afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7 1805 (emphasis added). Section 1805 of the Zoning Ordinance is nearly identical to Section 910.2 of the\n   Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which authorizes a zoning hearing board's grant or denial of a variance. Unnecessary hardship requires evidence that: (1) the physical characteristics of the property are such that the property could not be used for any permitted purpose; (2) the property can be conformed for a permitted use only at a prohibitive expense; or (3) the property has no value for any purpose permitted by the zoning ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Its zoning permit was denied because its proposed sign would exceed the permitted height; would be placed less than 500 feet from another sign and closer than 660 feet to a highway ramp; and would deviate from the requirement that only one sign support structure was permitted on the lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   When the zoning board of adjustment granted the railroad a variance from these restrictions, objectors appealed, and the trial court reversed. In affirming the trial court, this Court observed that \"a dimensional variance contemplates only a reasonable adjustment from area and space requirements in order to develop a\n   <em>\n    permitted\n   </em>\n   use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456035\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/787/1123/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456035\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/787/1123/\">\n    at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

This Court held otherwise.

Accordingly, the zoning board erred in treating the variance as dimensional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Here, Landowners have requested a variance from the conditions in Section 1303.34(B) of the Zoning Ordinance that require a medical clinic in the R-3 District \"be established in conjunction with, part of and adjacent to an assisted living facility, independent living facility, life care community or nursing home.\" ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7 1303.34(B).

Full and Fair Opportunity to be Heard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, Landowners argue that the Zoning Board denied their request for a variance without taking any evidence. Section 1807.2(F) of the Zoning Ordinance provides that \"[t]he parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.\" ZONING ORDINANCE \u00a7 1807(2)(F). Landowners assert that they were denied the hearing guaranteed by Section 1807(2)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Landowners filed two requests with the Zoning Board, one for an interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance and another for a variance to develop a medical clinic on their property. The Zoning Board held a hearing on September 6, 2017, but it did not take testimony or evidence. Rather, it stated that it would first decide \"whether the [O]rdinance needs an interpretation,\" on which testimony was not\n   needed. Hearing Transcript at 31; R.R. 75a. Following the hearing, Landowners submitted a legal memorandum, which addressed their interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance but not their variance request. On October 4, 2017, the Zoning Board held another hearing, where it voted to uphold the Zoning Ordinance and deny Landowners' request for a variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Zoning Board stated in its written decision that Landowners appeared with counsel and \"offered testimony and exhibits,\" Board Decision at 3, Findings of Fact \u00b6 6, and they \"failed to demonstrate unnecessary hardship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, Conclusions of Law \u00b6 8. To the contrary, the Zoning Board did not receive any testimony or evidence at any point prior to denying Landowners' request for a variance.

However, because Landowners did not have the opportunity to present evidence in support of their variance request, we vacate the trial court's decision affirming the Zoning Board's denial of the variance.
