After careful consideration, we vacate the order and remand\n   to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 24, 2013, at Docket Number CP-48-CR-0003839-2012 (3839-2012), Appellant pled guilty to one count each of aggravated indecent assault and corruption of minors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These charges arose from Appellant's sexual assault of a 14-year-old female in May 2012. The same day, at Docket Number CP-48-CR-0003840-2012 (3840-2012), Appellant pled guilty to one count each of statutory sexual assault, corruption of minors, and indecent assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These charges resulted from Appellant's sexual assault of a different 14-year-old female, which occurred on five occasions between October 2011 and April 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 21, 2013, the trial court sentenced Appellant at both dockets to an aggregate term of 30 to 60 months of incarceration, followed by 72 months of probation. The same day, the trial court heard testimony from Dr. Veronique Valliere (Dr. Valliere) of the Sexual Offenders Assessment Board. Dr. Valliere opined that Appellant met the definition of an SVP. On November 25, 2013, Appellant filed a motion in which he asked the court to appoint an expert witness to conduct an independent SVP evaluation. On December 27, 2013, the trial court held a hearing on Appellant's motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the motion. On June 17, 2014, the trial court entered an order classifying Appellant as an SVP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 10, 2014, Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. On January 17, 2017, the trial court entered an order directing Appellant to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 8, 2017, Appellant filed his Rule 1925(b) statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal to this Court, the parties initially filed briefs on the sole issue raised in Appellant's Rule 1925(b) statement,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the trial court erred in denying Appellant's request for a court-appointed expert to conduct an independent SVP evaluation. However, on July 19, 2017, our Supreme Court decided\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Consequently, on September 13, 2017, Appellant filed an application seeking permission to file a supplemental brief with this Court to address\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . We granted the application on October 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 20, 2018, this Court certified this case for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and directed the parties to brief the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) In consideration of Appellant's having committed the relevant crimes between October 2011 and May 2012, whether the enactment date or the effective date of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\"), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.10 - 9799.41, controls for purposes of offenses committed between\n   the enactment date and the effective date?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) Whether there is an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation to a defendant who is sentenced under SORNA for criminal acts committed after the enactment date of SORNA (December 20, 2011) but before the effective date of SORNA (December 20, 2012)?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) Whether this Court must address if the Act of Feb. 21, 2018, P.L. 27, No. 10 (HB 631 of 2017; \"Act 10\"), applies in the instant case and all cases governed by SORNA and, if so, whether Act 10 renders the registration provisions of SORNA non-punitive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4) If Act 10 applies in the instant matter, whether Act 10's potential effects on Appellant, as a result of the crimes having been committed between October 2011 to May 2012, violate the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Order Directing\n   <em>\n    En Banc\n   </em>\n   Certification, 4/20/18. In addition to these issues, Appellant also argues that with respect to his SVP evaluation, \"[t]he [t]rial [c]ourt erred and abused its discretion by failing to appoint a psychological expert upon Appellant's request where Appellant was indigent and without funds to retain his own expert.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's Brief at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We begin by addressing the first two issues. Appellant argues that he should not be subject to SORNA's registration and reporting requirements. Appellant asserts that although the General Assembly enacted SORNA on December 20, 2011, prior to the time he committed several of his crimes in April and May 2012, SORNA did not go into effect until December 20, 2012. Therefore, Appellant contends that the application of SORNA to his sentence violates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this issue presents a question of law, our standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and our scope of review is plenary.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The Court explained that laws that fall within any of the above four\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Calder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   designations and which disadvantage a defendant are\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   laws and constitutionally infirm.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   then addressed the constitutionality of SORNA. The Court concluded that SORNA violated\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibitions under both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1223. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court reasoned that despite the legislature's designation of SORNA as a civil remedy, it was punitive in nature, and consequently, SORNA, as a criminal penalty, fell within the third\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Calder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   category (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , application of the statute would inflict greater punishment than the law in effect at the time the defendant committed his crimes).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1196, 1218. Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated the portion of the judgment of sentence that required the appellant to comply with SORNA. While\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is not a majority decision, the concurring opinion joins the Supreme Court's lead opinion to the extent it concludes that SORNA is\n   punitive and that it was unconstitutional as applied to the appellant, in violation of both state and federal\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Like\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , this case implicates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions because application of SORNA's registration and reporting requirements would impose greater punishment on Appellant than the law in effect at the time he committed his crimes.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1195-96. Although SORNA increased the registration period for some crimes, the registration requirement for individuals convicted of aggravated indecent assault remained lifetime registration.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2) (expired)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 9799.14(d). While SORNA did not enhance the registration period for aggravated indecent assault, it did augment the registration and reporting requirements for Tier III offenders, which included the addition of quarterly in-person reporting and the posting of personal information on the Pennsylvania State Police website.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323520\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/1189/\">\n    164 A.3d at 1210-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As our Supreme Court pointed out in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , these additional registration and reporting requirements constitute a greater punishment than what Megan's Law would have imposed, and consequently, their retroactive application violates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323520\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/1189/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323520\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/1189/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323520\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/1189/\">\n    at 1193-1196, 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellant argues that the application of SORNA to his sentence was illegal under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . He contends that at the time he committed his offenses in 2011 and 2012, he would have been subject to then-effective Megan's Law, under which lifetime registration and reporting requirements were less stringent. Appellant asserts that the application of SORNA retroactively inflicted upon him a punishment greater than what he would have received under the law in effect at the time he committed the crimes. Further, although his guilty plea and sentencing occurred after SORNA's effective date, Appellant contends that for purposes of an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   analysis, the date upon which the crime was committed is dispositive, and not the date of his plea, conviction, or sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Commonwealth counters that although SORNA became effective on December 20, 2012 (after Appellant committed\n   his offenses), SORNA was enacted one year earlier on December 20, 2011 (before Appellant committed several of his offenses). Thus, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant had sufficient notice of SORNA's impending registration requirements at the time he committed his offenses at Docket Number 3839-2012 and at least some of his offenses at Docket Number 3840-2012, and consequently, there was no\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As Appellant argues, this Court has held that the critical inquiry for determining whether the application of SORNA to a convicted sex offender violates\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibitions is the date of the offense.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Additionally, the parties do not dispute that the application of SORNA to a sex offender for offenses committed prior to SORNA's enactment constitutes an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation in light of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

Although the General Assembly recently amended Subchapter H, Appellant has not received a sentence under the amended provision. Consequently, the question of whether Act 10 and Act 29 are constitutional is not before us. We also recognize that our Supreme Court recently granted review to determine the issue of whether Acts 10 and 29 are constitutional.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See Commonwealth v.
