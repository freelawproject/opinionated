Shortly after the State's takeover of the District, the Legislature authorized the establishment of charter schools. The first one opened in Newark in 1997. As of the 2017-2018 school year, nineteen charter schools were open in the District. https://www.nj.gov/education/chartsch/ (last visited April 12, 2019). The Charter School Act (the Act), N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to -18, defines an initial charter term as four years. The schools are required to renew for subsequent five-year periods. N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-17.

N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(b) ; N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.2. The Commissioner may revoke a charter at any time if the school has not fulfilled or has violated any of the conditions of its charter.

Additionally, respondents further argue that allowing ELC to pursue the matter essentially permits individual students, contrary to N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(d), to appeal a decision by the Commissioner.

Further, all District students, in charter schools or not, have a direct interest in obtaining adequate funding and in ameliorating the effect of student segregation within the District.

That the statute does not explicitly allow for organizations\n   such as ELC to appeal the Commissioner's decisions is inconsequential. The unfortunate reality is that, despite systemic improvements, public school children in\n   <em>\n    Abbott\n   </em>\n   districts continue to need representation in order to ensure their constitutional right to a thorough and efficient education is enforced.
