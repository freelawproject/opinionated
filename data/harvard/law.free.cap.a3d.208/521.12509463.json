The sole issue before this Court is whether the Board erred by concluding that Section 604 of the Pennsylvania Public Employe\n   Relations Act (PERA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not prohibit a union representing the Township's public works employees from also representing all full-time and regular part-time Act 111\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Township police officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2018, Teamsters Local Union No. 776 (Local 776), which is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters), filed a Petition for Representation with the Board pursuant to the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PLRA) and Act 111, seeking clarification of the union representation of all full-time and regular part-time police officers the Township employed. On February 12, 2018, the Board's Secretary issued an Order and Notice of Hearing (ONH).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the parties' stipulations of fact, the Township argued before the Hearing Examiner that since the petitioned-for police officers would act as Township security guards within the meaning of Section 604(3) of PERA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Teamsters could not represent those police officers since the Teamsters also represent Township employees who are not security guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 26, 2018, the Hearing Examiner issued the ODSEL, therein holding that Act 111 police officers are not security guards under PERA and, thus, may be represented by an employee organization that represents non-security guard employees. Specifically, the Hearing Examiner explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the Township asserts that this case presents an issue of first impression for the Board, (Township's Post-hearing Brief at 8) (stating that 'this case poses a new, novel and unanswered question'), the Board long ago rejected the position advanced by the Township here. In\n   <em>\n    Union Township\n   </em>\n   , 25 PPER \u00b6 25198 (Final Order, 1994), the employer filed three petitions (a unit clarification, an amendment of certification and a decertification) requesting that the Teamsters local be prohibited from representing the police employes of the township as a result of its certification to represent non-uniformed, non-professional employes of the employer under PERA. In that case, the employer argued that, the police officers were\n   guards and that[,] under Section 604(3) of PERA[,] they must be included in a security guard[-]only bargaining unit and that their bargaining representative must not be affiliated with any other organization which represents or includes members or persons outside of the security guard classification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 46a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Hearing Examiner reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties in this case agree that the police officers in the proposed bargaining unit currently represented by the [incumbent union, Lower Swatara Township Police Civic Association,] are sworn police officers ... who are entitled to organize under Act 111, not PERA. Consequently, those officers have a sworn duty to protect, not only the Township's property and persons thereon, but other property within the Township and persons therein. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Union\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Township\n   </em>\n   , the employes' Act 111 status as sworn officers ..., employed by a political subdivision, as opposed to an authority, removes them from any application of the guard exclusion under PERA. Moreover, under [\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, uniformed police officers could not violate their sworn duty to protect citizens and property simply because non-uniformed Township employes, represented by Local 776, were picketing or striking, in the event that Local 776 becomes the certified bargaining representative of the officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Similarly, officers will not disobey orders or their sworn duty, as peace officers, to protect persons and property simply because Article XIX, Section 7(b)(7) [of the collective bargaining agreement] allows sanctions against a Teamster member for crossing a picket line authorized by any local affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The threat of discipline from the Chief and the Township has more influence on the officers' loyalty (for violating their duty or their orders) than the ethereal possibility of sanction from the International. The special status of duty-bound and sworn Act 111 police officers, under law, renders the guard exclusion inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Capitol Police\n   </em>\n   , [sic];\n   <em>\n    Union T\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    wp.\n   </em>\n   ], [sic]. Although the Township maintains that 'it is also entitled to the protections of Section 604(3) [of PERA] by virtue of its employment of public works employees, ... the Township in fact enjoys and has the loyal, premium, duty-bound protections of its sworn police officers, who will protect persons and property without bias, judgment or influence from the Teamsters or any other person or organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   R.R. at 48a (citation and footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 10, 2018, the Board received the Eligibility List and, on May 15, 2018, issued an Order and Notice of Election directing a secret ballot election on May 24, 2018 to ascertain the exclusive representative of all the Township's full-time and regular part-time police officers (excluding the Police Chief and other managerial employees). On June 4, 2018, the Board issued the NOC finding that 50% or more of the valid votes cast designated the Teamsters as the exclusive representative for collective bargaining purposes. The NOC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   certified the Teamsters as the exclusive representative of all the Township's full-time and regular part-time police officers\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   for collective bargaining purposes under Act 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 25, 2018, the Township filed timely exceptions to the NOC with the Board. The Teamsters filed a response to the exceptions on July 13, 2018. On August 21, 2018, the Board issued its Final Order, holding that the Hearing Examiner's legal conclusions on the challenged issues were not erroneous. Thus, the Board dismissed the Township's exceptions and made the April 26, 2018 ODSEL and the June 4, 2018 NOC absolute and final. The Township appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Initially, this Court notes that in the Township's exceptions to the Board and Petition for Review to this Court, the Township contended that the Board erred in including Act 111 officers\n   <strong>\n    in the same unit\n   </strong>\n   as the Township's non-guard employees certified under PERA. The Board correctly points out that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   the Board did not certify the Act 111 police officers in the same unit as the public works employes certified under PERA. The police officers are certified in their own homogenous unit under Act 111, at PF-R-18-13-E, and the public works employes were certified in a bargaining unit of nonprofessional employes under PERA at Case No. PERA-R-17-280-E.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Board Br. at 20 n.11. Curiously, the Township admits in its brief to this Court: \"[I]t is important to note that\n   <strong>\n    the Township did not (\n    <em>\n     and does not\n    </em>\n    ) object to the police officers organizing into a union, just that the union representing the police officers should not be the\n    <em>\n     same\n    </em>\n    unit as the non-uniformed union.\n   </strong>\n   \" Township Br. at 4 n.6 (bold and italic emphasis added).

Indeed, the statute's reference to a mere '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     individual employed as a guard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ' read in conjunction and juxtaposed with its reference to '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     other public employes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ' indicates the intent of the General Assembly to apply this Section\n   <em>\n    in the presence\n   </em>\n   to a public-employer, public-employee relationship, regardless of whether the 'guards' are considered 'public employes' under PERA. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.604(3) (emphas[i]s added). The General Assembly refers to the 'individual[s] employed as guard[s]' as 'public employes' but specifically characterizes the individuals to whom the statute is meant to protect as 'public employes.'\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In short, it is not the 'guard' that must be the public employe and covered by the statute; it is the 'other public employes' that are the subject of this Section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20412\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1 Pa.C.S.[ ] \u00a7 1903(b) ('General words shall be construed to take their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words.').\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, under the 'guard exception,' the Board is prohibited from allowing the possibility that 'guards,' however defined, may be included in the same bargaining unit with the Township's public works employees.

In its analysis of whether the employes were police under Act 111 or security guards under PERA, the Commonwealth Court noted that in the event the employes were covered by Act 111, the UPGWA would be legally prohibited from representing them because police employes under Act 111 would be persons outside of the security guard classification under Section 604(3) of PERA.\n   <em>\n    Capitol Police\n   </em>\n   , ...\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%20470\">\n    441 A.2d at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the separate legislative coverage of police and guard employes and separate dispute resolution procedures available to them requires guards and policemen to be placed in separate units for bargaining.
