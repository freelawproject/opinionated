Menkins Holdings, LLC (Applicant) appeals from the Berks County Common Pleas Court's (trial court) June 28, 2018 order affirming the Douglass Township Zoning Hearing Board's (ZHB) decision granting a variance subject to conditions and denying the other requested relief. Applicant essentially presents one issue for this Court's review: whether the ZHB's conditions were authorized and reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Applicant owns the property located at 1269 Reading Avenue, Boyertown, Douglass Township (Township), Berks County, Pennsylvania (Property). Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 7a-9a. The Property is located in the Township's Village Commercial (VC) Zoning District, and consists of approximately one and one-half acres upon which sits a single-family residence and a five-bay garage/office. Applicant purchased the Property from Randy L. and Debra Keen (the Keens), who lived in the residence and operated a family-owned commercial electrical contracting business therefrom in accordance with variances the Township granted in 1986 (to construct the garage and conduct the business at the rear of the Property) and in 1987 (for a garage addition).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ZHB declared in both the 1986 and 1987 orders that any further expansion of the Keens' business would require additional variances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 170a, 174a-175a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Adjoining the Property to the west is B &amp; W, an asphalt and cement plant manufacturing facility that employs heavy equipment, cranes and trucks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ZHB Finding of Fact (FOF) 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 67a-68a, 182a-189a, 235a-236a. \"B &amp; W is a nonconforming use which is an industrial[-]type use[.]\" Township Br. App. (ZHB Op.) at 31. B &amp; W shares a common driveway with Applicant pursuant to an easement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 67a, 182a, 235a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Applicant leased the Property to W.J. Menkins Hauling (Company) to operate a quarry trucking business from the Property. The Company owns 25 tri-axle dump trucks that are used to haul sand and stone from quarries near the Property and as far away as South Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. The Company's employees' activity on the Property consists of entering, removing the dump trucks from their parking spaces, parking their personal vehicles in the dump truck spaces, leaving in the dump trucks to obtain and deliver materials, returning the dump trucks to the Property and departing in their cars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Applicant's president William J. Menkins, III (Menkins), this activity begins at 1:00 a.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m. The Company's 22 truck drivers, a dispatcher and a safety officer work from the Property. Menkins uses the office in the garage to operate the Company. The Company washes its dump trucks at the Property, and uses the garage's five bays to store parts and make minor mechanical repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the Township contacted Applicant about zoning violations, on February 28, 2016, Menkins applied for a zoning permit to change the Property's use from Keen Electric to a \"hauling business.\" R.R. at 207a. On March 23, 2016, the Township's Code Enforcement Officer John Wascavage (Wascavage) denied the zoning permit application because \"[a] trucking hauling business is not a permitted use in the [Township's VC] Zoning District (# 27-405.2 - Uses Permitted by Right).\" R.R. at 205a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 21, 2016, Applicant appealed to the ZHB seeking: (1) review of Wascavage's determination; (2) a variance from\n   Sections 27-405 and 27-904 of the Douglass Township Zoning Ordinance of 2013 (Zoning Ordinance), Zoning Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 27-405, 27-904; (3) the right to use the Property per Applicant's vested rights; (4) the right to use the Property pursuant to the doctrine of equitable estoppel; (5) the right to use the Property under a variance by estoppel; (6) the right to use the Property pursuant to Zoning Ordinance Section 27-902; and (7) the right to expand a nonconforming use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 1a-5a. The ZHB conducted hearings on August 22, October 31 and December 13, 2016, and February 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 63a-168a. The Township and neighboring property owners, Dennis (Mr. Urffer) and Judith Urffer (collectively, the Urffers),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Heather Pilla (Pilla)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Theresa Kovach (Kovach)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   intervened and were granted party status. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact, and the ZHB heard oral argument on May 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 26, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the ZHB granted Applicant's variance, subject to the following conditions (Conditions):\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a) [Applicant's] use is limited to the current size of his operation which [Applicant] stated is a total of 25 trucks.

App. (ZHB Op.) at 35-36 (emphasis added); R.R. at 289a-290a (emphasis added). Applicant's appeal was denied in all other respects. Applicant and\n   the Urffers appealed to the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 28, 2018, the trial court, without taking additional evidence, affirmed the ZHB's decision. Applicant appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Applicant argues that the ZHB's Condition b limiting its operating hours and Condition e requiring Applicant to obtain final land development approval are unreasonable and/or without authority. Applicant proposes that its appeal from the land development condition be sustained, and that the variance\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   should be granted subject only to the condition that [Applicant] be allowed to use the Property without limitation concerning the time of operation[,] as long as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1.
