On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) incorrectly concluded that he failed to establish that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when trial counsel failed to request a stay of execution that resulted in the loss of sixteen days of presentence incarceration credits. We agree with the petitioner that the habeas court improperly denied his petition for certification to appeal, and, after considering the merits of his claim, we conclude that\n   the habeas court incorrectly determined that trial counsel did not render deficient performance when he failed to request a stay of execution of the petitioner's prior sentence. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. On July 30, 2015, the petitioner, who at the time was represented by Attorney Michael Richards (trial counsel), entered into a plea agreement at the Superior Court in Waterbury on a series of charges resulting in a total effective sentence of three years incarceration, followed by five years of special parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of the Waterbury plea agreement, the petitioner pleaded to the following: Admission of two counts of violation of probation in Docket Nos. CR-12-0410035-S and CR-12-0412661-S, and guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to criminal violation of a restraining order in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223b in Docket No. CR-14-0423367-S, criminal violation of a protective order in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 and the crime of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 in Docket No. CR-14-0424236-S, and criminal violation of a protective order in violation of \u00a7 53a-223 in Docket No. CR-15-0432507-S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to accepting the pleas, the court canvassed the petitioner with respect to the plea agreement and found\n   that it was entered into voluntarily and with the assistance of competent counsel. After accepting the pleas, but prior to imposing sentence, the court asked the petitioner if\n   he would like to address the court. The petitioner stated that he \"just want[ed] to make sure all [his] jail credit [would be] applied to all [his] dockets, even for ... [the] Meriden cases.\" The court responded that because the petitioner's other cases were pending in a different jurisdiction, it had no control over them, but stated: \"What I can do is give you credit for any time you were incarcerated during the pendency of these cases that are in this jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then sentenced the petitioner to a total effective sentence of three years incarceration, followed by five years of special parole in accordance with the state's recommendation. Prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the court again asked whether anything else needed to be addressed before the conclusion of the proceeding. Trial counsel thanked the prosecutor and the court but made no further requests. Later that day, trial counsel filed a motion for presentence incarceration credits with the court but did not request a stay of execution of the sentence. On the following day, July 31, 2015, the court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Approximately three weeks later, on August 20, 2015, at the Superior Court in Meriden, as part of a separate plea agreement that stemmed from separate charges, the petitioner was sentenced to a total effective sentence of two years of incarceration, which was to run concurrently with the Waterbury sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of the Meriden plea agreement, the petitioner entered\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   pleas to the following charges: One count of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of \u00a7 53a-223 in Docket No. CR-14-0277421-S and one count each of the crimes of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 and failing to appear in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172 in Docket No. CR-13-0275489-S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 25, 2016, the self-represented petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance in several respects relating to the application of presentence incarceration credits. On August 3, 2016, the petitioner, now represented by assigned counsel, filed the operative amended petition, claiming that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to adequately preserve the petitioner's incarceration credits for time already served and that but for trial counsel's deficient performance, there was a reasonable probability that the petitioner would have a more favorable outcome in the form of a reduced period of special parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner's habeas trial was held on November 9, 2016, before the court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   During the evidentiary hearing, trial counsel testified that, while he was representing the petitioner at a violation of probation hearing in which the petitioner faced ten years incarceration, the petitioner informed him that he wanted to take the plea agreement that trial counsel had previously negotiated with the Waterbury prosecutor. Later in the hearing, when asked why he didn't ask for a stay of execution, trial counsel testified that the petitioner had been a difficult client who had tried to fire both of his previous attorneys and was unwilling to negotiate with\n   the prosecutor. He further testified that \"[the petitioner] kept wavering. There's a long track record of him blowing up, trying to fire everyone that had represented him in the past. I was just trying to get through the canvass\n   really .... [W]e were kind of in the middle of a confusing moment there with the plea. I probably should have [requested the stay]. I'm not sure what the result was that we didn't do it, but again, I thought that his jail credit was a mess in Meriden anyway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court also heard from the Meriden trial counsel, who testified that he also did not ask for jail credits at the subsequent sentencing, but stated: \"[I]t's something I should've done. I don't really have an explanation for [not doing] it.\" Furthermore, the petitioner's expert witness testified that defense attorneys in Connecticut have been aware of the issues surrounding jail credit for some time now and have learned through experience that it is necessary to take steps to protect whatever credit there may be. The expert further testified that having a strained relationship with a client and an urge to proceed through a hearing quickly does not justify failing to ask for a stay of execution and that one should always ask, except when it is counter to the client's express wishes. After the conclusion of evidence, the habeas court denied the petition by oral decision, concluding that there was no deficient performance on the part of trial counsel. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion when it found that he failed to prove that trial counsel's failure to request a stay of execution, which deprived him of sixteen days of presentence incarceration credits, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we address the claim of the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, that the petitioner's appeal should be dismissed as moot. This claim is predicated on the fact that the petitioner is no\n   longer incarcerated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent argues, therefore, that this court can afford the petitioner no practical relief. Although the petitioner is no longer incarcerated, the petitioner argues that practical relief still remains available because an order modifying the original sentence to include the sixteen days of presentence incarceration credit would likely lead to the advancement of his release from special parole by approximately that same amount of time. We agree that practical relief remains available to the petitioner, and, therefore, this appeal is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"504639\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/205/27/\">\n    205 Conn. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201302\">\n    529 A.2d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). In\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner was sentenced to a two year period of confinement, followed by a period of probation. Id., at 29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201302\">\n    529 A.2d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During the pendency of his appeal from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\n   the petitioner was released from confinement and began serving the period of probation. Id., at 29-30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201302\">\n    529 A.2d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addressing a similar mootness argument, our Supreme Court concluded that the petitioner's appeal was not moot, despite his release from confinement, because, although no longer \"confined,\" he was still serving the probationary portion of his sentence. Id., at 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201302\">\n    529 A.2d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further concluded that it could afford the petitioner practical relief, because an order directing the commissioner to recalculate the petitioner's sentence with the credit sought under General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d would affect the period of probation\n   and result in the petitioner completing his probationary period three months sooner by advancing his release date. Id., at 30-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201302\">\n    529 A.2d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see id., at 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201302\">\n    529 A.2d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]herefore, since our resolution of the issue presented in this appeal will affect [the petitioner's] period of probation, the appeal is not moot\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the present case, although the respondent argues that no relief exists, we note that if the petitioner successfully prevails on his claim and we were to reverse the judgment of the habeas court, the benefit to the petitioner would be the retroactive modification of his definite sentence so as to incorporate the sixteen days of presentence confinement credits, thereby advancing his effective release date from prison and reducing the amount of time he is required to spend on special parole.

In response, the respondent argues that the habeas court correctly determined that trial counsel's choice to forgo a motion to stay the execution of the Waterbury sentence was based on a strategic decision to\n   move through the sentencing without incident in order not to jeopardize the court's acceptance of the plea agreement.

Specifically, the petitioner argues that, with the Waterbury sentence already imposed, there was no basis for the claim that the petitioner might act in such a way\n   that would cause the prosecutor to withdraw the plea agreement or cause the court to alter the sentence. The petitioner further argues that the underlying premise of our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 308 Conn. at 463,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684181\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/334/\">\n    68 A.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , applies to the present case, and, therefore, the petitioner is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel with respect to ensuring that he receives all available presentence confinement credit. In response, the respondent argues that it was a reasonable strategic\n   decision to forgo a motion to stay the sentence because the petitioner could have disrupted the plea process prior to the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, given his tendency toward disruptive behavior and changing his mind. Specifically, the respondent argues that the decision by trial counsel was reasonable given the circumstances because the court could have rejected the plea agreement at any point up to the conclusion of the hearing had the petitioner wanted to withdraw the plea agreement or lost his composure. The respondent further argues that the petitioner's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because that case dealt with an omission that had no strategic value and addressed whether a bond hearing constituted a critical stage in a criminal proceeding and, therefore, is distinguishable from the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In considering the petitioner's claim that there was no reasonable strategic basis for not requesting a stay of execution, we first address the issue of whether the petitioner could have withdrawn his plea after it was accepted by the court. The following legal principles assist in our resolution of this issue. \"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable ... [however] strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are [only] reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments\n   support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p686\">\n    466 U.S. at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p686\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court also asked whether the petitioner was satisfied with trial counsel's advice. The petitioner answered in the affirmative to both inquires. The court proceeded to canvass the petitioner in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 through 39-22. The court then asked whether trial counsel or the prosecutor knew of any reason why the plea should not be accepted. No reasons were given by either representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court made a finding that the plea agreement was made voluntarily and with the assistance of competent counsel, and accepted it. After the plea agreement had been accepted, but before the sentence was pronounced, the court asked whether the state or the petitioner wanted to be heard on anything further. The petitioner stated that he \"just want[ed] to make sure all [his] jail credit [would be] applied to all [his] dockets, even for ... [the] Meriden cases.\" The court explained that because the Meriden cases were pending in another jurisdiction, the court had no control over them. The court further stated: \"What I can do is give\n   you credit for any time you were incarcerated during the pendency of these cases that are in this jurisdiction.\" The court then asked if there was anything else. The petitioner asked to be heard a second time and proceeded to apologize to the court for his previous outburst and for any inconvenience that he may have caused to the court, the state, and the victims. The court then pronounced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the present case, the sentencing court canvassed the petitioner in conformity with the relevant rules of practice and provided the prosecutor, trial counsel, and the petitioner sufficient opportunity to present any reasons why the plea agreement should not be accepted. Our review of the record fails to disclose any findings or circumstances that would lead us to conclude that the requirements set forth in \u00a7 39-27 had been violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we defer to the habeas court's determination that trial counsel credibly testified that his failure to request a stay of execution was the result of a strategic decision, as a matter of law, we conclude that trial counsel's failure to request a stay was not the product of reasonable professional judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p686\">\n    466 U.S. at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p686\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trial counsel's\n   concern that the petitioner could withdraw his plea, even after it had been accepted by the court, was not reasonable given that had the court accepted the plea agreement and had the petitioner subsequently sought to withdraw it, he likely would have been barred by\n   \u00a7 39-27. Accordingly, we conclude that it was not reasonable for trial counsel to believe that once the court accepted the plea agreement, the petitioner would have been able to withdraw it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We next address whether the court could have modified the petitioner's sentence on the basis of the petitioner's behavior after the sentence was imposed, but prior to the conclusion of the sentencing proceeding. To begin, we acknowledge the common-law principle that a sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the proceeding and, thus, the authority to modify the sentence, until custody passes to the respondent, unless otherwise permitted by statute. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20125\">\n    306 Conn. at 133-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20197\">\n    49 A.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court affirmed this court's determination that a failure to request a bond increase, which, if granted, would have allowed the petitioner to earn credit for a period of presentence incarceration, was deficient performance because, despite the fact that the ultimate decision of whether to grant the bond increase was discretionary, there was no strategic reason available not to ask for it. Id., at 489-91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684181\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/334/\">\n    68 A.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner argues that although the present case\n   deals with facts concerning a different stage of a criminal proceeding, the essential thrust is the same: absent a strategic justification, failure to maximize presentence confinement credits constitutes deficient performance. Under the facts of the present case, we agree with the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although a stay of execution can be a negotiable term in the plea process that may involve strategic considerations and, therefore, is dissimilar to the routine bond increase addressed in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , the issue here is not whether requesting a stay is strategic in nature or part of some strategic process, but whether trial counsel took the necessary and available steps during critical stages of the proceedings to protect the petitioner's statutory right to receive his full presentence confinement credit. See id., at 490,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684181\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/334/\">\n    68 A.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the present case, given that we can ascertain no reasonable basis from the record that supports the respondent's claim that trial counsel's failure to request a stay of execution was the product of a reasonable strategic decision, the distinction that the respondent draws between requesting a bond increase and requesting a stay of execution is not persuasive in respect to the issue presented in this appeal. Accordingly, we conclude, on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , that trial consel's failure to request a stay of execution once the sentence had been imposed constituted deficient performance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684181\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/334/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lastly, we address the prejudice prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   The petitioner claims that he was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to request a stay of execution for the Waterbury sentence because he was unable to apply sixteen days of presentence incarceration credits toward his controlling sentence in Meriden that he would have received if not for defense counsel's deficient performance.

Although the habeas court made no mention of prejudice or whether a more favorable outcome would have been likely had defense counsel acted differently, it acknowledged in its oral decision that \"[t]his\n   area of jail credits in Connecticut is extremely confusing ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"I will comment that while what is at issue here is whether [the petitioner] is entitled to receive sixteen days of jail credit and thereby be released slightly over two weeks earlier, that's not insignificant.
