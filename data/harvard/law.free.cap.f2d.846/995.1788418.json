As to both culprits, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-23\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-24\">In April 1987, appellants Miguel Hurtado and Henry Aguas pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. At appellants\u2019 sentencing hearing, however, Aguas moved to withdraw his guilty plea. After denying the motion, the district court sentenced Aguas to twelve years imprisonment and Hurtado to fifteen years imprisonment. Aguas and Hurtado timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-25\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-26\"><em>Hurtado\u2019s Sentence. </em>Hurtado appeals his fifteen-year sentence, contending that it violates due process because the district court (1) assigned no oral or written reasons for it as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(c) mandates, and (2) did not consider his cooperation with authorities, a relevant mitigating factor under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(n) and the new sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-27\">The statutes cited are inapplicable. First, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), which requires the district court to state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence, did not take effect until after Hurtado was sentenced. Although enacted in 1984, Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1987, 1987-90, \u00a7 3553 became effective on November 1, 1987. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 235(a)(1), 98 Stat. at 2031, and Sentencing Reform Amendments Act of 1985, Pub.L. No. 99-217, \u00a7 4, 99 Stat. 1728. Second, although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(n) requires the Sentencing Commission to promulgate sentencing guidelines that \u201creflect the general appropriateness\u201d of imposing lower sentences when defendants cooperate, the Commission\u2019s first guidelines did not become effective until November 1, 1987. United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, 52 Fed.Reg. 44,674, 44,675 (1987). Thus, the district court did not violate Hurtado\u2019s due process rights by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>not applying either \u00a7 3553 or the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">Hurtado\u2019s fifteen-year sentence is less than half the forty-year maximum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 846. Absent proof that impermissible motives or incorrect information influenced the district court, a sentence that falls within the statutory range will not be reversed. <em>United States v. Stovall, </em>825 F.2d 817, 826 <em>modified on another point, </em>833 F.2d 526 (5th Cir.1987). Hurtado offers no such proof, and his sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\"><em>Aguas\u2019s Guilty Plea. </em>The district court detailed the conspiracy charge and its elements to Aguas before accepting his plea, and Aguas indicated his understanding. In addition, Aguas accepted the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the factual basis for the plea as \u201caccurate and correct.\u201d Aguas testified that he was guilty of the acts charged, that he was pleading guilty for that reason, and that no one had induced or persuaded him to plead guilty. He added that he had discussed all possible defenses with his attorney and was satisfied with counsel\u2019s advice. Five weeks later, just nine days before sentencing, Aguas wrote to the district court seeking leniency, expressing \u201cdeep regret for [his] actions,\u201d and asserting that he wanted \u201cto pay for [his] mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">At sentencing, however, Aguas maintained his innocence and unsuccessfully moved to withdraw his plea. He testified that his attorney had pressured him to plead guilty by advising that a guilty verdict after trial would net a harsher sentence. The district court found Aguas\u2019s claim of innocence not credible because it contradicted his earlier testimony and recent letter. The district judge also noted his personal knowledge of defense counsel\u2019s integrity. On appeal Aguas contends that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Upon a showing of a \u201cfair and just reason,\u201d a district court may permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea at any time before sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d); <em>United States v. Benavides, </em>793 F.2d 612, 616 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 232, 93 L.Ed.2d 158 (1986). Rule 32 is applied liberally, but there is no absolute right to withdrawal. <em>Id. </em>In ruling on the motion, the district court is to consider: (1) whether the defendant has asserted his innocence; (2) whether withdrawal would prejudice the Government; (3) whether the defendant delayed in filing the motion and, if so, the reason for the delay; (4) whether withdrawal would substantially inconvenience the court; (5) whether close assistance of counsel was available to the defendant; (6) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; and (7) whether withdrawal would waste judicial resources. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1004, 105 S.Ct. 1865, 85 L.Ed.2d 159 (1985). The defendant has the burden of proving that withdrawal is justified, and the district court\u2019s ruling will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">The <em>Carr </em>factors support the court\u2019s ruling. Aguas first moved for withdrawal at sentencing, seven weeks after pleading guilty. He explained that during the interim he had been \u201cthinking and meditating how my attorney influenced me.\u201d Rule 32, however, was not intended \u201cto allow a defendant to make a tactical decision to enter a plea, wait several weeks, and then obtain a withdrawal if he believes that he made a bad choice.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>740 F.2d at 345. Moreover, Aguas was assisted by respected counsel, <em>see id., </em>and he concedes that the transcript indicates that his plea was knowing and voluntary. Aguas argues that withdrawal would not have prejudiced the Government, but that fact alone does not \u201cmandate permission to withdraw a plea when, as here, no credible reason is proffered.\u201d <em>United States v. Rasmussen, </em>642 F.2d 165, 168 n. 6 (5th Cir.1981). Nor does a claim of innocence, by itself, justify withdrawal. <em>Carr, </em>740 F.2d at 344. On this record it cannot be said that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\"><em>Aguas\u2019s Sentencing Hearing. </em>After refusing to permit Aguas to withdraw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>his guilty plea, the district court asked if Aguas had any \u201cchanges, corrections or alterations\u201d to his presentence report. In response, Aguas initiated the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-4\">THE WITNESS: I want to say that the report is a big mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-5\">THE COURT: I suppose it\u2019s a big mistake because you now claim you are innocent. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-6\">THE WITNESS: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-7\">THE COURT: Is there anything else you want to say before I impose sentence on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">THE WITNESS: None, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMk\">The court then sentenced Aguas. On appeal Aguas asserts that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) after Aguas challenged the presentence report as a big \u201cmistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">When a defendant asserts that any part of his presentence investigation report is factually incorrect, Rule 32(c)(3)(D) requires the sentencing judge to make, as to each matter controverted, \u201c(i) a finding as to the allegation, or (ii) a determination that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing.\u201d If the sentencing judge \u201cfails to make the requisite finding or determination, or if the finding or determination is ambiguous, the case must be remanded for resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>821 F.2d 1051, 1052 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">In <em>United States v. Aleman, </em>832 F.2d 142, 145 (11th Cir.1987), the Eleventh Circuit held that Rule 32(c)(3)(D) does not obligate a district court to make a finding or determination unless the defendant asserts \u201cwith specificity and clarity each factual mistake\u201d of which he complains. As the court noted, \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would oblige the district court to guess whether a challenge is being mounted as well as what defendant wishes to contest.\u201d <em>Id. accord United States v. Petty, </em>798 F.2d 1157, 1162 (8th Cir.1986), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">The <em>Aleman </em>rationale demonstrates that Aguas\u2019s argument has no merit. It is a sensible manner in which to treat such broadcast assertions as that made by Aguas, and we adopt the rule of <em>Aleman </em>for our Circuit. Aguas characterized his PSI as a \u201cbig mistake\u201d without raising any clear or specific objection of factual error; because that characterization did not suffice to trigger Rule 32(c)(3)(D), no response by the court was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
