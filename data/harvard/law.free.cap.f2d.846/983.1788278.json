SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1080-23\">Patsy Marie Galberth entered a conditional guilty plea to possession with the intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and a three-year special parole term. She asserts on appeal that the warrantless search of her person violated her constitutional rights, in that her acquiescence was not valid voluntary consent and even if it were, her consent was tainted by her improper detention and interrogation. We AFFIRM with reference to our recent <em>en banc </em>opinion in <em>United States v. Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d 593 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc) and the compatible prior panel decision in <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d 748 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-24\">I. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-25\">On the morning of June 26, 1987, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport were watching passengers disembarking from American Airlines Flight 6 arriving from Miami, Florida, when they observed an \u201cextremely nervous\u201d male passenger deplane. This passenger kept looking back toward the jetway as if he were waiting for someone. The Appellant, Patsy Marie Galberth, got off the same flight shortly after he did. DEA Officer Kirk Griffith observed Galberth and the male passenger appear to look at one another, and then observed Galberth walk about 20 to 30 feet behind the male passenger down the concourse toward another airline\u2019s ticket counter. The male passenger continually kept turning and looking at Galberth as they were walking down the concourse. She appeared to be nervous, and kept looking ahead at the male, but remained approximately 20 to 30 feet behind him as they walked from Gate 30 to Gate 36E. Galberth walked to the unsecured area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>the terminal, and then to the American Eagle section of the terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">As another DEA officer approached the male passenger, Officer Griffith approached Galberth, identified himself as a narcotics officer, and asked if he might speak with her. Galberth was \u201cstartled and rather nervous,\u201d but she voiced no objection. Officer Griffith asked to see Galberth\u2019s airline ticket, which she took from her purse and handed to him. It was a one-way cash fare from Miami, Florida, to Lawton, Oklahoma, via Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, issued that day in the name of \u201cBetty Davis.\u201d Officer Griffith returned Galberth\u2019s airline ticket and asked to see some identification. Gal-berth produced a hospital card with her real name on it. Officer Griffith noticed that the defendant\u2019s hands were shaking, and her voice was quivering during their conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">When questioned about the difference in the names on the ticket and the hospital card, Galberth stated that her maiden name was Davis. When he asked her why the two first names were different, she replied that her sister-in-law in Miami had purchased the ticket for her. Officer Griffith then returned the hospital card, and upon questioning, Galberth stated that she had been in Miami for twenty-four hours and had visited her sister-in-law and other friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Officer Griffith again identified himself as a narcotics agent and then asked to look in Galberth\u2019s purse and carry-on bag. Again, she consented. As Officer Griffith examined Galberth\u2019s purse and carry-on bag, another officer came and stood about ten feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">As Officer Griffith examined the contents of the purse and bag and engaged Galberth in conversation, he observed a bulge on her lower abdomen under her clothing, that did not appear to be a part of her body. When asked if she was carrying anything under her clothing, Galberth \u201cbecame visibly more nervous\u201d and appeared \u201cscared\u201d; she was shaking, the artery in her neck began to throb, and her voice was quivering, but she replied that she was not carrying anything under her clothes. Officer Griffith asked Galberth to press her hands against her abdomen in three different places, and on the third request Officer Griffith testified he could clearly see that the bulge was not part of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">Officer Griffith next asked Galberth if she would mind if a female officer patted her down for possible narcotics. She responded affirmatively by saying only \u201cOkay.\u201d Officer Griffith had the other officer who was nearby contact a female customs inspector to perform the search. From the time Officer Griffith first approached Galberth until the time she consented to be searched, approximately five minutes had elapsed. Officer Griffith and Galberth then waited an additional ten minutes in a lounge area of the airport for the customs inspector to arrive. She changed her shoes, and they engaged in \u201csmall talk,\u201d during which Galberth appeared to become more calm. At no time did she act as if she wished to withdraw her consent, although she had approximately ten minutes to reconsider her decision to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">When customs inspector Vicky Lovell arrived, she took Galberth into the women\u2019s public restroom. Inspector Lovell had Gal-berth place her hands on the side of the first available stall, and she conducted a pat-down. She felt a bulge in the midriff section and asked Galberth if it was part of her body. Galberth said it was not, and Inspector Lovell then removed a small package from between Galberth\u2019s pantyhose and underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">While she now says she voiced resistance to having her dress pulled up or otherwise being searched under her clothing, at no time did Galberth ask to leave the restroom or withdraw consent to the pat-down. At no time was Galberth asked to remove items of clothing, and Inspector Lovell did not directly touch her body except through her outer garments. Inspector Lovell thereafter gave the package to Officer Griffith, who inspected the pound-and-a-quarter bundle and its contents and identified the powder apparently to be cocaine. Galberth was placed under arrest and ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>vised then of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. All of her incriminating oral statements were made after the contraband was discovered and she had been formally arrested and <em>Mirand </em>ized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Galberth was indicted for possession with intent to distribute 447 grams of 91 <em>%- </em>strength cocaine. The district court denied Galberth\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence of the warrantless search of her person, whereupon Galberth entered a conditional plea of guilty pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). She was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment plus a three-year special parole term and a $50.00 special mandatory assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The facts of this case present the issue of whether the warrantless search of Gal-berth\u2019s person violated her constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Galberth argues that she did not voluntarily consent to the warrantless pat-down of her body, and that even if she had voluntarily consented, such consent was tainted by her previous illegal seizure. We agree with the district court that the government proved that Galberth voluntarily consented to both the initial questioning by Officer Griffith and the ultimate search of her person by Inspector Lovell. Finding the remaining issues disposed of by the closely analogous recent decisions in <em>United States v. Bengivenga </em>(non-custodial interrogation) and <em>United States v. Gonzales </em>(asking an airline passenger for her ticket), the conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">II. THERE WAS VALID CONSENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">The district court denied Galberth\u2019s motion to suppress because of her consent to being searched. Such a finding of consent will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In view of the totality of the circumstances, the district court\u2019s finding of a valid consent is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">The initial question is whether the government has proven that Galberth\u2019s consent to the search of her person was voluntary. <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1791, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>L.Ed.2d 382 (1968); <em>see Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2047, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <em>Davis, </em>749 F.2d at 294; <em>United States v. Parker, </em>722 F.2d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1983). The Supreme Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-4\">[T]he question whether a consent to a search was in fact \u2018voluntary\u2019 or was the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\"><em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. at 2047-48.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">This court has outlined six primary factors for consideration in determining whether consent to a search is knowing and voluntary: (1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse consent; (5) the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found. <em>United States v. Ruigomez, </em>702 F.2d 61, 65 (5th Cir.1983). \u201cCognizant at all times of the fact that acquiescence cannot substitute for free consent,\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 754 we have concluded that, although all of the above factors are highly relevant, no one of the six factors is dispositive or controlling of the voluntariness issue. <em>Id.; Ruigomez, </em>702 F.2d at 65; <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1023-24 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">These factors show nothing but a voluntary consent to the search here. All the questioning occurred in a public area of the airport and lasted only five minutes. There is no indication that Officer Griffith\u2019s requests were made in an intimidating manner. When he asked Galberth whether she would mind if a female officer patted her down for possible narcotics, she replied \u201cokay.\u201d Following her consent to the pat-down, Galberth and Officer Griffith waited in a public lounge area for approximately ten minutes and made \u201csmall talk.\u201d In fact, Galberth herself testified that Officer Griffith did not threaten her in any form or fashion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that he was nice to her. At no time did Galberth change her mind and withdraw her consent, though she was not specifically advised that she could.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-13\">Other facts that weigh in favor of the district court\u2019s finding of a valid consent to the search are Galberth\u2019s age, education, and prior experience with the criminal justice system. <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 555-57, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877-78, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980). In contrast to <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 755, where the \u201cyoung\u201d suspect was a 5'4\" tall Hispanic with only a sixth-grade education and whose native tongue was not English, Gal-berth was thirty-eight years old at the time of this incident, had no difficulty with English, and had an eleventh-grade education. She had a prior criminal record for larceny and also for shooting her husband, and had been advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights on both of these occasions. Galberth had been convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in early 1987, and was still under house arrest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Oklahoma at the time that she travelled to Miami and Dallas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The district court\u2019s finding of a valid consent to be searched is not outweighed by the fact that Galberth was never told that she had the right to withhold her consent, or the facts that she was very nervous and obviously acted against her own self-interest. While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor in determining voluntariness,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the failure to advise an individual of the right to withhold consent is not determinative in and of itself, and any weight accorded to such a failure is offset by Galberth\u2019s prior experience with her constitutional rights in a criminal setting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Galberth\u2019s nervousness, likewise, does not preclude a finding of voluntariness in the light of all the other facts and circumstances involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">As in <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 755 where the suspect certainly was aware that incriminating evidence would be disclosed by a search of her carry-on bag, the fact that Galberth acted against her own self-interest by consenting to the request of the officer to produce her airline tickets and identification and subsequently consenting to the search of her person is immaterial to the issue presented in her motion to suppress the fruits of the search. <em>Id. </em>at 755 n. 3; <em>Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d at 600-01. The Supreme Court rejected that argument in <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 555-56, 100 S.Ct. at 1878, stating:q</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-6\">It may happen that a person makes statements to law enforcement officials that he later regrets, but the issue in such cases is not whether the statement is self-protective, but rather whether it was made voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\"><em>See Berry, </em>670 F.2d at 598 n. 16. As this court recently said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-8\">In the purest sense, consent by suspects with knowledge that incriminating evidence will be discovered during a search would never be truly voluntary if self-interest were the primary focus of the voluntariness inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\"><em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 755 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">Based upon all the facts and circumstances of this case, Galberth\u2019s consent to the search of her person was voluntary. The district court\u2019s finding of a valid consent is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-13\">III. PROPRIETY OF GALBERTH\u2019S DETENTION AND SEIZURE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">Even before reaching the issue of whether Galberth voluntarily consented to the search, we must determine whether such consent was tainted by an illegal seizure. We recognize, in other words, that the taint of an unconstitutional seizure cannot be removed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent consent except where there are substantial intervening factors. <em>See Berry, </em>670 F.2d at 605. So we must identify the point at which the stop of Galberth became a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-15\">First, not all police-citizen contact invokes the fourth amendment, <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879 n. 16, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), though the courts \u201cshould closely scrutinize whether [the totality of] those circumstances reveals] the presence of coercion.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>670 F.2d at 596-97. Instead, there are three levels of police-citizen encounters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-16\">[ (1) ] communication between police and citizens involving no coercion or detention and therefore without the compass of the Fourth Amendment, [ (2) so-called <em>Terry </em>stops or] brief \u2018seizures\u2019 that must be supported by reasonable suspicion, and [ (3) ] full-scale arrests that must be supported by probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 591. <em>See Hanson, </em>801 F.2d at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-18\">At the first level, there is no element of detention or coercion, and the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>amendment is not implicated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The second level involves brief detentions or investigatory stops and requires \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d on the part of the detaining officer, based upon \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from these facts, reasonably warrant an intrusion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The third level, arrest, obviously requires the existence of probable cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">The facts establish that Officer Griffith initially approached Galberth and made inquiries that constituted the mere communication level of contact. <em>Hanson, </em>801 F.2d at 761. No coercion was shown by the officer\u2019s words or conduct, nor did he intimate that an innocent individual would certainly cooperate with police. In addition, prior to the search request, the officer\u2019s inquiries established that Galberth was attempting to hide her true identity by lying to the officers about her name. This action, coupled with her obvious anxiousness and the additional facts observed by the officers up to that point, constituted articulable facts that would reasonably warrant further inquiry by the officers. <em>United States v. Ehlebracht, </em>693 F.2d 333, 336-38 (5th Cir.1982). Furthermore, she was returning from a known source city for illegal narcotics, her airline ticket was a cash one-way ticket from Florida to Oklahoma, and she admitted to having been in Miami for only twenty-four hours. <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 752-53; <em>United States v. Elmore, </em>595 F.2d 1036, 1039 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 910, 100 S.Ct. 2998, 64 L.Ed.2d 861 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"AQC\">Officer Griffith\u2019s asking Galberth whether he could speak with her, and her subsequent consent, fall within the first level of police-citizen contact. The stop was extremely restricted in scope and was conducted in a completely non-coercive manner. After requesting to see Galberth\u2019s ticket and identification, Officer Griffith immediately returned them to her. Gal-berth was free to leave at any time, and in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that she was free to leave at any time. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877; <em>Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d at 596; <em>Chenault, </em>844 F.2d at 1128-29; <em>Zukas, </em>843 F.2d at 183; <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 751-52; <em>Berry, </em>670 F.2d at 594-95; <em>Elmore, </em>595 F.2d at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>In <em>Elmore, </em>this court held that a simple stop had occurred when a DEA agent approached Elmore, identified himself, and asked to see Elmore\u2019s ticket. The court further found that the stop became a seizure when the agent removed Elmore\u2019s ticket from the immediate vicinity, but that such seizure was lawful because the inconsistencies between Elmore\u2019s identification and story and the name on the ticket provided the reasonable suspicion necessary for seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 1039-40.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Although the officer\u2019s request for Gal-berth to allow him to examine her purse and bag for narcotics may be argued to have elevated the discussion to a <em>\u201cTerry</em>type\u201d detention, <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 752-53,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> she voluntarily consented to the examination. The interview was conducted in a public area of the airport terminal, not (as in <em>Bengivenga </em>and Chenault) in one of the private offices. There was no coercion or trickery on the part of the officer, and the interview was not prolonged or repetitious. The officer did nothing to lead her to believe that she had to consent to the search or that she was not free to leave. However, by the time of the search of her person, the officer had developed ample probable cause for further inquiry and a body search, even if Galberth had refused consent. <em>Zukas, </em>843 F.2d at 182-83; <em>Ehlebracht, </em>693 F.2d at 338; <em>Elmore, </em>595 F.2d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">Galberth testified at trial that from the moment Griffith confronted her with the fact that he was a narcotics officer, she felt that she had to do everything he \u201crequested\u201d or that she would go to jail. However <em>Michigan v. Chesternut, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 1980, 100 L.Ed.2d 565, acknowledges a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard. \u201cFourth Amendment protection does not vary with the state of mind of the particular individual being approached.\u201d; <em>Accord Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d at 597 (\u201c[T]he subjective belief of the subject [is] irrelevant to the custody determination.\u201d). Her knowledge (or her ignorance) that the other two men with Griffith were also law enforcement officers is similarly irrelevant beyond her presently-argued subjective apprehension that they were not going to let her go. During the pat-down in the women\u2019s restroom, the female customs inspector stood between Gal-berth and the single exit, but did not physically prevent her leaving. Galberth now says she told Inspector Lovell that she did not want to be searched under her dress; nonetheless, there is no evidence of compulsion except current complaints that the female officer told her that \u201cshe [the officer] had to\u201d search her dress and stockings and that in order to do that she had to pull the dress up. Galberth testified that Lovell never ordered her to do anything nor threatened her with arrest if she did not continue to cooperate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>Whether a suspect has actually been \u201cseized\u201d for purposes of the fourth amendment is determined by viewing \u201call circumstances surrounding the incident,\u201d and determining whether \u201ca reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877. <em>See Michigan v. Chesternut, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 108 S.Ct. at 1979, 1980, 100 L.Ed.2d 565, (\u201c[W]e adhere to our traditional contextual approach ..., [an] objective standard looking to the reasonable man\u2019s interpretation of the conduct in question.\u201d); <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 215, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1762, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1948) (\u201c[Viewing] all the circumstances surrounding the incident.\u201d). In the footnote following that comment, however, the <em>Mendenhall </em>Court stated that in determining whether an individual has actually been \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment, the subjective intent of the DEA agent to detain or, assumedly, <em>not </em>to detain, \u201cis irrelevant except insofar as that [intention] may have been conveyed to the respondent.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 554 n. 6, 100 S.Ct. at 1877 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">Subjective intention to hold, with or without a belief that proper probable cause exists, was one of the four factors applied by this court before <em>Bengivenga </em>to determine whether an interrogation occurred in a custodial context.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since Bengivenga\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>abolition of the four-factor test for custody, we must place more emphasis on footnote 6 of <em>Mendenhall. See Chestemut, </em>&amp;emdash; U.S. at- n. 7, 108 S.Ct. at 1980 n. 7, 100 L.Ed.2d 565. For example, recognizing that the officer\u2019s car was parked immediately in front of the suspect\u2019s plane and that the officer had not returned the pilot\u2019s documents, the panel in <em>Zukas </em>readily conceded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-6\">[I]t is clear from the facts ... [that the DEA agent] would have been most reluctant to let the plane fly away; however, his subjective intent is not important in determining whether an arrest was made and he made no statements during the investigation to indicate to Zukas that he would impede or prevent Zukas and his passenger from departing the area if they had been prepared to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">843 F.2d at 183. <em>See Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. v.

Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There, the Court found that what had begun as a consensual inquiry in a public place had escalated into a full-scale arrest when the subject was asked to accompany law enforcement officers \u201cto a room approximately 40 feet away, adjacent to the concourse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 103 S.Ct. at 1322. The subject was seen to have affirmatively \u201cconsented\u201d to the warrantless search of his luggage that revealed contraband,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but the Court held that since the subject was, in effect, under arrest on less than probable cause at the time he consented to the search in the \u201csmall enclosed area being confronted by two police officers,\u201d the consent was tainted and incapable of validating an otherwise illegal search. <em>Id. </em>at 501,103 S.Ct. at 1326. Thus, <em>Royer </em>differs from the instant case in that the consent was given in a secluded room, and Royer\u2019s luggage and ticket had been <em>confiscated </em>without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">It is true that Officer Griffith candidly admitted that, at the time Galberth was taken into the bathroom and searched, even if they could properly detain her, he and the other agents did not have a legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>sufficient probable cause to arrest her.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, the existence of probable cause to arrest is largely immaterial to the question of custody.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If a custodial investigation had been taking place, Galberth\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights would have been implicated, but even <em>Royer </em>indicates Galberth suffered no <em>constitutional </em>assault; the Court in <em>Royer </em>stated that had the suspect consented to a search on the spot (in the public area of the terminal rather than in the segregated, enclosed office), the search could have been conducted with him present (in the baggage claim area where the luggage was retrieved by the officer), an\u00e1 any evidence recovered would have been admissible against him \u2014 despite the <em>Miranda </em>violation. 460 U.S. at 505, 103 S.Ct. at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\"><em>Bengivenga </em>does not cite <em>Royer, </em>but parallels its reference to consensuality and segregation throughout the majority opinion. When a suspect validly consents to interrogation or physical investigation, there may in some cases be a seizure for fourth amendment purposes, requiring probable cause, but there is not necessarily the custodial relationship that implicates <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 752.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Consequently, even if the stop of Gal-berth transformed itself into a \u201cseizure\u201d for fourth amendment purposes, the \u201cseizure\u201d was supported by the requisite reasonable suspicion. <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Elmore </em>and <em>Gonzales, </em>there were inconsistencies between Galberth's identification on her ticket and her hospital card. Galberth's story that attempted to explain these inconsistencies was less than believable.

THE FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE DOCTRINE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">Assuming that she was indeed in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>Gal-berth, like the defendant in <em>Bengivenga, </em>argues that even the nontestimonial evidence of the cocaine package must be suppressed if it is tainted by a custodial interrogation that occurs in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-13\">This contention is contrary to the rule that a mere violation of Miranda's \u2018prophylactic\u2019 procedures does not trigger the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. The derivative evidence rule operates only when an actual constitutional violation occurs, as where a suspect confesses in response to coercion. None of the tactics employed by the agents were \u2018so offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned.\u2019 <em>Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\"><em>Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d at 601 (other citations omitted) (baggage claim stubs were non-testimonial and could not be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree, because there was only a <em>Miranda </em>violation, not a constitutional violation).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Galberth has failed to forward specific instances of taint to shift the burden of persuasion onto the government that the cocaine package would not have been inevitably discovered or was otherwise untainted. <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984). Because of our finding (in contrast to <em>Royer) </em>that she had not been illegally arrested at the time of the body search, the derivative-evidence rule and inevitable-discovery exception provide alternative bases for finding the poisoned-fruit argument unpersuasive. <em>See United States v.

CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">Based upon the foregoing, Galberth voluntarily consented to the search of her person, and that consent was not tainted by any previous illegal seizure. Even if Gal-berth was placed \u201cin custody\u201d at the time of her body search, the evidence should not have been suppressed, because it was non-testimonial and the derivative evidence rule was not triggered by an actual constitutional violation. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Galberth\u2019s motion to suppress, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">.

Since a fourth amendment seizure does not necessarily render a person \"in custody\" for purposes of <em>Miranda (Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 755), however, <em>Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d at 598, saw the \"critical difference\" between seizure and custody to be that custody arises only if the restraint on freedom reaches a certain degree \u2014 \"the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d <em>See Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877; <em>See also INS v.
