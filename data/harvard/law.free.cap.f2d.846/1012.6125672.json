We find that the meaning of the statute is plain, there was no fact issue for the lower courts to resolve, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-21\">Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, at 1201, et seq., was enacted to provide a particular form of reorganization for those classified by the statute as family farmers. A \u201cfamily farmer\u201d is defined in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(17) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-22\">\u201c(A) Individual or individual and spouse engaged in a farming operation whose aggregate debts do not exceed $1,500,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>000.00 and not less than 80% of whose aggregate non-contingent, liquidated debts (excluding a debt for the principal residence of such individual or such individual and spouse unless such debt arises out of a farming operation), on the date the case is filed, arise out of a fanning operation owned or operated by such individual or such individual and spouse, and such individual or such individual and spouse receive from such farming operation more than 50% of such individual\u2019s or such individual and spouse\u2019s gross income for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which the case concerning such individual or such individual and spouse was filed;\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">This language, although not a model of clarity, seems to establish three prerequisites for obtaining relief as a family farmer: (1) aggregate debts may not exceed $1,500,000.00; (2) 80% of the aggregate non-contingent liquidated debts (excluding a debt for the principal residence unless \u201csuch debt arises out of a farming operation\u201d) arise out of a farming operation; and (3) more than 50% of gross income for the year preceding the filing is received from a farming operation. The Reiners contend, however, that the parenthetical language excluding debt for a principal residence applies to the $1.5 million aggregate limitation as well as to the 80% farm-related debt criterion. We disagree. Had Congress intended the parenthetical exclusion of the debt for a principal residence to modify the $1.5 million limitation on aggregate debt, the legislators would have placed that parenthetical after the first reference to \u201caggregate debts\u201d in the statutory provision. Congress did not do so. Moreover, the parenthetical appears as part of a series of phrases modifying the 80% farm-related debt criterion as follows: debts making up at least 80% of the $1.5 million aggregate debt must be (1) noncontingent; (2) liquidated; (3) must qualify by the parenthetical exclusion of debt for a principal residence; (4) must be in existence on the date the case is filed; and (5) must arise out of a farming operation of the debtor or debtor and spouse. We cannot wrench the parenthetical out of this series without at the same time having to revise the meaning of the entire preceding portion of the sentence. Finally, this subsection separates itself neatly and with grammatical correctness into its three parts by means of two conjunctive \u201cand\u201d \u2019s under-lined in the statutory language. This symmetry would be destroyed if the parenthetical phrase were brought into the $1.5 million aggregate debt limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">The parties have cited no legislative history, and we have found none, indicating that Congress intended to define an individual family farmer in a way different than the ordinary language of the statute suggests. Our conclusion is the same as that reached in regard to identical language defining a \u201ccorporate\u201d family farmer in <em>In re Henderson Ranches, </em>75 B.R. 225 (Bkrtcy D.Ida.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Because it is undisputed that the aggregate debt reflected on the face of the Rein-ers\u2019 petition was greater than $1.5 million, they do not qualify for relief as \u201cfamily farmers\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">The judgment of the district court must be AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
