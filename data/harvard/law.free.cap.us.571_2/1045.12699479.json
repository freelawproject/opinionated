But the trial judge overrode the jury's decision and sentenced Woodward to death after hearing new evidence and finding, contrary to the jury's prior determination of the same question, that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The judge was statutorily entitled to do this under Alabama law, which provides that a jury's decision as to whether a defendant should be executed is merely an \"advisory verdict\" that the trial judge may override if she disagrees with the jury's conclusion. In the last decade, Alabama has been the only State in which judges have imposed the death penalty in the face of contrary jury verdicts. Since Alabama adopted its current statute, its judges have imposed death sentences on 95 defendants contrary to a jury's verdict.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  Forty-three of these defendants remain on death row today. Because I harbor deep concerns about whether this practice offends the Sixth and Eighth Amendments, I would grant Woodward's petition for certiorari so that the Court could give this issue the close attention that it deserves.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A list of these 95 defendants sentenced to death after a jury verdict of life imprisonment is produced in an appendix to this opinion. By contrast, where juries have voted to impose the death penalty, Alabama judges have overridden that verdict in favor of a life sentence only nine times.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In Alabama, a defendant convicted of capital murder is entitled to an evidentiary sentencing hearing before a jury. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-45, 13A-5-46 (2005). At that hearing, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one aggravating circumstance; otherwise, the defendant cannot be sentenced to death and instead receives a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. \u00a7 13A-5-45(e), (f). The defendant may present mitigating circumstances, which the State may seek to disprove by a preponderance of the evidence. \u00a7 13A-5-45(g). If it has found at least one aggravating circumstance, the jury then weighs the aggravating and mitigating evidence and renders its advisory verdict. If it finds that the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating circumstances, the jury must return a life-without-parole verdict; if it finds that the aggravating circumstances do outweigh the mitigating circumstances, it must return a death verdict. \u00a7 13A-5-46(e). A life-without-parole verdict requires a vote of a majority of the jurors, while a death verdict requires a vote of at least 10 jurors. \u00a7 13A-5-46(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the jury returns its advisory verdict, the trial judge makes her own determination whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances and imposes a sentence accordingly. \u00a7 13A-5-47. Alabama's statute provides that \"[w]hile the jury's recommendation concerning [the] sentence shall be given consideration, it is not binding upon the court.\" \u00a7 13A-5-47(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Woodward was convicted of capital murder for fatally shooting Keith Houts, a city of Montgomery police officer. By a vote of 8 to 4, the jury determined that the aggravating circumstances shown by the State did not outweigh the mitigating circumstances presented by the defense. It therefore recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial judge conducted his own sentencing proceeding. At that hearing, the State presented additional evidence concerning the mitigating circumstances presented to the jury. The trial judge, in part on the basis of the new evidence, rejected the jury's finding. Making his own determination that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the judge imposed the death penalty, thereby overriding the jury's prior advisory verdict of life without parole. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Woodward's conviction and sentence,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005298\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/123/989/\">\n    123 So.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206278294\">\n    2011 WL 6278294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 24, 2012), and the Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court has long acknowledged that death is fundamentally different in kind from any other punishment.

That leaves four States in which the jury has a role in sentencing but is not the final decisionmaker. In Nebraska, the jury is responsible for finding aggravating circumstances, while a three-judge panel determines mitigating circumstances and weighs them against the aggravating circumstances to make the ultimate sentencing decision. See Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 29-2520, 29-2521 (2008).

In the 1980's, there were 125 life-to-death overrides: 89 in Florida, 30 in Alabama, and 6 in Indiana. In the 1990's, there were 74: 26 in Florida, 44 in Alabama, and 4 in Indiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since 2000, by contrast, there have been only 27 life-to-death overrides, 26 of which were by Alabama judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As these statistics demonstrate, Alabama has become a clear outlier. Among the four States that permitted judicial overrides at the time of\n   <em>\n    Harris,\n   </em>\n   Alabama now stands as the only one in which judges continue to override jury verdicts of life without parole. One of the four States, Indiana, no longer permits life-to-death judicial overrides at all. See Ind.Code \u00a7 35-50-2-9(e) (2004). Only one defendant in Delaware has ever been condemned to death by a judicial life-to-death override, and the Delaware Supreme Court overturned his sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And no Florida judge has overridden a jury's verdict of a life sentence since 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, whereas judges across three States overrode roughly 10 jury verdicts per year in the 1980's and 1990's, a dramatic shift has taken place over the past decade: Judges now override jury verdicts of life in just a single State, and they do so roughly twice a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   What could explain Alabama judges' distinctive proclivity for imposing death sentences in cases where a jury has already rejected that penalty? There is no evidence that criminal activity is more heinous in Alabama than in other States, or that Alabama juries are particularly lenient in weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The only answer that is supported by empirical evidence is one that, in my view, casts a cloud of illegitimacy over the criminal justice system: Alabama judges, who are elected in partisan proceedings, appear to have succumbed to electoral pressures. See Symposium, Politics and the Death Penalty: Can Rational Discourse and Due Process Survive the Perceived Political Pressure? 21 Fordham Urban L.J. 239, 256 (1994) (comments of Bryan Stevenson) (concluding, based on \"a mini-multiple regression analysis of how the death penalty is applied and how override\n   is applied, [that] there is a statistically significant correlation between judicial override and election years in most of the counties where these overrides take place\"); see also Equal Justice Initiative, The Death Penalty in Alabama: Judge Override, at 16, http://eji. org/files/Override_Report.pdf (as visited on November 15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (hereinafter Override Report) (noting that the proportion of death sentences imposed by override in Alabama is elevated in election years). One Alabama judge, who has overridden jury verdicts to impose the death penalty on six occasions, campaigned by running several advertisements voicing his support for capital punishment. One of these ads boasted that he had \" 'presided over more than 9,000 cases, including some of the most heinous murder trials in our history,' \" and expressly named some of the defendants whom he had sentenced to death, in at least one case over a jury's contrary judgment. Override Report 16. With admirable candor, another judge, who has overridden one jury verdict to impose death, admitted that voter reaction does \" 'have some impact, especially in high-profile cases.' \" Velasco, More Judges Issue Death Despite Jury, Birmingham News, July 17, 2011, p. 11A. \" 'Let's face it,' \" the judge said, \" 'we're human beings.

For example, Alabama judges frequently override jury life-without-parole verdicts even in cases where the jury was unanimous in that verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In many cases, judges have done so without offering a meaningful explanation for the decision to disregard the jury's verdict. In sentencing a defendant with an IQ of 65, for example, one judge concluded that \" '[t]he sociological literature suggests Gypsies intentionally test low on standard IQ tests.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Override Report 20 (quoting Sentencing Order in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Another judge, who was facing reelection at the time he sentenced a 19-year-old defendant, refused to consider certain mitigating circumstances found by the jury, which had voted to recommend a life-without-parole sentence. He explained his sensitivity to public perception as follows: \" 'If I had not imposed the death sentence, I would have sentenced three black people to death and no white people.' \" Override Report 20 (quoting Tr. of Sentencing Hearing in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Alabama permits a defendant to present mitigating circumstances that weigh against imposition of the death penalty. See Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-51, 13A-5-52. Indeed, we have long held that a defendant has a constitutional right to present mitigating evidence in capital cases. See\n   <em>\n    Eddings v. Oklahoma,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304091\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/104/#p110\">\n    455 U.S. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304091\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/104/#p110\">\n    102 S.Ct. 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304091\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/104/#p110\">\n    71 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). And a defendant is eligible for the death penalty in Alabama only upon a specific factual finding that any aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors he has presented. See Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-46(e), 13A-5-47(e). The statutorily required finding that the aggravating factors of a defendant's crime outweigh\n   the mitigating factors is therefore necessary to impose the death penalty. It is clear, then, that this factual finding exposes the defendant to a greater punishment than he would otherwise receive: death, as opposed to life without parole. Under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ring,\n   </em>\n   a finding that has such an effect must be made by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The facts of this case underscore why Alabama's statute might run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   . After the State and Woodward presented evidence at the sentencing hearing, the jury found two aggravating factors, but it determined that the mitigating factors outweighed those aggravating factors, and it voted to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The judge then heard additional evidence before reweighing the aggravating and mitigating factors to reach the opposite conclusion from the jury. With respect to the first mitigating circumstance-Woodward's relationship with his children-the judge noted that he was \"underwhelmed\" by Woodward's family situation in light of the additional evidence that only he had heard. App. to Pet. for Cert. 80 (amended sentencing order). Rejecting the conclusion that Woodward had a positive influence on the lives of his young children, the judge opined: \"What young child does not adore a parent?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304091\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/104/#p110\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The judge further reasoned that Woodward's criminal history rendered him a \"very poor parenting role model.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 81. Moving to the second mitigating factor-Woodward's traumatic childhood-the judge concluded that the evidence of problems in Woodward's childhood did not \"withstand close scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   He noted that \"no documentation of abuse was introduced\"; speculated that Woodward's \"truncated academic career may well have been the result of his bringing weapons to school, not the result of family issues\"; suggested that Woodward's mother did not actually send him to live with his abusive father because no mother would \"sen[d] her children to live alone, unprotected with an abusive man\"; and found that it \"strain[ed] logic to accept the story that [Woodward's] father evicted him.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The judge opined that \"[w]hile [Woodward's] childhood was not the stuff of fairytales, his youth appear[ed] more idyllic than those of others [Woodward] called to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   And he concluded that the aggravating factors \"far outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 82.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the judge imposed the death penalty on Woodward only because he disagreed with the jury's assessment of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under our\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence, as it has evolved since\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   was decided, a sentencing scheme that permits such a result is constitutionally suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Eighteen years have passed since we last considered Alabama's capital sentencing scheme, and much has changed since then.
