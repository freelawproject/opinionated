Under\n   <em>\n    Harrington,\n   </em>\n   when a state court summarily rejects an appeal without clearly indicating whether the disposition was based on the merits of the claims presented or instead on procedural grounds, a federal habeas court must presume that the decision was on the merits, but the presumption may be overcome under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/770/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, when the state court makes it clear that a summary disposition was on the merits,\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   's rebuttable presumption has no application. A federal court may not probe beyond the state court's order to inquire whether the court accurately characterized its own decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In this case, the Sixth Circuit overlooked that important rule. The panel majority relied on a prior Sixth Circuit decision that had recognized-based on a long line of Michigan Court of Appeals cases-that the form of order used by the Michigan Court of Appeals in the present case invariably reflects a disposition on the merits. But the panel understood that prior decision nevertheless to allow it to look past the order to determine whether the state appellate court had meant what it said and actually based its disposition on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This was a fundamental error-and an important one. I would therefore grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder in Michigan state court and was sentenced to life in prison. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, and the Supreme Court of Michigan denied leave to appeal. Respondent then sought postconviction relief from a Michigan trial court, raising for the first time certain claims that his trial counsel had provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. The trial court held that those claims were procedurally defaulted and that respondent had failed to show cause or prejudice to excuse the default. Respondent requested leave to appeal, and the Michigan Court of Appeals denied his application \"for lack of merit in the grounds presented.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondent then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, and he requested that the court hold an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. A federal evidentiary hearing is permissible for a particular claim only if, among other requirements, the claim was not \"adjudicated on the merits by a state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Cullen v.

Based on evidence produced at that hearing, the District Court found cause and prejudice to excuse respondent's failure to raise the claims on direct appeal of his conviction, see\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

As a result, the District Court granted habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner appealed, and a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision in the postconviction appeal had not been on the merits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3648833\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/344/\">\n    703 F.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

There, the court considered the meaning of a Michigan Court of Appeals order identical to the one at issue here.

The\n   <em>\n    Werth\n   </em>\n   panel then held that the order represented a merits adjudication, although it first noted that no other provision of Michigan law, and nothing about the specific background of the case, gave reason to believe that the disposition had not been on the merits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514884\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/486/\">\n    692 F.3d, at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The panel majority in the case now before us interpreted\n   <em>\n    Werth\n   </em>\n   to mean that it is proper for a federal habeas court to disregard the form of order issued by the Michigan Court of Appeals and apply\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   's rebuttable presumption. Proceeding in this way, the panel majority held that respondent had rebutted that presumption because (1) the last reasoned state-court decision (by the Michigan trial court) had rested solely on respondent's procedural default, see\n   <em>\n    Ylst v.

And based on evidence that respondent had presented at the federal hearing, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's holdings that respondent had demonstrated cause and prejudice to excuse procedural default; that his trial counsel had been ineffective; and that, as a result, he was entitled to habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    After the Court of Appeals entered its order, the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal in an order stating that respondent had \"failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under [Michigan Court Rule] 6.508(D).\"\n    <em>\n     People v.

The\n    <em>\n     Harrington\n    </em>\n    rebuttable presumption comes into play only when a state court's order is ambiguous.

There is no dispute that respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims were \"issues raised\" by him before the Michigan Court of Appeals.

Rather, respondent could have prevailed on his claims only if he could have demonstrated an entitlement to relief under \u00a7 2254(d) on the state-court record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    In sum, the Sixth Circuit has gone astray in its analysis of habeas cases in which the Michigan Court of Appeals denies review using the form of order at issue here. And this error may derail many Michigan habeas cases. I can understand the Court's reluctance to decide what the form of order at issue means under Michigan law. But I would grant the petition and vacate the decision below because the Sixth Circuit made a severe error of federal law. On remand, I would direct the Sixth Circuit to decide whether, as another panel of that court clearly stated,\n    the form of order at issue represents a merits disposition. If so, the\n    <em>\n     Harrington\n    </em>\n    presumption has no place in the court's analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
