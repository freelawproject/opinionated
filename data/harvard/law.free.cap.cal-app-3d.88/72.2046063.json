J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar5\">Defendant Robert A. Moesch (Moesch) appeals from a judgment entered by the trial court in an unlawful detainer action upon a motion by plaintiff Union Oil Company of California (Union) for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Union\u2019s complaint alleged a lease agreement between Union as lessor and Moesch as lessee, executed on July 31, 1973, for real property which was to be used by Moesch to operate a gasoline service station. A copy of the lease was attached to the complaint as \u201cExhibit \u2018A\u2019 \u201d and incorporated therein by reference. The lease contained the following pertinent language: \u201cThe term of the lease commences July 31, 1973, and terminates July 30, 1976. The Lease ends automatically and without notice on the termination date. If the Lessee remains in possession of the Station after the termination date with Union\u2019s expressed or implied consent, Lessee is a tenant from month to month on the terms and conditions specified herein. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The complaint further alleged that Moesch entered into possession on or about July 31, 1973; that pursuant to the above quoted language he became a month-to-month tenant on July 31, 1976; that on January 6, 1977, Union gave Moesch notice it was terminating the lease effective March 16, 1977; that said termination was \u201cfor good cause and legitimate business reasons\u201d; and that although the lease was duly terminated on March 16, 1977, Moesch refused to vacate and surrender possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Moesch\u2019s first amended answer denied that there was good cause for termination of the lease, and affirmatively alleged the existence of a franchise arrangement between Union and Moesch (consisting of the lease and a separate \u201cRetail Dealer Gasoline Storage and Purchase Agreement\u201d), the applicability of Business and Professions Code section 20999.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as required by said code section, the lack of good cause to terminate the lease. The first amended answer also contained other affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Union\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was, in part, premised on the theory that the factual issue of good cause to terminate the lease was immaterial because section 20999.1 was enacted subsequent to the creation of the instant leasehold and thus could not be constitutionally applied here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree and reverse the judgment for the reasons to be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Section 20999.1 (fn. 1, <em>ante) </em>represents an attempt on the part of the Legislature to correct certain abuses it perceived to exist in franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>arrangements between petroleum distributors and retail gasoline dealers. In enacting the statute, the Legislature declared that such arrangements affect \u201cthe general economy of the state, the public interest and the public welfare.\u201d (Stats. 1975, ch. 640, \u00a7 2, p. 1390.) By correcting the perceived abuses, the Legislature hoped to insure the continued availability to the public of a vital energy resource like gasoline at prices which reflect competitive and nondiscriminatory practices in the industry. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Section 20999.1 seeks to bring about the intended results by prohibiting a petroleum distributor from terminating or failing to renew a retail gasoline franchise \u201cwithout good cause.\u201d The term \u201cgood cause\u201d is expressly defined in the statute and includes, among other grounds for termination or nonrenewal, the existence of \u201clegitimate business reasons\u201d (defined in a limited manner in the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We note initially that there is no dispute between the parties as to whether the subject lease should be deemed part of a retail gasoline \u201cfranchise\u201d as that term is defined in section 20999 (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>the companion statute to section 20999.1. Indeed, Union stated in its points and authorities filed in support of the motion for judgment on the pleadings that \u201c[t]he service station lease here in question would be considered a \u2018franchise\u2019 [under section 20999] since it is an agreement between a petroleum distributor and a gasoline dealer under which the dealer is granted to [s/c] right to occupy premises owned, leased or controlled by Union for the purpose of engaging in the retail sale of petroleum products.\u201d Furthermore, in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Handley (1978) </em>76 Cal.App.3d 956 [143 Cal.Rptr. 321], the court expressly recognized that in a fact situation like that presented here the landlord-tenant relationship generally exists only to facilitate a franchise arrangement between the parties, and that defenses arising from the franchise arrangement may therefore be properly raised in an unlawful detainer action. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 962-963; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 <em>1174, </em>subd. (a), eff. Jan. 1, 1978 (fn. 4, <em>infra).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The parties do, however, dispute the applicability of section 20999.1. As in the court below, Union contends that because the statute did not become effective until January 1, 1976, it would constitute an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contracts and infringe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>upon Union\u2019s vested rights if the statute were applied to a lease which had been in existence since July of 1973. Moesch controverts Union\u2019s contention in this regard, arguing that no impairment of contract or vested property rights would occur since the subject lease terminated automatically on July 30, 1976, and was thereafter renewed on a month-to-month basis <em>subsequent </em>to the statute\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that a statute may not, in general, be applied retroactively so as to impair an existing contractual obligation or deprive a person of a vested property right. (See <em>Estate of Gill </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 496, 501 [96 Cal.Rptr. 786].) Both the United States and California Constitutions specifically incorporate clauses prohibiting impairment of contracts (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9; see 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 619, p. 3918) and the cases are legion which recognize this precept (see <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 509, 519 [310 P.2d 634], and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Were Moesch attempting to apply section 20999.1 to the original lease which was executed some two and one-half years prior to the effective date of the statute, we would be compelled, in accord with the decision in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Handley, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d 956, to hold any such attempted application unconstitutional. In the cited case, Division Two of this court held that an unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights would result if section 20999.1 were applied retroactively to a lease which had been executed (and, in that case, terminated without renewal) prior to the statute\u2019s effective date. <em>(Id., </em>\u00e1t pp. 964-965; see also <em>Globe Liquor Co. </em>v. <em>Four Roses Distillers Company </em>(Del. 1971) 281 A.2d 19,21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The present case, however, is distinguishable from the situation contemplated in <em>Mobil Oil. </em>Here, the original lease, by its own terms, terminated \u201cautomatically\u201d on July 30, 1976. On that date, both parties were free of all obligations and conditions imposed by that lease. Furthermore, since the lease provided that Union\u2019s, express or implied consent was required to continue the tenancy on a month-to-month basis, Union was, on July 30, completely at liberty to immediately reclaim its property and thus exercise whatever contractual or property rights had become vested under the original agreement between the parties. Instead, Union chose to negotiate with Moesch and thereafter to give its approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to the creation of a new, month-to-month arrangement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Dardarian </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 248, 253-255 [147 Cal.Rptr. 761], wherein this court held that defendant lessees were not liable for rent incurred by their assignee during a holdover period which was at the express discretion of the lessor; the rationale was that the month-to-month holdover was a new arrangement rather than a continuation of the original lease.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In view of the above, using the good cause standard set forth in section 20999.1 to test the legality of Union\u2019s termination of the instant tenancy would not impair any contractual or property rights enjoyed by Union under the original agreement since that agreement terminated and was supplanted by the month-to-month arrangement. (Cf. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Paradee Oil Co., Inc. </em>(Del. 1975) 343 A.2d 610, 611-612, wherein the Supreme Court of Delaware held that the application of the state\u2019s franchise security act to petroleum distributorship franchises which were renewed subsequent to the act\u2019s enactment would not constitute an unconstitutional impairment of any contractual obligations.) Thus, when the present parties entered into negotiations upon the termination of the original lease and then agreed upon the new, periodic arrangement, it must be inferred that all law then applicable, including sections 20999 and 20999.1, became a part of their agreement. <em>(Bodle </em>v. <em>Bodle </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 758, 764 [143 Cal.Rptr. 115]; <em>Masonite Corp. </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 1, 8 [135 Cal.Rptr. 170].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Having determined that section 20999.1 may be constitutionally applied in the case at bench, the disposition we must reach is manifest.  In ruling on Union\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court was obliged to accept as true the portion of Moesch\u2019s answer alleging as a material fact that Union\u2019s termination of the lease was without good cause. (See <em>Baillargeon </em>v. <em>Department of Water &amp; Power </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 670, 676 [138 Cal.Rptr. 338]; <em>Hospital Council of Northern Cal. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 331, 337-338 [106 Cal.Rptr. 247].) Since the pleadings thus disclosed the possibility of an affirmative defense under section 20999.1, it was error to grant Union\u2019s motion. (See <em>Richter </em>v. <em>United Calif. Theatres, Inc. </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 126, 128 [1 Cal.Rptr. 895]; <em>Barasch </em>v. <em>Epstein </em>(1957) 147 Cal.App.2d 439, 442 [305 P.2d 283].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In light of our holding herein, we deem it unnecessary to discuss Moesch\u2019s contention that Code of Civil Procedure section 1174,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as amended effective January 1, 1978, relates only to procedural matters in requiring a showing of good cause in unlawful detainer actions like the present one, and therefore may be applied retroactively. (See 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Constitutional Law, \u00a7 627, pp. 3924-3926.) Nor do we reach other arguments advanced by Moesch.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Allport, J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Business and Professions Code section 20999.1 is preceded by the following list of definitions in section 20999:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab3\">\u201cAs used in this chapter, the term:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqs\">(a) \u2018Petroleum distributor\u2019 means any person engaged in the sale, consignment, or distribution of petroleum products to retail outlets which it owns, leases, or otherwise supplies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>(b) \u2018Gasoline dealer\u2019 means any person engaged in the retail safe of petroleum products in this state under a franchise or contractual agreement entered into with a petroleum distributor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAml\">(c) \u2018Franchise\u2019 means any agreement between a petroleum distributor and a manufacturer or between a gasoline dealer and a petroleum distributor under which the petroleum distributor or the gasoline dealer is granted the right to use a trademark, trade name, service mark, or other identifying symbol or name owned by the manufacturer or distributor, or an agreement between a petroleum manufacturer or distributor, and a distributor or dealer under which the petroleum distributor or the gasoline dealer is granted the right to occupy premises owned, leased, or controlled by the other party to the agreement, for the purpose of engaging in the retail or wholesale sale of petroleum products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aup\">Section 20999.1 then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKO\">\u201cNotwithstanding the terms of any franchise, no franchisor shall terminate, cancel or refuse to renew any existing franchise <em>without good cause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAA4\">\u201cAs used in this section good cause is limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Q\">(a) The gasoline dealer or petroleum distributor failed to comply with essential and reasonable requirements of the franchise agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALx\">(b) The gasoline dealer or petroleum distributor failed to act in good faith in carrying out the terms of the franchise; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad4\">(c) For other legitimate business reasons (except that a termination, or cancellation of a franchise for the purpose of enabling the petroleum distributor or manufacturer to assume operation of the distributor\u2019s or gasoline dealer\u2019s business shall not be considered to be a legitimate business reason unless the gasoline dealer or distributor is paid reasonable compensation for the value of his franchise, including a reasonable amount for goodwill).\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL3J\">Unless otherwise indicated, all code section references hereinafter are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-15\">In granting Union\u2019s first motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was instead treated as a demurrer to Moesch\u2019s answer, the trial court noted in its minute order dated August 1, 1977, that \u201c[t]he principal basis for the ruling is the Court\u2019s view that defendant\u2019s reliance upon . . . section 20999.1 as applying to contracts entered into before its effective date runs afoul of the constitutional prohibition upon impairing contractual obligations. No sufficient \u2018emergency\u2019 exception has been alleged.
