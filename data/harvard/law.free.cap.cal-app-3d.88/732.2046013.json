Nevertheless, Deisinger\u2019s suspicions were aroused. He called on his radio for a backup, turned his car around to follow defendants\u2019 vehicle, stopped it and requested both occupants\u2014driver and passenger\u2014to produce I.D.\u2019s. The driver, Davis, did; but his passenger, Snowden, possessed none. Meanwhile, pursuant to the radio call, another officer, Johnson, had gone to the parking lot and there discovered an abandoned suitcase\u2014as Deisinger knew prior to the arrival at the detention scene of a third officer, Cost. But while Johnson told Officer Cost he had stopped the car because of suspicious activity, he did not impart to him the particular fact of the suitcase having been discovered before Cost shone a flashlight into the suspects\u2019 car and observed, in plain view, items known to him in his police experience to be typical auto burglary tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Deisinger and Cost thereupon ordered the occupants out of their car, searched its trunk and found stolen property and a bent screwdriver\u2014evidence pragmatically but not necessarily legally justifying Deisinger\u2019s original suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The sole issue presented on this appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion that <em>the </em>detention\u2014not the subsequent search\u2014was unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">It is settled in California law that a police officer is justified in stopping and briefly detaining a person for questioning or other limited investigation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickelson </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 448, 450 [30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658].) The reasonableness of any particular invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security, however, has been and must be measured by objective standards. Some activity relating to crime must have occurred or be about to occur, and the person the officer intends to stop must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>reasonably<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appear to be involved in that activity. <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Measured by this standard, the conduct in question seems entirely innocuous. As earlier observed, only the position of the car, the lateness of the hour and, it may be, the proximity of defendants to a motel\u2014still regarded in some quarters as a center of opprobrious activity\u2014could remotely be seen as \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Recently, this division upheld the reasonableness of a detention which occurred under similar circumstances in a high burglary area, but the activity we held to justify detention there was driving a vehicle on a private and deadend road, after business hours, in an area where no commercial activity was taking place. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moreno </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 962 [134 Cal.Rptr. 322].) The essential and in our mind determinative distinction here is that, when first observed, defendants\u2019 activities did not objectively appear in the slightest degree criminally surreptitious, for they were standing in the lighted parking lot of a major motel, in a commercial area on the El Camino Real where several all-night restaurants operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">I accordingly find that substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Although the appeal purports to be from the order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress, an unappealable order, we treat the notice of appeal as a premature notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>appeal from the contemporaneous dismissal. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1238, subds. (a)(7) and (c); cf. \u00a7 1538.5, subds.

J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A6i\">In disapproving the <em>Irwin </em>dictum <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 894 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957]), our Supreme Court has not\u2014as implied by the dissent\u2014rejected or otherwise abrogated the rules governing detention as formulated in its earlier decisions. (See <em>In re Tony C., supra, </em>at pp. 892-893; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 384, 388-389 [124 Cal.Rptr. 536, 540 P.2d 632] [cert, den., 425 U.S. 934 (48 L.Ed.2d 175, 96 S.Ct. 1664)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 85, 91 [115 Cal.Rptr. 225, 524 P.2d 353]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gale </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 788, 797-798 [108 Cal.Rptr. 852, 511 P.2d 1204]; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 423, 426-427 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 674, 682-683 [72 Cal.Rptr. 800, 446 P.2d 800] [overruled on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Cal.3d 630, 641 (139 Cal.Rptr. 594, 566 P.2d 228)].) The underlying rationale that the circumstances known to the police officer include specific and articulable facts causing him to reasonably suspect some crime-related activity involving the detainee has been reaffirmed rather than rejected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Tony C., supra, </em>at p. 893.) In applying those traditional principles, as clarified by <em>Tony </em>C.\u2019s requirement that the perceived activity need only be rationally consistent with criminality, it is our duty to review the circumstances of the detention for constitutional validity based upon the findings below where supported by substantial evidence, as here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawler </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 160 [107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Keithley) </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 406, 410 [118 Cal.Rptr. 617, 530 P.2d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">It bears repeating that our function in reviewing errors of law does not include rejection of a supported factual determination concerning the crucial question whether the officer\u2019s suspicion was objectively reasonable in undertaking the challenged detention. Where that determination negates the criminal nexus between subjective perceptions and activity, we may not disregard it simply because the evidence and permissible inferences might support findings contrary to those made by the trial judge, the exclusive trier of fact. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawler, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 156, 160.) If we do not faithfully adhere to that duty, then we could unwittingly contribute to the potential for random interrogations admonished by the court. (See <em>In re Tony C, supra, </em>at p. 897.)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Curiously, the unusual conclusion reached in the dissent is itself at odds with the earlier statements therein recognizing such firmly established principles. (See dis. opn. of Elkington, J. at pp. 736-737, 738 and 740.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b556-5\">ELKINGTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsrJ\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The instant appeal was transferred to us by the Supreme Court <em>\u201cfor reconsideration in the light of In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) I think we have not, at least not properly, done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We are concerned <em>only </em>with the relation of the Fourth Amendment to a temporary police detention of a person, upon suspicion that he is engaged in criminal activity. My esteemed colleagues agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The state\u2019s high court had tersely stated the applicable rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gale, 9 </em>Cal.3d 788, 797-798 [108 Cal.Rptr. 852, 511 P.2d 1204], as follows: \u201c \u2018While a detention of a citizen by a police officer based on a \u201cmere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>hunch\u201d [italics added] is unlawful, if there is a rational <em>suspicion </em>that some activity out of the ordinary is taking place, and some <em>suggestion </em>that the activity is related to crime, a detention is permissible.\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>15 Cal.3d 384, 388-389 [124 Cal.Rptr. 536, 540 P.2d 632] [cert, den., 425 U.S. 934 (48 L.Ed.2d 175, 96 S.Ct. 1664)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>12 Cal.3d 85, 91 [115 Cal.Rptr. 225, 524 P.2d 353].)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The \u201crational suspicion\u201d of <em>People </em>v. <em>Gale, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 788, need not have been a <em>strong suspicion, </em>for in that case the policeman would have probable cause for an arrest. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn, </em>18 Cal.3d 889, 894 [135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872].) \u201c[Circumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may still justify an officer\u2019s stopping pedestrians or motorists on the streets for questioning.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickelson, </em>59 Cal.2d 448, 450 [30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 384, 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">But in the application of the rule, the dividing line between \u201cmere hunch\u201d and <em>\u201csuspicion\u2019'\u2019 </em>or \u201csuggestion\u201d was often uncertain. What some courts recognized as a \u201chunch,\u201d others viewed as the required \u201csuspicion\u201d or \u201csuggestion,\u201d and vice versa. And the uncertainty was compounded by dicta found in <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 423, 427 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12]: \u201cWhere the events are as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on those events is unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>In re Tony C, </em>21 Cal.3d 888 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957], to which our consideration is commended, undertook to clarify the rule. In disapproving the above noted dicta of <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201c[A] reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity will justify a temporary stop or detention. Under that standard, <em>if the circumstances are \u2018consistent with criminal activity,\u2019 they permit\u2014even demand\u2014an investigation: </em>the public rightfully expects a police officer to inquire into such circumstances \u2018in the proper discharge of the officer\u2019s duties.\u2019 . . . No reason appears for a contrary result simply because the circumstances are also \u2018consistent with lawful activity,\u2019 as may often be the case. The possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to \u2018enable the police to quickly determine whether they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u2019 \u201d (21 Cal.3d, p. 894.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Thus, in the clearest language, the court has announced that if the circumstances apparent to the policeman are \u201cconsistent with criminal activity,\u201d the required \u201crational suspicion\u201d is necessarily justified, and an ensuing temporary investigative detention is in constitutional accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">But <em>Tony C. </em>also makes clear that the detention itself must be <em>reasonable </em>in its scope, duration, and manner. For: \u201cThe guiding principle, as in all issues arising under the Fourth Amendment and under the California Constitution ... is \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u2019 \u201d (21 Cal.3d, p. 892; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingle, </em>53 Cal.2d 407, 413 [2 Cal.Rptr. 14, 348 P.2d 577] [cert, den., 364 U.S. 841 (5 L.Ed.2d 65, 81 S.Ct. 79)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">And in any judicial determination whether the circumstances apparent to the policeman are \u201cconsistent with criminal activity,\u201d proper respect will be paid to police expertise. For, \u201c \u2018[ejxperienced police officers naturally develop an ability to perceive the unusual and suspicious which is of enormous value in the difficult tasks of protecting the security and safety of law-abiding citizens. The benefit thereof should not be lost because the cold record before a reviewing court does not contain all the particularized perceptions which may have been so meaningful at the scene.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Peoples. Gale, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 788, 795-796.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">I look to the record of the case before us, in determining whether the circumstances here apparent to the policeman were \u201cconsistent with criminal activity,\u201d according to <em>Tony C. </em>If so, it is of no consequence that they were also \u201cconsistent with lawful activity\u201d for, as noted, <em>Tony C. </em>says: \u201cThe possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to \u2018enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u2019 \u201d (21 Cal.3d, p. 894.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">There is no dispute on the evidence as presented to the magistrate, and then to the superior court, on Davis\u2019 and Snowden\u2019s Penal Code section 1538.5 motion to suppress. The superior court therefore \u201c \u2018resolved no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>conflicts in the evidence since there were none,\u2019 \u201d and the determination of <em>Tony </em>C.\u2019s \u201csuspicion of criminal conduct\u201d and \u201creasonableness\u201d as applied to the facts of this case is now for this court alone. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 586, 602-603 [109 Cal.Rptr. 531]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Leighter, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 389, 396 [93 Cal.Rptr. 136] [disapproved on other grounds <em>Madrilv. Superior </em>Court, 15 Cal.3d 73, 77-78 (123 Cal.Rptr. 465, 539 P.2d 33)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">A lone policeman was driving his clearly marked patrol car around 4 o\u2019clock one morning in a \u201cmotel-business\u201d area where (as found by the magistrate) there had been \u201can extreme rash of motel and automobile burglaries . . . .\u201d Alert, and as a police officer should, he was looking for \u201csuspicious circumstances.\u201d Cruising his recognizable police vehicle past a motel facing the far side of the street, he observed an automobile in the rear area of the motel\u2019s parking lot. The vehicle was not properly parked within the lot\u2019s \u201cwhite lines,\u201d and \u201cobviously . . . somebody wasn\u2019t just getting in and out from the motel.\u201d And the vehicle was immediately adjacent to several properly parked cars. Doors of the automobile were open, there was a man on either side of it, and the officer couldn\u2019t tell what they were doing. No reason appeared for anybody at that time of the morning \u201cto be in the lot. . . clearly blocking . . . about three or four other cars so they couldn\u2019t get out of the lot, so it wasn\u2019t a place where somebody had parked all night.\u201d The officer quickly made a U-tum, but in the few intervening seconds the suspect automobile had left the motel\u2019s parking lot and was being driven away.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The officer decided \u201cjust to check out for two possible actual burglary suspects in the motel, because we have had so many vehicle burglaries in that particular area,. . .\u201d He called, for a \u201cback-up\u201d over the police radio and asked that the motel parking lot be checked for criminal activity. The departing vehicle, occupied by Davis and Snowden, was soon stopped, and while the officer was examining the driver\u2019s identification the police radio announced discovery in the motel parking lot of a suitcase filled with seemingly stolen property. It was apparently left behind in Davis\u2019 and Snowden\u2019s flight upon seeing the passing police car. Soon the back-up officer arrived; he was at the moment told only by the other busy officer that the vehicle was stopped \u201cfor suspicious activity in one of the motel parking lots.\u201d The newly arrived officer \u201cwent up and shone [his] light [through the \u201crear and side windows\u201d] in the back seat area of the car to check for other persons or weapons.\u201d He there observed in plain view a \u201ccrowbar,\u201d \u201cleather gloves,\u201d \u201cburglary tools,\u201d and particularly an \u201cauto jack-pry tool.\u201d In respect of the latter he said, \u201cI have seen them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>used to piy open trunks, locked hoods .... I saw one fellow remove a whole rear window with one, and I have seen one . . . peel away an auto door with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">As a result of the above described police activity much stolen property was recovered. It implicated Davis and Snowden in many burglaries, including three which had occurred elsewhere within an hour of their sighting by the cruising police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As stated by my colleagues, the \u201csole issue presented on this appeal is whether . . . <em>the </em>detention\u2014not the subsequent search\u2014was unreasonable\u2014and hence unconstitutional . . . .\u201d The unreasonableness found by them relates to the detention itself, not its scope, or duration, or manner. Assuming, arguendo, the detention\u2019s validity no fault is found with the ensuing police conduct. And it might here be pointed out that an officer, standing where he has a right to be, may lawfully examine a motor vehicle\u2019s interior through its windows with a flashlight. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1012 [124 Cal.Rptr. 737]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 1065, 1068 [105 Cal.Rptr. 56]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bright, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d 926, 930 [84 Cal.Rptr. 691].)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In my respectful opinion, the record conclusively manifests (as was later demonstrated) that the circumstances apparent to the policeman were \u201cconsistent with criminal activity.\u201d The current \u201cextreme rash of motel and automobile burglaries\u201d were being perpetrated in the dead of night in motel parking areas by the use of nearby getaway cars in which the stolen property might be transported, by persons who might reasonably be expected to flee upon sighting nearby, a cruising police vehicle. The policeman\u2019s observations permitted\u2014\u201ceven demanded] \u2014an investigation [because] the public rightfully expects a police officer to inquire into such circumstances \u2018in the proper discharge of the officer\u2019s duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 888, 894.) The only means of inquiry \u201cinto such circumstances\u201d was the investigative vehicle stop and detention. Had the policeman chosen to first examine the motel parking lot for crime indications, the culprits would have disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">It follows, I conclude, that the investigative vehicle stop and detention of this appeal comported fully with <em>Tony C. </em>and Fourth Amendment requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">It is noted that the superior court\u2019s \u201cOpinion and Order,\u201d entered before <em>Tony C., </em>was based on the premise that \u201cthe suspects\u2019 actions while in the parking lot were quite consistent with actions of people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>having a legitimate right to be on the premises.\u201d My colleagues\u2019 opinion seems founded on a requirement that within the policeman\u2019s observation \u201c[s]ome activity relating to crime must have occurred or be about to occur,...\u201d Both rationales, as pointed out, are contrary to, and expressly rejected by, <em>Tony C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">I would sustain the ruling of the magistrate, and reverse the order and judgment of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 20, 1979. Elkington, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 12, 1979.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
