J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9r\">Following a jury trial in the Long Beach Municipal Court, defendant David Lee Barben (Barben) was convicted of violating section 4050 of the Business and Professions Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That section, with exceptions not relevant here, makes it a misdemeanor for any person \u201cto manufacture, compound, sell or dispense any drug, poison or chemical, or to dispense or compound any prescription of a medical practitioner unless he is a registered pharmacist under the provisions of [chapter 9 of division 2 of the Business and Professions Code].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Upon appeal to the appellate department of the superior court, Barben succeeded in obtaining a reversal of his conviction. Pursuant to rule 62 of the California Rules of Court, we ordered transfer of the cause to this court to settle an important question of law. As will be developed in the discussion to follow, we hold that Barben\u2019s conviction must be reversed since section 4050 is unconstitutionally vague as applied in the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On September 14, 1976, Barben was employed at an adult bookstore where a bottled product, labeled \u201cLocker Room,\u201d was offered for sale. \u201cLocker Room,\u201d which retailed for $6, was a room odorizer whose function was to reproduce the odor associated with its name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the day in question, a police officer purchased a bottle of \u201cLocker Room\u201d from Barben, who was at the time neither a registered pharmacist nor working under the direction of one; this action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Barben was prosecuted under the portion of section 4050 which prohibits the sale of a \u201cpoison\u201d by any person other than a registered pharmacist.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At Barben\u2019s trial, evidence was received showing that chemical analysis had revealed \u201cLocker Room\u201d to contain from 12 to 16 percent butyl nitrite. The jury was instructed that butyl nitrite is subject to the provisions of section 4050 since it is defined as a poison by section 4160.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court rejected an offer of proof by Barben designed to show that butyl nitrite has no pharmaceutical use or application.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">One of the cardinal rules of statutory interpretation is that statutes should, if their language permits, be construed so as to render them valid and constitutional rather than invalid and unconstitutional. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Amor </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 20, 30 [114 Cal.Rptr. 765, 523 P.2d 1173].) A statute is presumed to be valid and mere doubt is not sufficient to overcome the presumption. <em>(In re Dennis M. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 444, 453 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296]; see <em>Findley </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 566, 570 [133 Cal.Rptr. 241].)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">On the other hand, due process demands that those subject to a state\u2019s penal laws be sufficiently informed as to what is commanded or forbidden before they may be prosecuted thereunder; no one is to be required to speculate as to the meaning of a penal statute at peril of his or her life, liberty or property. <em>(Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey (1939) </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 [83 L.Ed. 888, 890, 59 S.Ct. 618]; <em>Findley </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, 62 </em>Cal.App.3d 566, 570.) It is thus well established that \u201ca statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d <em>(Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co. </em>(1926) 269 U.S. 385, 391 [70 L.Ed. 322, 328, 46 S.Ct. 126]; see also <em>Findley </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We conclude that section 4050, as interpreted in conjunction with section 4160, fails to attain the degree of certainty as to its application necessary to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The question which initially arises in this regard is whether section 4050 was ever intended to be applied to butyl nitrite when it is used in a product like \u201cLocker Room,\u201d or, in other words, when the use of the substance is devoid of any apparent medicinal or pharmaceutical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">A negative answer to this initial question is, at first glance, suggested by an analysis of the statutory scheme of which sections 4050 and 4160 are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>part (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 248, 273 [102 Cal.Rptr. 137, 497 P.2d 481]). The two statutes are both found in chapter 9 of division 2 of the Business and Professions Code. Division 2 is entitled \u201cHealing Arts,\u201d and is divided into various chapters which individually regulate the licensing and conduct of different health care providers, such as physicians, dentists, nurses, etc. Chapter 9 thereof is devoted to the regulation of the pharmacy profession. With no better guide as to the legislative intent behind the enactment of the statutes in question, we note that similar statutory language in the predecessor to chapter 9, the Pharmacy Act, was found to have the purpose of preventing \u201cthe sale of <em>drugs and medicines </em>by any person not a registered pharmacist or assistant pharmacist . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arthur </em>(1934) 1 Cal.App.2d Supp. 768, 771 [32 P.2d 1002], italics added.) In view of the foregoing, it might be concluded that the Legislature did not intend by the enactment of sections 4050 and 4160 to restrict the sale of any poisons other than those with a medicinal or pharmaceutical application.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The above analysis, however, breaks down upon closer inspection of the statutory scheme. For while the other restricted items mentioned in section 4050, namely, drugs,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> chemicals,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and prescribed medicines or devices,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are defined in the code with reference, either directly or indirectly, to an intended therapeutic purpose, the definition of poison contained in section 4160 is not, in general, similarly circumscribed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Had the Legislature intended to limit the definition of poison in that section to substances with a medicinal or pharmaceutical purpose, it presumably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>would have done so either expressly or by framing the definition in a manner which utilizes a recognized pharmaceutical product index.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Additional evidence that the Legislature did not intend to so limit the definition of poison in section 4160 is indicated by the express inclusion therein of the following products: \u201cglue, cement, dope, paint thinners, paint [when they contain toluene], and any combination of hydrocarbons either alone or in combination with any substance or material including but not limited to paint, paint thinners, shellac thinners, and solvents which, when inhaled, ingested, or breathed, can cause a person to be under the influence of, or intoxicated from, any such combination of hydrocarbons.\u201d (\u00a7 4160, sched. \u201cD,\u201d subd. (a).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are unaware of any medicinal or pharmaceutical applications for products like paint or paint thinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Furthermore, the inclusion of items like paint and paint thinner in the definition of poison makes graphic the seeming absurdity of the statutory scheme before us. Pursuant to a literal reading of sections 4050 and 4160, only a registered pharmacist (or someone acting under the direction of one) may sell many of the supplies commonly required by a painter. In addition, section 4164 provides that \u201cNo poison enumerated in Schedules \u2018A,\u2019 \u2018B,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 in Section 4160, shall be sold or delivered to any person who is less than 18 years of age.\u201d Thus, if our painter were still a minor, he would be unable to obtain the painting supplies listed in schedule \u201cD\u201d of section 4160 from anyone, including a pharmacist.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Another example of such seeming absurdity lies in the unqualified inclusion in section 4160 of \u201clarkspur.\u201d (\u00a7 4160, sched. \u201cB,\u201d subd. (p).) While the term \u201clarkspur\u201d may refer to certain seeds from which a tincture to be used against lice can be prepared, its primary definition refers to the plant of that name of the genus <em>Delphinium. </em>(Webster\u2019s Third New Intemat. Diet. (1966 unabridged) p. 1273.) Again, taken literally, sections 4050 and 4160 would prohibit all but registered pharmacists from selling larkspur plants, even when they are to be used only for decorative purposes; section 4164 would prevent anyone under 18 years of age from ever lawfully obtaining such plants. These unreasonable results could not have been intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>An additional difficulty with the statutory scheme before us results from the inclusion in section 4160 of the phrase \u201c \u2018Poison\u2019 means and includes the <em>compositions </em>of the following schedules: . . .\u201d (Italics added; see fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>The word \u201ccomposition\u201d has several accepted meanings, among which are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">\u201c[1] ... the nature of a chemical compound or mixture as regards the kind and amounts of its constituents . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201c[2] . . . the manner in which something is composed or compounded</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201c[3] ... an aggregate, mixture, mass, or body formed by combining two or more elements or ingredients . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 466.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In view of these varied definitions, it is uncertain whether the Legislature intended the word \u201ccompositions\u201d in section 4160 to refer only to the individual items mentioned in each subsection within the four schedules, or rather to mixtures composed entirely of items from several subsections or schedules, or instead to any mixture provided it contains one of the items listed in the schedules. The significance of this point is greater than at first might appear when it is remembered that the subject product, \u201cLocker Room,\u201d contained but 12 to 16 percent butyl nitrite. While most of the substances mentioned in section 4160 are expressly described as also including \u201cpreparations\u201d containing those substances (see, e.g., \u00a7 4160, sched. \u201cA,\u201d subd; (a), which refers to \u201cArsenic compounds and preparations\u201d), subdivision (n) of schedule \u201cB\u201d merely refers to \u201cNitroglycerine and nitrites.\u201d It can be argued that the Legislature\u2019s failure to explicitly state that \u201cpreparations\u201d containing nitrites are to be included in the definition of poison is an indication that only nitrites in their pure form were intended to be within the statutory restriction and that products like \u201cLocker Room,\u201d which are but part nitrite compound, were intended to be exempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">As the foregoing demonstrates, the statutory scheme in question impermissibly leaves the people of this state to speculate at their peril as to the nature of the conduct prohibited. <em>(Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>306 U.S. 451, 453 [83 L.Ed. 888, 890]; see <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 231 [82 Cal.Rptr. 175, 461 P.2d 375].) Left without any firm indication of what the Legislature intended by this legislation, we have no choice but to hold section 4050 constitutionally invalid insofar as it relies on the definition of poison set forth in section 4160.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Allport, J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Hereinafter all code section references are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The punishment prescribed for a violation of section 4050 is found in section 4382.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The text on the bottle read as follows: \u201cLOCKER ROOM\u00ae <em>Aroma of Men. </em>Net Weight .3 oz.

Although there was evidence produced at trial that the labeling of \u201cLocker Room\u201d (fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>indicated that the product was in accordance with the requirements of section 4052, that section was inapplicable here since it does not cover the portion of section 4050 which is directed at the sale of poisons as distinguished from chemicals or drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The first sentence of section 4160 reads: \u201c\u2018Poison\u2019 means and includes the compositions of the following schedules:. . .\u201d Four schedules, entitled \u201cA\u201d through \u201cD,\u201d then follow.
