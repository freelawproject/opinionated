Petitioner\u2019s services, however, were available to respondents from September 1,1943, to the day her position was abolished and she is entitled to receive her salary for that period. Insofar as the resolution attempts to deprive petitioner of her salary by abolishing her position retroactively, it is invalid. The orders should be modified to the extent of directing respondents to pay petitioner her salary for the period from September 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>1943, to October 18, 1943, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The orders should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Loughran, Ch.
