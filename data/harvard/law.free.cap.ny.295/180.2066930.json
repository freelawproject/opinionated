It carried over from the preceding charter (L. 1914, ch. 217, \u00a7 117, as amd. by L. 1916, ch. 260), a fifteen-day limitation within which to institute proceedings to review tax assessments, and added a new provision to review special franchise assessments as provided by the Tax Law, both of which provisions were incorporated in the charter as section 327, article 18, \u201c Actions and Proceedings \u201d. The remainder of section 117 of the original Charter was incorporated in section 554, article 29, \u201c Tax and Assessment Boils \u201d. For convenience, section 327 is quoted as follows: \u201c\u00a7 327. <em>Certiorari to review general assessment. </em>No proceeding shall be brought to review any assessment on the general rolls, or any of them, unless the petition for the writ is presented to a justice of the supreme court or at a special term of the supreme court in the judicial district in which the assessment complained of was made within fifteen days after the final completion of said assessment rolls and the publication of the notice thereof as required by section five hundred fifty-four. In any such proceeding the total assessment only can be reviewed. Assessments of special franchises may be reviewed as provided by the tax law.\u201d (Local Law, No. 4 of City of Buffalo, 1927 [published in Local Laws, 1932, p. 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At the time of the adoption of the Charter of the City of Buffalo in 1927, section 291 of the Tax Law also provided a fifteen-day limitation for the commencement of certiorari proceedings to review a tax assessment. This time limitation has been enlarged to thirty days (L. 1935, ch. 296). No correspond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ing increase has been made in the Charter of the City of Buffalo. This does not mean that its designated time limitation has thereby been superseded and repealed. It is only when the charter is silent on matters of practice and procedure for the review of a tax assessment that reference to the general Tax Law is necessary <em>(People ex rel. N. Y. C. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Block, </em>178 App. Div. 259, appeal dismissed 221 N. Y. 652; <em>People ex rel. American Sugar Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>274 N. Y. 304; <em>People ex rel. Empire Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>198 App. Div. 317, affd. 234 N. Y. 507; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>210 N. Y. 412); or when specific reference is made to the Tax Law <em>(Matter of Port Chester Central Corp. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>260 App. Div. 944). It is otherwise when the charter contains a complete scheme for the review by certiorari of a tax assessment <em>(Fulton </em>v. <em>Krull, </em>200 N. Y. 105). An examination of the Charter of the City of Buffalo, as a whole, brings us to the inescapable conclusion that it contemplated and, in fact, provides for a complete procedural enactment for the review of assessments. Its provisions as to limitation of time in such cases must be deemed controlling. To hold otherwise is to disregard the long recognized rule of statutory construction that a general act will not repeal a special act unless the Legislature clearly intended to do so (1 McKinney\u2019s Statutes, \u00a7 396) and would necessitate extensive changes in the administration of the fiscal affairs of the city. To mention only the most obvious, the time for submitting the Mayor\u2019s budget, which is an estimate of the revenues needed for the fiscal year, on or before May 15th (Executive Budget, art. 6, \u00a7 86); and the consideration by the Common Council of the budget at its first meeting. If changes are made therein, it must be returned to the mayor on or before the 15th of April, for his approval and, if he objects to the changes, it may be considered by the council and adopted by a two-thirds vote on or before the first day of May (Common Council, art. 3, \u00a739). The necessity of the fifteen-day limitation for the commencement of certiorari proceedings becomes apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Neither can we invoke sections 4 and 113 of the Civil Practice Act, for, in any event, the commencement of the proceeding must be timely. Here the proceeding is not timely when measured by the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The orders should be reversed, with costs to the appellants, and the matter remitted to the Special Term for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Thacher and Medalie, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
