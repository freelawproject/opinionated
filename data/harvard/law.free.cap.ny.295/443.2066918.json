On that day, he was accidentally killed while working in the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The primary question posed is whether Siguin\u2019s injury and consequent death arose \u2018 \u2018 out of and in the course of the employment \u201d within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. The Industrial Board \u2014 now the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board \u2014 held that it did, and the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">During the time of Siguin\u2019s employment, it had been more or less customary and usual \u2014 and this was known to appellant-employer\u2014 that whenever two employees passed, each would \u201c make a pass \u201d \u2014 take a friendly tap or blow \u2014at the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\"Upon the day in question, December 24,1942, Siguin came into the kitchen, conversed in amicable fashion with Demers \u2014 another seventeen-year-old boy employed at the restaurant \u2014 and then, on leaving, made a pass at Demers. As Demers turned to avoid the blow, a knife which he held in his other hand accidentally struck Siguin in the left side, penetrated his heart and caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In the light of the record, it was but natural to expect appellant\u2019s employees to deport themselves \u2014 as boys and young men full of life and health \u2014 as they did. Indulgence in a moment\u2019s diversion \u2014 a moment spent making a friendly pass at a fellow employee \u2014 had long been part and parcel, an incident, of the employment. The risks thereby engendered were risks of the employment. There can no longer be any question- \u2014 in this State, at least \u2014that injuries resulting therefrom arise \u201c out of * * * the employment \u201d within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>(Matter of Levy </em>v. <em>World-Telegram Corp., </em>285 N. Y. 533; <em>Matter of Leonbruno </em>v. <em>Champlain Silk Mills, </em>229 N. Y. 470; <em>Matter of Verschleiser </em>v. <em>Stern &amp; Son, </em>229 N. Y. 192; <em>Matter of Markell </em>v. <em>Green Felt Shoe Co., </em>221 N. Y. 493; <em>Matter of Mason </em>v. <em>Nassau Riding Academy, </em>250 App. Div. 802; <em>Matter of Donovan </em>v. <em>Bush Terminal Co., </em>255 App. Div. 737; <em>Matter of Heitz </em>v. <em>Ruppert, </em>218 N. Y. 148.) We need do no more than repeat what Judge Cardozo said in the <em>Leonbruno </em>case <em>(supra),, </em>pp. 472, 473: \u201c The claimant was injured, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>merely while he was in a factory, but because he was in a factory, in touch with associations and conditions inseparable from factory life. The risks of such associations and conditions were risks of the employment <em>(Thom </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra; <em>Matter of Redner </em>v. <em>Faber &amp; Son, </em>223 N. Y. 379).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">*******</p>\n<p id=\"AnL\"><em>\u201c * * </em># The risks of injury incurred in the crowded contacts of the factory through the acts of fellow-workmen, are not measured by the tendency of such acts to serve the master\u2019s business. Many things that have no such tendency are done by workmen every day. * * * The test of liability is the relation of the service to the injury, of the employment to the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A14\">Nor can there be any doubt that the injury arose <em>\u201c </em>in the course of the employment.\u201d The long-continuing custom and practice \u2014 to which we have called attention \u2014 strongly indicating as it does that there was no abandonment, serves to distinguish the present case from those wherein the instigator of a fight or the initiator of horseplay was held not entitled to compensation. <em>(Matter of Frost </em>v. <em>Franklin Manufacturing Co., </em>236 N. Y. 649, affg. 204 App. Div. 700; <em>Matter of Stillwagon </em>v. <em>Callan Bros., </em>224 N. Y. 714, affg. 183 App. Div. 141; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Roberson &amp; Son, 176 </em>App. Div. 6.) In each of those cases, there was <em>a single isolated incident </em>which originated solely and entirely in the injured employee\u2019s own act; there was not \u2014 as here \u2014 a continued series of related and similar incidents participated in by all the employees. In view of that fact, Siguin can scarcely be said to have \u201c instigated \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>initiated \u201d the horseplay within the meaning of the above cases. Moreover, both the <em>Stilhvagon </em>and <em>Griffin </em>cases involved fights actually commenced in anger and animosity so that \u2014 as the Appellate Division explicitly stated in the former case (183 App. Div., at pp. 144-145) \u2014 the injuries complained of fell within the statutory exception, being \u201c occasioned * * * by wilful intention of the injured employee to bring about the injury or death of himself or another.\u201d (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Since Siguin\u2019s fatal injury arose <em>\u201c </em>out of and in the course of \u201d Ms employment, the determinations below upon tMs question were correct and the award against appellant-carrier should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The second question \u2014 raised only by appellant-employer, since he alone is affected \u2014 relates to the propriety of the award against him individually for the benefit of special funds under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">That award was made pursuant to section 14-a of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, which provides, in part, that \u201c compensation and death benefits * * * shall be double the amount otherwise payable if the injured employee at the time of the accident is a minor under eighteen years of age employed, permitted or suffered to work in violation of any provision of the labor law \u201d and that the employer alone is to be liable for such increased compensation or death benefits. Concededly, Siguin was'under eighteen, and \u2014 in violation of section 131 of the Labor Law \u2014 no work certificate had been filed for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Since Siguin left no dependents, each of the two awards \u2014 both that against appellant-employer or appellant-carrier and that against appellant-employer individually \u2014 included specified sums payable to the \u201c Special Fund \u201d under section 15, subdivision 8; to the \u201c Vocational Rehabilitation Fund \u201d under section 15, subdivision 9; and to the \u201c Fund for Reopened Cases \u201d under section 25-a of the law. These statutes provide, in effect, that \u201c the employer, or if insured, his insurance carrier, shall pay into \u201d the specified fund \u201c for every case of injury causing death in which there are no persons entitled to compensation \u201d a specified sum of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In our view, the award against appellant-employer individually cannot stand because payments to the special funds do not constitute \u201c compensation and death benefits \u201d within the meaning of section 14-a. Subdivision 6 of section 2 defines \u201c compensation \u201d as \u201c the money allowance payable to an employee or to his dependents \u201d, and section 16 states that \u201c If the injury causes death, the <em>compensation </em>shall be known as a <em>death benefit </em>\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Although we have not previously passed upon the question whether payments to the statutory special funds constitute \u201c compensation and death benefits \u201d under section 14-a, the answer is <em>clearly pointed by the </em>decision <em>in Commissioner of Taxation </em>v. <em>Riger Bldg. Corp. </em>(285 N. Y. 217). There, the deceased \u2014 who had been employed in a hazardous occupation by an uninsured subcontractor \u2014 was not survived by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>person legally entitled to compensation. The pertinent statute \u2014 section 56 \u2014 provided that in such a case, the general contractor \u201c shall be liable for and shall pay compensation to any employee injured \u201d unless the subcontractor primarily liable has secured compensation. In vacating an award which \u2014 pursuant to that statute \u2014 directed the general contractor to pay certain sums to the three statutory special funds, the court held that such payments did not constitute \u201c compensation.\u201d (See, also, <em>Matter of State Treasurer </em>v. <em>West Side Trucking Co., </em>198 App. Div. 432, affd. 233 N. Y. 202; <em>Matter of Martin </em>v. <em>Wurlitzer Co., </em>249 App. Div. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Additional support for our conclusion may be found in the very nature of the \u201c double compensation and death benefits \u201d payable under section 14-a. It has been repeatedly held that this increased payment is not punitive in character. <em>(Matter of Sackolwitz </em>v. <em>Hamburg &amp; Co., </em>295 N. Y. 264; <em>Bogartz </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>293 N. Y. 563; <em>Matter of Molnia </em>v. <em>Kaplan &amp; Co., </em>293 N. Y. 700.) As this court very recently declared in the <em>Sackolwitz </em>case <em>(supra, </em>p. 267): \u201c In <em>Bogartz </em>v. <em>Astor </em>(293 N. Y. 563), we held that the additional payment exacted by section 14-a is not a penalty but is, as the statute itself calls it, * increased compensation.\u2019 Imposed at a higher rate, it differs in amount, but not in character, from the lesser compensation awarded to injured adult workers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In short, then, none of the doubled payments except the $150 item for funeral expenses may be regarded as <em>\u201c </em>compensation \u201d or <em>\u201c </em>death benefits \u201d within the meaning of the statute. Accordingly, the Industrial Board and the Appellate Division erred in directing appellant-employer to pay to the special funds the amounts aggregating $2,000; as already indicated, however, the initial award made against appellant-employer or appellant-carrier is in all respects proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The order of the Appellate Division and the award of the Board should be modified by eliminating from the award the provision that appellant-employer Adrian McCarthy individually pay to the designated special funds sums aggregating $2,000, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond and Thacher, JJ., concur; Dye, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
