The surcharge cannot be supported since the drawee bank properly charged $5,000 to the account of decedent in the bank, and the drawee paid the check as drawn. The drawee is a single corporation licensed to do a banking business. Its several branches own no property; no branch, as such, is responsible for debts and no branch can be sued. (Banking Law, \u00a7 14, subd. [g]; \u00a7\u00a7 29,105.) II. The fact that \u201c Fordham \u201d had been written on decedent\u2019s check, dated June 27, 1939, in no wise impinged upon the validity of the payment. <em>(Troy City Bank </em>v. <em>Lauman, </em>19 N. Y. 477; <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Arons, </em>81 Misc. 165; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>56 N. Y. 22; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>160 Ind. 153; <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>70 N. Y. 280; <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>21 Wend. 502; <em>Suydam </em>v. <em>Westfall, </em>2 Denio 205.) III. Even if a check is presented for collection, if the bank is willing to pay at one place a check drawn upon an account kept in another, it may do so and thereby be fully discharged. <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>38 Upper Canada, Q. B. Reports 374.) IV. The check was paid at the clearing house on June 28th. The bookkeeping debits and credits were corrected on July 7th. To say that payment was not effected until \u201c Lexington\u2019s \u201d bookkeeping entry on July 10th is sophistry. The bookkeeping entry is not the payment but merely the evidence of payment. <em>(Baldwin\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>215 N. Y. 76; <em>Sokoloff </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>250 N. Y. 69.) V. The surcharge cannot be supported because it was not a proper remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>(O\u2019Conner </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>117 N.

The other check for $5,000, dated July 7, 1939, was given to claimant by decedent to pay for services previously rendered, for which services decedent assumed an obligation to pay. <em>(Stimson </em>v. <em>Vroman, </em>99 N.

Decedent\u2019s check of June 27, 1939, was a gift and therefore revocable at any time before the $5,000 was paid over or transferred from the decedent\u2019s account to that of the claimant payee by the drawee bank. <em>(Matter of Ryan, </em>291 N. Y. 376; <em>Matter of Mead, </em>90 Misc. 263, 173 App. Div. 982, 221 N. Y. 645; <em>Provident Institution for Savings </em>v. <em>Sisters of St. Francis, </em>87 N. J. Eq. 424, 88 N. J. Eq. 342; <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>240 Mass. 485; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>47 Cal. App. 86.) II. The decedent\u2019s check of June 27, 1939, was not paid until two days after her death. Each branch of the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company is a separate bank entirely distinct from every other bank for the purposes of the presentment and payment of checks. (Negotiable Instruments Law, \u00a7 350; <em>Chrzanowska </em>v. <em>Corn Exchange Banh, </em>173 App. Div. 285, 225 N. Y. 728; <em>Sokoloff </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>250 N.

Supp. 480.) III. The alteration by the payee\u2019s secretary of the decedent\u2019s check of June 27, 1939, was a material alteration which rendered' the check void, except as against him. (Negotiable Instruments Law, \u00a7\u00a7 205, 206; <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Furniture Frame Factories, Inc., </em>235 App. Div. 704; <em>Berks County Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lyte, </em>250 Pa. 543; <em>Marion Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>200 Iowa 220; <em>Mechanics\u2019 American Nat.

W. 2d 703 [Tex Civ. App.].) IV. The alteration of the decedent\u2019s check of June 27,1939, was obvious and no subsequent holder of that check \"was a holder in due course. (Negotiable Instruments Law, \u00a7 91; <em>New Rochelle Securities Co. </em>v. <em>International Thrift Society, </em>244 App. Div. 824, 270 N. Y. 52; <em>Sundail Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank, </em>277 N. Y. 137; <em>National Ulster County Bank </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>114 N.

There is sufficient evidence to support the Surrogate\u2019s finding that said check was without consideration. <em>(Matter of Humfreville, </em>6 App. Div. 535; <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Hollands, </em>85 App. Div. 231; <em>Matter of Dole, </em>168 App. Div. 253 ; <em>Collyer </em>v. <em>Collyer, </em>113 N. Y. 442; <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Penfield, </em>155 App. Div. 177.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-5\">Desmond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATB\">Anne Marie Goebel died on July 8, 1939. On June 27th of that year she had delivered to Dr. E. Garfield Snyder her check to his order for $5,000, and again on July 7th had turned over to him another check for the same amount. Dr. Snyder tendered both checks to a bank other than the one on which they were drawn, for deposit in his own account. The check first above described was credited to Dr. Snyder\u2019s account. The second $5,000 check, mailed to Dr. Snyder\u2019s bank for deposit on the day of Miss Goebel\u2019s death, was, because of her death, not honored by her bank. When Dr. Snyder brought this proceeding to settle his accounts as Miss Goebel\u2019s executor, the residuary legatees moved for a $5,000 surcharge against him by reason of his having collected that amount for himself on the first check. They objected also, to a claim which he had put in against the estate for $5,000 for medical services, which claim, according to him, was evidenced by the second, or uncollected, $5,000 check. The Surrogate held against Dr. Snyder as to both items. The Appellate Division affirmed unanimously, and we granted leave to appeal. Dr. Snyder thereafter died, and his executor is the appellant in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">As to the second above-mentioned check \u2014 the one which was not presented for payment until after Miss Goebel\u2019s death \u2014 the Surrogate found that there was no consideration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>giving of the instrument (see <em>Matter of Mead, </em>90 Misc. 263, affd. 173 App. Div. 982, affd. 221 N. Y. 645). That finding, affirmed by the Appellate Division, is well supported by the proof. We therefore affirm so much of the decree as disallows Dr. Snyder\u2019s $5,000 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The other $5,000 check \u2014 the one first above described \u2014 was a gift from Miss Goebel to Dr. Snyder. The holdings below are that the check after issuance, became a void instrument because of a \u201c material alteration \u201d made therein and, further, that, because of facts to be narrated herein, it was not a proper charge against the estate because not actually paid until after Miss Goebel\u2019s death. On June 23, 1939, four days before the check was issued, Miss Goebel had received payment of an inheritance of some $16,000. Being confined to her home because of the illness from which she died about two weeks later, she asked Dr. Snyder, her friend and professional associate, to start a new bank account for her with the $16,000. For this purpose she prepared and handed him, with the $16,000 check, a letter addressed to the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company asking it to open a bank account in her name and in that amount. Dr. Snyder delivered the check and the letter to the nearby <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Lexington \u201d branch of that bank. A bank employee gave Dr. Snyder a \u201c duplicate deposit slip \u201d, also a checkbook. Four days later, on June 27th, Miss Goebel presented Dr. Snyder with the $5,000 check, made out to his order on one of the check blanks from her new checkbook, which check, in its printed heading, described the \u201c Lexington Branch \u201d of the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company. Dr. Snyder sent his secretary to that branch to have the check certified but on arrival there the secretary was told that certification was impossible, because, according to the branch bank manager, Miss Goebel\u2019s account was at the <em>\u201c Fordham </em>\u201d branch of the same bank. The Lexington branch manager suggested to the secretary that she run a line through the word <em>\u201c </em>Lexington \u2019 \u2019 on the heading of the check, substitute therefor the word \u201c Fordham \u201d, then deposit the check in Dr. Snyder\u2019s account (at another bank). All this the secretary did, and her markings on the check, so made, have been held below to have constituted a \u201c material alteration \u201d, absolutely voiding the instrument. As it turned out later, the bank itself had made a mistake and, having mislaid the letter originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>presented to it when Dr. Snyder opened the account for Anne Marie Goebel at its Lexington branch, had credited the original $16,000 to the account of one <em>Anna </em>Marie Goebel at the bank\u2019s Fordham branch. Dr. Snyder\u2019s secretary, after changing the word \u201c Lexington \u201d to \u201c Fordham \u201d, at the bank\u2019s own suggestion, put it into Dr. Snyder\u2019s bank for deposit, whereupon it passed through the Clearing House, and was, on June 28th, debited against the Fordham branch account into which the bank had, by mistake, put Miss Goebel\u2019s $16,000 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">All the above came to light on Friday, July 7, 1939, the day before Miss Goebel\u2019s death. The bank discovered its error, or series of errors, and began to reverse the processes, so as to make the matter right. On that day the Fordham branch debited <em>Anna </em>M. Goebel\u2019s ledger account there in the amount of $16,000 and credited that account $5,000 (for the check). On the same day the Lexington branch did what it had been instructed on June 23d to do \u2014 it opened a $16,000 account in the name of Anne Marie Goebel. Because of its own rules or customs, it did not, however, debit that newly opened \u201c Lexington Branch \u201d account with the amount of the $5,000 check until it had actually received that instrument back from its Fordham branch. The check did not arrive at the Lexington branch until July 10th, two days after Miss Goebel\u2019s death. Because of that fact, the holdings below are that the check was not \u201c paid \u201d until after her death, and that at the time of her death the transaction between Miss Goebel and Dr. Snyder was a mere uncompleted gift. To this we cannot agree. On \"the day before the death, the confusion had been all cleared away and the bank had put into motion all the procedures necessary to straighten out the books. Nothing done afterwards by the bank was any more than a detailed carrying out of the bank\u2019s procedures for correcting its records (see <em>Sokolof </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>250 N. Y. 69, 76, 77; <em>Baldwin\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>215 N. Y. 76, 84). Actually the $5,000 check of June 27th had been \u201c paid \u201d long before the blunder was discovered, since that check, in due course, had been charged by the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company itself against the very account into which it had put the $16,000 deposit. The check was issued as an order or draft against that $16,000 owing by the bank to Miss Goebel. When that draft was honored and an appropriate $5,000 debit made against the $16,000 credit, and a corresponding $5,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>credit (never revoked) made to Dr. Snyder\u2019s own bank of deposit, the check was in fact and in law \u201c paid \u201d,'and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As to the character and effect of the \u201c alteration \u201d also, we find ourselves in disagreement with the holdings below. We do not think that the substitution of the word <em>\u201c </em>Fordham \u201d for the word <em>\u201c </em>Lexington \u201d was in any way material. An alteration it was, but the instrument as so altered expressed and effectuated the exact and unquestioned intent of the maker. The purpose of Miss Goebel was to draw a draft on the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company, her debtor, in favor of Dr. Snyder, for $5,000, to be subtracted from the credit standing in her favor with that bank. The Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company is a single corporation, and was the sole debtor, no matter how many branches it maintained. Section 350 \u00f3f the Negotiable Instruments Law, making branches separate banks for certain purposes of collection <em>inter sese </em>of deposited items, lias no bearing on.this case. Nor was this a <em>\u201c </em>material alteration \u201d within the language or purpose of sections 205 and 206 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. The change in the check was \u201c to make it express the real bargain of the parties \u201d (Lehman, J., in <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Arons, </em>81 Misc. 165, 166, quoting from <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>56 N. Y. 22, 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The orders should be reversed, with costs to all parties appearing separately and filing briefs, and the matter remitted to the Surrogate\u2019s Court for further proceedings not- inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\" Loughran, Ch.
