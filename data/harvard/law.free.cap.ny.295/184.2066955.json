Section 15 of the Personal Property Law, b\u00e9ing in derogation of common law, must be strictly construed. As applicable and pertinent to the facts herein, the prohibition against transfer of beneficial interest applies solely to a beneficiary of the specifically indicated trust referred to therein. <em>(Matter of Fowler, </em>263 App. Div. 255, 288 N.

Assuming that it was the intention of decedent\u2019s father to create a trust under paragraph \u201c Fourth \u201d of his will, no legal effect can be given to said intention. The beneficiaries received legal life estates in the residuary. (Real Property Law, \u00a7 92; <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>James, </em>115 N. Y. 346; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>197 N.

Assuming that on the death of decedent\u2019s father a trust did arise under paragraph \u201c Fourth \u201d of his will, the trust on the date of death of the beneficiary who died first, became a legal life estate in' the surviving beneficiary. <em>(Matter of Morrisey, </em>170 Misc. 1016; <em>Matter of Kimberly, </em>150 N.

The surviving beneficiary\u2019s renunciation was an alienation of her rights, forbidden by section 15 of the Personal Property Law. <em>(Matter of Wentworth, </em>230 N. Y. 176; <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust Co., </em>168 App. Div. 601.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b235-5\">Desmond, \"J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeC\">Additional New York State income taxes were assessed against Mathilda A. Stier, appellant\u2019s testatrix, because, according to the State, Mrs. Stier omitted certain taxable income from her returns for 1937, 1938 and 1939. After a hearing, the State Tax Commission confirmed the assessments and the commission\u2019s determination was, on appeal, unanimously confirmed by the Appellate Division. We granted leave to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This is an income tax case but the answer to its problem is found in the law of trusts. The income in question came from the estate of Mrs. Stier\u2019s father, who died in 1902. The investments of the estate are in both real and personal property. Read as of the date of his death, the father\u2019s will left his residuary estate to his only children, Mrs. Stier and her sister, as trustees to pay the income thereof to themselves <em>\u201c </em>during <em>&lt;i </em>the terms of their respective lives \u201d. There was no specific provision to take care of a situation that was bound to arise \u2014 the death of one daughter before the other. There was in the will a further direction that after the death of the two dough-A ters, the whole residuary estate was to go to another trustee who was to pay it over to the children of the daughters. Mrs. Stier never had children. Her sister, who died in 1935, had only one, Charles A. Fulton. In 1937 Mrs. Stier and her nephew Charles A. Fulton executed in France, and later filed in the New York County Surrogate\u2019s office, a document which recited the above facts and stated that Mrs. Stier was then seventy-seven years old, that she was independently wealthy and had no need of the income from her father\u2019s estate, and that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>wished to renounce that income in favor of her nephew. Mrs. Stier, in that document, then formally relinquished and renounced all right to the income, and her nephew released her, individually and as fiduciary. From the time of the execution of that paper, all the income of the estate was paid or credited to the nephew, and Mrs. Stier did not thereafter report it in her tax returns. The State says, and the Tax Commission and the Appellate Division have held, that the renunciation by Mrs. Stier was ineffective for any purpose because forbidden by section 15 of the Personal Property Law which says: \u201c The right of the beneficiary to enforce the performance of a trust to receive the income of personal property, and to apply it to the use of any person, can not be transferred by assignment or otherwise.\u201d The position of appellant \u2014 and with it we agree \u2014 is that, on the death of Mrs. Stier\u2019s sister, Mrs. Stier, though the purported trustee of a trust to pay income to herself alone, was no longer a \u201c beneficiary \u201d entitled \u201c to enforce the performance of a trust \u201d but was the owner of a legal, and thus assignable, life estate in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">A century ago dry or passive trusts, being \u201c justly considered wholly unnecessary \u201d, were abrogated in this State through the addition to the Statute of Uses of \u201c new and appropriate provisions which vested the title in the beneficiary \u201d <em>(Downing </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>23 N. Y. 366, 379). One of the great purposes of that revision was to abolish distinctions between title and use and to convert into a legal estate the beneficiary\u2019s interest in a naked trust <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Fleet, </em>14 Wend. 176; <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Lampman, </em>5 N. Y. 456; <em>Townshend </em>v. <em>Frommer, </em>125 N. Y. 446, 457). The statute accomplished this by commanding that: \u201c Every person, who, by virtue of any grant, assignment or devise, is entitled both to the actual possession of real property, and to the receipt of the rents and profits thereof, in law or equity, shall be deemed to have a legal estate therein, of the same quality and duration, and subject to the same conditions, as his beneficial interest * * * \u201d (Real Property Law, \u00a7 92). Section 92, although in terms applicable to realty, covers by analogy, trusts of personal property also, and modern courts, in New York as elsewhere, \u201c execute passive trusts of personalty \u201d as well as of realty (1 Bogert on Trusts &amp; Trustees, \u00a7 207, citing <em>Matter of De Rycke, </em>99 App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>596, 597, and <em>Matter of Cooney, </em>112 App. Div. 659, and 115 App. Div. 895, affd. 187 N. Y. 546; see, also, <em>Cutting </em>v. <em>Cutting, </em>86 N. Y. 522, 546; <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 N. Y. 157, 165, and Personal Property Law, \u00a7 11, last sentence). The trust we are here considering was not invalid while hath daughters were alive, even though they were at the same time trustees and <em>cestuis (Rogers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>111 N. Y. 228; <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>James, </em>115 N. Y. 346, 357; Restatement of Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 99, 115). But . the time came, as it obviously had to come unless both daughters died at the same instant, when the surviving daughter v became solely entitled to both possession and income. Every valid trust must have- a trustee who is not the sole beneficiary <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Spohr, </em>180 N. Y. 201, 209; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>125 N. Y. 427, 431 <em>et seq.; Weeks </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>197 N. Y. 304, 311; Restatement of Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 99, 115 and \u00a7 152, comment m). So, when the first daughter of this testator died, Mrs. Stier had thenceforth not the kind of beneficial trust interest which is made inalienable by section 15 of the Personal Property Law, but a fully assignable legal life estate in the property. She could and did turn that interest over to her nephew.' The income thereafter accruing was his, not hers, and she properly omitted it from her returns of taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Appellate Division, while conceding that after her sister\u2019s death Mrs. Stier could not hold office as sole trustee for herself, held that this disability resulted in no more than a \u201c vacancy \u201d in the office of trustee. The Appellate Division\u2019s view was that the \u201c vacancy \u201d could have been, and should have been, filled by the Supreme Court and that Mrs. Stier\u2019s failure to ask for such an appointment should not be permitted to nullify the testator\u2019s intent. The difficulty is that the first daughter\u2019s death did much more than create a vacancy. It ended a trust relationship and substituted a-life tenancy (see 1 Scott on Trusts, discussion of the 27ew York rule at p. 529).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the determination of the State Tax Commission annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Thacher, Dye and Medalie, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
