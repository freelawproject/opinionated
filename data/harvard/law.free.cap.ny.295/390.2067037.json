The life beneficiary does not have an absolute right in her untramm\u00e9led discretion to demand all of the principal. The will does not grant an absolute gift of the residuary estate to-the widow nor does it grant her <em>\u201c </em>an absolute right \u201d to all of the trust corpus upon demand. <em>(Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix, </em>248 N.

The will does not grant the beneficiary an <em>\u201c </em>absolute \u201d or unlimited discretion, but contemplates the exercise of good faith and honest judgment in determining the necessity for invasion of the corpus. <em>(Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix, </em>248 N.

In computing the amount of principal to be paid, the beneficiary\u2019s entire income \u2014 from other sources as well as from the trust \u2014 must be taken into account. Since respondent receives more than $20,000 a year - \u2014 the amount which she asserted she requires for her maintenance, comfort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and well being \u2014 she is not entitled to any of the principal <em>(Matter of Martin, </em>269 N.

This is not a will where the invasion of the principal is dependent upon the determination of whether it is necessary or proper for the support and maintenance of the widow. The will provides that she shall have the right to invade the principal, if in her judgment she deems it necessary for her maintenance, comfort and well being, and she shall not be required to account to anybody. <em>(Lord </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>153 Atl. 1; <em>Rock Island Bank and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Rhoads, </em>187 N.

The contention of appellants that all other income of the widow must be considered in construing the right of the widow under the will to invade the principal is against the weight of judicial authority. <em>(Forman </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>2 Abb.

Woollard, deceased, which has been affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Judicial Department, should be modified to read as follows: \u201c Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the true construction and effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the Last Will and Testament of William E. Woollard, deceased, and particularly paragraphs * Second \u2019 and * 3rd \u2019 thereof, relating to the payment of the income and principal of the residuary estate of said deceased, is construed as giving to Harriet Holland Woollard, widow of said deceased, the right to all of the income and to such part of the corpus and principal of the said trust estate created by said Last Will and Testament of said deceased as she shall deem necessary for her maintenance, comfort or well being, and said Harriet Holland Woollard shall have the right to demand the payment and transfer to her of such part of the principal and corpus of said estate at any time whenever the said Harriet Holland Woollard shall deem it necessary for her maintenance, comfort and well being and shall so determine and state in writing to the Trustees in making any such demand or demands therefor, and the said Trustees are hereby ordered and directed to comply therewith, and it is , * * * Such a statement is all that may be required from the widow, since the statement itself imports the exercise by her of good faith and honest judgment, and under the terms of the particular will no one may question or go behind such a determination and expression by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The order of the Appellate Division and the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should be modified in accordance with this opinion, and as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b442-8\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A823\">(dissenting). The direction contained in the Surrogate\u2019s decree in this proceeding which this court is about to modify serves to enlarge to an unlimited right the interest of the decedent\u2019s widow in the residuary estate of her deceased husband. The decree and the modification by this court transcend \"those limits fixed by the decedent, whose will prescribes that the trustees shall pay to his widow monthly during her lifetime all the income from his residuary estate \u201c * * * together with as much of the principal or corpus of my estate as she may deem necessary for her maintenance comfort and well being \u201d. Instead of giving his residuary estate outright to his widow the decedent chose to impress it with a trust. The broad provisions of that trust indicate the decedent\u2019s intent ,to make available to Ms widow sometMng more than a life use of Ms residuary estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>but something less than an absolute fee therein. He made provision for a remainder over \u2014 which cannot be limited upon an absolute estate in fee. <em>(Matter of Ithaca Trust Co., </em>220 N. Y. 437, 441.) When the decedent named his widow as the sole judge of the amount, if any, which should be withdrawn from the principal of the trust and paid to her as necessary for her maintenance, comfort and well-being during her lifetime, that grant of the use of principal with remainder over to their daughters and son-in-law imported his confidence in her and in turn called for the exercise by her of honest judgment and good faith which, when challenged, was the proper subject of judicial review. <em>(Swarthout </em>v. <em>Ranier, </em>143 N. Y. 499, 504; <em>Matter of Wilkin, </em>183 N. Y. 104, 113; <em>Matter of Briggs, </em>101 Misc. 191, 202, mod. 180 App. Div. 752, affd. 223 N. Y. 677; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix, </em>248 N.
