No reversion was created in or intended by the settlor; all those who may constitute the settlor\u2019s next of kin at the time of her son\u2019s death are beneficially interested in the trust estate and their consents to revoke are necessary. <em>(Doctor </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>225 N.

The necessary consents to revocation of the trust agreement by all those beneficially interested in the trust estate have not been obtained as required by section 23 of the Personal Property Law. The order denying revocation should be affirmed. III. The trust instrument evidences a clear, deliberate intention to eliminate any reversionary interest in the grantor; remainders were intended so as to exclude the trust property from settlor\u2019s gross estate. <em>(Klein </em>v. <em>United States, </em>283 U.

V. The order of June 7, 1944, appointing a guardian ad litem was proper and should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>be affirmed.

The appeal from said order was not timely taken and should be dismissed. <em>(Goepel </em>v. <em>Kurtz Action Co., </em>158 App. Div. 879, 216 N.

W. Scholtz \u2014 a person over twenty-one years of age, unmarried and without issue. She has two brothers, two sisters, and two nephews and a niece who are the children of a deceased brother. On December 28, 1937, there was delivered to the respondent trust company a deed of trust executed by the appellant which transferred to the respondent cash and securities in trust for the following purposes: <em>\u201c </em>To\u2022 pay the net income thereof to G-eorge C. W. Scholtz, the Settlor\u2019s son, as nearly as possible in equal weekly installments during each and every week of his life; and upon his death to transfer, assign and pay over the principal thereof to the descendants of said George C. W. Scholtz, if any, him surviving, in equal shares, per stirpes and not per capita, and if he shall have no descendants him surviving, to transfer, assign and pay over the same to the Settlor\u2019s next-of-kin under the laws of the State of New York at the date of her said son\u2019s death, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">On April 10, 1944, when the trust had been administered for more than six years, the appellant served upon the respondent as trustee a written notice of her demand for and her consent to the revocation of the trust agreement. Simultaneously there was delivered to the respondent a written consent to the revocation of the same trust agreement executed by the petitioner\u2019s son, G-eorge C. W. Scholtz.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Our inquiry goes to the question whether the demand for revocation thus made by the appellant, accompanied by her son\u2019s written consent thereto, satisfies the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>section 23 of the Personal Property Law. That statute provides: \u201cUpon the written consent of all the persons beneficially interested in a trust in personal property or any part thereof heretofore or hereafter created, the creator of such trust may revoke the same as to the whole or such part thereof, and thereupon the estate of the trustee shall cease in the whole or such part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The determination of the question thus presented \u2022 depends upon whether the trust instrument here involved reserved to the appellant as settlor a reversion of the trust estate or created a remainder therein. At Special Term the petitioner\u2019s motion for an order revoking the trust agreement was denied upon the ground that \u201c It has not been established that all those persons beneficially interested have consented to the revocation. Specifically the \u2022 nephews and nieces of the settlor have not consented. * * * \u201d Thereafter the order entered upon such determination and two other orders by Special Term \u2014 one of which appointed a guardian ad litem for unknown contingent beneficiaries and the other denied a motion for reargument \u2014 were affirmed by the Appellate Division, one of the justices dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We may assume that the ruling by Special Term, as affirmed by the Appellate Division \u2014 that all persons beneficially interested had not consented to the revocation of the trust \u2014 had for its basis the conclusion that the trust instrument created a remainder and that the settlor had not reserved a reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Our construction of the trust agreement has led us to the opposite conclusion. As we read the language used by the appellant its legal effect was to reserve a reversion \u2014 not to create a remainder. Here the direction to transfer the trust estate to the settlor\u2019s next of kin is \u2014 as in <em>Doctor </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(225 N. Y. 305, 311) \u2014\u201c * * * equivalent to the reservation of a reversion. * * * The reservation of a- reversion is not inconsistent with the creation of a trust to continue until the death of the reversioner. <em>(Dome </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust Co., </em>160 N. Y. 494; <em>Matter of Asch, </em>75 App. Div. 486, 495).\u201d (See, also, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., </em>287 N. Y. 500, 504-505; <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>294 N. Y. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We apply here the rule which was decisive in <em>Doctor </em>v. <em>Hughes [supra, </em>p. 312): \u201c * * * that to transform into a remainder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>what would ordinarily he a reversion, the intention to work the transformation must be clearly expressed. Here there is no clear expression of such a purpose. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Our decision in the present case is not inconsistent with the rulings in <em>Whittemore </em>v. <em>Equitable Trust </em>Co. (250 N. Y. 298) and <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>(280 N. Y. 43) where the language of the trusts involved led this court in each instance to conclude that it was the intention of the grantor to create a remainder rather than to reserve a reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The order of the Appellate Division, insofar as it affirms the order of Special Term denying petitioner\u2019s motion for an order revoking the trust, should be reversed without costs, and the matter remitted to Special Term for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Insofar as the Appellate Division order affirms two Special Term orders which, respectively, appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for unknown contingent beneficiaries and denied a motion for reargument, the appeal should be dismissed upon the ground that such orders do not finally determine a special proceeding within the meaning of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Loughban, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Thacher and Fuld, JJ., concur; Dye, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
