Vukovich, and Judge Mary DeGenaro from presiding over case No. 12-BE-28, now pending on Patel\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus in the Seventh District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">{\u00b6 2} Patel alleges that Judge Donofrio, Judge Vukovich, and Judge DeGenaro should be disqualified from hearing his underlying writ action because in a different case filed by him, <em>Patel v. Bellaire, </em>7th Dist. No. 10-BE-27, 2012-Ohio-4348, 2012 WL 4342093, they issued a biased opinion that violated his constitutional rights. Specifically, Patel argues that the panel included false statements in the <em>Patel </em>opinion, ignored \u201cundeniable facts and evidence,\u201d and \u201cmaliciously and wrongfully\u201d affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment against him. As a result, Patel claims that this panel of judges is \u201cincapable\u201d of adjudicating the underlying writ action and \u201cwill again deprive Patel of his Constitutional Right to due process due to his race and religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">{\u00b6 3} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Donofrio, Judge Vukovich, or Judge DeGenaro.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">{\u00b6 4} First, the gravamen of Patel\u2019s affidavit is that the Seventh District violated his constitutional rights in the separate <em>Patel </em>case. However, whether the appellate court erred in that case cannot be litigated in an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding. It is well established that an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. And a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>See In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4; <em>In re Disqualification of Light, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 604, 522 N.E.2d 458 (1988) (\u201calleged errors of law or procedure are legal issues subject to appeal and are not grounds for disqualification\u201d). Therefore, Patel\u2019s disagreement with the Seventh District\u2019s <em>Patel </em>opinion does not demonstrate bias or prejudice and is not grounds for disqualification in the underlying writ action. The remedy for these and other legal claims, if any, lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Second, Patel has failed to substantiate his claim of racial or religious bias. Allegations of such bias strike at the very heart of the judiciary and are among the most serious and damaging that can be directed at a judge. As a result, such claims must be proven by clear evidence establishing the existence of bias. <em>In re Disqualification of Cunningham, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1216, 2002-Ohio-7470, 798 N.E.2d 4, \u00b6 2. Here, Patel has submitted documents, transcripts, and affidavits from the <em>Patel </em>record in an attempt to show that the appellate court erred by misinterpreting the relevant evidence. However, he provides no evidence, beyond speculation, to support his assertion that the alleged errors were the product of bias \u2014 racial or otherwise. Vague or unsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988); <em>In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation * * * are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 6} Finally, because the appellate panel has been the target of his personal criticism, Patel suggests they should be disqualified because the probability of their bias is now \u201ctoo high to be Constitutionally tolerable.\u201d Patel cites <em>Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971), and <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975). As an initial matter, neither <em>Mayberry </em>nor <em>Withrow </em>support disqualification here. <em>Mayberry </em>involved the narrow issue of whether a judge should hear the criminal-contempt trial of a defendant when the same judge was the one reviled by the contemnor, and <em>Withrow </em>involved whether an administrative agency\u2019s combination of investigative and adjudicative functions created an unconstitutional risk of bias. <em>Mayberry </em>at 466; <em>Withrow </em>at 47. The issue here is much broader: whether judges on an appellate court should be removed from a case involving a litigant who has previously criticized the court\u2019s judicial opinions and lodged personal attacks against the judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 7} In general, absent some indication that the criticism was so great that no reasonable judge could be expected to remain unaffected, personal attacks on a judge \u2014 even serious allegations of racism, such as here \u2014 will not lead to the judge\u2019s disqualification. <em>See </em>Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>Section 21.8 (2d Ed.2007). As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Mayberry, </em>\u201c[a] judge cannot be driven out of a case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464; <em>see also Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Sweeney, </em>136 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir.1998), quoting 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, </em>Section 3542, 577-578 (2d Ed.1984) (\u201c \u2018A party cannot force disqualification by attacking the judge and then claiming that these attacks must have caused the judge to be biased against [her]\u2019 \u201d [brackets sic]). \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case. Nothing in the record suggests that Patel\u2019s accusations against the Seventh District judges have affected or would affect their conduct in the underlying case. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 17. Accordingly, the fact that this panel of judges has been the target of Patel\u2019s criticism is insufficient to warrant their disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">{\u00b6 8} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Donofrio, Judge Vukovieh, and Judge DeGenaro of the Seventh District Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
