Crawford, a retired judge sitting by assignment, from presiding over the contempt hearing in case No. 2011-MD-0006 in the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">{\u00b6 2} Helfrich alleges that Judge Crawford\u2019s conduct at a January 15, 2013 pretrial conference demonstrates bias and prejudice against Helfrich and that because of this conduct, Judge Crawford\u2019s impartiality at the upcoming hearing might reasonably be questioned. Specifically, in December 2012, Helfrich filed a motion indicating that some of the attorneys he contacted to represent him against the contempt charges would not do so because Judge Crawford was the assigned judge. The motion, according to Helfrich, embarrassed Judge Crawford, and at the pretrial conference, Judge Crawford allegedly \u201cbelittled Helfrich\u2019s credibility and condemned\u201d him for his assertions in the motion. According to Helfrich, Judge Crawford also \u201cwent so far as to order\u201d the prosecuting attorney to contact the attorneys named in Helfrich\u2019s motion. The prosecutor later sent letters to several of the attorneys explaining the matter and sought an affidavit or statement from each in response to Helfrich\u2019s allegations. To support his affidavit of disqualification, Helfrich has submitted an audio transcript of the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Crawford has responded in writing to the allegations in Helfrich\u2019s affidavit, asserting that he has no animosity toward Helfrich and no preconceived notions regarding the validity of the contempt charges. Judge Crawford acknowledges that he requested the prosecutor to \u201clook into Mr. Helfrich\u2019s claims.\u201d According to Judge Crawford, he is familiar with one of the attorneys mentioned in Helfrich\u2019s motion and \u201cdid not believe Mr. Helfrich was being totally candid\u201d with the court. In addition, Judge Crawford requested the prosecutor to look into Helfrich\u2019s allegations because he was concerned that \u201cMr. Helfrich would subsequently make a claim that [the judge] was denying him of his right to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 4} Licking County Prosecutor Kenneth W. Oswalt has also filed a response to Helfrich\u2019s affidavit, arguing that Helfrich\u2019s claims are meritless and that Judge Crawford has exhibited a \u201ctremendous degree of patience\u201d with Helfrich.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>addition, Oswalt now moves for the imposition of sanctions against Helfrich for abusing the disqualification process and for a declaration that Helfrich is a vexatious litigator pursuant to this court\u2019s practice rules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">{\u00b6 5} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 6} First, the transcript of the pretrial conference does not reveal any bias or prejudice on Judge Crawford\u2019s part that would require his disqualification. To be sure, if a judge\u2019s words or actions convey the impression that the judge has developed a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u201d or reached a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d that will prevent the judge from presiding over the case with \u201can open state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), then the judge should not remain on the case. Here, Judge Crawford questioned the legitimacy of Helfrich\u2019s claims regarding why he could not obtain counsel. The transcript does not indicate that Judge Crawford \u201cbelittled\u201d or \u201ccondemned\u201d Helfrich; nor does the transcript demonstrate that Judge Crawford has developed hostility or ill will toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 7} Second, Judge Crawford\u2019s request to the prosecutor has not created an appearance of impropriety and therefore does not warrant disqualification. \u201cThe proper test for determining whether a judge\u2019s participation in a case presents an appearance of impropriety is * * * an objective one. A judge should step aside or be removed if a reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8. Contrary to Helfrich\u2019s affidavit, no reasonable and informed observer would question Judge Crawford\u2019s impartiality under the circumstances here. Judge Crawford requested the prosecutor to look into Helfrich\u2019s claims because the judge believed that Helfrich was not being candid with the court and because he was concerned that Helfrich would later claim that he was denied his right to counsel. Nothing about the judge\u2019s request to the prosecutor, or his later explanation of that request, indicates that Judge Crawford was motivated by public embarrassment at Helfrich\u2019s claims or a personal prejudice or bias against Helfrich. Indeed, the judge affirms in his response that he has \u201cno animosity\u201d toward Helfrich, and there is no suggestion in the record that Judge Crawford has become so \u201cpersonally embroiled\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Helfrich as to make the judge unfit to sit in judgment on the contempt charges. <em>See Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971); <em>compare In re Disqualification of Saffold, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1204, 2010-Ohio-6723, 981 N.E.2d 869, \u00b6 2 (\u201cWhen the case becomes about the judge rather than the facts of the case and the law, it is time for the judge to step aside\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">{\u00b6 8} Similarly, the fact that Judge Crawford questioned Helfrich\u2019s credibility at the pretrial conference does not create an appearance of impropriety. The formation of a conditional opinion about a party\u2019s credibility is common during preliminary proceedings. However, the formation of such a conditional opinion is not sufficient to counter the presumption of the judge\u2019s ability to render a fair decision based on the law and facts later presented at the hearing. <em>See In re Disqualification of Brown, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1250, 1251, 657 N.E.2d 1353 (1993). Here, Judge Crawford has affirmed that he has no \u201cpreconceived notions\u201d regarding the validity of the contempt charges, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the presumption of impartiality has not been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 9} Finally, because the record does not conclusively establish that Helfrich\u2019s affidavit was frivolous, Oswalt\u2019s motions for the imposition of sanctions and to declare Helfrich a vexatious litigator under S.CtPrac.R. 4.03 are denied. However, given Helfrich\u2019s history of abusing the statutory affidavit-of-disqualification process in other cases <em>(see </em>case Nos. 07-AP-088, 08-AP-134, 11-AP-140, and 12-AP-019), he is again warned that the filing of any further frivolous, unsubstantiated, or repeated affidavits of disqualification will result in an imposition of appropriate sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Crawford.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">. On February 11 and 12, 2013, Helfrich filed replies to Judge Crawford\u2019s and Oswalt\u2019s responses to Helfrich\u2019s affidavit. R.C. 2701.03, however, requires that a party or counsel seeking to disqualify a judge in a pending action must file an <em>affidavit See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(2) (requiring that the affidavit contain the \u201cjurat of a notary public or another person authorized to administer oaths or affirmations\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Pokorny, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1238, 657 N.E.2d 1345 (1992) (by definition, an affidavit must be confirmed by oath or affirmation of the party maldng it and must be taken before a person having authority to administer the oath or affirmation). Helfrich\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>confirm the statements in these additional reply documents \u201cby oath or affirmation\u201d violates R.C. 2701.03. Accordingly, each document is a nullity and has no effect on the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"><em>. </em>The Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio were recently reorganized and renumbered.
