Reece II, to resentence him by issuing a judgment of conviction and sentence that complies with Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AfH\">Timothy Grinnell, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AoX\">Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and A. Paul Theis, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cNeither mandamus nor procedendo will lie to compel an act that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lester v. Pepple, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 353, 2011-Ohio-5756, 958 N.E.2d 566, \u00b6 1. Grinnell\u2019s sentencing entry constitutes a final, appealable order because it set forth his convictions, the sentence, the judge\u2019s signature, and the time stamp indicating the entry upon the journal by the clerk. <em>State ex rel. Culgan v. Kimbler, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 480, 2012-Ohio-3310, 974 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 1. Grinnell claims that the sentencing entry does not comply with Crim.R. 32(C), because it fails to specify whether he was convicted of specifications that he had been charged with. But there is no evidence that he was convicted of the specifications, and Crim.R. 32(C) requires a resolution of only those charges for which there were convictions. <em>See State ex rel. Rose v. McGinty, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 371, 2011-Ohio-761, 944 N.E.2d 672, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 3} Moreover, Grinnell\u2019s discussion regarding the entry not being timestamped is factually inaccurate. While the time-stamp on the copy of the entry attached to Grinnell\u2019s petition is hard to see, the darker copy appended to Judge Reece\u2019s brief clearly shows that the entry was stamped and certified by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed Grinnell\u2019s claims for extraordinary relief in mandamus and procedendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
