S.Ct.Prac.R. 11.2(A)(4) allows a motion for reconsideration of a decision on the merits of a case. \u201cWe have invoked the reconsideration procedures set forth in S.CtPrac.R. XI to correct decisions which, upon reflection, are deemed to have been made in error.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Huebner v. W. Jefferson Village Council, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 381, 383, 662 N.E.2d 339 (1995). <em>See also Buckeye Community Hope Found, v. Cuyahoga Falls, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 539, 541, 697 N.E.2d 181 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 2} The state does not ask this court to reconsider the judgment in this case, but instead requests that we modify certain portions of the opinion that were not outcome-determinative. For the most part, the state\u2019s concerns center around the statement in the original opinion, \u201cA hearsay violation itself violates the Confrontation Clause, and thus requires a heightened harmless-error analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Hood, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 595, 2012-Ohio-5559, 984 N.E.2d 929, \u00b6 40. We agree that that statement and supporting language was overbroad and was made in error. Upon reconsideration, we modify the opinion to clarify that it is not the hearsay nature of the cell-phone records at issue that made their admission constitutional error. Instead, it was their lack of authentication as business records that made their admission unconstitutional under the Confrontation Clause, because without that authentication, the records cannot be considered nontestimonial. We do not agree with the state that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the unauthenticated records was not constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 3} Accordingly, we vacate our decision in <em>State v. Hood, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 595, 2012-Ohio-5559, 984 N.E.2d 929, and replace it with the opinion issued today on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Merit Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 4} The issue we address in this case is whether, in general, cell-phone records produced by a cell-phone company constitute testimonial evidence that implicates a defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We find that ordinarily such records, if properly authenticated, are business records and are not testimonial. However, in this case, the cell-phone records were not properly authenticated at trial, and their admission violated the defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. We hold that the admission of the cell-phone records was error, but that that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">{\u00b6 5} In the early morning hours of January 26, 2009, defendant-appellant, James Hood, allegedly was one of four men who burst into a Cleveland home and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>robbed at gunpoint nearly a dozen people who had gathered to celebrate the birthdays of friends and family. A co-conspirator, Samuel Peet, was shot dead during the course of the robbery. Hood was arrested and charged with murder and multiple counts of aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping. As part of the proof to establish Hood\u2019s involvement in the crimes, the state introduced cell-phone records that it argued showed his communication -with the other co-conspirators and his whereabouts during the early morning in question. The issue we address is whether the introduction of that evidence violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Crime</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 6} In the late evening of January 25, 2009, a group of friends gathered in the basement of Sharon Jackson\u2019s home on Parkview Avenue in Cleveland to play cards and celebrate the birthdays of Denotra Jones and her son, Rodney. Among the guests that evening was one of the alleged co-conspirators, Terrence Davis, also known as \u201cTD.\u201d According to Rodney Jones, Davis\u2019s presence was unusual: Davis had not joined the group in over a year, and he left the party several times throughout the evening. TD had met earlier that day with Samuel Peet and the other co-conspirators \u2014 Hood and Kareem Hill \u2014 and told them about the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 7} Jerrell Jackson, homeowner Sharon Jackson\u2019s son, was the first person to be confronted by the assailants. He had walked some guests to their cars at around 5:00 a.m.; when he went back inside, there were four men in the hallway wearing masks and carrying guns. Jerrell noticed that one gun was an Uzi. Jerrell ran down into the basement, yelling a warning to everyone. Sharon Jackson, who had fallen asleep on a couch in her basement, was awakened by the commotion; she saw Jerrell being followed into the basement by four men wearing masks and carrying guns. She described the guns as two 9 mm handguns, one Uzi, and one handgun with a long chrome barrel. The robbers made the victims strip, then searched the clothing and took money and cell phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">{\u00b6 8} Nine of the eleven victims testified at trial. They described the same basic facts \u2014 men in dark clothing, wielding guns, stormed into the basement, ordered some of the victims to remove their clothes, and stole money and cell phones from them at gunpoint. Some witnesses differed on the number of assailants, from two to four, but the victims were robbed in two separate rooms of the basement. At some point, gunshots were heard. One of the co-conspirators, Peet, was later found dead nearby, in a yard several houses away. Several of the victims were able to identify him as one of the assailants due to his distinctive coat. He had been shot twice from close proximity; on his body were two cell phones belonging to victims and $345 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Earlier that morning, around 4:00 a.m., police received a report of a male pointing a gun at another male in the area of East 104th Street and Sophia Avenue, near where Hood lived. En route to the scene, the officers observed a green Jeep Cherokee stopped in the middle of Parkview Avenue with its lights on. As the officers approached, the Jeep sped away. The officers pursued the Jeep and were able to get a partial plate number, \u201cEOF,\u201d before losing sight of the vehicle. The same officers were called to help investigate the Parkview Avenue break-in and were told that a sport utility vehicle was involved in the crime. Shortly after the break-in, a green Cherokee, license plate number EOF 7079, was spotted at a local McDonald\u2019s. Cash, a mask, and two victims\u2019 cell phones were found inside. Hood, his co-defendant Kareem Hill, and William Sparks had been removed from the vehicle and arrested. At the time of his arrest, Hood had $411.25 in cash in his possession. Hill eventually testified against Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Kareem Hill\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 10} Hill initially lied to police and denied any involvement in the crimes. But when a latex glove found at the scene tested positive for Hill\u2019s DNA, Hill pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to testify truthfully against Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 11} Hill knew his co-conspirators Hood, Davis, and Peet from the neighborhood where he grew up. Hill was 18 at the time of the crimes; Hood was older\u2014 he was 29 at the time of the trial, according to his attorney. In the hours before the robbery, Hill and Hood met Davis and Peet at a bar. The four discussed robbing a card game on Parkview Avenue. Davis left the bar to go to the party. Davis eventually returned to the bar and laid out the specifics about the party situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 12} They all left the bar \u2014 Davis and Peet in one car, and Hill and Hood in Hill\u2019s green Jeep Cherokee. Hood and Hill went to Hood\u2019s house on Sophia Avenue to pick up guns. Hood went into his house and returned to the vehicle with a semiautomatic pistol, an Uzi, and latex gloves. Hill and Hood then drove to Parkview Avenue, where they saw Peet standing in a driveway near the target house; they let Peet get into the back seat of the Jeep. Peet had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 13} The three waited in the car. When Davis approached and informed them that the back door of the target house was open, Hood and Peet left the vehicle while Hill parked on the next street. Hill then cut through back yards to meet the others. All had weapons and wore hats or masks; Hill, Hood, and Davis wore latex gloves. Hill carried a black handgun, Peet carried a long silver revolver, Davis carried a black pistol, and Hood carried an Uzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 14} Hill testified that he and his cohorts took money and cell phones from the victims. At one point, there was an argument between Hood and Peet\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Hood had accused Peet of stealing money from the pile of cash that was to be divided. Davis broke up the altercation by announcing that it was time to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">{\u00b6 15} Hill ran up the stairs and outside; he was outside when he heard gunshots from inside the house. He never saw Peet leave the house. Hill and Hood left in Hill\u2019s Jeep while Davis went off in another direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 16} Hill and Hood returned to Hood\u2019s house on Sophia to drop off the guns. Hood went inside. Hood returned to the Jeep, and the two picked up Hill\u2019s friend, William Sparks, who Hill says had called him for a ride to McDonald\u2019s. Hill let Sparks drive. They went to McDonald\u2019s, where police stopped and arrested the three. The state ultimately did not pursue charges against Sparks.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Cellular-Phone-Record Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 17} At trial, the prosecution introduced cell-phone records for Hood, Hill, and Davis that detectives claimed to have subpoenaed from cellular-phone companies. Detective Carlin described the subpoena process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">We have to go to a county prosecutor. We can\u2019t just go and say we want these records. The phone companies have rules on that. They just don\u2019t give them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">We obtain an authorization for a subpoena and then we respond to\u2014 there is a subpoena person in the prosecutor\u2019s office * * *. We provide them with the numbers, they then type up the subpoenas, and based on their records and their relationship with the phone companies, they know, with the prefix numbers, what company that subpoena needs to go to and they direct the subpoena to that company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 18} Carlin testified that the cell-phone records were obtained through that process; however, the subpoenas are not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 19} The records purport to show cell-phone activity by Hood, Hill, and Davis on the night and early morning in question. During Hill\u2019s testimony, the prosecution used the records to ask Hill about certain calls that were placed by his phone or received by his phone. Those calls included ones made by Hill\u2019s cell phone to Davis\u2019s cell phone and vice versa, some right around the time of the crimes. Indeed, Detective Carlin testified that Davis first became a suspect in the robberies when the phone records were reviewed. There was also a call from one of the stolen cell phones to Hill\u2019s phone; Hill claimed that Hood had called Hill\u2019s number to see whether the stolen phone worked. The records showed Hill trying to contact Davis several times just before and after the robberies; Hill testified that Hood borrowed his phone to make those calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>{\u00b6 20} When the prosecution first attempted to use cell-phone records in its direct examination of Hill, the defense objected, claiming that the records lacked verification or certification of their authenticity. The prosecution argued that the records fell under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule and that Hill could verify the records based on his own knowledge. The court determined that the prosecution could use the records to have Hill testify as long as another witness would authenticate the records. The prosecutor stated that Detective Carlin, who subpoenaed the records, would testify as to how she obtained them. The defense argued that Detective Carlin could not authenticate business records of another entity and entered a continuing objection on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 21} On cross-examination, the defense used the phone records to poke holes in Hill\u2019s version of events. For instance, phone records showed that Hill\u2019s cell phone was calling Hood\u2019s cell phone at 2:42 a.m. Hill could not explain why he would have called Hood at a time when, according to Hill, the two men were a few feet apart, in the same car.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 22} After the cross-examination, Hood renewed his objection to the cellphone records after the state related that it would use Detective Carlin\u2019s partner, Detective Henry Veverka, to verify the records. The trial court remarked at that time: \u201cI\u2019ve done the case law research on it and my gut reaction is to subpoena Verizon on that basis. I guess Veverka would just have to come in and say that he issued it, how he\u2019s familiar with the business records of the company. That would be the testimony that would be proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 23} Detective Veverka testified that the records were obtained through subpoena. He also testified about his experience interpreting cell-phone records, which he learned mostly on-the-job through other detectives, including experience in using information from providers to determine geographic locations of the cell phone at the time calls were made, based upon cell-tower data. Veverka testified that Hood did not have his cell phone with him at the time of his arrest. He reviewed call logs for the days at issue, as well as cellular-tower records. He testified as to State\u2019s Exhibit 187, which contained tower records for Hood\u2019s cell phone. Those records indicated which cell tower Hood was near when he used his phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 24} Through the records, Veverka was able to ascertain that between 10:00 p.m. through 3:00 a.m., 15 calls were made or received on Hood\u2019s phone. The last of those 15 calls was at approximately 2:42 a.m.; the next call was at 6:24 a.m. He was able to determine through tower records that Hood was in the vicinity of the robbery when he used his cell phone. Through another record containing a log of calls to and from Hood\u2019s cell phone, Veverka was able to determine the dates and duration of the calls and the phone numbers involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>{\u00b6 25} From his examination of the cell-phone records, Veverka concluded that Hood, Hill, and Davis were all in the vicinity of the targeted house at the time the robberies were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 26} Defense counsel cross-examined Veverka. He admitted that although he knew more about interpreting cell-phone records than his fellow detectives, he did not have any expertise in cell phones or towers. He admitted being unaware that different towers have different powers, and admitted that phone company experts could provide maps and charts showing which towers serve which areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 27} The records Veverka testified about were admitted into evidence. The documents sent to the jury contained some alterations made by the detective \u2014 he wrote the phone numbers of the suspects on the documents and color-coded the records to highlight phone calls involving the different participants in the robbery. Hood\u2019s counsel objected, stating that the records had not been verified as a business record, had not been identified by any phone company, and contained the detective\u2019s personal notes, and that the alleged subpoenas were not in the record. The trial judge overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Verdict and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 28} The jury convicted Hood on one count of murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.02(B), \u201ccausing] the death of another as a proximate result of the offender\u2019s committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence that is a felony of the first or second degree,\u201d and acquitted him on one count of murder as defined in R.C. 2903.02(A), \u201cpurposely causing] the death of another.\u201d Further, the jury convicted Hood of nine counts of kidnapping, nine .counts of aggravated robbery, and one count of aggravated burglary, as well as two firearm specifications for each count, which were merged for purposes of sentencing into a single specification. The trial court had granted Hood\u2019s motion for acquittal on two counts of kidnapping and two counts of aggravated robbery when two of the victims failed to testify. The court ultimately sentenced Hood to an aggregate term of 21 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 29} Hood appealed his convictions to the Eighth District Court of Appeals; among other things, he argued that the trial court had erred \u201cby allowing cell phone records to be admitted into evidence without being properly authenticated in violation of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d The appellate court held that \u201c[assuming arguendo that these records were inadmissible and violative of appellant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him, any error on the part of the trial court in this regard was harmless.\u201d <em>State v. Hood, </em>8th Dist. No. 93854, 2010-Ohio-5477, 2010 WL 4522416, \u00b6 27. The appellate court applied the harmless-error standard applicable to constitutional error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Before constitutional error can be considered harmless, we must be able to \u201cdeclare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. Where there is no reasonable possibility that the unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623, paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in (1978), 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 30} The appellate court determined that the admission of the cell-phone records did not contribute to Hood\u2019s conviction and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 31} Hood sought jurisdiction in this court on the following proposition of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">Cell phone records are not admissible as business records without proper authentication. The admission of unauthenticated cell phone records under the business records exception violates the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 32} The matter is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal. 128 Ohio St.3d 1411, 2011-Ohio-828, 942 N.E.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Law and Analysis Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 33} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, in its Confrontation Clause, preserves the right of a criminal defendant \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court of the United States stated that the Confrontation Clause bars \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d The key issue is what constitutes a testimonial statement: \u201cIt is the testimonial character of the statement that separates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Crawford, </em>the court suggested that business records are \u201cby their nature\u201d nontestimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 56. In <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, this court stated that business records \u201care not \u2018testimonial in nature because they are prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted business and are \u201cby their nature\u201d not prepared for litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 82, quoting <em>People v. Durio, </em>7 Misc.3d 729, 734, 794 N.Y.S.2d 863 (2005). Whether a business record meets a hearsay exception is immaterial in regard to the Confrontation Clause; it is the nontestimonial character of the record that removes it from the purview of the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">Business and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\"><em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 324, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 35} A Confrontation Clause issue can arise \u201cif the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321. In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>for instance, the items of evidence at issue were reports by a company that provided forensic analysis on seized substances to establish whether they were illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 36} But the regularly conducted business activity of cell-phone companies is not the production of evidence for use at trial. The fact that records are used in a trial does not mean that the information contained in them was produced for that purpose. Even when cell-phone companies, in response to a subpoena, prepare types of records that are not normally prepared for their customers, those records still contain information that cell-phone companies keep in the ordinary course of their business. In <em>United States v. Yeley-Davis, </em>632 F.3d 673, 679 (10th Cir.2011), the defendant argued that the documents produced by the cellular-phone company were not merely phone records but were instead exhibits prepared especially for trial to prove the commission of a crime. The information contained in the exhibits was similar to that contained in the exhibits at issue in this case: \u201cThe phone records provide information about each call made or received by Ms. Yeley-Davis\u2019s number, including the number making the call, the number receiving the call, and the date and duration of the call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">Ms. Yeley-Davis contends that the phone records and authenticating documents in Exhibit 5 are testimonial because they were prepared solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>for use at trial to prove the conspiracy. * * * Specifically, she argues that the records were not telephone bills, but rather \u201cexhibits prepared especially and only for trial.\u201d * * * Ms. Yeley-Davis is correct that the phone records in Exhibit 5 are not telephone bills. This does not mean, however, that these records were created simply for litigation \u2014 they were not. Rather, these records were kept for Verizon\u2019s business purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 37} Likewise, in <em>United States v. Green, </em>396 Fed.Appx. 573, 575 (11th Cir.2010), the court held that subpoenaed records from the defendant\u2019s cell-phone carrier were not testimonial: \u201c[The defendant\u2019s] cell phone records and cell tower location information qualified as business records under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) which, by their nature, are non-testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d The court noted that \u201cdocuments which are routinely recorded for a purpose other than preparation for a criminal trial are non-testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574-575.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 38} Unlike the laboratory reports that the court found to be testimonial in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>or <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011), the culling and configuration of cell-phone records does not require the undertaking of a scientific process or an interpretation of results from experimentation. It reflects only a formatting of information that already exists as a part of the company\u2019s day-to-day business.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Authentication of Business Records</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">{\u00b6 39} Because cell-phone records are generally business records that are not prepared for litigation and are thus not testimonial, the Confrontation Clause does not affect their admissibility. But in this case, there is no assurance that the records at issue are business records. Evid.R. 803(6) governs the admission of business records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">\u201cTo qualify for admission under Rule 803(6), a business record must manifest four essential elements: (i) the record must be one regularly recorded in a regularly conducted activity; (ii) it must have been entered by a person with knowledge of the act, event .or condition; (iii) it must have been recorded at or near the time of the transaction; and (iv) a foundation must be laid by the \u2018custodian\u2019 of the record or by some \u2018other qualified witness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-13\"><em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 171, quoting Weissenberger, <em>Ohio Evidence Treatise, </em>Section 803.73, 600 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Here, there was simply no foundation laid by a custodian of the record or by any other qualified witness. Detective Veverka was not a custodian of the records. He did not prepare or keep the phone records as part of a regularly conducted business activity. Nor was he an \u201cother qualified witness\u201d under the rule. A \u201cqualified witness\u201d for this purpose would be someone with \u201cenough familiarity with the record-keeping system of the business in question to explain how the record came into existence in the ordinary course of business.\u201d 5 McLaughlin, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence, </em>Section 803.08[8][a] (2d Ed.2009); <em>United States v. Lauersen, </em>348 F.3d 329, 342 (2d Cir.2003). Tellingly, in the midst of discussions regarding the lack of authentication of the records, the trial judge remarked, \u201cMy gut reaction is to subpoena Verizon.\u201d That did not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>Yeley-Davis, </em>both the certification authenticating Yeley-Davis\u2019s phone records and the affidavit authenticating the phone records of her two alleged co-conspirators stated that the records were kept in the course of Verizon\u2019s regularly conducted business. 632 F.3d at 677. In this case, there is no such authentication. The records in this case lacked a certification or affidavit authenticating them, and no \u201ccustodian or other qualified witness\u201d testified that the phone records were business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 42} Thus, the cell-phone records in this case were not authenticated as business records, and that fact affects their status in regard to the Confrontation Clause. If the records had been authenticated, we could be sure that they were not testimonial, that is, that they were not prepared for use at trial. Without knowing that they were prepared in the ordinary course of a business, among the other requirements of Evid.R. 803(6), we cannot determine that they are nontestimonial. We thus find that the admission of the records in this case was constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Harmlessness Review</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 43} In determining whether admission of the cell-phone records was harmless, the court below applied the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of review. <em>Hood, </em>2010-Ohio-5477, 2010 WL 4522416, at \u00b6 27. \u201cWhere constitutional error in the admission of evidence is extant, such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of [the] defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 281, 452 N.E.2d 1323 (1983), paragraph six of the syllabus. The court below concluded, \u201cConsidering Hill\u2019s devastating testimony against appellant, we cannot find that the admission of the cell phone records contributed to appellant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. We agree that the admission of the cell-phone records was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 44} The evidence of Hood\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. We first note that jurors did not have to believe that Hood pulled the trigger to find him responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>for Peet\u2019s death; they just had to find that he participated in the criminal act that led to Peet\u2019s death. Kareem Hill was a co-conspirator and eyewitness; Hill\u2019s DNA was found at the scene. His version of events inside the house was consistent with testimony from the victims. He provided detailed testimony against Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 45} Hill\u2019s testimony was, by itself, disastrous for the defense. And it was corroborated by other evidence. Hood\u2019s DNA was found in Hill\u2019s vehicle, on a cigar tip in the front ashtray; Hood could not be ruled out as a contributor to DNA found on the right and left rear interior passenger doors of Hill\u2019s vehicle. Peet could not be ruled out as a contributor of part of the mix of DNA found on the interior left rear passenger door, corroborating Hill\u2019s testimony that Hood and Peet had been together in Hill\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 46} When police surrounded Hill\u2019s vehicle in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot following the robbery, Hood was inside. Also in the vehicle were cell phones stolen during the robbery, as well as cash. A large amount of cash was found in Hood\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 47} What role did the cell-phone records play in Hood\u2019s conviction? Upon review, we conclude that the records were of minimal probative value and, at most, merely cumulative in effect. Veverka testified that cell-tower logs placed Hood in the vicinity of the crime. But there were no calls to or from Hood between 2:52 a.m. and 6:24 a.m. on the morning of the crime. The break-in occurred at around 5:00 a.m., so the cell towers do not place him in the vicinity at the crucial time.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 48} In one respect, the phone records could even be seen as weakening the state\u2019s case against Hood. As the defense pointed out during its cross-examination of Hill, the records reflect calls made between Hill and Hood at times when the two men were, according to Hill, together in Hill\u2019s car. Hill had no explanation for why two people would communicate by phone when they were both inside the same car.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 49} Terrence Davis\u2019s records were also introduced. The records reveal no contact with Hood, but there is contact with Hill. This does back up Hill\u2019s testimony that conversations regarding planning occurred between someone using Hill\u2019s phone and Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">{\u00b6 50} But the key evidence \u2014 the evidence that places Hood inside the house participating in the crimes \u2014 does not depend in any way on the cell-phone records. DNA evidence proves that Hill was there, and Hill placed Hood there, armed with an Uzi, wearing latex gloves, and participating in the robberies. Victim testimony corroborated to a large extent Hill\u2019s version of events inside the house. Hood was in the vehicle containing the spoils of the robberies soon after they occurred. We thus conclude that the admission of the cell-phone records did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>not contribute to Hood\u2019s conviction and that their admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMvW\">William D.
