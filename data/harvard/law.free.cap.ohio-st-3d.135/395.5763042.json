(\u201cMCS\u201d), an Ohio trucking company, seeks a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, BMV Registrar Mike Rankin and Ohio Department of Public Safety Director Thomas P. Charles, to provide an unredacted, noncertified copy of the driving records of an MCS employee at cost. The case is consolidated with case No. 2012-1264, a direct appeal from the Tenth District Court of Appeals, involving the same parties and the same issues, but a different driving record.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">{\u00b6 3} In both cases, MCS requested unredacted copies of the driving records of its employees from the BMV at cost. The BMV refused to provide unredacted copies at cost \u2014 five cents per page \u2014 but instead, following the BMV rule, required MCS to specify the basis for its entitlement to an unredacted copy on form BMV1173 and to pay a $5 fee for a certified copy. MCS claims that it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>not need a certified copy and that it should be able to receive an unredacted copy at cost under the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 4} MCS is not entitled to a writ of mandamus, because disclosure of the records is prohibited by the DPPA unless a requester can demonstrate a permissible use, which it must do by complying with the procedure outlined in the rule, Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(2). The BMV properly promulgated the rule under its rule-making authority. The rule creates a procedure for requesting DPPA-governed materials, which includes filling out and submitting form BMV1173 and paying the $5 fee. The specific provisions of R.C. 4501.27 and Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1 \u2014 12\u201402(D)(2) prevail over the general provisions of R.C. 149.43, including the provision requiring that public records should be provided \u201cat cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 5} For the following reasons, we affirm the Tenth District in case No. 2012-1264 and deny the writ in case No. 2012-1394.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 6} The BMV is a division of the Ohio Department of Public Safety (\u201cDPS\u201d) and is a public office within the meaning of the Public Records Act. <em>State ex rel. Mancini v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 486, 633 N.E.2d 1126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 7} The DPPA prohibits the disclosure of personal information that the BMV has in connection with a driving record. R.C. 4501.27(A); 18 U.S.C. 2721(a). However, the DPPA permits disclosure for use by an employer or insurer to obtain or verify information about the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license. R.C. 4501.27(B)(2)(j); 18 U.S.C. 2721(b)(9). The federal DPPA does not establish a procedure for requesting protected material from the BMV, but Ohio\u2019s statute grants the BMV rule-making authority to carry out its duties. R.C. 4501.27(E). The BMV promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02 under this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">\n<em>Case No. 2012-126\u00cd</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 8} On August 31, 2010, MCS submitted a public-records request to the BMV seeking an unredacted copy of the driving record of one of its employees. In its request, MCS stated that the record was necessary to verify information about the employee\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license as required by the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, 49 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. MCS did not submit a form BMV1173 with its request, nor did it pay any fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">{\u00b6 9} The BMV provided MCS with a copy of the driving record, but with the employee\u2019s personal information redacted. In a subsequent letter, an attorney for DPS explained that the redaction is required by R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>DPPA, unless the request is made by a statutorily exempted requestor for statutorily defined purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 10} MCS filed a mandamus action in the Tenth District Court of Appeals, claiming that it was entitled to an unredacted copy of the driver\u2019s record at cost. The respondents countered that disclosure was prohibited by the DPPA and that MCS had failed to demonstrate that any exception applied, because it filed a request under the general public-records provision, Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1 \u2014 12\u2014 02(D)(1), rather than under Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(2), which allows the requester to obtain unredacted records after showing that it meets the statutory conditions and paying the $5 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 11} The Tenth District magistrate recommended denial of the writ, finding that because MCS had applied under Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(1) rather than (D)(2), it was entitled only to a redacted copy. A majority of the panel agreed, finding that a requester is not authorized to obtain an unredacted copy unless the request conforms to section (D)(2) of the rule. <em>State ex rel. Motor Carrier Serv., Inc. v. Williams [Rankin], </em>10th Dist. No. 10AP-1178, 2012-Ohio-2590, 2012 WL 2106223. The BMV \u201chas promulgated a rule requiring a requester to provide specific information regarding the purpose of the intended use accompanied by a certification of truthfulness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. MCS did not follow this procedure, but made a general public-records request. One member of the panel dissented in part on the merits, asserting that the BMV, while authorized to promulgate the rule requiring a special application for restricted information, went too far in its requirement that an eligible requester \u201cchoose either a public records request to receive a redacted copy or the completion of form BMV1173, request for a certified abstract, and payment of a $5 fee to get a full copy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30 (French, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\n<em>Case No. 2012-1391</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 12} On July 3, 2012, MCS submitted a request, including a completed BMV' form, but again lacking the $5 fee, to BMV Registrar Rankin for a copy of the unredacted, noncertified driving record of an employee. MCS again specified that its request was to verify information relating to its employee\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license that is required under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986. The DPS again provided only a redacted version of the requested driving record, citing the DPPA and Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 13} On August 14, MCS filed case No. 2012-1394 as an original action in this court for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, BMV Registrar Mike Rankin and DPS Director Thomas P. Charles, to provide access at cost to an unredacted, noncertified copy of the employee driving record MCS requested in its July 3, 2012 request. On October 1, 2012, an alternative writ was granted. 133 Ohio St.3d 1403, 2012-Ohio-4477, 975 N.E.2d 1022. At the same time, case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Nos. 2012-1394 and 2012-1264 were consolidated for consideration by the court. <em>Id. </em>at 1402.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">{\u00b6 14} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\n<em>Request for oral argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 15} The phrase \u201cRequest for Oral Argument\u201d appears on the front page of MCS\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Writ in case No. 2012-1394, without explanation in the memorandum or in any pleading. As part of their response to the motion to consolidate, the BMV and DPS concur in that request, although again with no explanation as to why oral argument is needed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 16} In cases in which oral argument is not mandatory \u2014 such as original actions and direct appeals from cases originating in a court of appeals, see S.Ct.Prac.R. 17.02(A) \u2014 we have discretion to grant oral argument, and \u201c \u2018in exercising this discretion, we consider whether the case involves a matter of great public importance, complex issues of law or fact, a substantial constitutional issue, or a conflict among courts of appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Jean-Baptiste v. Kirsch, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 421, 2012-Ohio-5697, 983 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 118, 2006-Ohio-5339, 855 N.E.2d 444, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 17} No conflict in the lower courts has been identified, and the case involves an important, but narrow, issue of public-records law. The briefs are sufficient for us to resolve the appeal here. <em>Jean-Baptiste </em>at \u00b6 13, <em>citing State ex rel. Otten v. Henderson, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 453, 2011-Ohio-4082, 953 N.E.2d 809, \u00b6 19. We therefore proceed to decide the merits of the case without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">\n<em>Public Records Act analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

However, records or parts of records are exempt from this requirement if their release is prohibited by state or federal law. R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 20} In 1994, the federal government enacted the DPPA to regulate the disclosure and resale of personal information in the records of state motor-vehicle departments. Pub.L. No. 103-322,108 Stat. 2099; <em>Reno v. Condon, </em>528 U.S. 141, 143, 120 S.Ct. 666, 145 L.Ed.2d 587 (2000). In 2000, the Ohio General Assembly followed suit, amending R.C. 4501.27 to comply with federal requirements. 2000 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 600, 148 Ohio Laws, Part III, 6524, 6535; <em>Bailey v. Ohio Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-378, 2002-Ohio-7361, 2002 WL 31906708, \u00b6 30. Both the federal DPPA and its Ohio counterpart prohibit the BMV from \u201cknowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] available to any person or entity\u201d any \u201cpersonal information\u201d about an individual that the bureau obtained \u201cin connection with a motor vehicle record.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 2721(a)(1); R.C. 4501.27(A). The Ohio statute defines \u201cpersonal information\u201d as \u201cinformation that identifies an individual, including, but not limited to, an individual\u2019s photograph or digital image, social security number, driver or driver\u2019s license identification number, name, telephone number, or medical or disability information, or an individual\u2019s address other than the five-digit zip code number.\u201d R.C. 4501.27(F)(3); <em>see also </em>R.C. 4501.27(F)(5) (defining \u201csensitive personal information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 21} DPPA\u2019s ban on disclosure has exceptions, some requiring disclosure (not pertinent here) and some permitting disclosure. One exception allows the BMV to disclose personal information \u201c[f]or use by an employer or by the agent or insurer of an employer to obtain or verify information relating to the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license or permit that is required under the \u2018Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986,\u2019 100 Stat. 3207-170, 49 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., as now or hereafter amended.\u201d R.C. 4501.27(B)(2)(j). MCS claims to be such an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Ohio\u2019s DPPA establishes a procedure for requesting DPPA-protected material from the BMV, by granting the BMV rule-making authority. Specifically, R.C. 4501.27(E) states that \u201c[t]he registrar of motor vehicles may adopt any forms and rules, consistent with but no more restrictive than the requirements of [the federal DPPA] that are necessary to carry out the registrar\u2019s duties under this section * *</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 23} Under that authority, the BMV promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02, which articulates the prohibitions and exceptions in the DPPA and creates a procedure for requesting a motor-vehicle record. The rule creates two options for requesting such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 24} First, the requester may make a public-records request under Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(1). A request made under this section entitles the requester to a copy of the record at cost, but with personal information redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 25} A requester seeking an unredacted record containing personal information may make a request under Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(2). Under this section, the requester must complete form BMV1173 and submit \u201cthe fees statutorily authorized in the Revised Code.\u201d Form BMV1173 requires the requester to provide proof of identity and to state which of the statutory exceptions to nondisclosure of personal information applies. <em>See </em>Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(G)(1) and (2). R.C. 4509.05(B) authorizes a fee of $5 for a certified abstract of a driving record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>Ohio Adm.Code 1501:1-12-02 does not conflict with the Public Records Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 26} A well-settled principle of Ohio law is that when two statutes, one general and one specific, cover the same subject matter, the specific provision is to be construed as an exception to the general statute that might otherwise apply. <em>See State ex rel. Slagle v. Rogers, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 89, 2004-Ohio-4354, 814 N.E.2d 55, \u00b6 14, citing <em>State ex rel. Dublin Securities, Inc. v. Ohio Div. of Securities, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 426, 429, 627 N.E.2d 993 (1994). This rule has also been codified at R.C. 1.51:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 27} MCS\u2019s argument here appears to be that the provisions of Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, are immune from that principle. MCS argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(2) is invalid because it \u201cconflicts with Ohio\u2019s public records statute\u201d and is \u201cwholly inconsistent with the plain language of R.C. 149.43.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">{\u00b6 28} More specifically, MCS complains that the rule \u201ceffectively prohibits a DPPA-authorized requester from ever obtaining an unredacted, uncertified copy of the record pursuant to Ohio\u2019s public records laws.\u201d The rule also \u201cforces the DPPA-authorized requester to pay a $5.00 fee for a certified copy \u2014 a product which is not being requested, nor wanted.\u201d MCS also complains that R.C. 149.43 and 4501.34 and the DPP A, \u201cwhen read together, mandate disclosure of the unredacted records to MCS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 29} Contrary to MCS\u2019s position, the Public Records Act is not immune from R.C. 1.51. The federal and state DPPAs prohibit the BMV from disclosing personal information except under specific circumstances, and the General Assembly is permitted to establish an exception or partial exception to the Public Records Act to accommodate that law. The General Assembly chose to do that in R.C. 4501.27, and it chose to permit the BMV to promulgate rules that specify a procedure for qualified requesters to obtain information as long as the requester pays a fee and states which exception to the ban on disclosure applies. Under R.C. 1.51, these specific provisions cannot be overcome by the more general provisions of the Public Records Act. Rather, the opposite is true: the specific prevails over the general. Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(2) allows the BMV to verify that the requester is qualified to receive the information and will follow the nondisclosure rules in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 30} MCS appears to agree with the first two requirements of Ohio Adm. Code 4501:1-12-02(D)(2), as it has filled out form BMV1173 for at least one of its requests and identified the DPPA exception that applies. MCS\u2019s main objection seems to be to the $5 fee. But we have specifically held on more than one occasion that the \u201cat cost\u201d provision of the Public Records Act is also amenable to R.C. 1.51 and that a statutory provision for a specific fee is considered an exception to the general \u201cat cost\u201d provision. <em>State ex rel. Slagle v. Rogers, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 89, 2004-Ohio-4354, 814 N.E.2d 55. In <em>Slagle, </em>we held that the \u201cat cost\u201d provision of R.C. 149.43(B)(1) means \u201cthe actual cost of making copies, \u2018unless the cost is otherwise set by statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>State ex rel. Warren Newspapers, Inc. v. Hutson, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 619, 625, 640 N.E.2d 174 (1994). In <em>Hutson, </em>we cited 1989 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 89-073 for the same proposition. Moreover, <em>Slagle </em>cited another Attorney General Opinion, requested by the relator in <em>Slagle, </em>which also held that when a specific statute establishes a method for determining the amount a party must pay for a photocopy of a transcript, that statute applies rather than the \u201cat cost\u201d provision in R.C. 149.43. 2002 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 2002-014.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Thus, under <em>Slagle </em>and the precedent cited there, a specific statute establishing a fee or a method for determining a fee for a requested public record acts as an exception to the general \u201cat cost\u201d language in R.C. 149.43. Here, the BMV permissibly set up a special procedure for the release of certain records, together with a special provision requiring the payment of a specific fee for that release. Under R.C. 1.51 and <em>Slagle, </em>these are special provisions that supersede the general language of R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 32} Therefore, MCS cannot get an unredacted copy of the driver\u2019s record without applying for it under Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1 \u2014 12\u201402(D)(2) by completing form BMV1173 and by paying the $5 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>The BMV is not estopped from arguing that Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02 is valid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 33} The doctrine of judicial estoppel prohibits a party from taking a position inconsistent with one successfully and unequivocally assex-ted by the same pax-ty in a prior proceeding. <em>Greer-Burger v. Temesi, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 324, 2007-Ohio-6442, 879 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 25. MCS contends that the arguments made by the DPS and the BMV in another <em>case </em>\u2014 Roth <em>v. Guzman, </em>650 F.3d 603 (6th Cir.2011)\u2014 estop them from making the arguments they make here. We disagree. <em>Roth </em>is factually distinguishable and was decided based on federal law alone. Moreover, at the time relevant to the facts in <em>Roth, </em>Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-12-02 did not contain the two options now found in sections (D)(1) and (D)(2). 2000-2001 Ohio Monthly Record 58. Finally, the arguments made there by the BMV are not at odds with the arguments made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 34} The issue in <em>Roth </em>was whether the DPS director and the BMV registrar had qualified immunity under the federal DPPA for their disclosure of personal information in bulk to a company, Shadowsoft, Inc. Shadowsoft had applied for personal information of Ohio drivers in bulk, asserting that it had a legitimate reason for the information, and signed an agreement that it would use the information in conformity with all applicable laws governing personal information. According to the plaintiffs in <em>Roth, </em>Shadowsoft later sold the entire database to an entity that placed it on a public website, in contravention of the DPPA.
