For the reasons explained, we hold that in juvenile cases, the state is not authorized to pursue a discretionary appeal when it fails to take an appeal as of right in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">{\u00b6 2} The Eighth District reached the correct result in this case, but it did so by relying on a dissent in <em>State v. Arnett, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 186, 489 N.E.2d 284 (1986). In contrast, appellant, the state of Ohio, relies on our majority opinion in <em>Arnett, </em>as well as our later decision in <em>State v. Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644 (1990), which cited <em>Arnett </em>with approval. <em>Id. </em>at 159. This opinion will affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, limit <em>Arnett </em>to its facts, and explain the scope of <em>Bistricky, </em>thereby providing clarity to a somewhat confusing area.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">\n<em>The charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">{\u00b6 3} On September 29, 2009, the state filed seven complaints against appellee, M.M., a juvenile, alleging that he was delinquent for engaging in conduct that, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>he had been an adult, would have constituted rape and gross sexual imposition. The alleged victims were siblings, M.J., A.R., K.R., and C.R. The complaints each charged that the conduct had occurred between October 2008 and January 2009, when M.M. was 12 years old and the alleged victims were 8, 6, 4, and 2, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>Pretrial proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 4} On April 22, 2010, the state filed a notice of its intention to introduce statements that M.J. and A.R. made to Lauren Krol, a social worker for the Cleveland Police Department Sex Crimes and Child Abuse Unit. The state argued that the statements are admissible under Evid.R. 807,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which permits admission of certain hearsay statements made by child victims about physical or sexual abuse. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 5} On October 28, 2010, a magistrate held an evidentiary hearing on a motion in limine filed by M.M., which sought exclusion of all out-of-court statements made by any of the alleged victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 6} The magistrate determined that M.J., A.R., and K.R. were competent to testify at trial but that C.R., who was two years old at the time of the alleged conduct, was not competent to testify. The magistrate further concluded that because M.J. and A.R. were competent to testify at trial, Evid.R. 807 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>permit admission of their statements, as the rule excludes such statements as hearsay when the child\u2019s testimony is reasonably obtainable. Evid.R. 807(A)(2). For that reason, the magistrate determined that the state was precluded from introducing at trial \u201cany statements by the alleged victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">{\u00b6 7} The state did not move to set aside the magistrate\u2019s decision even though it had the right to do so no later than ten days after the adverse order was issued. Juv.R. 40(D)(2)(b). The state also failed to perfect an interlocutory appeal as of right to the Eighth District, pursuant to Juv.R. 22(F). Instead, the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>The trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 8} At trial, the state\u2019s primary witnesses were M.J., A.R., K.R., their mother, S.H.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the social worker, Krol.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 9} S.H. testified that she was dating M.M.\u2019s older brother, and from October 2008 to January 2009, she and her children lived with M.M., M.M.\u2019s older brother, and their mother. In January 2009, S.H., who was pregnant, developed a kidney infection. S.H. testified that while she was lying sick on the kitchen floor in need of medical assistance, M.M.\u2019s mother accused her of fabricating the pregnancy and illness and \u201cliterally walked over [her] body.\u201d As a result, S.H. realized that she was not welcome at the house and that she and her children needed to move out. S.H. left the house by ambulance; however, her children remained. After she was released from the hospital, she went back to the home only to collect her children and her belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 10} S.H. testified that thereafter, the children disclosed to an adult cousin that M.M. had sexually abused them. The cousin told S.H. and she, in turn, reported the abuse to the police. As a result, in March 2009, Krol contacted S.H. and arranged to interview the children about the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 11} Krol is an intake sex-abuse social worker who investigates referrals from the child-abuse hotline, 696-KIDS. She testified that in her professional capacity, she investigates allegations of sexual abuse, makes referrals, ensures the safety of children, and provides services to the children\u2019s families. In response to a defense objection to a question about what the children said in the interview, the prosecuting attorney argued that Evid.R. 803(4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>for admission of statements made for the purpose of medical treatment, justified the admission of Krol\u2019s testimony about statements that M.J. and A.R. made to her. The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence under Evid.R. 803(4), but in doing so, ruled that the statements were admissible only to explain Krol\u2019s subsequent actions on behalf of the children. The trial court did not consider the children\u2019s out-of-court statements as substantive evidence of M.M.\u2019s alleged conduct, thereby adhering to the pretrial ruling with regard to admissibility of the statements under Evid.R. 807. Thus, the state\u2019s only direct evidence of M.M.\u2019s alleged conduct came from the testimony of the alleged victims at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 12} But the state\u2019s efforts to elicit coherent testimony from the children about the alleged abuse by M.M. were unavailing. The children\u2019s answers on the stand were confused and unfocused.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 13} M.J. testified that M.M. did \u201cinappropriate things\u201d to his sisters and to him, but he could not remember what those things were. A.R. testified that M.M. had requested that she do something that she did not want to do, but she also testified that she did not know how to describe what M.M. had requested that she do. A.R. further testified that she saw M.M. \u201claying on\u201d M.J., but she was unable to describe what M.M. was doing to him. When asked if she saw anything happen to her sister C.R. while they were living with M.M., K.R. testified that she had, but she was not asked any further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 14} At the close of the state\u2019s case, the prosecuting attorney renewed her argument that the children\u2019s out-of-court statements were admissible under Evid.R. 807, contending that even though they were competent to testify, their failure to provide answers in court made their testimony \u201cnot reasonably obtainable\u201d within the meaning of the rule. The trial court was not persuaded and did not allow the out-of-court statements into evidence. At that point, the defense moved for dismissal pursuant to Juv.R. 29. The court granted the motion, dismissing all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\n<em>The appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">{\u00b6 15} The state sought leave to file a discretionary appeal, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A). In doing so, it argued that appellate review of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence was permissible under our decision in <em>State v. Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644. Although leave to appeal was initially granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>after briefing and oral argument, the court of appeals determined that leave to appeal had been improvidently granted and therefore dismissed the appeal. <em>In re M.M., </em>8th Dist. No. 96776, 2011-Ohio-6758, 2011 WL 6920724.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 16} In so holding, the Eighth District explained that <em>Bistricky </em>permits courts <em>of </em>appeals in cases of acquittal to address substantive issues that are capable of repetition yet evading review. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. But because an adequate interlocutory remedy provided the state with \u201cthe means to correct any perceived error before the adjudicatory hearing,\u201d the court of appeals concluded that the evidentiary issues will not escape future review. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State v. Arnett, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 188-191, 489 N.E.2d 284 (Celebrezze, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 17} We accepted review of the state\u2019s discretionary appeal. <em>In re M.M., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 1539, 2012-Ohio-2025, 966 N.E.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 18} The sole proposition of law before us asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">The right to file an appeal pursuant to <em>State v. Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644 (1990), is not waived if the state does not pursue an interlocutory remedy under Crim.R. 12(K)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Juv.R. 22(E). The existence of interlocutory remedies does not preclude the state from appealing substantive legal issues involving the suppression or exclusion of evidence pursuant to <em>Bistricky.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 19} We reject the state\u2019s proposition because it both lacks statutory support and ignores a governing rule of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">{\u00b6 20} As a threshold issue, we must explain that the state\u2019s proposition contains a red herring. Contrary to the state\u2019s framing of the issue, <em>Bistricky </em>cannot and does not answer the question before us, because only a statute, not a decision of this court, can imbue the state with a substantive right to appeal. We will fully explain the proper place for <em>Bistricky, </em>but first we turn our attention to a discussion of the controlling law.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\n<em>R.C. 2945.67(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 21} The Ohio Constitution confers jurisdiction upon the courts of appeals to \u201creview and affirm, modify, or reverse\u201d a lower court\u2019s judgment or final order. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 3(B)(2); <em>Cincinnati Polyclinic v. Batch, </em>92 Ohio St. 415, 111 N.E. 159 (1915), paragraph one of the syllabus. But the General Assembly \u2014 and the General Assembly alone^ \u2014 has the authority to provide by law the method of exercising that jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 22} In an exercise of that authority, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2945.67, which grants the state limited rights to appeal in criminal and juvenile cases. <em>State v. Davidson, </em>17 Ohio St.3d 132, 134, 477 N.E.2d 1141 (1985); <em>In re A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, \u00b6 30. Absent R.C. 2945.67, the state has no substantive right to appeal trial-court decisions in criminal cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Davidson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2945.67 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">(A) A prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case, or any decision of a juvenile court in a delinquency case, which decision grants * * * a motion to suppress evidence * * * and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict, of the trial court in a criminal case or of the juvenile court in a delinquency case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">{\u00b6 24} The state\u2019s right to appeal certain decisions as of right originates in the first clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). <em>Davidson </em>at 134; <em>see also State v. Wallace, </em>43 Ohio St.2d 1, 2, 330 N.E.2d 697 (1975). The state\u2019s right to appeal \u201cany other decision\u201d by leave of court originates in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">{\u00b6 25} Notably, the right to appeal by leave of court is defined by reference to the right to appeal as a matter of right. First, the General Assembly defined the class of rulings of which the state may, without leave of court, obtain appellate review. This class includes a decision that grants a motion to suppress, as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">{\u00b6 26} In the same sentence, the General Assembly provided for discretionary appeals of \u201cany other decision.\u201d Thus, R.C. 2945.67(A) makes clear that the state\u2019s right to a discretionary appeal is exclusive of any absolute right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">{\u00b6 27} We reject the state\u2019s unsound position, which would result in the state having an option to seek leave to appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A) regarding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>suppression ruling either immediately upon the ruling or later after the delinquency adjudication. Such a position ignores the General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201cother\u201d in the statute. <em>State ex rel. Charvat v. Frye, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 76, 2007-Ohio-2882, 868 N.E.2d 270, \u00b6 23 (in construing a statute, a court may not delete or add words). Indeed, the proposition implicitly asserts that the state has the right to seek leave to appeal \u201cany decision,\u201d including a decision regarding the suppression of evidence that is clearly referred to in the first clause of the statute as a decision that is appealable by the state \u201cas a matter of right.\u201d Given the limited nature of the state\u2019s appellate rights, that assertion cannot be true. The plain language of R.C. 2945.67(A) refutes the state\u2019s position that it has the right to seek leave to appeal \u201cany decision,\u201d including one that it already has a right to appeal without seeking leave. An attempt to fuse the two renders the words of the statute meaningless. We also reject any argument that the word \u201cother\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cexcept the final verdict\u201d because that construction renders the word \u201cother\u201d superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 28} So, there is no statutory authority \u2014 and therefore no authority whatsoever \u2014 for a discretionary appeal when the state has the right to appeal without regard to the discretion of the appellate court. Having explained the state\u2019s substantive rights to an appeal without seeking leave, we turn our attention to the procedure that the state must follow in exercising that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Juv.R. 22(F)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">{\u00b6 29} In order to exercise its substantive right to appeal, the state must comply with the relevant rules of procedure. <em>Wallace, </em>43 Ohio St.2d at 2-3, 330 N.E.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Wallace, </em>the state filed a criminal complaint against the defendant, charging him with failure to plug unproductive wells in violation of R.C. 1509.12. Wallace successfully sought dismissal on the ground that R.C. 1509.12 was unconstitutional. The state filed a notice of appeal pursuant to App.R. 4(B), but failed to comply with the requirement contained in R.C. 2945.67 to obtain leave to appeal. The court of appeals dismissed the appeal because the state\u2019s failure to comply with the statute deprived it of jurisdiction. We affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">{\u00b6 31} In so doing, we explained that the state\u2019s substantive right to appeal originates only in a legislative grant of authority. <em>Id. </em>at 2. And \u201cthe grant apparent in R.C. 2945.67 * * * was dependent upon an application for leave to appeal being allowed by the appellate court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the statutory requirement of obtaining leave, rather than governing procedure, constituted a condition precedent necessary to trigger a substantive right. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">{\u00b6 32} Because the state failed to comply with the statutory requirement to seek leave to appeal in <em>Wallace, </em>we held that the court of appeals correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. But we also explained that \u201c[i]n all other respects\u201d the procedures outlined by the statute are superseded by the requirements of the Appellate Rules. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 33} Here too, the state must comply with the controlling procedural rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 34} Juv.R. 22(F) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">In delinquency proceedings the state may take an appeal as of right from the granting of a motion to suppress evidence if, in addition to filing a notice of appeal, the prosecuting attorney certifies that (1) the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and (2) the granting of the motion has rendered proof available to the state so weak in its entirety that any reasonable possibility of proving the complaint\u2019s allegations has been destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">Such appeal shall not be allowed unless the notice of appeal and the certification by the prosecuting attorney are filed with the clerk of the juvenile court within seven days after the date of the entry of the judgment or order granting the motion. Any appeal which may be taken under this rule shall be diligently prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">{\u00b6 35} Juv.R. 22(F) plainly requires the state to file an interlocutory appeal if it wishes to seek review of an adverse decision that suppresses evidence. And it must do so, if at all, within seven days of the adverse decision. It further requires the prosecutor to certify that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay and that the exclusion of the evidence seriously jeopardizes the state\u2019s case. The importance of the certification requirement is obvious, as the proceedings are to be halted until the issues of admissibility of evidence are decided on appeal. The existence of an interlocutory appeal is necessary to ensure a fair trial for both the defendant and the state. It also serves judicial economy. We need not quibble over \u201cwaiver\u201d or \u201cforfeiture.\u201d We simply hold that the state failed to follow the mandatory procedure set forth in Juv.R. 22(F), and it therefore failed to exercise its substantive right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Bistricky <em>is inapposite</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">{\u00b6 36} The state makes a colorable (but meritless) argument that <em>Bistricky </em>recognizes an alternative right to appeal. There is undeniable confusion that stems from our decisions in <em>Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644; <em>State v. Keeton, </em>18 Ohio St.3d 379, 481 N.E.2d 629 (1985); and <em>State v. Arnett, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 186, 489 N.E.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Bistricky, </em>the state charged five police officers with drug trafficking. After the state\u2019s case in chief, the trial court entered a verdict in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>officers on the basis that they were exempt from prosecution under R.C. 3719.14(B) (police officer is exempt from drug laws when offer to sell is necessary for performance of job-related duty). The state sought leave to appeal the exemption determination. In doing so, it expressly conceded that double-jeopardy principles prohibited the retrial of defendants, but asserted that the court of appeals could grant leave to appeal the legal basis of the ruling granting acquittal. The court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">{\u00b6 38} We construed R.C. 2945.67(A)\u2019s language \u201cany other decision, except the final verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159. In doing so, we held that this second clause of R.C. 2945.67(A) authorizes a court of appeals to review substantive legal rulings when such rulings result in a judgment of acquittal, as long as the state does not appeal the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 160. Accordingly, we remanded the case for the court of appeals to exercise its discretion to decide whether it would accept the state\u2019s appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 39} <em>Bistricky </em>simply reaffirmed what we had already held, that \u201ceven in a case resulting in a judgment of acquittal, the prosecution may appeal from evidentiary rulings, such as admissibility of evidence * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, citing <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Arnett. </em>And we emphasized that <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Arnett </em>expressly permitted discretionary appeals of evidentiary rulings on the authority of the \u201cany other decision\u201d clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). <em>Bistricky </em>at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 40} Because we could discern no distinction between evidentiary rulings and rulings on substantive issues of law, we extended <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Arnett </em>and held that the state also had the right to seek discretionary review of nonevidentiary, substantive rulings under the authority of the \u201cany other decision\u201d clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). <em>Bistricky </em>at 159-160.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 41} But as we will explain, a salient point of <em>Keeton </em>has been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Keeton, </em>three defendants were indicted for robbery in connection with their alleged attempt to lure a truck driver into a gambling scheme. When the truck driver refused to participate, the defendants allegedly stole his money and fled. Police pursued, detained, and searched the three men. As a result, an officer removed a roll of four $20 bills from Keeton\u2019s pocket. After the defendants were transported to the police department, the officer removed additional sums of money from the defendants\u2019 pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 43} Because the officer\u2019s trial testimony concerning his custody of the money conflicted with his testimony at a preliminary hearing, the trial court excluded the money from evidence. As a result, the trial court directed a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The state sought leave to appeal, but the court of appeals held that it lacked jurisdiction. We reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 44} We held that the appeal was reviewable under the \u201cany other decision\u201d clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). 18 Ohio St.3d at 381, 481 N.E.2d 629. But we emphasized that \u201cthe evidentiary rulings in this case, while they do not fall within the provisions of R.C. 2945.67(A) granting an appeal as of right, do fall within the language of \u2018any other decision, except the final verdict * * * \u2019 in R.C. 2945.67(A) which permits an appeal to the court of appeals after leave has first been obtained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">{\u00b6 45} Moreover, we expressly cautioned that the state must comply with the procedural requirements explained in <em>Wallace. Id. Keeton, </em>unlike this case, did not involve review of a decision listed in the first clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). And <em>Keeton, </em>unlike this case, did not involve a mandatory rule of procedure. Less than one year later, we glossed over that important distinction in <em>Arnett, </em>thereby creating precedent for the state\u2019s ill-conceived proposition in this case. And as we have already explained, we compounded the problem in <em>Bistricky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Arnett, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 186, 489 N.E.2d 284, the defendant was charged with murder but claimed self-defense. At trial, over the state\u2019s objection, he supported his claim with the expert testimony of a psychiatrist and a psychologist, who testified that they had used sodium amytal and hypnosis, respectively, to interview Arnett about his mental state during the shooting. Both testified that in their opinions, Arnett was intensely fearful. After the jury acquitted Arnett, the state sought leave to appeal the admission of the expert testimony. The court of appeals dismissed the appeal, holding that the acquittal precluded review of the evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 47} In a brief opinion, composed mostly of <em>Keeton </em>excerpts, we reversed. <em>Arnett </em>at 188. The majority explained only that a \u201ccomparable situation was presented to this court in <em>Keeton.\u201d Arnett </em>at 187. And we used broad language in our syllabus: \u201cPursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), a court of appeals has jurisdiction to grant the state leave to appeal from a decision of the trial court on the admissibility of evidence, notwithstanding the acquittal of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 48} The decisions in <em>Keeton, Arnett, </em>and <em>Bistricky </em>have caused some confusion. <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Bistricky </em>involved appeals under the \u201cany other decision\u201d clause of R.C. 2945.67(A), i.e., the state had no absolute right to pursue an immediate interlocutory appeal, but had to seek leave from the appellate court. <em>Arnett </em>did not make clear which clause of R.C. 2945.67(A) was being applied. Bistricky\u2019s discussion of \u201csubstantive\u201d versus \u201cevidentiary\u201d rulings and <em>Arnett\u2019s </em>lack of clarity made it possible for the state to argue here that this court has granted the state a right to seek a discretionary appeal even in cases involving the first clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). That is not correct. Only the legislature\u2014 not a court \u2014 can imbue a party with a right to appeal, discretionary or otherwise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The state\u2019s reference to its \u201cright to file an appeal pursuant to <em>Bistricky\u201d </em>is mistaken, as is its discussion of waiver. Whatever right to an appeal the state may have is limited to what is granted in the statute. Here, that right is found in the first clause of R.C. 2945.67(A). The second clause of the statute grants a discretionary appeal for any \u201cother\u201d decisions. Both clauses cannot apply to the same decision. Thus, the state in this ease is limited to an immediate interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZW\">Timothy J. McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Daniel T.

To hold otherwise would render meaningless the importance of procedural compliance when invoking the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 51} In juvenile cases, the state is not authorized to pursue a discretionary appeal when it fails to take an appeal as of right in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure. For that reason, the Eighth District Court of Appeals properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the merits of the state\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, the court of appeals\u2019 judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b619-11\">Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b619-12\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent and would dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\">. Evid.R. 807(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">An out-of-court statement made by a child who is under twelve years of age at the time of trial or hearing describing any sexual act performed by, with, or on the child or describing any act of physical violence directed against the child is not excluded as hearsay under Evid.R. 802 if all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">(1) The court finds that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that make the statement at least as reliable as statements admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 803 and 804. The circumstances must establish that the child was particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made and that the test of cross-examination would add little to the reliability of the statement. In making its determination of the reliability of the statement, the court shall consider all of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, including but not limited to spontaneity, the internal consistency of the statement, the mental state of the child, the child\u2019s motive or lack of motive to fabricate, the child\u2019s use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, the means by which the statement was elicited, and the lapse of time between the act and the statement. In making this determination, the court shall not consider whether there is independent proof of the sexual act or act of physical violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">(2) The child\u2019s testimony is not reasonably obtainable by the proponent of the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-13\">(3) <em>There </em>is independent proof of the sexual act or act of physical violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-14\">(4) At least ten days before the trial or hearing, a proponent of the statement has notified all other parties in writing of the content of the statement, the time and place at which the statement was made, the identity of the witness who is to testify about the statement, and the circumstances surrounding the statement that are claimed to indicate its trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-10\">.
