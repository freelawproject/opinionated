Judge Huffman disclaims any bias against Leet and further explains that her comments at the initial sentencing hearing were made after the jury found Leet guilty and while she was considering the seriousness of his conduct and the likelihood of recidivism, as required by R.C. 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Huffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">{\u00b6 5} First, Leet has failed to substantiate his claim that Judge Huffman treated his witnesses differently from the way she treated the state\u2019s witnesses. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence and argument demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). Here, Leet has not identified these alleged witnesses or explained how Judge Huffman treated them differently. Vague or unsubstantiated allegations \u2014 such as those here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988). <em>See also In re Disqualification of Mitrovich, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-7358, 803 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAn affidavit must describe with specificity and particularity those facts alleged to support the claim of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Second, Judge Huffman\u2019s sentencing comments do not demonstrate a bias or prejudice mandating disqualification. Because a sentencing judge must ordinarily explain the reasons for imposing a sentence, judicial comments during sentencing, even if disapproving, critical, or heavy-handed, do not typically give rise to a cognizable basis for disqualification. <em>See </em>Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>Section 16.4, 450-463 (2d Ed.2007). As other courts have explained, \" \u2018[i]t is the court\u2019s prerogative, if not its duty, to assess the defendant\u2019s character and crimes at sentencing, after * * * guilt has been decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connecticut v. Rizzo, </em>303 Conn. 71, 128-129, 31 A.3d 1094 (2011), quoting <em>United States v. Pearson, </em>203 F.3d 1243, 1278 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1268, 120 S.Ct. 2734, 147 L.Ed.2d 995 (2000). \u201cFurthermore, \u2018[t]o a considerable extent a sentencing judge is the embodiment of public condemnation and * * * [a]s the community\u2019s spokesperson * * * can lecture a defendant as a lesson to that defendant and as a deterrent to others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v. Bakker, </em>925 F.2d 728, 740 (4th Cir.1991). As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">The judge who presides at trial may, upon completion of the evidence, be exceedingly ill disposed towards the defendant, who has been shown to be a thoroughly reprehensible person. But the judge is not thereby recusable for bias or prejudice, since his knowledge and opinion it produced were properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings, and are indeed sometimes (as in a bench trial) necessary to completion of the judge\u2019s task.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\"><em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 550-551, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Accordingly, a trial judge\u2019s harsh comments to a defendant during sentencing will not ordinarily lead to disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">{\u00b6 7} On the other hand, there are circumstances in which a judge\u2019s disqualification is necessary to avoid an appearance of impropriety. <em>See In re Disqualification of Winkler, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1271, 2013-Ohio-890, \u2014 N.E.2d \u2014, \u00b6 11-14 (appearance of impropriety created by judge\u2019s sentencing comments). Leet has not established that Judge Huffman\u2019s comments create an appearance of partiality. During the initial sentencing hearing, Judge Huffman stated that Leet\u2019s conduct was \u201cracially motivated\u201d and that Leet has \u201cdisdain for people who have a skin color different\u201d from his. She also commented on Leet\u2019s lack of remorse, saying \u201cYou absolutely take no responsibility for your behavior\u201d and \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t seem to care about any human life but your own.\u201d Judge Huffman explains that she made these comments based on testimony she heard during the trial, after the jury found Leet guilty, and in consideration of the seriousness and recidivism factors listed in R.C. 2929.12. <em>See also </em>R.C. 2929.12(B)(8) (sentencing court shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>consider whether offender was motivated by prejudice based on race) and 2929.12(D)(5) (sentencing court shall consider whether offender shows genuine remorse for offense). Judge Huffman also avers that she understands that Leet is \u201centitled to a new trial and that he is clothed in the presumption of innocence.\u201d Based on this record, no reasonable and well-informed observer would harbor serious doubts about Judge Huffman\u2019s impartiality or question her ability to put aside her previous opinions and preside fairly over the new trial. <em>See In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">{\u00b6 8} In conclusion, \u201c[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Leet\u2019s speculation about Judge Huffman\u2019s prejudice is insufficient to overcome these presumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Huffman.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
