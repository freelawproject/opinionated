Ertle Jr., counsel for the mother of the proposed ward in the underlying case, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Thomas J. Carnes from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 2012 GD 0059, a guardianship action in the Probate Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Portage County.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">{\u00b6 2} Ertle alleges that Judge Carnes has demonstrated a strong personal bias against him and his client, Orna Lee Brawley, because of \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d of sexual abuse by Brawley\u2019s husband against their daughter, the proposed ward. As evidence of the judge\u2019s bias, Ertle points to the judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss the Ohio guardianship case, despite Brawley\u2019s prior guardianship proceeding in Texas, and the judge\u2019s alleged prejudicial comments made throughout the underlying proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Carnes has responded in writing to the allegations in Ertle\u2019s affidavit, offering a detailed account of his handling of the litigation. Judge Carnes denies any bias or prejudice against Ertle or Brawley and states that his decisions were based on the law and facts of the case and were made in his capacity as the superior guardian of the proposed ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Carnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">{\u00b6 5} First, the gravamen of Ertle\u2019s affidavit appears to be his dissatisfaction with Judge Carnes\u2019s refusal to dismiss the Ohio guardianship case. An affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>of disqualification, however, \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. Indeed, it is well settled that a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. Accordingly, Ertle\u2019s disagreement with Judge Carnes\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction over the Ohio guardianship case is not grounds for disqualification. The remedy for this and other legal claims lies on appeal, which Ertle has already filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 6} Second, most of Ertle\u2019s allegations are based on speculation, which is insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Ertle has not set forth any compelling evidence here. For example, he can only speculate that Judge Carnes requested him to read the guardian ad litem\u2019s report so that Ertle \u201cwould be repulsed and would stop advocating for [his] client.\u201d Similarly, Ertle \u201cbelieves\u201d that Judge Carnes took the mother\u2019s filing of a prohibition action against him as a \u201cpersonal affront and an insult,\u201d which led to him \u201cretaliating\u201d against Ertle and Brawley. In his response, however, Judge Carnes states that he provided the guardian ad litem\u2019s report to make sure that all parties had the documents provided to him by the Texas court, and he flatly denies being insulted by the pending writ case or retaliating against Ertle. On this record, Ertle\u2019s speculative allegations \u2014 especially in the face of the clear denials by Judge Carnes \u2014 are insufficient to overcome the presumption that Judge Carnes is fair and impartial. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation * * * are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 8 (\u201cIn the wake of the conflicting stories presented by the various affiants, however, I cannot conclude that the judge is clearly biased and prejudiced * * *\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 7} Finally, Ertle failed to substantiate his allegations that Judge Carnes made prejudicial comments. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). \u201cGenerally, an affiant is required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations contained therein.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2012-Ohio-6341, 985 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 6. Here, Ertle claims that Judge Carnes \u201crepeatedly made derogatory statements on the record\u201d and \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated his desire to protect the proposed ward, irrespective of the prior proceedings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>Texas. Further, Ertle claims that at the February 20 hearing, Judge Carnes did not give him an opportunity to be heard and also told Ertle to \u201cstop being such a lawyer and do the right thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 8} While Judge Carnes\u2019s response states that Ertle\u2019s affidavit includes \u201cmisstatements of facts and law,\u201d Judge Carnes has not specifically denied making any of these alleged comments. If the comments were made, they were unnecessary and ill-advised. The Code of Judicial Conduct directs that judges should be \u201cpatient, dignified, and courteous\u201d to litigants, lawyers, and others in an official capacity and should refrain from using words or conduct that might manifest bias or prejudice. Jud.Cond.R. 2.8(B) and 2.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 9} However, Ertle did not submit a transcript or other evidence to substantiate any of these alleged \u201con the record\u201d statements. Because he failed to submit a transcript, there is no way to determine whether the comments were made, the specific word choice and context in which they were allegedly made, or whether the comments reflect judicial bias or prejudice against Ertle or Brawley. \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy * * <em>In re Disqualification of Hunter, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 607, 608, 522 N.E.2d 461 (1988). Because Ertle has not submitted any evidentiary support, he has not established that he is entitled to such a remedy. His averments alone are insufficient to convey a conviction that Judge Carnes has developed a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u201d or reached a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d that will prevent him from presiding over the remaining issues in the case with an \u201copen state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Carnes.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
