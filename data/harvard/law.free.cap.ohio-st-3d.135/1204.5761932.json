Lawson has filed two affidavits with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Alison L. Floyd from acting on any further proceedings in case Nos. AD10915427 and CU03109953 in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County. Lawson also requests a \u201cstanding order\u201d that disqualifies Judge Floyd from any matter in which Lawson represents a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">{\u00b6 2} Lawson and Judge Floyd were opponents in the March 2012 primary election for Judge Floyd\u2019s juvenile court seat. Because of the \u201ccontentious nature of the campaign,\u201d Lawson claims that Judge Floyd\u2019s impartiality \u201cmight reasonably be questioned\u201d in the two underlying cases, as well as all future cases involving Lawson as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Floyd has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavits, stating that she \u201ctakes seriously her solemn obligation to perform her judicial duties impartially\u201d and \u201charbors no hostile feelings against affiant [or] his clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">{\u00b6 4} Joseph J. Triscaro, opposing counsel to Lawson in case No. CU03109953, has also filed an affidavit and memorandum. Triscaro asserts that Judge Floyd has presided over the matter for eight years and that it would be \u201cextremely prejudicial\u201d to his client if Judge Floyd were now disqualified after such a lengthy and complex proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">{\u00b6 5} For the following reasons, no basis has been established for ordering disqualification of Judge Floyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number><em>In re J.K., </em>case No. AD10915427</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 6} It is well established that \u201ca judge ordinarily will not be disqualified based solely on the fact that a lawyer in a pending case is or has been the judge\u2019s election opponent.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Maschari, 88 </em>Ohio St.3d 1212, 1213, 723 N.E.2d 1101 (1999), citing <em>In re Disqualification of Burnside, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1240, 657 N.E.2d 1346 (1992). <em>See also In re Disqualification of Krueger, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1267, 1268, 657 N.E.2d 1365 (1995) (\u201cAffiant has failed to demonstrate the existence of bias or prejudice based on the fact that she and Judge Krueger were opponents in the previous election\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Osowik, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2006-Ohio-7224, 884 N.E.2d 1089, \u00b6 6 (\u201cThe fact that the defendant may have opposed the judge\u2019s bid for elected office is insufficient to warrant disqualification, absent some evidence of actual bias\u201d). This court has also held, however, that disqualification may be warranted where a \u201ccombination of factors\u201d creates an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>Maschari </em>at 1213. For example, in <em>Maschari, </em>the affiant was not only the judge\u2019s previous election opponent, but the affiant would likely be a witness in any disciplinary proceeding against the judge. <em>Id. </em>Under this unique \u201ccombination of factors,\u201d an appearance of impropriety existed, which mandated disqualification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">{\u00b6 7} Lawson relies on the <em>Maschari </em>decision to support disqualification, but he has failed to demonstrate that a similar unique combination of factors exists here. In the underlying case, Lawson represents the mother in a child-custody proceeding. Lawson alleges that Judge Floyd\u2019s ability to remain impartial may be \u201creasonably questioned\u201d based on the following: (1) Judge Floyd denied Lawson\u2019s motion for recusal, which is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with recusal decisions in two other cases involving Lawson, (2) Judge Floyd\u2019s supporters during the campaign \u201cattempted to intimidate\u201d Lawson\u2019s supporters, including a \u201ckey member\u201d of Lawson\u2019s campaign committee, (3) Judge Floyd received \u201cnegative publicity\u201d during the campaign, including several articles in the Cleveland Plain Dealer endorsing Lawson over Judge Floyd, and (4) the election was \u201chotly contested,\u201d with Lawson making \u201chighly critical\u201d public comments about Judge Floyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 8} Only the first allegation suggests that Judge Floyd\u2019s own actions convey a personal bias against Lawson, i.e., Judge Floyd\u2019s allegedly \u201cinconsistent\u201d recusal orders. However, it has long been held that a judge\u2019s voluntary removal from an earlier case does not by itself support disqualification from another unrelated case involving that same party. <em>In re Disqualification of Martin, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1221, 657 N.E.2d 1334 (1990). Moreover, Judge Floyd has thoroughly explained her decisions to step aside in the two unrelated cases involving Lawson. In the first case, Judge Floyd recused herself because one of the parties sought sanctions against Lawson during the election campaign. In the second case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Judge Floyd recused herself because the best interests of the child necessitated that the juvenile-court case continue without interruption by a lengthy disqualification proceeding. Lawson has failed to demonstrate that the same disqualifying interests present in those cases are present in the underlying case here, and therefore he has failed to demonstrate any inconsistency in Judge Floyd\u2019s decisions. In an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence and argument demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) (requiring affiant to include specific allegations of bias, prejudice, or disqualifying interest and the facts to support those allegations). Lawson has not met that burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 9} Similarly, Lawson has failed to substantiate his claim that Judge Floyd\u2019s supporters intimidated a key member of his campaign. As an initial matter, this allegation is not directed against Judge Floyd\u2019s conduct, but that of her supporters. Further, Lawson failed to set forth evidence to support his allegation, which is generally required in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Crow, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 1209, 741 N.E.2d 137 (2000) (denying affidavit where affiants failed to provide supporting affidavits from participants in alleged improper conversations). Lawson has not included a third-party affidavit from this \u201ckey member\u201d of his campaign to substantiate the claim. Vague or unsubstantiated allegations, such as those alleged here, are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 10} The only remaining allegations are Lawson\u2019s claims that he was \u201chighly critical\u201d of Judge Floyd during the campaign and that Judge Floyd received \u201cnegative publicity.\u201d Lawson speculates that because of these facts, Judge Floyd will not remain impartial to him in future proceedings. Such speculation, however, cannot demonstrate bias or an appearance of bias. <em>See, e.g., Burnside, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 1241, 657 N.E.2d 1346 (denying affidavit of judge\u2019s election opponent where he \u201cspeculates that the judge may demonstrate bias and prejudice against him, but offers no specific evidence or occurrence of events in support of this claim\u201d). Lawson\u2019s allegations here do not suggest that Judge Floyd has done or said anything that reflects bias, prejudice, or partiality on her part.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 11} Finally, in his rebuttal affidavit, Lawson claims that Judge Floyd\u2019s \u201cself-serving statement\u201d that she can remain impartial should not be accepted, and if it is, there is \u201cno point\u201d to these affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings. A judge\u2019s subjective belief as to his or her own impartiality is not the decisive factor in deciding disqualification requests. <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 11. However, the judge\u2019s own assessment is \u201centitled to some weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Judge Floyd expressly states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>that she has no hostile feelings towards Lawson and that she is willing and able to serve impartially. Aside from speculation, Lawson has not set forth any compelling evidence to suggest that the presumption of impartiality afforded to all judges has been overcome. <em>See In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5 (\u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions\u201d). Further, Lawson has failed to demonstrate the existence of a unique \u201ccombination of factors\u201d \u2014 which were present in the <em>Maschari </em>case- \u2014 warranting disqualification based on an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">{\u00b6 12} On the record here, it cannot be said that a \u201creasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>at \u00b6 8. Lawson\u2019s affidavit in case No. AD10915427 is, therefore, not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>In re D.C.J., </em>case No. CU03109953</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>In re D.C.J., </em>case No. CU03109953, Lawson represents the maternal grandparents of the minor child in a custody case against the child\u2019s father. After a seven-day trial, Judge Floyd issued an order in December 2011 designating the father as the legal custodian. Lawson subsequently filed an appeal, which remains pending in the Eighth District Court of Appeals. On April 16, 2012, the father filed a motion in the juvenile court to modify the temporary custody arrangement during pendency of the appeal. Lawson opposed the motion and filed a motion for recusal. On May 30, 2012, Judge Floyd ordered that the father\u2019s motion be held in abeyance and granted the father leave to request a limited remand from the Eighth District so that Judge Floyd could decide the father\u2019s motions. On June 6, 2012, the appeals court denied the father\u2019s request for a limited remand. Judge Floyd has not ruled on Lawson\u2019s motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">{\u00b6 14} To support disqualification, Lawson sets forth the same allegations against Judge Floyd as he set forth in the case discussed above. For the reasons explained in the preceding section, those allegations are insufficient to warrant disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 15} In addition, Lawson claims that Judge Floyd\u2019s May 30, 2012 order in this case and Judge Floyd\u2019s refusal to rule on Lawson\u2019s motion for recusal demonstrate her alleged prejudice against Lawson. An affidavit of disqualification, however, \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. Indeed, it is well settled that a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. Accordingly, Lawson\u2019s dissatisfaction with Judge Floyd\u2019s May 30, 2012 order does not demonstrate prejudice. Like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>wise, Judge Floyd\u2019s refusal to rule on Lawson\u2019s motion for recusal is not grounds for disqualification. <em>See In re Disqualification of Eyster, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1246, 2004-Ohio-7350, 826 N.E.2d 304, \u00b6 4 (a judge\u2019s action \u2014 or inaction \u2014 on a motion is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion and is not evidence of bias or prejudice). Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that Judge Floyd\u2019s refusal to rule on Lawson\u2019s motion is the result of prejudice. In fact, Judge Floyd claims that because of Lawson\u2019s appeal to the Eighth District \u2014 and that court\u2019s denial of the father\u2019s request for a limited remand \u2014 she is divested of jurisdiction to rule on the pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 16} Judge Floyd has presided over this case for eight years, and it has long been held that absent extraordinary circumstances, a judge will not be disqualified after having presided over lengthy proceedings in a pending case. <em>In re Disqualification of Light, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 604, 522 N.E.2d 458 (1988). No extraordinary circumstances are present here, as Lawson points to no action on the part of Judge Floyd that would demonstrate bias, prejudice, or a disqualifying interest. As in the case discussed above, on this record, no \u201creasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b68. Lawson\u2019s affidavit in case No. CU03109953 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 17} For the reasons stated herein, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. Lawson\u2019s request for a standing order is also denied. The cases may proceed before Judge Floyd.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
