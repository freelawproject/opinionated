McQueen, an indigent ward subject to a guardianship, from a judgment entered by the court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>denying his request for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Probate Division, to appoint counsel at court expense for him in a hearing to review the continued necessity of the guardianship. Because McQueen established his entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 2} In May 2010, the probate court granted the application of Karyn Seeger of Adult Guardianship Services to be appointed the guardian of McQueen and placed McQueen in a secured nursing facility. The probate court in effect found that McQueen was incompetent because prior to his hospitalization and placement in the nursing home, he was \u201chomeless * * * [and] without medication to control his diagnosed diabetes and schizophrenia, and was not compliant with his mental health case manager.\u201d The probate court had determined that McQueen was indigent and unable to retain counsel and sua sponte appointed an attorney to represent McQueen at the hearing on Seeger\u2019s application to be appointed as his guardian. The probate court later granted McQueen\u2019s appointed counsel\u2019s application for attorney fees in connection with his representation of McQueen for the hearing on the appointment of a guardian for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 3} In September 2011, after more than 120 days had elapsed since the probate court\u2019s appointment of the guardian for McQueen, he submitted a written request to the probate court for a review of the guardianship. McQueen believed that he no longer needed a guardian and that he was being medicated against his will. He requested that the case be set for a review hearing and that counsel be appointed for him. A guardianship-review hearing was originally scheduled in the probate court for December 5, 2011, but the court did not appoint counsel to represent McQueen for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 4} The probate court rescheduled the review hearing for January 30, 2012, and McQueen filed a motion for the appointment of counsel at court expense, an independent expert evaluation, and a continuance of the review hearing. The probate court denied McQueen\u2019s motion for a continuance, noted that it had already ordered a medical evaluation of him, and stated that all other matters raised by him \u2014 the request to appoint counsel- \u2014 would be considered at the review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 5} McQueen then filed a complaint in the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus to compel the probate court to appoint counsel for him at the court\u2019s expense pursuant to R.C. 2111.49(C) and 2111.02(C)(7) for the guardianship-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>review hearing. After the parties submitted motions for summary judgment, the court of appeals granted the probate court\u2019s motion and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before the court upon McQueen\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>Mandamus: Clear Legal Right and Clear Legal Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 7} To be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, McQueen had to establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a clear legal duty on the part of the probate court to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Waters v. Spaeth, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-69, 960 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 8} For the first two requirements, McQueen claims that he has established a clear legal right to the appointment of counsel at state expense for the guardianship-review hearing and a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the probate court to appoint counsel at state expense for the hearing based on R.C. 2111.49(C) and 2111.02(C)(7)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[U]nlike criminal litigation, there is no general right of counsel in civil litigation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burnes v. Athens Cty. Clerk of Courts, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 523, 524, 700 N.E.2d 1260 (1998). Nevertheless, we have recognized the right of indigent persons to appointed counsel at state expense when a statute provides it. <em>State ex rel. Asberry v. Payne, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 44, 693 N.E.2d 794 (1998) (right to appointment of counsel for persons in loco parentis to child in juvenile court custody proceeding under the applicable former version of R.C. 2151.352).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">{\u00b6 10} The General Assembly has empowered probate courts to appoint a guardian of an incompetent person. R.C. 2111.02(A). R.C. 2111.02(C) specifies that \u201c[p]rior to the appointment of a guardian * * *, the court shall conduct a hearing on the matter of the appointment\u201d and that \u201c[t]he hearing shall be conducted in accordance with all of the following\u201d requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">(1) The proposed guardian or limited guardian shall appear at the hearing and, if appointed, shall swear under oath that the proposed guardian or limited guardian has made and will continue to make diligent efforts to file a true inventory in accordance with section 2111.14 of the Revised Code and find and report all assets belonging to the estate of the ward and that the proposed guardian or limited guardian faithfully and completely will fulfill the other duties of guardian, including the filing of timely and accurate reports and accountings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">(2) If the hearing is conducted by a magistrate, the procedures set forth in Civil Rule 53 shall be followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>(3) If the hearing concerns the appointment of a guardian or limited guardian for an alleged incompetent, the burden of proving incompetency shall be by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">(4) Upon request of the applicant, the alleged incompetent for whom the appointment is sought or the alleged incompetent\u2019s counsel, or any interested party, a recording or record of the hearing shall be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">(5) Evidence of a less restrictive alternative to guardianship may be introduced, and when introduced, shall be considered by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">(6) The court may deny a guardianship based upon a finding that a less restrictive alternative to guardianship exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">(7) If the hearing concerns the appointment of a guardian or limited guardian for an alleged incompetent, the alleged incompetent has all of the following rights:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(a) The right to be represented by independent counsel of the alleged incompetent\u2019s choice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">(b) The right to have a friend or family member of the alleged incompetent\u2019s choice present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">(c) The right to have evidence of an independent expert evaluation introduced;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">\n<em>(d) If the alleged incompetent is indigent, upon the alleged incompetent\u2019s request:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-13\"><em>(i) The right to have counsel </em>and an independent expert evaluator <em>appointed at court expense;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-14\">\n<em>(ii) If the guardianship, limited guardianship, or standby guardianship decision is appealed, the right to have counsel appointed and necessary transcripts for appeal prepared at court expense.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2111.49, in turn, governs review hearings for existing guardianships and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-17\">(C) Except as provided in this division, for any guardianship, upon written request by the ward, the ward\u2019s attorney, or any other interested party made at any time after the expiration of one hundred twenty days from the date of the original appointment of the guardian, <em>a hearing shall be held in accordance with section 2111.02 of the Revised Code to evaluate the continued necessity of the guardianship.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cVenerable principles of statutory construction require that in construing statutes, we must give effect to every word and clause in the statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Carna v. Teays Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 478, 2012-Ohio-1484, 967 N.E.2d 193, \u00b6 18. \u201cTo discern legislative intent, we \u2018read words and phrases in context and construe them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Barley v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 505, 2012-Ohio-3329, 974 N.E.2d 1183, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 13} With these principles guiding our analysis, we now consider the mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 14} McQueen submitted a written request for a guardianship-review hearing after the expiration of 120 days from the date the probate court had originally appointed a guardian. Pursuant to R.C. 2111.49(C), the probate court was then required to hold a hearing \u201cin accordance with\u201d R.C. 2111.02. The word \u201caccordance\u201d means \u201cagreement, accord.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>12 (2002). Therefore, the hearing requirements specified in R.C. 2111.02 for hearings to initially determine whether to appoint a guardian for an alleged incompetent person are explicitly incorporated in the R.C. 2111.49(C) requirements for hearings on the necessity of continuing a guardianship. The R.C. 2111.49(C) guardianship-review hearing must be conducted in agreement and accord with the R.C. 2111.02 hearing requirements. One of these requirements is set forth in R.C. 2111.02(C)(7)(d)(i), which confers a right on the incompetent person to have counsel appointed at court expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals held otherwise because it concluded that the pertinent statutes were unclear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">In the present case, the lack of controlling authority, the reiteration of the burden of proof in both statutes, and the limiting language in subsection 7 of \u201cif the hearing concerns the appointment of the guardian\u201d and \u201cthe alleged incompetent\u201d create doubt as to whether the General Assembly intended subsection 7 to be incorporated into the hearing on the necessity of continuing a guardianship. The relator has not established the <em>clear </em>legal right and the <em>clear </em>legal duty enforceable in mandamus. Accordingly, this court declines to issue the writ of mandamus and dissolves the alternative writ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>(Emphasis sic.) 2012-Ohio-1839, 2012 WL 1454692, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 16} The court of appeals erred in so holding. Although it is true that we cannot create the legal duty enforceable in a mandamus case, <em>State ex rel. Baroni v. Colletti, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 208, 2011-Ohio-5351, 957 N.E.2d 13, \u00b6 22, it is equally true that \u201ccourts in mandamus actions have a duty to construe constitutions, charters, and statutes, if necessary, and thereafter evaluate whether the relator has established the required clear legal right and clear legal duty,\u201d and in doing so, the courts have a \u201cduty to resolve all doubts concerning the legal interpretation of these provisions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fattlar v. Boyle, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 123, 125, 698 N.E.2d 987 (1998); <em>see also State ex rel. Melvin v. Sweeney, </em>154 Ohio St. 223, 225-226, 94 N.E.2d 785 (1950). By not resolving any doubt it found in the pertinent statutes in this mandamus proceeding, the court of appeals abdicated its duty to do so. <em>Fattlar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 17} Moreover, there is no doubt in the provisions. R.C. 2111.49(C) expressly incorporates the hearing requirements relating to original appointments of guardians to proceedings concerning the continued necessity of guardianships. These requirements include the right of indigent wards to appointed counsel at court expense. Adopting the court of appeals\u2019 construction would make the R.C. 2111.49(C) directive that the guardianship-review hearing \u201cshall be held in accordance with section 2111.02 of the Revised Code\u201d meaningless. We must avoid this unreasonable construction by applying the plain language of these provisions. <em>Carna, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 478, 2012-Ohio-1484, 967 N.E.2d 193, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Spencer Twp. Rural School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>95 Ohio St. 367, 373, 116 N.E. 516 (1917) (\u201c \u2018No part [of the statute] should be treated as superfluous unless that is manifestly required, and the court should avoid that construction which renders a provision meaningless or inoperative\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 18} In addition, as McQueen\u2019s evidence submitted in the court of appeals established, this construction is consistent with the practice of probate courts from Fi-anklin, Summit, Medina, and Logan Counties. And amici curiae claim that other states with statutes similar to the ones at issue here recognize the right to appointed counsel in guardianship-review hearings. In fact, because the court of appeals determined that the issue was susceptible of different interpretations, it limited the reach of its holding by stating that it did not \u201cpreclude other courts from appointing counsel for indigent wards in review hearings, if the court concludes that such an appointment is necessary, appropriate, or required.\u201d 2012-Ohio-1839, 2012 WL 1454692, \u00b6 13. Again, the court erred in failing to resolve any doubt it perceived in the statutes and in further finding that any doubt existed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Disability Rights Ohio, John R.

Mandamus is thus an appropriate remedy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, McQueen established his entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.
