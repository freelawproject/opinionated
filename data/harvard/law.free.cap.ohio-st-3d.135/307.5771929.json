The driver was injured in 2005 in a traffic accident for which he was cited. This was his third moving violation in one year, and as a result, he was dropped from his employer\u2019s liability insurance policy. Without insurance coverage, he could no longer work as a truck driver, and the employer fired him.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">{\u00b6 2} In 2006, the Industrial Commission initially concluded that he was not eligible for temporary-total-disability compensation, because his discharge was a voluntary abandonment of employment. A year later, a staff hearing officer concluded that his discharge was not voluntary abandonment under the recently decided <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162 (the voluntary-abandonment doctrine as applied to an employee who had been fired for the conduct that resulted in his industrial injury), and approved a subsequent request for temporary-total-disability compensation based on additionally allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">{\u00b6 3} The commission exercised continuing jurisdiction and concluded that the staff hearing officer had made a clear mistake of law by not considering the commission\u2019s initial finding of voluntary abandonment as res judicata as to the second request. The commission also determined that the staff hearing officer had misapplied <em>Gross </em>because the injured worker\u2019s discharge was due to his lack of insurance, not his industrial injury. Thus, according to the commission, he had voluntarily abandoned his employment and was not eligible to receive temporary-total-disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals concluded that the commission had abused its discretion, and it issued a writ of mandamus that ordered the commission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>award benefits or reconsider the denial of benefits from the date of the injury, in accordance with <em>Gross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 5} For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals granting the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 6} The claimant-appellee, George H. Haddox, was a truck driver for Forest City Technologies, Inc. On December 20, 2005, he was injured in a motor vehicle accident within the course and scope of his employment. His workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for \u201csprain lumbar region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 7} This was Haddox\u2019s third accident in the calendar year 2005. As a result, his employer\u2019s liability insurance would no longer cover him. Forest City terminated his employment in January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">A. First Application for Temporary-Total-Disability Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">{\u00b6 8} Haddox filed a request for temporary-total-disability compensation to begin on the date he was injured, December 20, 2005. A staff hearing officer denied the request. The hearing officer concluded that Haddox\u2019s discharge constituted a voluntary abandonment of employment because Haddox had violated a company policy that required termination of employment for a third traffic violation. The commission refused to hear Haddox\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">B. Additionally Allowed Conditions and the Second Application for Temporary-Total-Disability Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">{\u00b6 9} The commission later approved Haddox\u2019s claim for two additional conditions of substantial aggravation of lumbar spondylolisthesis and spondylosis. Haddox filed a second request for temporary-total-disability compensation beginning September 4, 2007, based on the additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">{\u00b6 10} A district hearing officer denied the request, finding that Haddox\u2019s discharge was related to his inability to perform his duties as a truck driver for the company, not due to his injuries. A staff hearing officer reversed, relying on the statement in <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162, \u00b6 19, that the voluntary-abandonment doctrine \u201c \u2018has never been applied to preinjury conduct or conduct contemporaneous with the injury.\u2019 \u201d The staff hearing officer awarded compensation because Haddox\u2019s discharge was causally related to acts that occurred contemporaneously with or before his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">{\u00b6 11} The commission refused further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>C. Third Application for Temporary-Total-Disability Dating Back to Original Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 12} Haddox filed a third request for benefits for temporary total disability, asking for compensation dating back to his initial injury, based on the order approving his second application. A district hearing officer concluded that the commission had previously adjudicated the issue of voluntary abandonment for the original claim and that it was res judicata. The hearing officer rejected Haddox\u2019s argument that the previous orders could be vacated on the basis of <em>Gross. </em>A staff hearing officer agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 13} On March 6, 2008, the commission refused Haddox\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">D. Employer\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of the Order Awarding Temporary-Total-Disability Compensation for Additional Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 14} The employer asked the commission to invoke its continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52 and reconsider the award of temporary-total-disability compensation based on the additional conditions (Haddox\u2019s second application). According to the employer, the order was based on a clear mistake of law because the finding of voluntary abandonment in the initial denial of compensation was res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 15} On March 7, 2008 (the day after the commission had refused Haddox\u2019s appeal from the denial of his second application), the commission entered an interlocutory order and set the matter for further hearing to evaluate whether the staff hearing officer had made a mistake of law that would warrant the commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction over the issue of Haddox\u2019s voluntary abandonment as res judicata and to consider the application of <em>Gross </em>on his eligibility for temporary-total-disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 16} On June 2, 2008, the commission determined that the staff hearing officer had made a clear error of law by not relying on res judicata to deny the compensation requested in his second application. The commission granted reconsideration to correct the error and denied Haddox\u2019s current request based on the additional conditions. In the alternative, the commission determined that even if res judicata did not apply, Haddox had voluntarily abandoned his employment. According to the commission, a representative of the employer had testified that Haddox was terminated because he could no longer be insured as a truck driver on the employer\u2019s group liability policy due to his three moving violations. The commission noted that although the allowed injury occurred simultaneously with the third moving violation, Haddox\u2019s loss of earnings was caused by the lack of insurance, not his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"Acl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>E. Haddox\u2019s Mandamus Action</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">{\u00b6 17} Haddox filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus asking the Court of Appeals for Franklin County to require the commission to order temporary-total-disability compensation beginning on the date of his initial injury. Haddox alleged that according to <em>Gross, </em>he was entitled to compensation because the loss of his job was related to his injury, so his departure from employment was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 18} The court of appeals concluded that res judicata did not apply and that the commission had abused its discretion when it vacated the award for the additional conditions. Because the moving violations that resulted in Haddox\u2019s inability to be insured had occurred prior to and contemporaneously with his injury, the court held that his discharge could not be considered a voluntary abandonment making him ineligible for temporary-total-disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 19} Applying <em>Gross </em>to the facts of this case, the appellate court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate the denials of temporary-total-disability compensation that were based on abandonment of employment, to reinstate one award of compensation, and to redetermine the remaining motions for compensation on the medical evidence. 2011-Ohio-3923, 2011 WL 3451706, \u00b6 9,12-13,16.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 20} The commission\u2019s appeal as of right is now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 21} We must determine whether the commission abused its discretion when it exercised continuing jurisdiction for the purpose of correcting what it considered a clear mistake of law. Our review addresses the follow issues: Was the commission\u2019s initial finding of voluntary abandonment res judicata for all future applications for temporary-total-disability compensation, or did <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm. </em>apply? Did the commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction (over the order deciding the second request for benefits for temporary total disability) extend to modify the initial order denying compensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">A. Temporary Total Disability and Voluntary Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 22} The purpose of temporary-total-disability compensation is to compensate an injured employee for lost earnings during the period of disability while the injury heals. <em>State ex rel. McCoy v. Dedicated Transport, Inc., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 25, 2002-Ohio-5305, 776 N.E.2d 51, \u00b6 35; <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm., </em>34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533 (1987). To qualify for temporary-total-disability compensation, an injured worker must demonstrate that he or she is medically unable to return to the former position and that the industrial injury is the reason for the loss of earnings. <em>State ex rel. McCoy </em>at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>{\u00b6 23} When the employee no longer has a loss of earnings, temporary-total-disability benefits terminate. This occurs when the employee returns to work or is capable of returning to work. Benefits for temporary total disability also terminate when the injury has reached maximum medical improvement. R.C. 4123.56. Benefits may also terminate if the employee voluntarily leaves the workforce. <em>Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm., </em>40 Ohio St.3d 44, 46, 531 N.E.2d 678 (1988). (After termination of benefits for temporary total disability, a claimant remains entitled to payments for medical expenses and may be eligible for compensation for any permanent disability. R.C. 4123.57 and 4123.66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 24} When an employee is fired for misconduct, the dismissal may be deemed a voluntary abandonment of employment \u201cwhen it arises from the employee\u2019s decision to engage in conduct that he or she knows will result in termination.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Hoover Universal, Inc., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 520, 2012-Ohio-3895, 974 N.E.2d 1198, \u00b6 11; <em>State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm., </em>72 Ohio St.3d 401, 403, 650 N.E.2d 469 (1995). The commission must look to the underlying facts and circumstances of the discharge, including its timing and nature, when classifying the employee\u2019s departure as voluntary or involuntary. <em>McCoy, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 25, 2002-Ohio-5305, 776 N.E.2d 51, \u00b6 20; <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc., </em>76 Ohio St.3d 408, 411, 667 N.E.2d 1217 (1996). The underlying principle is that the employee\u2019s departure from employment must be causally related to the injury for the employee to be eligible for temporary-total-disability compensation. <em>Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm., </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 46, 531 N.E.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">B. <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 25} Shortly after the commission determined in 2006 that Haddox was ineligible for temporary-total-disability compensation because he had voluntarily abandoned his former position, this court reviewed the voluntary-abandonment doctrine in the context of an employee who had been fired for the very conduct that resulted in his industrial injury. David Gross, an employee at a KFC restaurant, burned himself and two others when he placed water in a pressurized deep fryer, heated the fryer, and then opened the lid. Following an investigation, KFC discharged Gross for violating a workplace safety rule and defying repeated verbal warnings. The commission said this was a voluntary abandonment of his employment and terminated Gross\u2019s temporary-total-disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 26} This court initially upheld the commission\u2019s decision, <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., 112 </em>Ohio St.3d 65, 2006-Ohio-6500, 858 N.E.2d 335 <em>(\u201cGross I </em>\u201d), but later reconsidered and ordered the commission to reinstate benefits. <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162 <em>(\u201cGross </em>II\u201d). In <em>Gross II, </em>the court explained that it had not intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Gross I </em>to create an exception to or an expansion of the voluntary-abandonment doctrine or to inject fault into the no-fault nature of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 27} Upon reconsideration, <em>Gross II </em>reiterated that the underlying issue in a voluntary-abandonment case is \u201cwhether his injury or his termination * * * is the cause of his loss of earnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b623. \u201cThe distinctions between voluntary and involuntary departure are complicated and fact-intensive.\u201d <em>Id. Gross II </em>examined the evidence and concluded that KFC\u2019s termination letter \u2014 in which KFC stated that it was Gross\u2019s rule violation, resulting in the injury that had triggered the investigation and led to his subsequent termination \u2014 established that his discharge was related to the industrial injury. Thus, Gross\u2019s termination was involuntary and did not bar temporary-total-disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 28} This court had the opportunity to apply <em>Gross II </em>in <em>State ex rel. Upton v. Indus. Comm., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-4758, 895 N.E.2d 161. In that case, Upton had been discharged for causing multiple motor vehicle accidents, including the one in which he was injured. The commission denied his request for temporary-total-disability compensation, filed prior to Gross <em>II, </em>because his discharge constituted a voluntary abandonment of his former position. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. In a split decision, the court of appeals concluded that Upton did not have clear notice in advance of the grounds for his termination, so it was an involuntary departure. The court granted a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Upton v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-594, 2007-Ohio-3283, 2007 WL 1861823.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 29} We affirmed, stating: <em>\u201cGross II </em>held that if a claimant is injured by the same misconduct that led to his or her termination, eligibility for temporary total disability compensation is not compromised. <em>Gross II </em>controls and renders the court of appeals reasoning moot.\u201d 119 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-4758, 895 N.E.2d 161, at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals\u2019 application of <em>Gross II </em>in this case comports with <em>Upton. </em>Haddox, a truck driver, had three moving violations and was no longer able to be insured by his employer. The court of appeals held that because the moving violations occurred prior to and contemporaneously with the injury, his termination was not a voluntary abandonment, because \u201c[u]nder the terms of <em>Gross II, </em>[Haddox\u2019s] actions prior to and concurrent with his industrial injury did not form a basis for concluding he voluntarily abandoned his employment, meaning the commission abused its discretion in concluding otherwise.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Haddox, </em>2011-Ohio-3923, 2011 WL 3451706, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">C. Continuing Jurisdiction Grants Broad Authority to the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">{\u00b6 31} In this appeal, the commission argues that the court need not apply <em>Gross II, </em>because the commission\u2019s original decision that Haddox had voluntarily abandoned his employment, decided prior to <em>Gross II, </em>became res judicata for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>future applications for temporary-total-disability compensation arising out of the same incident. But the court of appeals determined that once the commission invoked its continuing jurisdiction, the previous determination was subject to revision, and res judicata no longer applied. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 32} Res judicata may apply in quasi-judicial administrative proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 29. But the defense of res judicata has a limited application in workers\u2019 compensation matters because of the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction in certain circumstances. <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm., </em>58 Ohio St.3d 199, 200, 569 N.E.2d 496 (1991). R.C. 4123.52 grants the commission broad authority when exercising continuing jurisdiction so that the commission may \u201cmake such modification or change\u201d to former findings or orders \u201cas, in its opinion is justified.\u201d Such broad authority permits the commission to address any issues pertaining to the order in question. <em>State ex rel. Wheeler v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-865, 2003-Ohio-3120, 2003 WL 21385609, \u00b6 67-69; <em>State ex rel. Hayes v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-1087, 2002-Ohio-3675, 2002 WL 1578409, \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 33} Although the parties litigated the issue of Haddox\u2019s eligibility for temporary-total-disability benefits to a resolution in 2006, the commission reopened the issue when it exercised continuing jurisdiction to reconsider Haddox\u2019s second application based on a mistake of law. <em>State ex rel. B &amp; C Machine Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>65 Ohio St.3d 538, 541-542, 605 N.E.2d 372 (1992). The commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction permitted it to modify or amend, if necessary, the former order dating back to the injury. <em>State ex rel. Riter v. Indus. Comm., </em>91 Ohio St.3d 89, 90, 742 N.E.2d 615 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 34} Because Haddox was discharged for the same misconduct that caused his industrial injury, the discharge was not tantamount to a voluntary abandonment of employment that precludes temporary-total-disability compensation. <em>State ex rel. Upton, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-4758, 895 N.E.2d 161; <em>Gross II, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162. The commission abused its discretion when it reconsidered the order on the basis of res judicata. Finally, it is within the commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction to modify its initial order denying temporary-total-disability compensation and to award compensation dating back to the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 35} Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b548-5\">O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and French, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b548-6\">O\u2019Connor, C J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Akp\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 36} I concur in the majority\u2019s decision, because I must.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 37} As the majority opinion makes clear, the result in this case is compelled by the court\u2019s prior decision in <em>State ex rel. </em>Gross <em>v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162 <em>(\u201cGross II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 38} I dissented, strongly, from the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Gross II, </em>asserting that this court had wrongly decided to reconsider its prior decision in the case, <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 65, 2006-Ohio-6500, 858 N.E.2d 335 <em>(\u201cGross I </em>\u201d), and wrongly decided to find that the Industrial Commission abused' its discretion in determining that David Gross had voluntarily abandoned his employment by repeatedly disregarding his employer\u2019s clear warnings that his misconduct in the workplace was endangering himself and others. <em>See generally </em>Gross <em>II </em>at \u00b6 29-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 39} Five years later, I remain resolute that <em>Gross II </em>was wrongly decided and that the majority retreated from its holding in <em>Gross I </em>because of public criticism of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 40} But five years later, <em>Gross II </em>remains the law of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">{\u00b6 41} There appears to be no will to overrule <em>Gross II </em>in accordance with our decision in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA prior decision of the Supreme Court may be overruled where (1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it\u201d). I will not ignore precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">{\u00b6 42} As we set forth in our decision in <em>Shay v. Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, \u00b6 26, a justice\u2019s dissenting view is, by its very nature, \u201c \u2018a disagreement with a majority opinion,\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) 506, without force of law or precedential value.\u201d Though that opinion may be strongly held, as mine is here, it must yield to precedent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">[DJeference to an established majority opinion, despite a jurist\u2019s disagreement with the opinion, is part of the court\u2019s rich tradition of adherence to stare decisis.

That understanding is perhaps particularly true in cases driven by statutory interpretation and any legislative response to that interpretation. See <em>Square D Co. v.

In light of the court\u2019s opinion here, there should be no mistake that the remedy for <em>Gross II, </em>if there is to be one, must come from the legislative branch. I urge the General Assembly to act, but until it does, I must follow the law. I thus concur in the majority\u2019s reasoning and judgment in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
