Lawson, have filed affidavits with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Alison L. Floyd from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. CU03109953, now pending for a new trial in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">{\u00b6 2} This is the second affidavit of disqualification that Lawson has filed against Judge Floyd in the underlying custody case. In June 2012, Lawson filed an affidavit requesting Judge Floyd\u2019s removal because they were opponents in a \u201chotly contested\u201d primary election for Judge Floyd\u2019s juvenile court judge seat. Lawson\u2019s affidavit was denied by entry of August 10, 2012. <em>See In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>No. 12-AP-069 (Aug. 10, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">{\u00b6 3} Since that entry, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Appellate District reversed Judge Floyd\u2019s decision designating the father of D.C.J. as the legal custodian of the child and remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>See In re D.C.J., </em>8th Dist. Nos. 97681 and 97776, 2012-Ohio-4154, 976 N.E.2d 931. The appeals court held that Judge Floyd committed numerous errors that deprived the grandparents of their right to a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 53. In addition, the court admonished Judge Floyd for failing to promptly handle the custody proceeding, which was pending for more than three years. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">{\u00b6 4} In their present affidavit, the grandparents claim that Judge Floyd is partial to the father, as evidenced by the appeals court opinion. Lawson similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>claims that the appeals court\u2019s \u201cstunning rebuke\u201d of Judge Floyd\u2019s custody decision, combined with his election history against Judge Floyd, raises doubts about her ability to conduct a new trial with impartiality. Lawson has also filed a sworn rebuttal, in which he claims that Judge Floyd\u2019s recent assignment of a new evaluator is suspect and \u201cgives the appearance of expert shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 5} Judge Floyd has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavits. Judge Floyd asserts that she does not harbor any hostile feelings towards the grandparents or Lawson and that she has \u201cattempted to conduct these proceedings with an open state of mind, guided only by the law and the facts.\u201d Joseph J. Triscaro, counsel for the father, has also responded to the affidavits, asserting that the proceedings already conducted before Judge Floyd have been \u201cextensive, lengthy and complex\u201d and that removing the judge at this late stage would be prejudicial to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 6} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Floyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The Grandparents\u2019 Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 7} The grandparents claim that the appellate court\u2019s reversal of Judge Floyd\u2019s custody decision and its admonishment of Judge Floyd for the undue delay demonstrate that she is biased and prejudiced against them and partial to the father. They also question Judge Floyd\u2019s ability to remain impartial for the retrial. <em>Id. </em>The grandparents\u2019 averments, however, do not mandate Judge Floyd\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 8} First, it has long been established that a trial judge\u2019s opinions of law, even if erroneous, are not by themselves evidence of bias or prejudice and therefore are not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Kimmel, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 602, 522 N.E.2d 456 (1987); <em>In re Disqualification of Light, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 604, 522 N.E.2d 458 (1988) (\u201calleged errors of law or procedure are legal issues subject to appeal and are not grounds for disqualification\u201d). The record here shows that the appeals court determined that Judge Floyd abused her discretion with respect to four evidentiary rulings. While affiants allege that the appeals court opinion exposes Judge Floyd\u2019s bias, nothing in the record demonstrates that Judge Floyd\u2019s errors were the product of bias or prejudice against the grandparents. Indeed, the appeals court blamed Judge Floyd\u2019s errors, in part, on her misconception of the rules of evidence \u2014 not on favoritism towards the father. <em>See In re D.C.J., </em>2012-Ohio-4154, 976 N.E.2d 931, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">{\u00b6 9} Second, there is no indication from the appeals court opinion that Judge Floyd\u2019s failure to promptly handle the underlying proceeding is the result of bias or prejudice against the grandparents. Thus, the judge\u2019s delay is not a reason to remove her. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Hall, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1230, 763 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>N.E.2d 599 (2001) (\u201cWhile a delay in ruling on objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision may have adverse consequences to the defendant, affiant has failed to present any evidence that the delay is the product of bias or prejudice on the part of [the judge] toward her or her client\u201d). Further, as Triscaro asserts, the delay was equally prejudicial to the father, as the grandparents were granted temporary custody of the child during the pendency of the lengthy trial court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 10} Finally, it is also well established that \u201ca judge may preside over the retrial of a case even if that judge\u2019s rulings of law were reversed on appeal.\u201d <em>Kimmel, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 602, 522 N.E.2d 456; <em>see also In re Disqualification of Hurley, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1228, 2006-Ohio-7229, 863 N.E.2d 630, \u00b6 6 (\u201ca judge may remain on a case that has been remanded from the court of appeals\u201d). Here, the grandparents question Judge Floyd\u2019s ability to remain impartial, but there is no evidence that Judge Floyd is predisposed against the grandparents because they obtained a successful reversal of the custody decision. Similarly, the mere fact that Judge Floyd\u2019s decision was reversed in a critical opinion by the appeals court does not imply that she will be biased against the grandparents or somehow retaliate against them. <em>See generally </em>Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>Section 12.8 (2d Ed.2007). Judges are often called on to reconsider prior rulings, and Judge Floyd has pledged to hear the new trial fairly and impartially and to follow the mandate of the court of appeals. Accordingly, while there may be circumstances in which a new judge should preside over a retrial after remand from an appellate court, affiants have not proven that any such disqualifying circumstances exist here. <em>Compare Columbus v. Hayes, </em>68 Ohio App.3d 184, 189, 587 N.E.2d 939 (10th Dist.1990) (remanding for further proceedings before a different municipal court judge where original sentencing judge, after being reversed, made it clear that he did not intend to follow the mandate of the appeals court by declaring that he would impose the same sentence as before, even if he were reversed ten times).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Lawson\u2019s Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 11} According to Lawson\u2019s affidavit, two new events have occurred since the denial of his previous affidavit: (1) issuance of the appeals court opinion, which he claims is a \u201cstunning rebuke\u201d of Judge Floyd\u2019s custody decision, and (2) Judge Floyd\u2019s assignment of a new evaluator, which, according to Lawson, looks like \u201cexpert shopping.\u201d Neither of these allegations, however, is sufficient to justify Judge Floyd\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">{\u00b6 12} In making his first argument, Lawson cites the entry denying his previous affidavit of disqualification against Judge Floyd, which held that \u201cabsent extraordinary circumstances, a judge will not be disqualified after having presided over lengthy proceedings in a pending case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>No. 12-AP-069 (Aug. 10, 2012), citing <em>In re Disqualification of Light, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 604, 522 N.E.2d 458 (1988). Lawson argues that extraordinary circumstances exist here because of the critical appeals court opinion and Judge Floyd\u2019s \u201clikelihood of resentment\u201d towards him due to his near-successful election challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 13} Contrary to Lawson\u2019s contention, there are no extraordinary circumstances here requiring judicial disqualification. As an initial matter, precedent is clear: a judge ordinarily will not be disqualified based on the fact that a lawyer in a pending case was the judge\u2019s election opponent <em>(In re Disqualification of Maschari, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1212, 1213, 723 N.E.2d 1101 (1999)); and the fact that a judge\u2019s rulings were reversed on appeal does not lead to automatic disqualification of that judge for a retrial <em>(Kimmel, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 602, 522 N.E.2d 456). Here, Lawson suggests that the two allegations combined create an appearance of impropriety. He might have had a case if, for example, he had established that Judge Floyd issued blatantly incorrect legal rulings against Lawson\u2019s clients during their contentious election race. However, the underlying trial was held in April and May 2011, and Judge Floyd issued her custody decision on December 6, 2011. Lawson obtained petitions to run against Judge Floyd <em>after </em>issuance of the custody decision and long after the evidentiary rulings were made during the 2011 trial. Thus, there is no evidence that the incorrect evidentiary rulings were the result of Lawson\u2019s candidacy, and there is no apparent connection between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 14} Instead, Lawson seeks to disqualify Judge Floyd based wholly on his speculation that Judge Floyd <em>may </em>have resentment towards him based on the election and the appeals court opinion. In response to Lawson\u2019s affidavit, Judge Floyd vows to conduct future proceedings \u201cfairly and impartially in accordance with the judgment and mandate rendered by the Court of Appeals.\u201d Based on this record, no reasonable and objective observer would doubt Judge Floyd\u2019s ability to remain impartial, and Lawson\u2019s speculation is insufficient to establish that any extraordinary circumstances exist requiring Judge Floyd\u2019s disqualification. <em>See In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation * * * are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 15} In addition, Lawson has failed to substantiate his claims that the assignment of a new evaluator was the result of \u201cexpert shopping.\u201d Lawson claims that after the appeals court decision, Judge Floyd met with the director of the court\u2019s diagnostic clinic and expressed dissatisfaction with the two previous custody evaluations. A new evaluator was later assigned to conduct an updated custody evaluation. According to Lawson, the assignment of a new evaluator is highly unusual and suspect. In response, Judge Floyd admits that she met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>the director of the court\u2019s diagnostic clinic to discuss the need for an updated evaluation. However, Judge Floyd denies expressing any dissatisfaction with the previous evaluations, and she explains that the director of the clinic selected a new evaluator because the previous evaluator had limited availability and the director believed that a \u201cfresh perspective\u201d would be beneficial. Judge Floyd reiterates that the decision to select a new evaluator was made by the director \u201cwithout any input or influence from Judge Floyd.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 16} Given Judge Floyd\u2019s response, Lawson\u2019s vague and speculative argument, which is also based on hearsay, is insufficient to demonstrate bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d). Lawson\u2019s affidavit, therefore, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 18} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The case may proceed before Judge Floyd.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
