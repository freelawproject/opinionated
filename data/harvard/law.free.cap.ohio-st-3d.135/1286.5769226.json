Farchione, counsel for defendants in the underlying case, Dr. Tara Shipman and Associates in Female Health, Inc., has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge W. Wyatt McKay from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 2006-CV-2992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>now pending on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for prejudgment interest in the Court of Common Pleas of Trumbull County.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">{\u00b6 2} Farchione alleges that throughout this lengthy litigation, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have engaged in \u201cdeceptive manipulations of the law and fact in their arguments\u201d and that Judge McKay has \u201calmost universally accepted\u201d their representations. Farchione further claims that Judge McKay\u2019s rulings have created an appearance of bias or prejudice against Shipman \u201cto the point that an entire medical community believes there is no way to get a fair trial in his courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">{\u00b6 3} Judge McKay has responded in writing to the allegations raised in Farchione\u2019s affidavit, asserting that his rulings were not the result of any bias or prejudice and that they have not created any appearance of impropriety. Judge McKay further claims that \u201ccriticism in the community by certain interested groups of people does not equal evidence of judicial bias or prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">{\u00b6 4} Martin F. White, one of the attorneys for plaintiffs in the underlying case, has filed an affidavit and memorandum opposing Farchione\u2019s affidavit. White avers that Judge McKay has not shown any bias or favoritism toward any party in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">{\u00b6 5} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge McKay.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Judge McKay\u2019s adverse rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">{\u00b6 6} Farchione suggests that Judge McKay\u2019s \u201cconsistently adverse and prejudicial rulings\u201d against Shipman have created an appearance of bias mandating the judge\u2019s disqualification. Farchione sets forth a long list of such adverse rulings\u2014 including the judge\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial based on a comment made by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during voir dire, his rulings on various motions in limine and regarding witness testimony at trial, the judge\u2019s final jury instructions, his orders on posttrial motions, and his signing of a writ of execution of judgment without a hearing. These allegations, however, do not establish bias, prejudice, or a disqualifying interest under R.C. 2701.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">{\u00b6 7} First, an affidavit of disqualification must be filed \u201cas soon as possible after the incident giving rise to the claim of bias and prejudice occurred,\u201d and failure to do so may result in waiver of the objection, especially when \u201cthe facts underlying the objection have been known to the party for some time.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Grady, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1240, 1241, 674 N.E.2d 353 (1996). The events giving rise to Farchione\u2019s affidavit occurred years ago. Specifically, the underlying trial occurred in September and October 2010, and the most recent challenged ruling was made in September 2011, when Judge McKay signed the writ of execution. Yet Farchione did not file his affidavit until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>February 2013. If Farchione believed that Judge McKay\u2019s conduct demonstrated bias or prejudice, he should have timely sought disqualification, i.e., \u201cas soon as possible after the incident giving rise to the claim of bias and prejudice occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because nothing in the record justifies the delay in filing the affidavit of disqualification, Farchione has waived the ability to seek Judge McKay\u2019s disqualification based on his adverse rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">{\u00b6 8} Second, contrary to Farchione\u2019s assertions, whether Judge McKay erred in any of the various rulings cannot be litigated in an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding. It is well established that an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. And a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. Farchione may submit his legal arguments to the court of appeals, but the chief justice\u2019s statutory and constitutional authority to decide whether a judge can serve fairly and impartially does not authorize the removal of a trial judge because a party is unhappy about a series of rulings. Moreover, \u201c[a] party is not entitled to a certain number of favorable rulings, and a judge must be free to make rulings on the merits without the apprehension that a disproportionate number of rulings in favor of one party will create the impression of bias toward that party or against its adversary.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lawson, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2012-Ohio-6337, 986 N.E.2d 6, \u00b6 7, citing Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>Section 16.3, 449 (2d Ed.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Alleged public reaction to Judge McKay\u2019s rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">{\u00b6 9} Farchione also argues that Judge McKay\u2019s adverse rulings have resulted in an \u201cerosion of public faith\u201d in the court\u2019s ability to fairly adjudicate Shipman\u2019s case. Specifically, Farchione claims that the local medical community has \u201cwaged a very public protest campaign\u201d and that local physicians believe that Shipman \u201ccannot and will not get a fair trial or fair treatment after trial.\u201d According to Farchione, the fact that so many members of the medical community have lost faith in Judge McKay demonstrates the existence of an appearance of impropriety-</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe proper test for determining whether a judge\u2019s participation in a case presents an appearance of impropriety is * * * an objective one. A judge should step aside or be removed if a reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8. In general, media reports or editorials suggesting judicial bias, standing alone, are not competent sources on which to base an affidavit of disqualification, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>cannot act as a barometer of the reasonable-person standard. <em>See </em>Flamm, Section 5.7, at 131-133, citing <em>TV Communications Network, Inc. v. ESPN, Inc., </em>767 F.Supp. 1077, 1080 (D.Colo.1991) (\u201carticles and features in the media suggesting impropriety cannot act as a barometer of the reasonable observer standard\u201d); <em>In re Detroit, </em>828 F.2d 1160, 1168 (6th Cir.1987) (\u201cletters and articles * * * do not necessarily mean that the public believes [the judge] is biased\u201d); <em>Datagate, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>941 F.2d 864, 871 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cfact that the judge\u2019s decision was reported in the newspapers is not persuasive of a public impression of partiality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">{\u00b6 11} More important, Farchione has not substantiated his allegations on these claims. He attaches to his affidavit items- that he labels \u201cprotest materials,\u201d which he claims demonstrate that the local medical community believes that Shipman will not receive a fair trial. The alleged protest materials \u2014 which include newspaper letters to the editor and newspaper articles \u2014 for the most part are not specifically directed against Judge McKay, but involve local physicians\u2019 concerns regarding the rising cost of medical-malpractice insurance in Mahoning and Trumbull counties. While most of the letters and articles mention the jury verdict in the underlying case of <em>Cobb v. Shipman, </em>only one of the provided items directly criticizes Judge McKay. Specifically, Farchione includes a copy of a faxed letter, which appears to be dated September 16, 2011, from the president of the medical staff at Trumbull Memorial Hospital. The author addressed the letter to his colleagues and requested that they attend a staff meeting to discuss the \u201clatest OUTRAGEOUS ATTACK on Tara Shipman, M.D. by Marty White and his bedfellow, Judge McKay.\u201d (Capitalization sic.) This one letter does not establish that the public \u2014 or even the local Trumbull County medical community \u2014 questions the impartiality of Judge McKay or that the alleged public protests against Judge McKay are so strong that disqualification is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">{\u00b6 12} It has long been held that \u201cabsent extraordinary circumstances, a judge will not be subject to disqualification after having presided over lengthy proceedings in a pending case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1228, 1229, 763 N.E.2d 598 (2001). No extraordinary circumstances are present here. Farchione points to no action on the part of Judge McKay that demonstrates bias, prejudice, or a disqualifying interest. Further, \u201c[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">{\u00b6 13} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge McKay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
