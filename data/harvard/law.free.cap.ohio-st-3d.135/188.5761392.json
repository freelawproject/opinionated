Brock, from the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Brock failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 July 5, 2012 judgment dismissing his petition. Former S.Ct.Prac.R. 2.2(A)(1)(a) (\u201cTo perfect an appeal from a court of appeals to the Supreme Court, * * * the appellant shall file a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court within forty-five days from the entry of the judgment being appealed\u201d) (now S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.01(A)(1)(a)\u00ae, effective January 1, 2013). The court of appeals\u2019 August 6, 2012 entry striking Brock\u2019s motion for reconsideration and motion for certification due to lack of service and September 20, 2012 entry denying Brock\u2019s motion for review of judgment did not extend his time to appeal the judgment dismissing his habeas corpus petition. <em>State ex rel. Manuel v. Stenson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 52, 2010-Ohio-2673, 930 N.E.2d 310.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Brock\u2019s motion for reconsideration was a nullity because his habeas corpus petition was an original action in the court of appeals, and thus App.R. 26(A) was inapplicable. <em>Phillips v. Irwin, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 350, 2002-Ohio-4758, 774 N.E.2d 1218, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 2} In addition, upon appellee\u2019s request, we find Dennis R. Brock to be a vexatious litigator under S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.03(B). <em>See State v. Brock, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1421, 2008-Ohio-6166, 897 N.E.2d 654; <em>State v. Brock, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 1457, 2009-Ohio-3131, 908 N.E.2d 947; <em>State v. Brock, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 1410, 2011-Ohio-3244, 949 N.E.2d 1005; <em>State v. Brock, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1513, 2011-Ohio-2686, 948 N.E.2d 449; <em>Brock v. Niemeyer, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 80, 2011-Ohio-4704, 955 N.E.2d 981. Accordingly, it is ordered by the court that Dennis R. Brock is prohibited from continuing or instituting legal proceedings in this court without first obtaining leave. Any request shall be submitted to the clerk of this court for the court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ARxr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Stephanie Watson, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">.
