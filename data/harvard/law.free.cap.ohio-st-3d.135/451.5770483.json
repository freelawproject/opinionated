Randolph dated June 21 and October 2, 2009, issued as addenda to his original report of March 5, 2009, constituted some evidence in support of the commission\u2019s decision denying Kish\u2019s request for compensation for the loss of use of her left arm. Thus, the court concluded that the commission had not abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons that follow, we agree, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">{\u00b6 4} Kish was working as a clerk for appellee Kroger Company on January 3, 1990, when she slipped and fell on a wet floor, injuring her left ankle. Since then, she has suffered several other injuries that have been attributed to her underlying ankle injury. By 2009, Kish\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim had been allowed for the following conditions: left ankle injury, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (\u201cRSD\u201d), depression, fracture/dislocation left elbow with compartment syndrome, and loss of use of the left leg. Also by 2009, she had had multiple surgeries and was taking approximately 14 medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">{\u00b6 5} On February 23, 2009, at the request of Kroger, Dr. David C. Randolph examined Kish to determine whether further treatment was necessary and appropriate for her injury and other allowed conditions. In a March 5, 2009 report, Dr. Randolph identified and accepted the following allowed conditions: \u201cleft lower leg injury; depressive disorder; RSD; fracture left lower humerus, closed; [and] early complications of trauma.\u201d His report noted Kish\u2019s current complaints and the medical records he had reviewed. It also detailed his physical examination of Kish. Dr. Randolph concluded that Kish required no further medical treatment for her 1990 industrial injury and other allowed conditions in her claim and that her current medications were neither necessary nor appropriate for her allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">{\u00b6 6} As a result, Kroger notified Kish that Kroger would no longer pay for her treatment or medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On March 18, 2009, Kish filed a motion asking the commission to authorize continued treatment and medications, and a week later, she filed a motion for scheduled compensation for the loss of use of her left arm. She submitted a report from Dr. Douglas Gula in support of both motions. Dr. Gula had examined Kish on October 3, 2008, to evaluate her left arm. In a report dated March 25, 2009, he concluded that Kish had \u201csuffered serious injury to the left upper extremity\u201d and that she demonstrated the loss of use \u201cbased upon combination of finger, hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder function.\u201d He also concluded that she demonstrated \u201csignificant signs of complex regional pain syndrome\u201d related to her left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">{\u00b6 8} In April 2009, a district hearing officer authorized her continued treatment and medications based on the reports from Dr. Gula and another doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 9} On June 21, 2009, Dr. Randolph wrote an addendum to his original report to specifically address the alleged loss of use of Kish\u2019s left arm. According to Dr. Randolph, there was no objective evidence to support Kish\u2019s claim and Dr. Gula\u2019s opinion was invalid because he had merely relied on her self-reporting of pain and loss of function and had not made any objective findings to support the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 10} On July 16, 2009, Dr. Gula responded to Dr. Randolph\u2019s criticisms. He reiterated that Kish \u201cdoes demonstrate a complete loss of use in the sense of the ability to function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 11} In August 2009, a district hearing officer denied Kish\u2019s motion for compensation for the loss of use of her arm based on Dr. Randolph\u2019s June addendum. The hearing officer specifically rejected Dr. Gula\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">{\u00b6 12} Kish appealed, and each doctor responded in writing to the hearing officer\u2019s decision. On September 11, 2009, Dr. Gula clarified that Kish\u2019s loss of use of her left arm was based upon the allowed condition of fracture dislocation left elbow, with associated compartment syndrome. On October 2, 2009, Dr. Randolph repeated his opinion that Kish did not suffer a total loss of use of her left arm and that Dr. Gula\u2019s opinion was not supported by objective evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">{\u00b6 13} A staff hearing officer denied the motion based on Dr. Randolph\u2019s June and October addenda. The hearing officer noted that Dr. Randolph had \u201copined that there are no objective abnormalities with respect to [Kish\u2019s] left upper extremity which would support a total loss of use. * * * Dr. Randolph observed [Kish] during his examination and noted that when [she] was unaware of being observed her left upper extremity function appeared to be approaching normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">{\u00b6 14} The commission denied Kish\u2019s further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">{\u00b6 15} Kish filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Tenth District Court of Appeals alleging that the commission\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion. The court of appeals concluded, however, that Dr. Randolph\u2019s adden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>da constituted some evidence upon which the commission could rely to support its decision denying Kish\u2019s claim for the loss of use of her left arm. Thus, the appellate court determined that the commission had not abused its discretion and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 16} This cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 17} The dispositive issue is whether the second and third reports of Dr. Randolph \u2014 issued as addenda to his original report of March 5, 2009 \u2014 constituted some evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision denying Kish\u2019s motion for a scheduled loss-of-use award.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 18} First, Kish argues that Dr. Randolph\u2019s addenda could not be considered some evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision, because Dr. Randolph had not considered all the allowed conditions in his first report, in particular, the compartment syndrome associated with Kish\u2019s left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">{\u00b6 19} An examining physician must consider the allowed conditions of the claim in order to render an opinion that will constitute some evidence upon which the commission can rely. <em>State ex rel Richardson v. Quarto Mining Co., </em>73 Ohio St.3d 358, 652 N.E.2d 1027 (1995). In his original report, Dr. Randolph listed Kish\u2019s allowed injuries related to her left arm as \u201cfracture left lower humerus, closed\u201d and \u201cearly complications of trauma,\u201d but he did not expressly refer to Kish\u2019s allowed condition as \u201cfracture/dislocation left elbow with compartment syndrome.\u201d Thus, Kish argues that Dr. Randolph did not consider the compartment-syndrome component and his opinion cannot support the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">{\u00b6 20} The court of appeals noted that Dr. Randolph acknowledged in his report that Kish told him that she had developed compartment syndrome in her left arm. In addition, the appellate court noted that \u201ccompartment syndrome\u201d is a subcategory of \u201cearly complications of trauma.\u201d Thus, when Dr. Randolph considered \u201cearly complications of trauma,\u201d he considered compartment syndrome. Finally, the appellate court reasoned that Dr. Randolph would also have considered compartment syndrome when he responded to Dr. Gula\u2019s opinion that mentioned the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">{\u00b6 21} There is no dispute that Dr. Randolph examined Kish\u2019s left arm and provided clinical findings in support of his opinion. He also considered early complications of trauma, of which compartment syndrome is a subcategory, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <em>International Classification of Diseases </em>686-687 (9th Ed. 2011), and he addressed Dr. Gula\u2019s comments on the condition. Consequently, Kish\u2019s argument that Dr. Randolph did not consider compartment syndrome lacks merit.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Law Offices of James A. Whittaker, L.L.C., Laura J. Murphy, and James A. Whittaker, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">{\u00b6 22} Next, Kish contends that the commission implicitly rejected Dr. Randolph\u2019s initial report in its order authorizing the continuation of treatment and medications, so his addenda must likewise be rejected, in accordance with <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm., </em>45 Ohio St.3d 17, 19, 543 N.E.2d 87 (1989) (it would be inconsistent for the commission to reject a medical report at one level, for whatever reason, and rely on it at another).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 23} As the court of appeals concluded, the commission did not rely on Dr. Randolph\u2019s March 2009 report in its order denying the loss-of-use motion but instead relied on his later addenda, so there was no violation of <em>Zamora. </em>Furthermore, although the commission had implicitly rejected Dr. Randolph\u2019s conclusion regarding the continuation of medical treatment, it did not reject the clinical findings from his initial examination. His later addenda relied on those clinical findings, but addressed a different issue \u2014 specifically, the loss of use of the left arm. It was within the commission\u2019s discretion to rely on those reports. <em>State ex rel. Crocker v. Indus. Comm., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 202, 2006-Ohio-5483, 855 N.E.2d 848, \u00b6 16 <em>(Zamora </em>does not mean that the commission can <em>never </em>rely on a report from a doctor whose opinion has been rejected. \u201cWhat the commission cannot do is accept the same doctor\u2019s opinion on one matter that it previously rejected\u201d). <em>See also State ex rel. Value City Dept. Stores v. Indus. Comm., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 187, 2002-Ohio-5810, 777 N.E.2d 249, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 24} Finally, Kish contends that Dr. Randolph fabricated additional observations and findings in his October 2, 2009 addendum to support his opinion. Kish maintains that Dr. Randolph\u2019s statement that her left arm was \u201cquite functional\u201d and \u201cappeared] to be approaching normal\u201d when she was unaware of being observed was contrary to findings in his original report. We find that the record does not contain evidence to support Kish\u2019s allegation that the doctor fabricated this or any other statement. Without more, we find that Kish\u2019s argument is merely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 25} Because the June and October 2009 addenda of Dr. Randolph constituted some evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision to deny Kish\u2019s request for compensation for the loss of use of her left arm, the commission did not abuse its discretion and the court of appeals properly denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 26} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b689-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AWq3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Kevin J.
