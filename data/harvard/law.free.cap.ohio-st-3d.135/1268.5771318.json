Forsthoefel, voluntarily recused himself after Sizemore filed a federal civil action against him. Sizemore alleges that his replacement, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>Pokorny, should be disqualified for four main reasons: (1) Sizemore has moved to supplement her complaint in the federal ease to add Judge Pokorny as a defendant, (2) it appears that Judge Pokorny has conspired with Judge Forsthoefel and defendant\u2019s counsel, Greg Melick, to conceal material facts and to deny Sizemore her right to defend herself, (3) Judge Pokorny appears to be biased against women and pro se litigants, and (4) Judge Pokorny has scheduled a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim to declare Sizemore a vexatious litigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">{\u00b6 3} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Pokorny.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 4} First, the fact that Sizemore is attempting to name Judge Pokorny as a defendant in her federal case does not automatically lead to his disqualification in the underlying state-court proceeding. It is well established that a judge will not be disqualified solely because a litigant in a case pending before the judge has filed a lawsuit against that judge. To hold otherwise would invite parties to file lawsuits solely to obtain a judge\u2019s disqualification, which would severely hamper the orderly administration of judicial proceedings. <em>See In re Disqualification of Hunter, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 607, 608, 522 N.E.2d 461 (1988); <em>In re Disqualification of Kilpatrick, </em>47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 5} Second, Sizemore has failed to substantiate her claim that Judge Pokorny is engaging in a conspiracy with Judge Forsthoefel and Melick. In an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). The affiant is often required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit itself supporting the allegations contained therein. <em>See In re Disqualification of DeWine, </em>\u2014 Ohio St.3d \u2014, 2012-Ohio-6288, \u2014 N.E.2d \u2014, \u00b6 18. To support her conspiracy claim, Sizemore attached a December 10, 2012 letter from Judge Forsthoefel to the parties. Judge Forsthoefel attached to the letter a copy of the certificate of assignment reassigning Judge Pokorny to the case, and he informed the parties that \u201cupon Judge Pokorny\u2019s request,\u201d a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was scheduled for February 1, 2013. Sizemore claims that because Judge Forsthoefel had already recused himself at the time he sent the letter, his participation gives the \u201covert appearance of conspiracy\u201d to deprive her of her federal rights and gives the appearance that both judges are conspiring with Melick. But on its face, the letter merely informs the parties that Judge Pokorny has scheduled a hearing on a pending motion, and Sizemore has acknowledged that she does not have \u201cany way of ascertaining if there is a relationship between these two Judges.\u201d Vague or unsubstantiated allegations \u2014 such as those here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 6} Third, Sizemore has similarly failed to substantiate her claim that Judge Pokorny is biased against female and pro se litigants. Allegations of such bias strike at the very heart of the judiciary and are among the most serious and damaging that can be directed at a judge. As a result, such claims must be proven by clear evidence establishing the existence of bias. <em>See In re Disqualification of Cunningham, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1216, 2002-Ohio-7470, 798 N.E.2d 4, \u00b6 2 (setting forth standard for evaluating allegations of racial bias). Sizemore repeatedly asserts that Judge Pokorny is biased in favor of men and attorneys\u2014 mostly because he has promptly responded to the defendant\u2019s motions but has failed to rule on Sizemore\u2019s motions. However, Sizemore has not provided any actual evidence, beyond speculation or conjecture, to support her assertion that Judge Pokorny\u2019s actions are the product of bias \u2014 based on gender, pro se status, or otherwise. Allegations that are based solely on innuendo and speculation are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b64.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 7} Fourth, the fact that Judge Pokorny has scheduled a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is not grounds for disqualification. Sizemore claims that Judge Pokorny scheduled this hearing without legal grounds to do so, in violation of the Civil Rules, in violation of her right to a jury trial, and without regard to the evidence in the record. It is well settled, however, that a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. Similarly, a judge\u2019s action, or inaction, on a pending motion is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion and is not evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Eyster, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1246, 2004-Ohio-7350, 826 N.E.2d 304, \u00b6 4. Trial judges are entitled to exercise discretion in ruling on many matters, and it is not the chief justice\u2019s role in deciding an affidavit of disqualification to second-guess each ruling. The remedy for these and other legal claims, if any, lies in appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 8} Finally, affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings are narrow in scope and \u201c \u2018limited to determining whether a judge in a pending case has a bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying interest that mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification from that case.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Griffin, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1219, 2003-Ohio-7356, 803 N.E.2d 820, \u00b6 9, quoting <em>In re Disqualification of Kate, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1208, 1209, 723 N.E.2d 1098 (1999). Many of Sizemore\u2019s allegations in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>affidavit are directed against Judge Forsthoefel and attorney Melick. However, this is not the proper forum to evaluate whether the previous judge in the case or an attorney engaged in any wrongdoing or professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">{\u00b6 9} In conclusion, \u201c[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Pokorny.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
