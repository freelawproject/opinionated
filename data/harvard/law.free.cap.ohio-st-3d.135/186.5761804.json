Eubank, for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Lucas County Court of Common Pleas Judge Frederick McDonald, to issue a new sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C). Mandamus will not lie to compel an act that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Culgan v. Kimbler, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 480, 2012-Ohio-3310, 974 N.E.2d 88. Eubank\u2019s sentencing entry fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) and constituted a final, appealable order because it set forth the fact of his convictions, the sentence, the judge\u2019s signature, and the time stamp indicating its entry upon the journal by the clerk. <em>See State ex rel. Jones v. Ansted, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 125, 2012-Ohio-109, 961 N.E.2d 192, \u00b6 2. Notwithstanding Eubank\u2019s argument to the contrary, Crim.R. 32(C) did not require Judge McDonald to specify that some of the crimes for which he was convicted were lesser included offenses of the offenses charged in his indictment. The judge\u2019s sentencing entry contained a full resolution of the counts for which Eubank was convicted. <em>See State ex rel. Davis v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 29, 2010-Ohio-4728, 936 N.E.2d 41, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-13\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AjN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>James R.
