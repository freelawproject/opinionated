Papcke, attorney for the defendant in the underlying case, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Leslie Ann Celebrezze from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. DR10 330242, which is now pending on postdecree motions relating to the allocation of parental rights in the Domestic Relations Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County. Defendant, Nicole Misconin f.k.a. Nicole Gribble, has also filed an affidavit to disqualify Judge Celebrezze.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 2} Papcke alleges that Judge Celebrezze should be disqualified because she has previously recused herself from all cases in which Papcke entered an appearance as counsel, citing a \u201cpersonal conflict.\u201d Misconin alleges that Judge Celebrezze and her magistrate, Patrick R. Kelly, should be disqualified because Magistrate Kelly \u201cverbal[ly] attack[ed]\u201d Misconin and Misconin subsequently filed a grievance against Magistrate Kelly with disciplinary counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Celebrezze has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavits. Judge Celebrezze admits that she previously recused herself from cases in which Papcke represented a party. However, Judge Celebrezze further explains that the circumstances precipitating her recusal no longer exist; therefore, Judge Celebrezze \u201cmade the choice not to automatically recuse [herself] from any future cases in which [Papcke] may be counsel of record.\u201d Judge Celebrezze further asserts that an affidavit of disqualification is not the appropriate vehicle to resolve Papcke\u2019s and Misconin\u2019s issues with Magistrate Kelly. Finally, Judge Celebrezze affirms that she harbors no bias or prejudice against Papcke or Misconin.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order disqualification of Judge Celebrezze.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">{\u00b6 5} First, neither the fact that Judge Celebrezze previously recused herself from cases in which Papcke represented a party, nor the circumstances precipitating that recusal, mandate disqualification. According to Judge Celebrezze, when she became a judge in 2009, her husband, a physician, supervised Papcke\u2019s former domestic partner, who was also a physician. Judge Celebrezze felt it was possible that \u201cthere might be an appearance of impropriety\u201d if she presided over cases involving Papcke while her husband continued to supervise Papcke\u2019s former domestic partner. Therefore, Judge Celebrezze recused herself from cases in which Papcke represented a party. Judge Celebrezze now claims, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>her husband has not supervised Papcke\u2019s former partner in two years, and Papcke\u2019s relationship with her former partner ended over five years ago. Under these circumstances, Judge Celebrezze asserts, there is no longer any possibility of an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 6} Given Judge Celebrezze\u2019s explanation, the facts here do not warrant judicial disqualification. \u201cThe proper test for determining whether a judge\u2019s participation in a case presents an appearance of impropriety is * * * an objective one. A judge should step aside or be removed if a reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lucci, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1242, 2006-Ohio-7230, 884 N.E.2d 1093, \u00b6 8. \u201cGenerally, the more intimate the relationship between a judge and a person who is involved in a pending proceeding, the more acute is the concern that the judge may be tempted to depart from expected judicial detachment or to reasonably appear to have done so.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Shuff, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1230, 2004-Ohio-7355, 884 N.E.2d 1084, \u00b6 6. Here, nothing in the record suggests that Judge Celebrezze has the type of close personal or professional relationship with Papcke that would cause an objective, disinterested observer to question Judge Celebrezze\u2019s ability to remain impartial. The record demonstrates only that Judge Celebrezze\u2019s spouse supervised Papcke\u2019s former domestic partner, but that supervisory relationship ended two years ago. Moreover, Papcke\u2019s relationship with her partner ended over five years ago. Without more, no reasonable, objective observer would question Judge Celebrezze\u2019s ability to remain neutral based on this attenuated link between Judge Celebrezze and Papcke.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 7} In addition, Papcke has failed to demonstrate that Judge Celebrezze\u2019s participation in this case creates an appearance of impropriety. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence and argument demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) (requiring affiant to include specific allegations of bias, prejudice, or disqualifying interest and the facts to support those allegations). Accordingly, if there are reasons why Judge Celebrezze cannot serve fairly and impartially in the case, Papcke had the burden to specifically explain those reasons. Papcke\u2019s affidavit, however, failed to set forth the nature of her conflict with Judge Celebrezze or how that conflict demonstrates bias or prejudice. Papcke\u2019s only allegation is that Judge Celebrezze should be disqualified because she voluntarily recused herself in previous cases. But it is well established that a judge\u2019s voluntary removal from an earlier case does not, by itself, support disqualification from an unrelated case involving that same party or attorney. <em>In re Disqualification of Martin, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1221, 657 N.E.2d 1334 (1990) (\u201cThe voluntary recusal by a judge from an earlier case does not by itself support the judge\u2019s disqualification from another unrelated case involving the same party\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>Moreover, Judge Celebrezze has described the circumstances that caused her to previously remove herself and has explained that those circumstances no longer exist. Vague or unsubstantiated allegations \u2014 such as those alleged here by Papcke \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">{\u00b6 8} Second, as to affiants\u2019 allegations against Magistrate Kelly, R.C. 2701.03 does not permit the chief justice to consider claims of bias or prejudice against magistrates. <em>In re Disqualification of Wilson, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1250, 1251, 674 N.E.2d 360 (1996); <em>In re Disqualification of Evans, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1213, 2009-Ohio-7204, 937 N.E.2d 1006, \u00b6 6. To the extent that Papcke or Misconin seek Magistrate Kelly\u2019s disqualification, the request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 9} Third, contrary to Papcke\u2019s assertions, a judge will not be disqualified solely because a litigant in a case pending before the judge has filed a disciplinary grievance against the judge or magistrate. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Kilpatrick, </em>47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929 (1989) (\u201ca judge is not automatically disqualified solely because a party in a case pending before him or her has filed a complaint against the judge with Disciplinary Counsel or a similar body\u201d). To hold otherwise would invite the filing of misconduct complaints solely to obtain a judge\u2019s disqualification, and \u201cthe orderly administration of judicial proceedings would be severely hampered and thwarted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 10} The statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">{\u00b6 11} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The case may proceed before Judge Celebrezze.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
