Sawicki v. Lucas Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 507, 2009-Ohio-1523, 905 N.E.2d 1192, \u00b6 11; Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 2(B)(2)(a)(i). \u201cR.C. 2505.03 restricts the appellate jurisdiction of this court to the review of final orders, judgments, or decrees.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Downs v. Panioto, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 347, 2006-Ohio-8, 839 N.E.2d 911, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cR.C. 2505.02 defines a final order for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. The applicable portion of this statute states, \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is * * * [a]n order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). The magistrate\u2019s decision recommending dismissal of Boddie\u2019s mandamus case is not a final, appealable order, because it does not determine the mandamus action and prevent a judgment. <em>See </em>Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(a) (\u201cA magistrate\u2019s decision is not effective unless adopted by the court\u201d) and (e) (\u201cA court that adopts, rejects, or modifies a magistrate\u2019s decision shall also enter a judgment or interim order\u201d); <em>In re Adoption of S.R.A., </em>189 Ohio App.3d 363, 2010-Ohio-4435, 938 N.E.2d 432, \u00b6 17 (\u201cOrders do not constitute court orders unless certain formalities are met, and only judges, not magistrates, can terminate claims or actions by entering judgment\u201d). Nor did the court of appeals\u2019 order denying Boddie\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the magistrate\u2019s decision constitute a final, appealable order. <em>See Brewer v. Hope Timber Pallet &amp; Recycling, </em>5th Dist. No. 10-CA-76, 2011-Ohio-533, 2011 WL 379195 (order denying motion for reconsideration of interlocutory order denying motion for summary judgment is not a final, appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>order); <em>Harkai v. Scherba Industries, Inc., </em>136 Ohio App.3d 211, 218, 736 N.E.2d 101 (2000) (\u201cAlthough the judge entirely agrees with the decision of the magistrate, the judge must still separately enter his or her own judgment setting forth the outline of the dispute and the remedy provided\u201d). The court of appeals\u2019 order denying the motion for reconsideration did not resolve Boddie\u2019s mandamus claim, which, according to the court\u2019s website, was dismissed by the court of appeals in accordance with the magistrate\u2019s decision on January 7, 2013.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A43\">Howard Boddie Jr., pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 3} Therefore, the order appealed from does not constitute a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), because it does not determine Boddie\u2019s mandamus action or prevent a judgment. <em>State ex rel. Keith v. McMonagle, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 430, 2004-Ohio-5580, 816 N.E.2d 597, \u00b6 4.
