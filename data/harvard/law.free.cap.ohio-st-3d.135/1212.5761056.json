Carinci, counsel for the obligor in the underlying case, E.E., has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Thomas M. Baronzzi from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. C2006-0067, now pending on the request of obligee in the underlying case, C.S., for child-support modification in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana County.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">{\u00b6 2} Carinci alleges that Judge Baronzzi is biased and prejudiced against E.E. Carinci\u2019s allegations can be grouped into four main categories: (1) C.S. is involved in a romantic relationship with \u201ca good friend\u201d of Judge Baronzzi, (2) Judge Baronzzi has made disparaging comments about E.E. off the record, (3) Judge Baronzzi has attempted to \u201cco-counsel the case\u201d by \u201cpressur[ing]\u201d C.S.\u2019s attorney to conduct more discovery, and (4) Judge Baronzzi exhibited bias against E.E. in an August 6, 2012 entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Baronzzi has responded in writing to the concerns raised in Carinci\u2019s affidavit. Judge Baronzzi denies almost every statement in the affidavit and finds her \u201cfalse accusations\u201d to be \u201coutrageous, disturbing and frivolous.\u201d Judge Baronzzi admits that he has been \u201cvery frustrated\u201d with E.E.\u2019s \u201cfailure to adequately respond to discovery.\u201d However, Judge Baronzzi disclaims any bias or prejudice against E.E., and he contends that E.E. will be afforded \u201ccourtesy and professionalism through the conclusion of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Baronzzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b714-17\">\n<em>Judge Baronzzi's alleged \u201cgood friend\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-18\">{\u00b6 5} Carinci\u2019s allegation that C.S. is involved in a romantic relationship with a \u201cgood friend\u201d of Judge Baronzzi does not mandate disqualification. Carinci has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>failed to identify this \u201cgood friend,\u201d and she has failed to explain how Judge Baronzzi\u2019s friendship with this person could reasonably affect his impartiality in the underlying case. Just as the \u201cmere existence of a friendship between a judge and an attorney or between a judge and a party will not disqualify the judge from cases involving that attorney or party,\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Bressler, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 1215, 688 N.E.2d 517 (1997), the mere allegation that a party before a judge is a friend of a friend of the judge will not result in judicial disqualification. Because Carinci\u2019s assertion lacks an affirmative indication that Judge Baronzzi\u2019s friendship with the unidentified person will somehow affect the judge\u2019s consideration of the case, it is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">\n<em>Judge Baronzzi\u2019s alleged comments made off the record and alleged attempts to \u201cco-counsel\u201d the case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 6} Carinci has failed to substantiate her claims that Judge Baronzzi made disparaging comments about E.E. off the record and attempted to \u201cco-counsel\u201d the case. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) (requiring affiant to include specific allegations of bias, prejudice, or disqualifying interest and the facts to support those allegations). Generally, an affiant is required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations contained therein. <em>Compare In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1235, 674 N.E.2d 350 (1996) (judges disqualified when affiants submitted evidentiary materials showing disqualification of all county judges was warranted) <em>with In re Disqualification of Crow, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 1209, 741 N.E.2d 137 (2000) (judge not disqualified when affiants failed to support their general allegations with third-party affidavits).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">{\u00b6 7} Carinci offers only her affidavit to support her allegations. A number of her claims, however, could have been substantiated by other means. For example, as part of her \u201cco-counseling\u201d allegation, Carinci claims that at an April 2012 hearing, Judge Baronzzi demanded that E.E. provide certain evidence, even though C.S.\u2019s counsel had not requested the information. Yet Carinci failed to submit a transcript from the hearing to support her allegation. Likewise, Carinci failed to submit any third-party affidavit or other evidence to support her allegation that Judge Baronzzi made disparaging comments about her client off the record during pretrial conferences. Carinci\u2019s need for supporting evidence is exacerbated here because Judge Baronzzi flatly denies making any of the alleged comments or attempting to \u201cco-counsel\u201d the case. Judge Baronzzi further indicates that Carinci\u2019s accusations are \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Because of Carinci\u2019s failure to substantiate her claims, there is no way to determine whether Judge Baronzzi made the alleged comments, let alone whether the comments reflect bias or prejudice against E.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. <em>In re Disqualification of Hunter, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 607, 522 N.E.2d 461 (1988). Further, a \u201cjudge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. On this record, Carinci\u2019s vague and unsubstantiated allegations \u2014 especially in the face of clear denials by Judge Baronzzi \u2014 -are insufficient to overcome the presumption that Judge Baronzzi is fair and impartial. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Cacioppo, 77 </em>Ohio St.3d 1245, 674 N.E.2d 356 (1996) (hearsay allegations of affiant \u201cwill not stand in the face of an affirmative denial by the trial judge\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 8 (\u201cIn the wake of the conflicting stories presented by the various affiants, however, I cannot conclude that the judge is clearly biased and prejudiced * * * \u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>Judge Baronzzi\u2019s August 6, 2012 entry</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">{\u00b6 9} In July 2012, Carinci filed a motion for Judge Baronzzi to recuse himself based on alleged prejudicial comments by the judge about E.E.\u2019s lifestyle and income. Carinci has failed to submit a copy of her motion; thus, the record does not include any information regarding the substance of these alleged comments. By entry of August 6, 2012, Judge Baronzzi denied the motion. In that entry, Judge Baronzzi admits that he previously commented that E.E. was \u201cliving the life,\u201d but Judge Baronzzi claims that this comment was neither prejudicial nor inappropriate. Instead, the comment was meant to communicate to E.E. that his claims of \u201cnear poverty\u201d were \u201cridiculous.\u201d As support for the \u201cliving the life\u201d comment, the August 6 entry states that (1) there is evidence in the record demonstrating that E.E. drives expensive vehicles, takes expensive shopping trips, and travels to Las Vegas for gambling and (2) E.E. has \u201cextensive tattoos, which were openly displayed for the Court during his testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">{\u00b6 10} In her affidavit of disqualification, Carinci describes Judge Baronzzi\u2019s August 6 entry as a \u201ccollection of musings\u201d about E.E.\u2019s \u201cexpensive tattoos,\u201d and Carinci states that Judge Baronzzi should recuse himself if he feels \u201cjealousy or anger because of the appearance of Mr. [E.E.]\u201d In addition, Carinci claims that the August 6 entry demonstrates that Judge Baronzzi has reached the opinion\u2014 before the final hearing on the matter \u2014 that E.E. is not being truthful about his income level.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 11} To be sure, \u201c[i]f a judge\u2019s words or actions convey the impression that the judge has developed a \u2018hostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u2019 or reached a \u2018fixed anticipatory judgment\u2019 that will prevent the judge from presiding over the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>with \u2018an open state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts,\u2019...... * then the judge should not remain on the case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Synenberg, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2009-Ohio-7206, 937 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 24, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). Here, Judge Baronzzi\u2019s comments in the August 6 entry about E.E.\u2019s tattoos were unnecessary, but they do not demonstrate that he has developed hostile feelings toward E.E. based on his appearance. As an initial matter, the August 6 entry states that E.E. has \u201cextensive\u201d tattoos, not \u201cexpensive\u201d tattoos, as Carinci alleges in her affidavit. Regardless, it is clear from the entry that Judge Baronzzi mentions E.E.\u2019s tattoos \u2014 along with his cars and shopping and gambling trips\u2014 to imply that E.E. has more income than he portrays in court filings. A person\u2019s tattoos, however, are not indicative of the person\u2019s current income level. Thus, Judge Baronzzi\u2019s comments about E.E.\u2019s appearance were unfortunate and probably best left unsaid. <em>See, e.g., Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10 (\u201c[Rjemarks * * * about attorneys\u2019 clothing are probably best left unsaid by judges during official proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 12} Judge Baronzzi\u2019s August 6 entry also does not indicate that he has predetermined E.E.\u2019s income level. Judges often form conditional opinions about a case during preliminary matters, but it is well settled that the formation of these conditional opinions does not counter the presumption of the judge\u2019s ability to preside fairly and impartially over future proceedings. <em>In re Disqualification of Horvath, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1247, 2004-Ohio-7356, 826 N.E.2d 305, \u00b6 8; <em>In re Disqualification of Brown, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1250, 1251, 657 N.E.2d 1353 (1993). Judge Baronzzi affirms that he \u201chas reserved judgment as to any amount of income or earnings of Mr. [E.E.] pending final hearing.\u201d At the final hearing, E.E. will have the opportunity to present evidence to dispute any claims about his income level. Because nothing in the record contradicts Judge Baronzzi\u2019s assurances, there is no clear existence of a fixed anticipatory judgment. Disqualification is therefore not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">{\u00b6 13} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Baronzzi.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
