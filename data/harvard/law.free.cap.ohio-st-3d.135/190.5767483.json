The election contest is in regard to the office of state representative for the 98th House District for the state of Ohio, held in the November 6, 2012 general election. O\u2019Farrell, a Democrat, and contestee Al Landis, a Republican, were the candidates. In addition to the contestee, O\u2019Farrell named the boards of elections of Tuscarawas and Holmes counties as respondents in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent Holmes County Board of Elections moves to be dismissed as a party. The motion is denied for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">{\u00b6 3} The board argues that because R.C. 3515.09 does not provide that a board of election is to be named as a party in an election contest, O\u2019Farrell has \u201cfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">{\u00b6 4} While the statute does define the contestor and the contestee in an elections contest, it does not explicitly state that the contestee is to be the only opposing party or prohibit the contestor from including other entities as parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, R.C. 3515.09 also states that if the judgment is rendered against the contestee, \u201cthe county shall pay the costs as other election expenses are paid.\u201d Thus, while it does not explicitly include or exclude a county board of elections as a party, the statute does make the <em>county </em>potentially liable for costs in an election contest. Therefore the board of elections \u2014 presumably the subdivision of Holmes County responsible for costs \u201cas other election expenses are paid\u201d \u2014 is an entity with a real interest in the litigation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHWi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>McTigue &amp; McGinnis, L.L.C., Donald McTigue, J.

The case may therefore proceed with the board as a respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
