Appellant, Cincinnati Community Kollel, an educational institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121, sought exemptions for three residential apartment buildings based on the claim that the properties were being used in furtherance of its educational purposes. The tax commissioner denied the exemptions, and the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 2} On the merits, the kollel argues that the BTA misconstrued and misapplied R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) and failed to cite competent and probative evidence to support its decision. For the reasons that follow, we agree and reverse the decision of the BTA and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 3} Cincinnati Community Kollel, an Ohio nonprofit corporation, is an institute that is devoted to the advanced study of Jewish religious texts. The kollel combines this mission with the goal of providing educational opportunities and outreach events for the Jewish community where it is situated. According to the kollel\u2019s constitution, its purpose is to \u201cprovide an environment of Torah study, combining the advanced studies of the <em>kollel </em>staff scholars with a venue for community learning.\u201d (Italics sic.) The kollel performs this service \u201cin the sincere belief that this Institution will elevate the spirit of, and thereby enhance, the Jewish Community of Cincinnati.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 4} The kollel sought real property tax exemptions on three parcels that it owns on Elbrook Avenue in the Hamilton County village of Golf Manor. The parcels are adjacent to each other, with each parcel containing one building. Each building is divided into two residential apartments. The apartments are occupied by the kollel\u2019s \u201cstaff scholars\u201d and their families. The staff scholars are Torah scholars who have moved to the kollel to continue their own Torah studies and to teach others in the Cincinnati community. While the staff scholars study and teach at the kollel, they and their families live rent-free in the apartment buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 5} In cases involving tax years 1998 through 2002, the BTA previously held that two of the apartment buildings at issue in this case were not entitled to an exemption. <em>See Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Wilkins, </em>BTA Nos. 2004-K-1441 and 2004-K-1442, 2006 WL 200649 (Jan. 20, 2006). Specifically, the BTA found that irrespective of how the property was used, the kollel was not entitled to an exemption, because it was not an \u201ceducational institution\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5709.121. <em>Id. </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 6} In <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 138, 2007-Ohio-1249, 863 N.E.2d 147, we reversed the BTA and held that the kollel did qualify as an educational institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121. We did not, however, decide whether the kollel\u2019s properties were being used in a manner that qualified for an exemption under R.C. 5709.121(A), and we remanded the case to the BTA for consideration of that issue. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 7} On remand, the BTA found that \u201c[t]he record supports [the kollel\u2019s] contention that some learning occurs at the subject property.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>BTA Nos. 2004-K-1441 and 2004-K-1442, 2007 WL 2688699, *2 (Aug. 31, 2007). The BTA, however, found that the \u201cprincipal use\u201d of the apartments was \u201cresidential in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, despite finding that the apartment buildings were \u201cused in a manner not inconsistent with [the kollel\u2019s] mission,\u201d the BTA determined that the kollel did not qualify for an exemption under R.C. 5709.121, because the apartments were \u201cused at all times and primarily as a private personal residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. The kollel appealed to this court, but we dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution. <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1407, 2007-Ohio-6173, 876 N.E.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 8} In the instant matter, the kollel sought exemptions relating to tax years 2004 through 2007 for the two apartment buildings that were at issue in BTA case Nos. 2004-K-1441 and 2004-K-1442. The kollel also sought an exemption for tax year 2004 for a third apartment building that had been purchased after the tax years at issue in the earlier case. The kollel\u2019s exemption claim was filed pursuant to R.C. 5709.121(A)(2), based on its status as an educational institution and on the claim that the properties were being used in furtherance of the kollel\u2019s educational purpose. The tax commissioner denied the exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In denying the exemption, the commissioner did not expressly determine whether the kollel was an educational institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121. Instead, the commissioner focused primarily on the fact that the subject properties were used as residential apartments that house the kollel\u2019s staff scholars and their family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The kollel appealed to the BTA, which held a hearing on the matter in July 2010. Following the hearing, the BTA affirmed the tax commissioner\u2019s decision. The BTA first found that the kollel is an educational institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121 based on our holding in <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 138, 2007-Ohio-1249, 863 N.E.2d 147. The BTA then turned to the question whether the three residential buildings were used in furtherance of or incidental to the kollel\u2019s educational purposes. For this part of its decision, the BTA relied extensively on the analysis and legal conclusions set forth in <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>BTA Nos. 2004-K-1441 and 2004-K-1442, 2007 WL 2688699 (Aug. 31, 2007). The BTA held, as it had in that earlier case, that the buildings were not used to further the kollel\u2019s educational purposes, because the principal and primary use of the properties was as private residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 10} The kollel has filed this appeal of right from the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>I. The Issue on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 11} This appeal questions the BTA\u2019s interpretation and application of R.C. 5709.121(A)(2), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) Real property * * * belonging to a charitable or educational institution * * * shall be considered as used exclusively for charitable or public purposes by such institution * * * if it meets one of the following requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(2) It is made available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational, or public purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">{\u00b6 15} There is no dispute here that (1) the kollel is an educational institution, (2) the subject property has been made available under the kollel\u2019s direction or control, and (3) there is no view to profit. The parties agree that the sole issue presented for review is whether, under R.C. 5709.121(A)(2), the property is made available for use \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the kollel\u2019s educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">{\u00b6 16} When an appellant challenges a decision of the BTA, this court looks to see whether the BTA\u2019s decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783 (2001). We \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789 (2001). The BTA is also responsible for deciding factual issues, and if the record contains reliable and probative evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to support the BTA\u2019s determinations, this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 17} Moreover, any claimed exemption from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed, and the taxpayer must affirmatively establish a right to the exemption.\u201d <em>Athens Cty. Aud. v. Wilkins, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 293, 2005-Ohio-4986, 834 N.E.2d 804, \u00b6 8. <em>See also </em>R.C. 5715.271 (\u201cthe burden of proof shall be placed on the property owner to show that the property is entitled to exemption\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>III. The BTA\u2019s Decision Was Unlawful and Unreasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 18} The kollel asserts that the BTA erred as a matter of law in construing and applying R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). The kollel also maintains that the record does not support the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\n<em>A. The BTA\u2019s reliance on its earlier decision in case Nos. 200Jp-K-HIl and 200I-K-1I4-2 was misplaced</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 19} In its decision and order in this matter, the BTA relied extensively on the analysis and legal conclusions set forth in its earlier decision, <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>BTA Nos. 2004-K-1441 and 2004-K-1442, 2007 WL 2688699 (Aug. 31, 2007) (the \u201c2007 remand decision\u201d). That decision was issued after our remand order in <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 138, 2007-Ohio-1249, 863 N.E.2d 147, in which we held that the kollel qualified as an educational institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121. We instructed the BTA on remand to consider \u201cwhether the purposes for which the kollel uses the apartment buildings qualify those buildings for a property-tax exemption under R.C. 5709.121(A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">{\u00b6 20} In the 2007 remand decision, the BTA expressly limited its analysis to considering whether the property at issue qualified for exemption under former R.C. 5709.121(A)(2), which, pursuant to a 2005 amendment to the statute, is now codified as R.C. 5709.121(A)(1)(b). Am.Sub.H.B. No. 66, 151 Ohio Laws, Parts II \u2014 III, 2868, 4403. That provision exempts property of educational institutions as long as the property is used for \u201cother charitable, educational, or public purposes.\u201d In the present case, the BTA quoted extensively from its 2007 remand decision, found that the evidence submitted in this case was essentially the same as the evidence submitted in that earlier case, and rejected the kollel\u2019s arguments for exemption here on the grounds that its \u201cevaluation of [the kollel\u2019s] use of the subject residences ha[d] not changed.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Community Kollel v. Levin, </em>BTA Nos. 2008-A-1367, 2008-A-1368, and 2008-A-1369, 2011 WL 6323047, at *7 (Dec. 13, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">{\u00b6 21} We conclude that the BTA erred by relying on the 2007 remand decision when deciding the present appeal. In that earlier case, the BTA never considered whether the property at issue qualified for exemption under a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>provision of R.C. 5709.121: former R.C. 5709.121(B), now codified as R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). 151 Ohio Laws, Parts II \u2014 III, 2868, 4403. That provision exempts property of an educational institution that is \u201cmade available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational, or public purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d The BTA\u2019s focus in the present case ought to have been on whether the use of the property was \u201cin furtherance of or incidental to\u201d the kollel\u2019s educational purposes, and that question differs from the question whether the use of the property was one that involved \u201cother charitable, educational, or public purposes.\u201d It was not proper for the BTA to rely on an earlier decision when the legal standard applied in that decision was different from the one to be applied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>B. The BTA misconstrued the plain language of R.C. 5709.121(A)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 22} The kollel contends that the BTA erred in requiring a minimum quantity of educational activity in order to meet the \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 requirement set forth in R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). According to the kollel, there is no legal authority that requires a certain level of educational activity to occur on the property for an exemption to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 5709.121(A) provides that \u201c[r]eal property and tangible personal property belonging to a charitable or educational institution * * * shall be considered as used exclusively for charitable or public purposes * * * if it meets\u201d one of the specified criteria under the statute. In prior cases, we have explained the relationship between R.C. 5709.121 and 5709.12. \u201cR.C. 5709.121 does not declare any property to be exempt but links certain property uses to R.C. 5709.12(B)\u2019s exclusive-charitable-use exemption.\u201d <em>Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 215, 2010-Ohio-5071, 938 N.E.2d 329, \u00b622. Under R.C. 5709.12(B), \u201c[r]eal and tangible personal property belonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes shall be exempt from taxation.\u201d Thus, pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B), any institution, charitable or noncharitable, may qualify for a tax exemption if it is making exclusive charitable use of its property. But if the property belongs to a charitable or educational institution, R.C. 5709.121 defines what constitutes exclusive use of property in order to be exempt from taxation. <em>Community Health Professionals, Inc. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 432, 2007-Ohio-2336, 866 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 17; <em>Dialysis Clinic </em>at \u00b6 24. <em>See also State Teachers Retirement Bd. v. Kinney, </em>68 Ohio St.2d 195, 197-198, 429 N.E.2d 1069 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 24} The kollel sought exemption under R.C. 5709.121(A)(2), claiming that the subject property was used \u201cin furtherance of or incidental to\u201d its educational purposes. The BTA acknowledged that some educational activities and programs were taking place at the kollel\u2019s apartment buildings. 2011 WL 6323047, *6. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>BTA, however, focused on the amount of time that the apartments were being used for educational activities and found that the level of activity was insufficient to qualify for a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). According to the BTA, even though the properties were used at certain times in a manner not inconsistent with the kollel\u2019s mission, the primary use of the properties was as private residences. <em>Id. </em>at *7. The BTA acknowledged that housing has been exempted from taxation in certain situations that required the \u201caround-the-clock presence of the resident\u201d to carry out the institution\u2019s purposes. <em>Id. </em>But the BTA found that the use of the kollel\u2019s apartments was not comparable to those situations, and because the \u201cprincipal use\u201d of the properties was residential, the BTA affirmed the tax commissioner\u2019s denial of the exemptions. <em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 25} The first rule of statutory construction requires courts to look at the statute\u2019s language to determine its meaning. If the statute conveys a clear, unequivocal, and definite meaning, interpretation comes to an end, and the statute must be applied according to its terms. <em>Lancaster Colony Corp. v. Limbach, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 198, 199, 524 N.E.2d 1389 (1988). Courts may not delete words used or insert words not used. <em>Cline v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 93, 97, 573 N.E.2d 77 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 26} We find that the BTA misconstrued the plain meaning of the language set forth in R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). The BTA\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) went beyond the statutory language and in effect imposed a primary-use test to qualify the subject property for a tax exemption. But there is no primary-use or principal-use test set forth in R.C. 5709.121. Indeed, this court previously rejected the argument that property must be primarily used for the purposes specified in R.C. 5709.121 to qualify for tax exemption. <em>Galvin v. Masonic Toledo Trust, </em>34 Ohio St.2d 157, 159-160, 296 N.E.2d 542 (1973). Rather, R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) provides a clear test for exemption: property belonging to an educational institution is marked for exemption if it is \u201cuse[d] in furtherance of or incidental to\u201d the institution\u2019s educational purposes and not with a view to profit. Had the General Assembly intended for an exemption to hinge on the primary or principal use of the property, it could have used words to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 27} Contrary to the BTA\u2019s apparent belief, nothing in the statutory language or case law makes residential use inimical to a finding that such use is \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the kollel\u2019s educational purposes. Historically, as the tax commissioner points out, a distinctly residential use of real property has defeated a charitable-use exemption claim, even when the property is used at times for charitable purposes. But this principle applies to R.C. 5709.12, not R.C. 5709.121. <em>See NBC-USA Hous., Inc.-Five v. Levin, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 394, 2010-Ohio-1553, 928 N.E.2d 715, \u00b6 6-9, 17-18. <em>See also Galvin </em>at 159-160 (reliance on case law construing R.C. 5709.12 developed prior to the enactment of R.C. 5709.121 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>improper). In short, nothing about the phrase \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 in R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) disqualifies residential property for exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 28} Likewise, no requirement exists in R.C. 5709.121 that a resident be present \u201caround the clock\u201d to carry out the institution\u2019s purposes, contrary to the BTA\u2019s holding in this case. Rather, when considering the question whether an educational institution uses its property in furtherance of or incidental to its educational purposes, the focus of the inquiry should be on the relationship between the actual use of the property and the purpose of the institution. <em>See Community Health Professionals, Inc. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 432, 2007-Ohio-2336, 866 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 29} In sum, we find that the BTA\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) was incorrect as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\n<em>C. The BTA\u2019s determination was not supported by reliable and probative evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 30} The kollel also challenges the evidence relied on by the BTA to support its decision. The kollel argues that the BTA cited no evidence that would support a finding that the apartment buildings were not being used in furtherance of the kollel\u2019s educational goals. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 31} After summarizing the testimony presented by the kollel, the BTA found that the kollel did not meet its burden of proving that the subject properties were used in furtherance of or incidental to its educational purposes. As evidence to support its decision, the BTA cited the kollel\u2019s tax-exemption application. Question 14 of the application asks the taxpayer to describe how the property is currently being used. The BTA found that the kollel had answered this question in the following manner: \u201cThis property was a 2-story, 4-family apartment building. The Applicant converted it into a 2-family apartment budding, with one apartment on each floor. The property houses two of the Applicant\u2019s staff members (scholars) and their families.\u201d According to the BTA, the kollel\u2019s answer made \u201cno mention of an educational component to the residences.\u201d 2011 WL 6323047, *6. But the BTA overlooked the second paragraph of the kollel\u2019s answer, which states: \u201cIn addition to living in the apartments, the scholars, alone, and with their wives, carry on activities in their residences that are an integral part of the Kollel\u2019s various educational programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 32} The BTA also attempted to rebut the kollel\u2019s evidence with a statement written in the kollel\u2019s posthearing brief. The BTA apparently found probative counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he Kollel scholars and their families mostly use the apartments in the ordinary fashion.\u201d Statements made by counsel are not evidence, however. <em>See Corporate Exchange Bldgs. IV &amp; V, L.P. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 297, 300, 695 N.E.2d 743 (1998). And even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>counsel\u2019s statement qualified as evidence, the BTA quotes it out of context, omitting the sentence immediately following the quoted excerpt, which states: \u201cHowever, the Kollel scholars also use their apartments in ways that are unrelated to their family lives, but are specifically in furtherance of or incidental to the Kollel\u2019s charitable and educational purposes.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMJ\">Simon Groner, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ALV\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Ryan P.
