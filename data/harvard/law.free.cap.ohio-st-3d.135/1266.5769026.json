Hupp and Ronald A. Margolis, counsel for defendants, have filed affidavits with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Frank G. Forchione from presiding over further proceedings in case No. 2011-CV-03120, a medical-malpractice and wrongful-death action now pending for trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">{\u00b6 2} Hupp and Margolis allege that Judge Forchione is biased and prejudiced in favor of plaintiff because, at a January 22, 2013 oral hearing, he granted plaintiffs motion to strike defendants\u2019 jury demand. According to Hupp, Judge Forchione\u2019s decision was \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d and violates his clients\u2019 constitutional rights to a jury trial. In addition, Margolis claims that Judge Forchione\u2019s \u201cmannerisms, tone of voice and overall dismissal of constitutionally protected rights and applicable law\u201d at the January 22 hearing demonstrate that he lacks judicial objectivity. On January 24, 2013, Hupp and Margolis submitted a transcript of the January 22 oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Forchione has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavits. Judge Forchione explains that he granted plaintiffs motion to strike defendants\u2019 jury demand because the defense did not timely pay jury costs. He further asserts that at the January 22 oral hearing, he treated all attorneys in a professional and respectful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Forchione.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">{\u00b6 5} First, contrary to affiants\u2019 assertions, it is well established that \u201c[rjulings that are adverse to a party in a pending case and with which a party disagrees or is dissatisfied are not grounds for disqualification, even if those rulings later are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>reversed on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Sheward, 77 </em>Ohio St.3d 1258, 1259, 674 N.E.2d 365 (1996), citing <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 605, 522 N.E.2d 459 (1988). An affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding addresses the narrow issue of the possible bias or prejudice of a judge, and \u201c[i]t is not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law * * <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. Accordingly, it is not within the scope of this proceeding to evaluate or review Judge Forchione\u2019s decision striking defendants\u2019 jury demand. The remedy for this and other legal claims, if any, lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 6} Second, the transcript from the January 22 hearing does not demonstrate that Judge Forchione is partial to plaintiff or that he has a bias against defendants or their counsel. To be sure, if a judge\u2019s words or actions convey the impression that the judge has developed a \u201c \u2018hostile feeling or spirit of ill will,\u2019 \u201d or if the judge has reached a \u201c \u2018fixed anticipatory judgment\u2019 \u201d that will prevent the judge from hearing the case with \u201c \u2018an open state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts,\u2019 \u201d then the judge should not remain on the case. <em>In re Disqualification of Hoover, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1233, 2006-Ohio-7234, 863 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). Here, Judge Forchione expressed frustration with Margolis for failing to timely deposit jury costs and to timely file motions in limine, and Judge Forchione repeatedly stated that he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d because the trial had already been continued once and one of the defendants had not made himself available for a deposition. But \u201c[jjudges are certainly entitled to express dissatisfaction with attorneys\u2019 dilatory tactics inside and outside the courtroom,\u201d as long as that dissatisfaction is \u201cexpressed in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity, dignity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10. Even if affiants are ultimately correct in that they could not timely deposit jury fees pursuant to the magistrate\u2019s scheduling order, nothing about the tone or nature of the judge\u2019s comments would cause a reasonable and objective observer to harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality. The transcript shows that Margolis and Judge Forchione strongly disagreed about when defendants should have deposited jury fees and that Judge Forchione was frustrated with what he perceived as defense counsel\u2019s dilatory tactics. But the transcript does not conclusively establish that Judge Forchione has a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u201d against the affiants mandating his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 7} Moreover, Judge Forchione expressed similar frustration with plaintiffs counsel when he denied plaintiffs motion for leave to file an untimely motion for summary judgment (\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s fair to the defense to file this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>summary judgment. Again, I am getting concerned with things being filed past the deadlines\u201d). And the judge admonished all counsel for failing to bring their clients to the hearing (\u201cNobody is taking this Court very seriously. That\u2019s what I am starting to see\u201d). These facts undercut affiants\u2019 claims that the judge exhibited partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The case may proceed before Judge Forchione.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
