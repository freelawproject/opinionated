Samples is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus for his claims of sentencing error, because he had an adequate remedy by way of appeal to raise his claims. <em>See </em>R.C. 2731.05; <em>State ex rel. Barr v. Sutula, </em>132 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>297, 2012-Ohio-2790, 971 N.E.2d 928 (court affirmed judgment dismissing mandamus claim because appellant \u201chad an adequate remedy by way of appeal from his sentencing entry to raise his claim of sentencing error\u201d). Moreover, insofar as Samples sought writs of mandamus and procedendo to compel the issuance of a valid sentence and rulings on motions that were pending when he filed his complaint, the trial court has provided the requested relief. <em>See, e.g., State v. Samples, </em>5th Dist. No. 2010-CA-00122, 2011-Ohio-179, 2011 WL 198433, affirming the trial court\u2019s revised sentencing entry. \u201cNeither mandamus nor procedendo will lie to compel an act that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lester v. Pepple, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 353, 2011-Ohio-5756, 958 N.E.2d 566, \u00b6 1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AjR\">Douglas Lee Samples, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AAH\">John D.

We deny Samples\u2019s motion to strike appellee\u2019s brief. Although appellee\u2019s brief does not comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. 16.03(B) because it does not include a table of contents and a table of authorities and we admonish appellee and her attorneys for such noncompliance, the brief need not be stricken, because Samples was able to timely respond to the brief and appellee\u2019s brief provides the court with a statement of facts and the relevant legal arguments on the issues raised in this appeal. <em>See State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Bd. of Trustees of Ohio State Univ., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 8-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
