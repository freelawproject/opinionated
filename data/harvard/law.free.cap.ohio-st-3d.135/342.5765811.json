Jensen, to issue a new sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C). Neither mandamus nor procedendo will lie to compel an act that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Culgan v. Kimbler, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 480, 2012-Ohio-3310, 974 N.E.2d 88. Porter\u2019s sentencing entry fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) and constituted a final, appealable order because it set forth the fact of his convictions, the sentence, the judge\u2019s signature, and the time stamp indicating its entry upon the journal by the clerk. <em>See State ex rel. Jones v. Ansted, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 125, 2012-Ohio-109, 961 N.E.2d 192, \u00b6 2. Notwithstanding Porter\u2019s argument to the contrary, Crim.R. 32(C) did not require Judge Jensen to specify that the sentence did not include restitution. The judge\u2019s sentencing entry contained a full resolution of the counts upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Porter was convicted. A court is not required to include in the judgment entry something not ordered as part of the sentence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACR\">Lamar Porter, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AIX\">Julia R.
