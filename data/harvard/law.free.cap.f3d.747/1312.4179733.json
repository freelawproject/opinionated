At sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>tencing, the district court calculated a base offense level of 24 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines because Travis had at least two prior convictions for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2, which defines a predicate crime of violence as any felony offense that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1, 4B1.2(a)(2). The court relied on two prior felony offenses: (1) a 2006 conviction for vehicular flight from a law enforcement officer under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1); and (2) a 2011 conviction for aggravated assault with a weapon. With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Travis\u2019 adjusted offense level of 21 and criminal history category of VI yielded a sentencing guideline range of 77 to 96 months imprisonment. Travis challenges the calculation of that sentencing range, contending that the district court erred in treating his conviction for vehicular flight as a crime of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011). For purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which specifically references the career offender guideline, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as any felony offense that \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">In determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the residual clause of the career offender guideline, we apply a categorical approach, looking \u201conly to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,\u201d and not to the \u201cparticular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.\u201d <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 202, 127 S.Ct. at 1593-94 (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Using that approach, we must decide whether the offense \u201cas it is ordinarily committed ... poses a serious potential risk of physical injury that is similar in kind and in degree to the risks posed by the enumerated crimes\u201d of burglary, extortion, arson, and those involving the use of explosives. <em>United States v. Owens, </em>672 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). The question is whether the \u201coffense is of a type that, by its nature, presents a seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>ous potential risk of injury to another,\u201d not whether \u201cevery conceivable factual offense covered by [the] statute ... necessarily present\u00eds] a serious potential risk of injury.\u201d <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 208-09, 127 S.Ct. at 1597.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">Travis was convicted under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935, which contains several subsections covering the use of a vehicle to flee or elude a police officer. Subsection (1), the specific provision under which Travis was convicted, makes it a third-degree felony \u201cfor the operator of any vehicle, having knowledge that he or she has been ordered to stop such vehicle by a duly authorized law enforcement officer, willfully to refuse or fail to stop the vehicle in compliance with such order\u201d or \u201cwillfully to flee in an attempt to elude the officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1). Subsection (2) also makes it a third-degree felony to \u201cwillfully fleet ] or attempt[ ] to elude a law enforcement officer,\u201d but only where the officer is \u201cin an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle, with agency insignia and other jurisdictional markings prominently displayed\u201d and \u201cwith siren and lights activated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 316.1935(2). Finally, subsection (3) increases the penalty associated with a violation of subsection (2) where the defendant flees \u201cat high speed\u201d or \u201cin any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 316.1935(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), and our recent decision in <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290 (11th Cir.2013), dictate the outcome of this appeal by compelling a single conclusion: vehicle flight in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of the sentencing guidelines. In <em>Sykes, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for intentional vehicle flight was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual clause of the ACCA. 131 S.Ct. at 2270-73. The defendant had been convicted under-an Indiana statute that made it a Class D felony to \u201cuse[] a vehicle\u201d to knowingly or intentionally \u201cfleet] from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2271. The Supreme Court held that a violation of that statute was categorically a violent felony under the ACCA because it presented a serious potential risk of physical injury comparable to both arson and burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 2273-74. The Court emphasized that the \u201c[r]isk of violence is <em>inherent </em>to vehicle flight,\u201d even if \u201cthe criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way,\u201d because \u201c[c]onfrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight\u201d and such confrontation \u201cplaces property and persons at serious risk of injury\u201d both during and after the pursuit. <em>Id. </em>at 2274 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">In <em>Petite, </em>we held that simple vehicle flight in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) is a violent felony under the ACCA. 703 F.3d at 1301. Finding \u201clittle meaningful distinction for ACCA purposes between Florida\u2019s simple vehicle statute and the Indiana statute of conviction in <em>Sykes,\u201d </em>and faced with the \u201cSupreme Court\u2019s detailed analysis in <em>Sykes </em>regarding the substantial risks that inhere in <em>any </em>confrontational act of intentional vehicle flight,\u201d we concluded that \u201cFlorida\u2019s offense of simple vehicle flight from a flashing patrol car presents a serious potential risk of physical injury comparable to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes of burglary and arson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300-01. Indeed, given <em>Syke\u2019s </em>emphasis on \u201cthe dangers created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>by the law enforcement response that <em>any </em>act of intentional vehicle flight provokes,\u201d we noted that \u201cthere are sound reasons to conclude ... that <em>any </em>form of intentional vehicle flight from a police officer presents powerful risks comparable to those presented by arson and burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296, 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">Travis contends that neither <em>Sykes </em>nor <em>Petite </em>compel the conclusion that vehicle flight in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) is a crime of violence because \u201cFlorida decisional law\u201d makes clear that violations of that statute, unlike violations of \u00a7 316.1935(2) or Indiana\u2019s vehicle flight statute, typically involve non-violent pursuits at low speeds over short distances. He also argues that refusing to stop a vehicle in compliance with a police officer\u2019s order to do so is far less likely \u201cto result in potential injury to others or a dangerous confrontation\u201d than when a defendant violates \u00a7 316.1935(2) by fleeing from a patrol car with its siren and lights activated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Travis\u2019 argument that violations of \u00a7 316.1935(1) are not crimes of violence because they typically do not involve high speeds or reckless driving was flatly rejected in both <em>Sykes </em>and <em>Petite. </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Sykes </em>decision made clear that vehicle flight is an inherently risky enterprise, even when it does not involve high speeds or other reckless conduct, because it can end in a violent confrontation between the offender and the police. 131 S.Ct. at 2273-74. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-6\">When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and others drivers an inherent part of the offense. Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody. A perpetrator\u2019s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent \u2014 even lethal \u2014 potential for others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2273. In reaching that conclusion, the Court did not rely on statistics specific to Indiana and how its vehicle flight statute is typically violated. Instead, it relied on the \u201ceommonsense\u201d notion that \u201cvehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2274. The Court then bolstered its \u201ccommonsense conclusion\u201d with nationwide, not state-specific, statistics concerning the risk of crashes and injuries involved in police pursuits. <em>See id. </em>(citing nationwide studies showing \u201cthat between 18% and 41% of chases involve crashes\u201d and a 2008 study showing that 313 police pursuits over a 7-year period in 30 states resulted in injuries to police and bystanders).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">Similarly, in <em>Petite </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that, because a typical offender of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) \u201cobserves all traffic requirements\u201d and \u201csimply continues to drive without pulling over for the officer,\u201d the offense does not pose a serious potential risk of injury. 703 F.3d at 1296 (quotation marks omitted). We explained that \u201ceven less-than-extreme driving on the part of an offender during the course of vehicle flight can be expected to provoke a lawful but dangerous confrontational response from the law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of events.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>Contrary to Travis\u2019 invitation for us to make the crime of violence determination based on the actual conduct involved in typical Florida prosecutions for violations of \u00a7 316.1935(1), \u201cthe proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. at 1597. The Supreme Court effectively answered that question in the affirmative when it ruled that violations of a virtually indistinguishable Indiana statute, which like \u00a7 316.1935(1) criminalized the simple act of fleeing from a police officer after being ordered to stop, present a serious potential risk of injury to others. <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2271-74. And we reaffirmed that conclusion in <em>Petite </em>by holding that simple vehicle flight under \u00a7 316.1935(2) is a violent felony for ACCA purposes because <em>\u201cany </em>form of intentional vehicle flight from a police officer presents powerful risks comparable to those presented by arson and burglary.\u201d 703 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">That \u00a7 316.1935(1), unlike \u00a7 316.1935(2), does not require that the offender flee from a marked patrol vehicle with its sirens and lights activated does not meaningfully distinguish this case from either <em>Petite </em>or <em>Sykes. </em>Our decision in <em>Petite </em>did not focus on the statutory requirement that the police officer have his sirens and lights activated, but instead, on \u201cthe dangers created by the law enforcement response that <em>any </em>act of intentional flight provokes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298. And the vehicle flight statute at issue in <em>Sykes </em>was, as we have already noted, identical in every material respect to \u00a7 316.1935(1) \u2014 both statutes require nothing more than using a vehicle to flee after an officer has ordered the driver to stop. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) (prohibiting the willful failure to stop after being ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer); Ind.Code \u00a7 35-44-3-3(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2011) (prohibiting vehicle flight \u201cfrom a law enforcement officer after the officer has ... identified himself and ordered the person to stop\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">Because Travis\u2019 prior conviction for vehicle flight under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) qualifies as a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines, we affirm his sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">. Travis, for purposes of preservation only, also argues that the residual clause of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, is unconstitutionally vague. He concedes that the argument is foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2013); <em>see also James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1598 n. 6, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (\"[W]e are not persuaded ... that the [ACCA's] residual provision is unconstitutionally vague. The statutory requirement that an unenumerated crime otherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another is not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits.\u201d) (quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1358-10\">. Because the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) provides a definition of \"violent felony\u201d that is virtually identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline, \"decisions about one apply to other.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1309 n. 6 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">. Travis requests that we \"affirm [his] conviction without prejudice to his raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\u201d in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. That request is unnecessary because a defendant may bring an ineffective-assistance claim in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding regardless of whether he could have raised it on direct appeal. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). In fact, as Travis acknowledges, we generally will not address claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>953 F.2d 1312, 1327 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
