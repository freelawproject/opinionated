Redden, Jr. (\"plaintiff\"), and ordering defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of one-hundred-fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Record evidence establishes the following: Monroe M. Redden Jr. (\"decedent\") maintained various bank accounts at First Union National Bank, including money market account number 1010044300784 (\"Account 784\") that was held only in decedent's name. In June 2000, decedent executed a Power of Attorney in favor of defendant, decedent's wife. On 16 May 2001, decedent designated defendant as the payable-on-death beneficiary (\"POD beneficiary\") of Account 784. Decedent never revoked or changed the POD beneficiary designation in favor of defendant on Account 784.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2001, decedent was admitted to the hospital for health problems that eventually led to his death on 11 January 2002. On 21 September 2001, defendant established a bank account in her name only at First Union National Bank, account number 1010052958801 (\"Account 801\"). Also on the same day, defendant used her power of attorney to transfer $237,778.71 from Account 784 to Account 801. Defendant testified in her deposition that decedent had instructed her to transfer $237,778.71 from Account 784 to Account 801 in order for defendant to proceed with office work on decedent's behalf. Defendant stated that although decedent did not reduce his instructions to writing, he communicated his intention to her verbally. Subsequently, between 21 September 2001 and decedent's death on 11 January 2002, defendant returned approximately $87,000.00 from her Account 801 to a separate account held solely in decedent's name. On the date of defendant's deposition, she stated that Account 801 had been closed since the money ran out, but she did not provide a specific date on which the account had closed or any accounting of the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 20 October 2003, the clerk of Henderson County Superior Court admitted\n   for probate decedent's Last Will and Testament. On 30 October 2003, the clerk issued letters of Administration CTA to E.K. Morley (\"the Administrator\"). On 12 February 2004, plaintiff filed a complaint on behalf of the Estate of Monroe M. Redden, Jr. against defendant. The complaint alleged that defendant had committed conversion, constructive fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with certain banking transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 16 April 2004, defendant filed her answer and counterclaim. On 4 May 2004, plaintiff filed a reply to defendant's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 20 September 2004, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment alleging that there was no genuine issue of material fact relating to the ownership of $237,778.71 taken by defendant from Account 784 on 21 September 2001. In support of the motion, plaintiff offered defendant's deposition that she transferred $237,778.71 from Account 784 to Account 801. After a hearing on the motion, on 27 June 2005, the trial court entered partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and ordered defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of $150,000.00 plus costs. Defendant appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the trial court granted only partial summary judgment, its order did not dispose of the entire case, and the appeal is interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

North Carolina General Statutes, Section 53-146.2(a)(6) provides: \"Prior to the death of the last surviving owner, no beneficiary shall have any ownership interest in a Payable on Death account.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53-146.2(a)(6) (2005). Instead, \"[f]unds in a Payable on Death account established pursuant to this subsection shall belong to the beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the death of the last surviving owner....\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53-146.2(a)(6). Accordingly, since the transfer took place while the deceased was still alive, defendant had no ownership interest in the funds in the POD account at the time that she transferred the funds.\n   <em>\n    See Jimenez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11206134\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/131/818/#p824\">\n    131 N.C.App. at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=509%20S.E.2d%20241\">\n    509 S.E.2d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the settlor of a POD account retains \"total control\" over the account with the result that \"it is fully reachable by creditors\" of the settlor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The evidence is undisputed that defendant transferred the funds into an account in which she retained sole ownership and then spent $150,778.71 of those funds. In other words, she exercised the right of ownership over the funds. It also is undisputed that defendant's power of attorney only authorized her to make gifts to herself in an amount not to exceed $10,000.00. Finally, defendant has pointed to no admissible evidence that her transfer and expenditure of the funds in excess of $10,000.00 was authorized by the deceased, the owner of the funds. Accordingly, the trial court properly entered partial summary judgment against defendant on the claim of conversion with respect to the POD account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We, however, remand for further proceedings regarding the amount of damages. The trial court's order does not explain the basis for awarding the flat amount of $150,000.00 when the evidence seems to suggest that the\n   missing amount was $778.71 greater. Further, the parties appear to agree that defendant was authorized to make a gift to herself of $10,000.00, which would seem to support damages of $140,778.71. Because the parties have not fully addressed this issue on appeal, we remand to the trial court to revisit the issue of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Judges TYSON and GEER concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
