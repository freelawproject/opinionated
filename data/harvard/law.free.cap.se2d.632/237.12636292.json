On 31 August 2001, Iredell County Department of Social Services (\"DSS\") filed a petition to remove J.T.W. from respondent mother and father, alleging a history of instability in the family. The juvenile court held an adjudication/disposition hearing on 1 November 2001, and adjudicated J.T.W. neglected. On 31 January and 2 May 2002, the court conducted review hearings. The court held a permanency planning meeting on 19 September 2002 changing the plan to one of concurrent attempts at reunification and termination of parental rights (\"TPR\") and adoption. On 19 November 2002, following another permanency planning meeting, the court changed the plan of care to TPR and adoption only. DSS and the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   jointly filed a TPR motion on 30 May 2003, seeking to terminate the rights of J.T.W.'s mother and father. Hearings were conducted 13 November 2003, 10 February and 23 March 2004, and the court terminated parental rights by order of 17 May 2004. Respondent father did not appeal, but mother appeals. As discussed below, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   DSS became involved in J.T.W.'s family in September 1998 before he was born. In August 2000, three of his older siblings were placed with relatives. On 31 August 2001, the district court held a hearing and granted guardianship of the older siblings to the relatives, and ordered DSS to take custody of J.T.W. On the same day, DSS filed a juvenile petition alleging that J.T.W. was neglected in that the child did not receive proper care, supervision or discipline and lived in an environment injurious to J.T.W. The petition further states that respondent mother had \"a long history of instability that has led to the older three children being removed[,]\" including an inability \"to establish and maintain a residence or maintain stead [sic] employment.\" On 1 November 2001, following a hearing, the juvenile court ordered that J.T.W. was neglected based upon the stipulation of respondent parents that the allegations in the petition were true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its order terminating respondent mother's parental rights, the court made findings, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   7. The Respondent Mother is presently a resident of Gaston County. She resides in a home at 501 East Third Street in Gastonia with two of her other infant children. The home is an acceptable home and has been visited by social workers from the Gaston County Department of Social Services. The mother has maintained this home since approximately May 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   8. Prior to occupying her present home, the mother was a resident of Catherine's\n   House, a residential treatment facility which assists mother with dependent children. While in residence at Catherine's House, the mother completed at least two worthwhile programs, namely the Very Important Parents Program and the Stepping Stones to Success Program. The Court will find that through her participation, the mother did benefit from learning to budget to some degree and to become more open with those who are trying to assist her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   9. Since 1999, the Respondent Mother has lived in and out of approximately 24 residences. Until the mother took residence in Gastonia, the mother had been evicted or otherwise removed from every residence she occupied in Statesville and the surrounding community since 2000. Until recently, the mother had a different employer every couple of months, a pattern which continues through the time of this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   10. The Respondent Mother has more or less been employed since her three children came into DSS custody. However, her employment, for the most part, has been sporadic in duration and almost always terminated by the mother being fired or by the mother voluntarily leaving employment after working for a short period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   11. During the pendency of this termination motion, the Respondent Mother has worked for three employers, the most recent employment being at a personal care facility where the mother works full time and earns $8.50 an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   12. The mother has never had reliable transportation throughout the time the DSS has had custody over her children. Furthermore, the mother's license has remained suspended during this time due to the mother accumulating two traffic tickets. Despite the citations being years old, the mother has yet to take any affirmative action to clear the tickets and apply with the Department of Motor Vehicles to have her license reinstated. Further, the mother has no automobile insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   13. The Respondent Mother's transportation problems have repeatedly led to the mother losing her employment and contributed to difficulties with the mother visiting her children. The mother's voluntary departure from Statesville to Gastonia in 2003 has created further difficulties for the mother in visiting her children since she has no transportation which would allow her to visit them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   14. The Respondent Mother has been physically and financially able to be gainfully employed and pay child support since the minor children came into custody. The mother was very late getting support under order, has accumulated arrearages amounting to several thousands of dollars, and has only since May 2003 has she made regular payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   15. The Respondent Mother has had no visits with any of her children who were placed in custody since December 2002. As a result, these children have no observable bond with the mother. The mother is virtually unknown to J[] in as much as he has been in care since he was an infant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   16. The respondent Mother has been incarcerated on several occasions during the minor children's stay in the custody of the DSS. On one occasion, the mother was incarcerated on a probation violation. Prior to that she had been incarcerated on a charge of failing to return rental property. On another occasion, the mother had been placed in jail after having been held in contempt related to accumulated child support arrearages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Respondent mother first argues that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights when it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because mandatory notice requirements were not met. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1106.1(b) requires that notice in pending child abuse, neglect, or dependency cases include all of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) The name of the minor juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) Notice that a written response to the motion must be filed with the clerk within 30 days after service of the motion and notice, or the parent's rights may be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (3) Notice that any attorney appointed previously to represent the parent in the\n   abuse, neglect, or dependency proceeding will continue to represent the parents unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (4) Notice that if the parent is indigent, the parent is entitled to appointed counsel and if the parent is not already represented by appointed counsel the parent may contact the clerk immediately to request counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (5) Notice that the date, time, and place of hearing will be mailed by the moving party upon filing of the response or 30 days from the date of service if no response is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (6) Notice of the purpose of the hearing and notice that the parents may attend the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1106.1(b) (2003). DSS filed notice of proceeding on both 3 September 2003 and on 10 October 2003 regarding the hearing on termination of respondent mother's parental rights. Each notice contains all of the information required by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1106.1(b), tracking the actual language used in the statute. The certificate of service attached to each notice of proceeding includes the names of all parties, including respondent mother and her counsel. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Respondent mother next argues that the trial court failed to state the proper standard of proof in its order. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"N.C.

However, there are no findings in the termination order showing that respondent mother has made no progress in correcting conditions that left J.T.W. without proper care, supervision or discipline and living in an injurious environment. Finding 7 states that respondent mother has an acceptable home which social workers had visited and which she had maintained for a number of months prior to the hearing. No finding suggests that J.T.W. would be exposed to an injurious environment with respondent mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Findings 12 and 13 touch on respondent mother's lack of transportation due to unresolved tickets and a suspended license, which has contributed to her difficulty in visiting her children. In addition, respondent mother moved from Statesville to Gastonia in 2003 to enter a residential treatment facility which assists mothers of dependent children, and that this had also contributed to her difficulty in visiting. The court found that she completed at least two \"worthwhile\" programs at the facility which will benefit her in \"learning to budget to some degree and ... become more open with those who are trying to assist her.\" Findings 10 and 11 state that respondent mother has had constant but sporadic employment during the pendency of the motion, and that she was working full-time for $8.50 per hour at the date of the hearing. Finding 14 states that respondent mother is in arrears in child support payments, but that she began making regular payments in May 2003. None of these findings touches directly on respondent mother's ability to provide her child with proper care, supervision and discipline. These findings do not support the conclusion that respondent mother failed to make reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to J.T.W.'s removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Respondent mother also argues that the trial court erred in concluding that J.T.W. was neglected. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In order to terminate parental rights, the evidence must show neglect at the time of the termination proceeding.\n   <em>\n    In re Ballard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4683935\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/311/708/#p716\">\n    311 N.C. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20S.E.2d%20227\">\n    319 S.E.2d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the trial court must admit and consider evidence, find facts, make conclusions and resolve the ultimate issue of whether neglect authorizing termination of parental rights under N.C.G.S. 7A-289.32(2) and 7A-517(21) is present at that time.

As discussed above, the findings after the hearing do not support that either of these bases existed at the time of the hearing. Conclusion 2 states that \"Clear, Cogent and Convincing evidence exists to find that the minor child has been neglected within the definition of N.C.G.S. 7B-101 and that such neglect would continue for the foreseeable future\" if J.T.W. were returned to his mother. However, the order states that J.T.W. has been in the custody of DSS since 1 November 2001. None of the court's findings indicate that neglect is likely to reoccur\n   if respondent mother regains custody, and respondent mother did not stipulate to neglect of J.T.W. as at the time of the original neglect petition.\n   <em>\n    See In re Brim,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497715\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/139/733/#p742\">\n    139 N.C.App. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=535%20S.E.2d%20367\">\n    535 S.E.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (2000) (holding that a \"prior adjudication [of neglect], standing alone, will not suffice where the natural parents have not had custody for a significant period prior to the termination hearing.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Respondent mother also argues that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights by failing to protect her rights to due process by failing to hold a timely hearing and enter a timely order.

The judge presiding at the 23 September 2003 session of juvenile court recused herself because she had prior experience with respondent parents. The court filed a written continuance, and the hearing was rescheduled for 28 October 2003. By agreement of the parties, the hearing was again continued, and the continuance was again reduced to writing as required by statute in case the new trial date fell outside the statutory timetable. The hearing actually took place on 13 November 2003, within the ninety-day continuance period. Respondent mother does not show how the scheduling of the original hearing date some 23 days outside the statutory timetable prejudiced her. Her brief merely states that \"the respondent-mother is still hopeful of having her son in her life\" and then makes a blanket statement that the delay prejudiced \"all parties.\" Because she has failed to explain how the scheduling of the hearing prejudiced her, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Respondent mother argues that the trial court erred in determining that termination is in the best interest of J.T.W. Termination of parental rights proceeding is a two-stage process: the trial court first determines whether sufficient grounds exist under N.C.

The trial court's conclusion of neglect is supported by its finding that respondent \"has had no visits with any of her children who were placed in custody since December 2002.... The mother is virtually unknown to [J.T.W.] in as much as he has been in care since he was an infant.\" This, coupled with the trial court's other findings about respondent's chronic inability to maintain regular employment, stable housing, and make reasonable progress over the course of three years, do not show, contrary to the majority's assertion, that the trial court failed to consider changed circumstances, but rather that it considered these changed conditions in light of the history of neglect and the probability of repetition of neglect if J.T.W. were returned to respondent's care. Therefore, I vote to affirm the trial court's order terminating respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
