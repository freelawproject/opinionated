For the following reasons, we find defendant's trial to be without error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show that defendant and Brandie Bullock (\"Bullock\") were involved in a romantic relationship, and Bullock believed they would get married someday, according to Christina Holder (\"Holder\"), Bullock's friend. On 30 July 2003, while riding around Raleigh with defendant and friends, Bullock received a phone call from Christopher Moore (\"Moore\"), whom she had met previously at a club, a meeting staged by Jonathan Allen (\"Allen\"). Bullock told Allen that the caller was \"the guy in the club you put me on[.]\" Allen then told defendant the caller was the person who had given Allen counterfeit money for drugs. Holder testified that defendant responded, \"m____ f____ers can't get away with getting over on him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant continued driving Bullock, Holder, Allen, and Lamont Turner (\"Turner\") around Raleigh most of the day, making multiple stops at various places. During one stop, defendant and Allen went inside an apartment, quickly returning to the vehicle. Holder then noticed a gun on the floorboard by her foot. The group next went to an apartment belonging to Paula Lucas (\"Lucas\"), where drugs were frequently bought and sold. Allen, Bullock, and defendant went into a bedroom while the rest of the group waited in the living room. Bullock soon emerged carrying a pocketbook which held the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The group returned to the vehicle, where defendant and Bullock sat in the front seat. Defendant again told Bullock, \"m____ f____ ers can't get away with doing this[.]\" Holder testified defendant instructed Bullock how to use the gun, and told Bullock to shoot Moore. Bullock responded that she knew how to use the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bullock and Moore exchanged additional telephone calls, making a plan for Moore to pick up Bullock and Holder at a McDonald's restaurant. On the way to the restaurant, defendant told Bullock, \"yo, boo, you can do this for me. Ain't nobody else can do it, you can do it.\" Defendant told Bullock, \"I[`ve] got my cell phone and I'm going to be behind you all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At McDonald's, the two girls got into the backseat of Moore's vehicle, with Bullock seated behind Moore. Moore drove them to Tysean Lunsford's (\"Lunsford\") apartment complex. Bullock and Holder saw defendant following Moore's vehicle to the apartment parking lot. As Moore began to park the vehicle, Bullock stated, \"f____ this s____,\" and shot Moore in the back of the head. Bullock and Holder then jumped out of the vehicle and ran to defendant's Suburban. Defendant drove away with Bullock and Holder, stating, \"[m]y boo did it. My boo did it.... I won't [sic] believe she did it, but my boo did it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The group drove around in search of marijuana, then went to Bullock's apartment. Bullock told the group what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   She said she \"had to do it\" because if she had thought about it, she \"would have never did [sic] it,\" so she \"just went ahead and did it.\" Defendant responded, \"my boo gangster,\" and \"my boo did it[.]\" Defendant also told the group, \"If you all want to hang around me, you all got to put in work[,]\" which Holder testified meant that they had to \"do dirt,\" meaning to commit crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The group eventually left for Lucas's apartment, dropping off Allen before arriving. Once there, defendant handed Lucas the gun and told her she would be \"going down\" for the murder. Defendant then gave the gun to Turner, who disposed of the gun by burying it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around midnight on 31 July 2003, Lunsford and a friend discovered Moore slumped over in the driver's seat of his vehicle in the parking lot of Lunsford's apartment complex. They called the police, who found the front doors of Moore's vehicle locked and the rear doors unlocked. Holder's fingerprints were lifted from the right rear passenger window. The pathologist found that Moore's death was caused by a gunshot wound to the back of the neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant cross-examined Holder regarding her testimony at an earlier trial that defendant was not the leader of the group, and that defendant did not make anyone do anything they didn't want to do. Holder testified at defendant's trial that people did what defendant told them to do \"the majority of the time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant appeals after being found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant first contends that the jury instructions were erroneous and lessened the State's burden of proof.

The judge initially instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [I]f you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that ... [defendant] knowingly instigated, encouraged, advised or procured or aided Brandie Bullock to commit the crime of first degree murder of Christopher Moore, and that in so doing [defendant]'s actions or statements caused the commission of the crime by Brandie Bullock, it would your [sic] duty to return a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. However, if you do not so find or have a reasonable doubt as to one or more of these things, it would be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty of first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After deliberations began, the jury asked the trial court for a definition of cause for element three of the charge. After hearing arguments by counsel, the trial court re-instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is generally recognized that a person is criminally responsible for a homicide only if his act caused or directly contributed to the death of the victim. In this case, where the Defendant ... is prosecuted as an aider and abetter of the crime of first degree murder, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the actions or statements of [defendant]\n   <em>\n    somehow\n   </em>\n   caused ... the victim's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Emphasis added.)

As the short form indictment properly apprised defendant of the charges against him, this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant further argues that a material variance existed between the indictment charging first degree murder and the evidence presented at trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When a variance exists between allegations in the indictment and evidence presented at trial, the defendant may be deprived of adequate notice to prepare a defense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, defendant appears to contend that evidence presented at Bullock's trial presented a theory that defendant was the shooter. We note that defendant fails to point to any evidence presented at his trial that he was the shooter. The State's evidence, regardless of the theory, supported the indictment for first degree murder, and this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant next asserts that testimony given by Bullock contained inadmissible hearsay which was erroneously admitted at trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Hearsay is generally inadmissible. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 802 (2005). \"`Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 801(c) (2005). However, out-of-court statements offered for a purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted are not hearsay and are not excluded by the hearsay rule.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Bullock then told Allen that the caller was Moore, the same person Allen had pointed out to her at a club. The State argued, and the trial court agreed, that the statement was offered only to show its effect on defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As Bullock's statement was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to show its effect on defendant, regardless of its truth, the statement was admissible. Bullock's statement affected the\n   subsequent conduct of defendant; he immediately began persuading Bullock to shoot Moore. Therefore, the trial court's admission of the statement was not error. Defendant's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant finally asserts the trial court was without jurisdiction to try defendant because the indictment was insufficient to charge first degree murder. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   the short form indictment has repeatedly been held sufficient by the North Carolina Supreme Court to charge a defendant with first degree murder, regardless of the theory under which the State proceeds.\n   <em>\n    Garcia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2986879\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/382/#p388\">\n    358 N.C. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20S.E.2d%20724\">\n    597 S.E.2d at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant acknowledges that the North Carolina Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the short form indictment, but raises the issue to preserve it in the event of further review and in anticipation of a change in the law on this issue. Defendant's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We find no error in the trial court's instructions to the jury, and no defect in the indictment for first degree murder or variance with the evidence presented at trial.
