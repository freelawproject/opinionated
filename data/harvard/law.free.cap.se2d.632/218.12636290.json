We find no prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The victim, age twenty-three, lived with his mother, stepfather, and sister in Franklinton. The victim's sister, Tiffany McFalls (\"McFalls\") testified the victim was an openly homosexual male. On 17 February 2004, the victim walked into the kitchen, where McFalls was washing dishes, and told her he was going to Durham to meet someone nick-named \"Blue\" and that \"he was going to go get some black meat tonight.\" McFalls testified she interpreted this statement to mean the victim was \"going to Durham to have sex with a black person.\" The victim told McFalls he had communicated with \"Blue\" through his cellular telephone, which contained internet access, was going to \"check on some things at work,\" and would be back home \"in a little bit.\" The victim left home driving his mother's 1998 burgundy Ford Contour automobile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McFalls became concerned after she was unable to contact the victim and he did not return home by 5:00 p.m. The victim's family reported him as a missing person on 20 February 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 21 February 2004, Durham police and paramedics responded to a report of a dead body floating in the river at Old Farm Park in Durham. The body was found face down approximately twenty feet below the river embankment. The body was identified as the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 22 February 2004, Durham police were dispatched to 614 Shepard Street where they found a 1998 burgundy Ford Contour belonging to the victim's mother partially burned and still smoldering. Investigators recovered a broken beaded necklace belonging to the victim from the floorboard of the car. Investigators determined the fire had been intentionally set with a lit newspaper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 4 March 2004, Durham police executed a search warrant of defendant's residence. Shelton Epps (\"Epps\") and Derrick Maiden (\"Maiden\") were present at defendant's residence. Defendant was at school when police\n   executed the warrant. Defendant agreed to go to the police station, where he gave a statement to Detective Wallace Early (\"Detective Early\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    A. Defendant's Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant told Detective Early that he came home early from school on 17 February 2004 because he had an upset stomach. Epps and Maiden were present at defendant's residence. Maiden asked defendant if he could use his cellular telephone. Maiden told defendant that someone was coming over. About thirty minutes later, the victim called defendant on his cellular telephone. Defendant told the victim that he did not know him, and handed the telephone to Maiden. Maiden told defendant, \"let's go to the clubhouse.\" Defendant accompanied Epps and Maiden to the Eno Trace Clubhouse. The victim had parked the burgundy Ford Contour automobile in the parking lot when defendant, Epps, and Maiden arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The victim drove defendant, Epps, and Maiden to Old Farm Park. All four men exited the car and began walking toward a picnic table. Defendant stated he was walking in front and the other three men were behind him. Defendant heard a gunshot, turned around, and saw Epps chasing the victim across the park with a gun in his hand. Epps wrestled the victim to the ground, and Maiden and Epps began to punch and kick the victim. Epps put the gun to the back of the victim's head and shot him again. Either Epps or Maiden choked the victim. Epps and Maiden dragged the victim to the river and threw him in. Maiden drove the victim's car away from the scene with defendant and Epps as passengers, and dropped defendant off at his residence. The next day at school, Maiden told defendant a \"boot\" had been placed on the car. Maiden gave money to Jimetrus Harris (\"Jimetrus\") to pay the fine to have the boot removed. Maiden drove defendant home after school in the victim's mother's burgundy Ford Contour. After defendant gave his statement, Detective Early spoke with two other detectives and placed defendant under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, and robbery with a dangerous weapon. Defendant was tried in the Durham County Superior Court in July 2005. Defendant was seventeen years of age at the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Murder Weapon\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Derek Taylor (\"Taylor\") testified for the State that he had known defendant for a couple of months before February 2004. Taylor knew defendant by the name \"Blue.\" During that time, Taylor saw defendant in possession of a handgun on four or five occasions. Taylor later bought that gun from a man named \"Wood\" for $132.00. After the victim's murder, Taylor had a conversation with \"Wood\" and turned the gun over to police. State Bureau of Investigation Forensic Firearms Examiner Adam Tanner (\"Examiner Tanner\") testified he identified the gun as a .32 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. Examiner Tanner opined the bullets recovered from the victim's body were fired from \"this firearm and this firearm alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jury found defendant to be guilty of all three charges. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder under the Felony Murder Rule rather than on the basis of malice, premeditation, and deliberation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court arrested judgment on defendant's robbery conviction. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the first-degree murder conviction and a consecutive sentence of seventy-three to ninety-seven months for the kidnapping conviction. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motion to allow an interview with the police investigator; (2) overruling his objection to McFalls's hearsay testimony regarding what the victim said to her on 17 February 2004; (3) denying his motion to suppress evidence gathered in the search of his residence where probable cause did not support the issuance of the search warrant; (4) overruling his objection to testimony regarding the existence of a cellular telephone and photographic images contained therein where such cellular telephone was taken from him without issuance of a search warrant;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (5) overruling his objection to allowing written statements to be published to the jury which were inconsistent with Jimetrus's and his sister, Andrea Harris's, (\"Andrea\") testimonies in court; (6) denying him the opportunity to review and use school records to impeach Maiden; (7) overruling his objection to the admission of certain autopsy photographs; (8) overruling his objection to speculative testimony by Dr. Gulledge regarding how long it would have taken the victim to die as a result of his injuries; (9) overruling his objection to testimony by surprise witness Michael Woods (\"Woods\"); (10) overruling his objection to admission of State's Exhibits 87 and 88, transcripts of cellular telephone text messages; (11) denying his motion to dismiss at the close of all evidence; (12) denying his motion to vacate the jury's verdict due to insufficient evidence; and (13) imposing a sentence of life in prison without parole in violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    III. Interview with the Police Investigator\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to allow an interview with the police investigator. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defense counsel requested a meeting with Detective Early, the lead police investigator. Detective Early refused to meet with defense counsel. Defense counsel moved the trial court to allow an interview with Detective Early and the trial court denied defendant's motion. The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its order denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court's findings of fact state that Detective Early did not want to and was told by his supervisors that he was not required to meet with defense counsel. Detective Early knew that it was the \"unofficial policy\" of the Durham Police Department for an officer to refrain from talking with defense counsel. The trial court found that Detective Early was never advised he was prohibited from meeting with defense counsel by anyone with the Durham County District Attorney's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant did not assign error to any of the trial court's findings of fact. \"Where no exception is taken to a finding of fact by the trial court, the finding is presumed to be supported by competent evidence and is binding on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Koufman v. Koufman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2510111\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/330/93/#p97\">\n    330 N.C. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20S.E.2d%20729\">\n    408 S.E.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (1991) (citations omitted). The trial court concluded, \"no attorney with the Durham County District Attorney's Office has obstructed the Defendant's attempts to conduct an interview with W.L. Early,\" and that \"W.L. Early's refusal to meet with Defendant's attorneys was not the product of any improper directive by anyone with the Durham County District Attorney's Office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant bases his argument on N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(1) (2005), which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) Upon motion of the defendant, the court must order the State to:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) Make available to the defendant the complete files of all law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies involved in the investigation of the crimes committed or the prosecution of the defendant. The term \"file\" includes the defendant's statements, the codefendants' statements, witness statements, investigating officers' notes, results of tests and examinations, or any other matter or evidence obtained during the investigation of the offenses alleged to have been committed by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant claims \"the spirit if not the letter\" of this statute entitles his counsel to interview Detective Early \"for purposes of clarifying discovery material provided by the State.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Our Supreme Court held, \"[t]here is no general constitutional or common law right to discovery in criminal cases.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior to the 2004 amendment of N.C. Gen.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   McFalls testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Q: Tiffany, that morning or that afternoon when you were talking with Sean, what did he tell you?

Evidence of Defendant's Cellular Telephone\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding the existence of his cellular telephone and photographic images contained therein, because the cellular telephone was taken from him without issuance of a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The police took a cellular telephone capable of taking photographs from defendant at the police station on 4 March 2004. This telephone was not the same cellular telephone the text messages were sent to and received from the victim. Sergeant David Rose testified on\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   that stored images of two guns were recovered from the cellular telephone. Defendant moved to suppress this evidence on the grounds the cellular telephone had been impermissibly seized from him. The trial court ordered the State not to present the contents of the photographic images stored within the cellular telephone to the jury unless the State could show the cellular telephone was properly seized from defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   No evidence was presented to the jury regarding the contents of the photographic images stored on the cellular telephone. The only evidence presented to the jury was that defendant possessed a cellular telephone with photographic images stored within upon his arrest. The jury did not see the photographic images or hear evidence regarding their contents. Presuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   the cellular telephone was improperly seized, defendant has failed to demonstrate any prejudice.

Jimetrus and defendant were teammates on the high school football team. Jimetrus drove defendant home from school occasionally. On 18 February 2004, defendant told Jimetrus a \"boot\" had been placed on his car in the school parking lot. Jimetrus did not know what car defendant was talking about. Jimetrus told defendant that he would have to go to the school office and pay $25.00 to have the boot removed. Defendant and Jimetrus went to the school office together. Defendant gave Jimetrus $25.00 and asked him\n   to pay to have the boot removed because he did not have his driver's license with him. Jimetrus paid the fine and the boot was removed. Defendant then asked Jimetrus to retrieve the car for him. The car was parked behind the school cafeteria in a lot restricted to students. Jimetrus drove the vehicle, a 1998 burgundy Ford Contour, to the front of the school where he met defendant. On a prior occasion, defendant had told Jimetrus that he owned a gun. Andrea testified that she knew defendant by the nickname \"Blue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant failed to object when the prior written statements were offered or admitted into evidence. Defendant did object when the State sought to publish the statements to the jury. The trial court noted that defendant's objection was \"a little late\" because defendant failed to object upon their admission into evidence. The trial court overruled defendant's objection to the statements being published to the jury. The trial court instructed the jury that the statements were admitted solely to corroborate the witnesses' in court testimonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"In order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context.\" N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (2006).

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Maiden was also charged with first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and first-degree kidnapping in connection with the victim's death. The State offered Maiden a plea bargain for second degree murder. Maiden testified for the State at defendant's trial under a plea agreement in exchange for truthful testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    A. Maiden's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In February 2004, Maiden was a tenth grade student at Northern High School. Maiden had been friends with defendant, whom he called \"Blue,\" since Maiden was ten years old. Maiden was also friends with Epps, who resided in defendant's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On 17 February 2004, Maiden and defendant left school early due to snow and went to defendant's house. Epps was present at defendant's house and played video games with Maiden. Defendant went outside the house speaking on his cellular telephone. Defendant reentered his home and told Maiden and Epps \"the whip was on the way.\" Maiden testified that \"whip\" meant car. Maiden, Epps, and defendant left defendant's house to meet the victim at the clubhouse. Defendant went back inside the house, returned with a gun, and handed it to Epps. Defendant and Epps discussed who would carry the gun. Maiden testified Epps carried the gun, but defendant stated \"he would shoot him if the guy resisted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The three men entered the victim's car upon arrival at the clubhouse. Defendant sat in the front passenger's seat. The victim drove to a Donut King and then to the store to buy a cigar to use to roll marijuana. Defendant possessed marijuana in a plastic bag. The victim drove defendant, Maiden, and Epps back to the park at approximately 1:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   According to Maiden, the four men exited the victim's car and began walking towards a park bench. Epps shot the victim in the back of the head. The victim began running and stated, \"please don't do this to me.\" Defendant and Epps chased after the victim and wrestled him to the ground. The victim got up and ran towards his car. As the victim attempted to enter his car, defendant hit him again. Epps tried to shoot the victim\n   a second time. Epps handed Maiden the gun, and Maiden handed the gun to defendant. Defendant handed the gun back to Epps. Maiden testified that \"somewhere along the line\" the victim was shot a second time. After the victim fell to the ground, Epps began choking the victim, saying \"he won't die.\" Epps stomped the victim in the head. After these incidents, Maiden testified he \"thought [the victim] was dead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendant and Maiden carried the victim to the river bank. Epps kicked the victim into the river. The three men reentered the victim's mother's car. Epps pulled the car over to wash the victim's blood off of him with snow. Defendant, Maiden, and Epps drove around for an hour or two smoking marijuana before returning to defendant's house. Defendant drove the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant drove Maiden to school the following day in the victim's car. Defendant did not want to pay for a parking pass and parked the car behind the cafeteria. Epps gave Maiden a pair of boots from the victim's car. Maiden was wearing the victim's boots when he was arrested on 4 March 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On 19 February 2004, Epps sprayed lighter fluid into the car and set in on fire. Defendant, Maiden, and Epps had wiped the car down with Clorox the night before. Maiden testified the plan on 17 February 2004 was to steal the victim's car. He also testified that defendant had tried unsuccessfully about a month or two earlier to contact someone on a chat line and steal that person's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    B.

The State contacted Woods, who had retrieved the text messages. The State notified the court and defendant of its intention to call Woods as a witness. Woods was present to testify in court \"with less than an hour's notice.\" Defendant objected on the grounds that Woods was not included on the State's witness list.

Detective Early was not required to submit to an interview against his wishes by defense counsel prior to trial.\n   <em>\n    Phillips,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2538877\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/328/1/#p12\">\n    328 N.C. at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=399%20S.E.2d%20293\">\n    399 S.E.2d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(1). The trial court properly admitted hearsay testimony from McFalls regarding what her brother, the victim, stated to her on 17 February 2004 pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. 8C-1, Rule 803(3). The trial court properly concluded the search warrant of defendant's residence was supported by probable cause, and properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the items seized from his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Defendant has failed to show he was prejudiced by the admission of testimony regarding the existence of his cellular telephone containing images of two guns where the contents of those images were not revealed to the jury. Defendant failed to properly preserve his argument regarding the admission into evidence of Jimetrus and Andrea Harris' prior statements. Defendant failed to object when the statements were admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   After review of Maiden's sealed school records, we hold they neither contain information favorable and material to defendant's guilt and punishment, nor evidence adversely affecting Maiden's credibility as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in: (1) admitting the autopsy photographs of the victim; (2) allowing Dr. Gulledge's testimony regarding how long it would have taken the victim to die as a result of his injuries; (3) admitting printouts of the text messages sent to and received from the victim's cellular telephone; and (4) allowing Woods to testify as a \"surprise\" witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendant's eleventh and twelfth assignments of error regarding his motion to dismiss and motion to vacate the jury's verdict are deemed abandoned. Although defendant failed to object or properly preserve the trial court's imposition of a life in prison without parole sentence, his arguments reveal no errors in his sentence. Defendant received a\n   fair trial free from prejudicial errors he preserved, assigned, and argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   No prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
