Murphy, M.D., Hemantkumar Patel, M.D., Praful N. Patel, M.D., and J. Robinson Harper, Jr., M.D., collectively (\"plaintiffs\"), appeal from a declaratory judgment of the trial court, determining a covenant not to compete and a liquidated damages provision were enforceable in an employment agreement between plaintiffs and WHA Medical Clinic, PLLC (\"WHA\"). We affirm in part and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court made,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1. [WHA] is a multi-specialty medical group of approximately 60 physicians who provide both primary and specialty care in southeastern North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2. [Plaintiffs] are physicians licensed to practice medicine by the State of North Carolina and are board-certified in cardiology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3. WHA was formed in 1996 as the successor to Wilmington Health Associates, P.A. (\"Wilmington Health\"). Prior to 1996, many of the physicians who work for WHA were owners or employees of Wilmington Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   4. Harper joined Wilmington Health as an employee physician in July 1990 and became a shareholder in August 1993. Calhoun joined Wilmington Health in January 1992 and became a shareholder in January 1994. P. Patel joined Wilmington Health in December 1994 and became a member of WHA in December 1996. Harper, Calhoun, and P. Patel shall be collectively referred to as \"Member Plaintiffs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   5. At the time the Member Plaintiffs joined Wilmington Health, their employment agreements included restrictive covenants with liquidated damages provisions that enabled the employee-physician to stay and compete through payment of a fixed sum designed to compensate Wilmington Health for its investment in the physician and the expenses associated with the physician's departure. When Harper and P. Patel originally joined Wilmington Health prior to 1996, they signed such covenants without objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   6. The benefits of joining an established practice such as Wilmington Health included a guaranteed salary and benefits package, an established patient and referral base, association with well-regarded physicians, staff, facilities, and equipment, licensing and credentialing support, billing, administrative[,] and financial administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   8. In August 1996, Wilmington Health and\n   <em>\n    Phycor Inc.,\n   </em>\n   a Tennessee physician practice management company, entered into an agreement to sell the assets of Wilmington Health to\n   <em>\n    PhyCor Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\"Asset Purchase Agreement\"). The Asset Purchase Agreement also required WHA, the newly formed entity that employed the physicians formerly employed by Wilmington Health, to enter into a service agreement with\n   <em>\n    PhyCor of Wilmington,\n   </em>\n   a subsidiary of\n   <em>\n    PhyCor Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\"Service Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   9. Simultaneous with the sale of assets, on August 1, 1996, Harper and Calhoun executed individual Payback Agreements, which were separate and distinct from the employment agreements at issue in this case. Pursuant to the Payback Agreements, Harper and Calhoun agreed to return all or a portion of their\n   <em>\n    PhyCor\n   </em>\n   payouts if they did not remain with WHA for a period of 4 years commencing August 1, 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   10. To protect\n   <em>\n    PhyCor's\n   </em>\n   investment in the tangible and intangible assets of Wilmington Health, the Service Agreement required WHA to obtain and enforce restrictive covenants from current and future physician members and employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   11. The Asset Purchase and Service Agreements further provided that, if an individual physician chose not to enter into the new contracts containing restrictive covenants, the compensation to WHA would be reduced and that individual physician would not receive any share of the\n   <em>\n    PhyCor\n   </em>\n   proceeds. At least one physician, Lowell Shinn, chose not to sign the new contract. Dr. Shinn did not receive a payout and the compensation to WHA was proportionately reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   12. On August 1, 1996, Calhoun and Harper executed a Member Physician Services Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of their employment with WHA. A First Amendment to Member Physician Services Agreement was executed on March 25, 1999. 13. In part, Paragraph 13 of the Member Physician Services Agreements provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    13. Covenant Not to Compete\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    13.1 Physician agrees that during the term of this Agreement and for a period of eighteen (18) months following the termination of employment of Physician with the Company, Physician will not Compete with the Company, as defined below, or employ or solicit the employment of any Restricted Employee, as defined below.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    13.2 For purposes of this restrictive covenant, the following definitions apply:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    B. \"Restricted Employee\" means any person that was an employee of the Company at any time during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the termination of employment of Physician with the Company.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    C. \"Restricted Territory\" means ... New Hanover, Pender, Brunswick, Onslow, Duplin, Bladen and Columbus Counties if Physician is a subspecialist or other non-primary care physician.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    13.4 Physician agrees that a breach by Physician of this restrictive covenant would cause irreparable damage to the Company and that, in the event of a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    breach or threatened breach by Physician, the Company shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining Physician from breaching or continuing to breach this restrictive covenant.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    13.8 In the event the Physician desires to practice in violation of this restrictive covenant, Physician shall have the option of paying to the Company the following liquidated damages in advance of practicing in violation of the covenant. Physician shall pay to the Company as liquidated damages an amount equal to the greater of (i) Physician's \"average annual income\" as shown on the W-2 or K-1 forms prepared by Wilmington Health Associates, P.A. (\"WHA\") or the Company for the two most recent years preceding termination of Physician's employment, or (ii) Physician's share of the total gross proceeds payable to WHA pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement between WHA and PhyCor of Wilmington, Inc. (\"PhyCor\"), including the amount of any liabilities of WHA assumed by PhyCor pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, and Physician's share of sums payable to the Company pursuant to Article 12 of the Service Agreement.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   14. The liquidated damages provision ensured that physicians who profited from the\n   <em>\n    PhyCor\n   </em>\n   transaction were required to repay, at a minimum, the amount of gross proceeds they received under the Asset Purchase and Service Agreements, should they depart and compete with WHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   15. Such liquidated damages provisions were included because the damage caused by the departure and subsequent immediate competition by physicians depends upon several factors and is difficult to determine in advance. A departing physician's prior net contribution to corporate overhead, the volume of patients and patient revenues lost to the departing physician's new practice, the length of time and cost associated with recruiting replacement physicians, the time it takes a new replacement physician to become a fully productive contributor to the group, and the ability of the remaining physicians in the group to assume the care of patients who wish to remain with the group all affect the extent of WHA's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   17. Each Member Plaintiff had a choice: Either agree to the new contract and receive a payout, or, not agree to the new contract and consequently forego said payout....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   18. Plaintiffs Harper, Calhoun, and P. Patel chose to sign the new contract with the restrictive covenants and subsequently received the following individual payouts: Harper received $287,350, Calhoun received $267,171, and P. Patel received $245,730[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   20. In December of 1999, WHA hired plaintiff H. Patel, an electrophysiology cardiologist. On December 29, 1999, H. Patel executed an Employee Physician Services Agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions of his employment with WHA. H. Patel began practice at WHA as an employee physician in the summer of 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   21. Also in late 1999, WHA hired plaintiff Murphy. On November 23, 1999, Murphy executed an Employee Physician Services Agreement that set forth the terms and conditions of his employment with WHA. Murphy began practice at WHA as an employee-physician in 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   22. Paragraph 17 of the Employee Physician Services Agreement is titled \"Restrictive Covenant\" and is identical to Paragraph 13 of the Member Physician Services Agreements (the Employee Physician Services Agreements and Member Physician Services Agreements will be collectively referred to as \"Employment Agreements\"). H. Patel's and Murphy's employment agreements contained the same provisions regarding hiring of \"restricted employees\" and confidentiality as the Member Physician Services Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   23. In addition, Paragraph 14 of Murphy's and H. Patel's Employee Physician Services Agreements, titled \"Compliance with Rules and Regulations,\" provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Physician shall comply with all rules and regulations as may be established and modified by the Managers of Company from time to time pertaining the business and medical practice of Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Physician and Company shall be obligated to follow all requirements of local, state, and federal laws and regulations relating to the practice of medicine and treatment of patients and no provision of this Agreement shall be enforceable by Company or Physician or any court of competent jurisdiction where local, state or federal laws and regulations and/or the AMA Code of Professional Ethics prohibits and/or discourages the conduct described in or intent of the provision(s) sought to be enforced.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   24. Diane Atkinson, the Executive Director of WHA, testified that the above provision was included in WHA's employee physician agreements to assuage concerns of potential physician candidates that WHA's contracts gave WHA the power to direct physicians to take unnecessary medical measures. She indicated that this provision was not intended to absolve the restrictive covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   25. At the time Murphy and H. Patel executed their Employee Physician Services Agreements and at the time of their departure from WHA, Policy E-9.02 of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics provided:\n   <em>\n    Covenants-not-to-compete restrict competition, disrupt continuity of care, and potentially deprive the public of medical services. The (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs discourages any agreement which restricts the right of a physician to practice medicine for a specified period of time or in a specified area upon termination of employment, partnership or corporate agreement.\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Restrictive covenants are unethical if they are excessive in geographic scope or duration in the circumstances presented, or if they fail to make reasonable accommodation of patients' choice of physician.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   28. WHA serves patients from each of the 7 counties reflected in the restrictive covenants, and the Plaintiffs treated patients from all 7 counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   29. Plaintiffs are all intelligent, well-educated adults who freely and voluntarily entered into their respective Member Physician Services and/or Employment Agreements with WHA....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   30. In the fall of 2000, WHA negotiated a termination of its relationship with\n   <em>\n    PhyCor\n   </em>\n   and agreed to pay over $8 million to repurchase the rights that\n   <em>\n    PhyCor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    PhyCor of Wilmington\n   </em>\n   had acquired under the Asset Purchase and Service Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   32. In the summer of 2001, Plaintiffs began meeting to discuss forming a separate cardiology practice in New Hanover County, North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   35. [A\n   <em>\n    pro forma\n   </em>\n   conducted by a certified public accountant] projected that each Plaintiff could earn approximately one million dollars in their first full year of practice, substantially more than they were earning at WHA. [The accountant] also provided Plaintiffs with an analysis of the after-tax cost of the liquidated damages that the Plaintiffs would owe WHA under Plaintiffs' employment agreement. This analysis showed that the projected increase in the Plaintiffs' earnings would be several times more than required to pay their liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   36. On December 3, 2001, Harper met with the remaining WHA cardiologists and WHA's president. The purpose of this meeting was for Harper to inform WHA of Plaintiffs' decision to consider leaving WHA. Plaintiffs had originally planned to meet on the evening of January 8, 2002 and then proceed with terminating their employment with WHA.... WHA terminated Harper on January 8, the day before he planned to resign. On January 10, 2002, Calhoun, P. Patel, H. Patel, and Murphy all submitted their ninety-day resignation notice to WHA as required by their respective Employment Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   37. On or about January 10, 2002, the Plaintiffs executed Articles of Organization for their new practice and shortly thereafter executed an Operating Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Also, on or about January 10, 2002, the Plaintiffs executed a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" for their new practice. Said document includes a covenant that requires any doctor who leaves the practice before April 1, 2005, to continue to pay his or her proportionate share of the expenses through that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   39. On or about April 10, 2002, the Plaintiffs opened their cardiology practice in New Hanover County, North Carolina under the name Wilmington Cardiology, PLLC. Without dispute, the Plaintiffs provide physician services in the \"Restricted Territory\" as defined in their respective agreements with WHA. Plaintiffs have never paid WHA, nor offered to pay WHA, any amount so that the Plaintiffs may compete without violating their Agreements with WHA. However, in response to Judge Jones's April 18, 2002 order, the Plaintiffs have posted a bond in the amount of liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   40. Plaintiffs Calhoun, H. Patel, and P. Patel testified at the hearing that they had no plans to leave the area and, if the covenant not to compete was determined to be enforceable, they were prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure continued presence in the medical community and continued treatment of patients, even if that meant paying the liquidated damages agreed to in their contracts with WHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   41. As required by the April 18, 2002 order, Plaintiffs posted a Letter of Credit with the Clerk of Superior Court of New Hanover County in the amount of One Million Five Hundred Fifty-Nine Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($1,559,767.00). As a result, Plaintiffs demonstrated the ability to pay the liquidated damages set forth in the restrictive covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   43. Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate they were unable to pay liquidated damages or that they would leave Wilmington or otherwise cease practicing if they are required to pay the liquidated damages set forth in their respective agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   51. In general, the Plaintiffs comprise a collection of uniquely qualified and talented and skilled physicians. Without dispute, the Plaintiffs provide valuable medical services to a substantial patient base in the \"Restricted Area.\" The Court acknowledges that a Doctor-Patient relationship is a relationship of trust and is developed over time and that patients can be adversely affected if this relationship is disrupted. The Court also acknowledges that a patient's right to choose his own doctor is especially important to the quality of healthcare provided. Patients should have the right to continuity of healthcare by a doctor of their own choosing. Categorically preventing the Plaintiffs from practicing medicine in the \"Restricted Area\" would cause a substantial health risk to actual and prospective patients in need of the Plaintiffs' services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   52. However, in this case, the Plaintiffs were provided with a simple choice: Pay the liquidated damages and practice in the \"Restricted Area;\" or, practice in violation of the terms of their respective employment contracts and subject themselves to litigation. The Plaintiffs chose the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   53. The liquidated damages set forth in Plaintiff's agreement are conservative compared to the actual damages WHA had already sustained after 12 months of the 18 month restricted period. In the first 12 months since Plaintiffs left WHA to open their competing practice, WHA's cardiology department suffered a decrease in gross professional and ancillary charges of $7.7 million, equating to a $2.9 million decrease in net revenues. Using the departing cardiologists' past net contribution to corporate overhead of 51.6 percent of net collections, the net loss to WHA for this 12-month period alone approximates $1,520,483. Despite aggressive recruiting, it took WHA approximately six months to recruit two replacement cardiologists. As of the trial date, WHA had already expended $128,795 in efforts to recruit replacement cardiologists. Thus, the net losses in the 12-month period from Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   departure to the time of trial alone exceed $1,641,278 compared to liquidated damages of $1,587,157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   57. The amounts stipulated in Plaintiffs' respective agreements as liquidated damages were a reasonable estimate of the damages that would probably be caused by a breach of their covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   59. The amounts stipulated in Plaintiffs' respective agreements as liquidated damages are reasonably proportionate to the damages which have actually been caused by Plaintiffs' breach of their respective covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Based on these and other related findings, the trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   2. Plaintiffs' agreements allow them to practice in the \"Restricted Area\" upon payment of specified liquidated damages and therefore said agreements are not subject to strict scrutiny as to reasonableness and public policy. Nevertheless, said agreements survive a strict scrutiny examination as to reasonableness and public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   3. Plaintiffs' agreements are each based on valuable consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   4. The enforcement of the liquidated damages provisions in the agreements between Plaintiffs and WHA create no substantial question of potential harm to the public health and consequently said agreements are not void as against public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   5. The restrictive covenants contained in the agreements between Plaintiffs and WHA are reasonable as to time and territory restrictions and are based on a legitimate business purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   6. The liquidated damages provisions and restrictive covenants contained in the employment agreements of Plaintiffs Murphy and H. Patel are enforceable notwithstanding Policy E-9.02 of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   7. The liquidated damages set forth in each of the Plaintiffs' employment agreements with WHA are reasonable in amount and do not constitute a penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   8. Each Plaintiff has breached [his or her] respective agreements with WHA by competing with WHA in the restricted area within 18 months of the termination of [his or her] employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   10. Plaintiffs are obligated to pay the liquidated damages set forth in their respective employment agreements with WHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   11. Section 6-21.2 of the North Carolina General Statutes allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees for the failure of Plaintiffs to pay their liquidated damages upon demand from Defendant. In the Court's discretion, the Court determines that the Defendant is entitled to an award of attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I. Right to Trial by Jury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We initially address plaintiffs' argument that the trial court erred in dismissing the jury and serving as the finder of fact because plaintiffs had a statutory right to trial by jury on all issues of fact. Plaintiffs instituted this action pursuant to the North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-253,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2005). The Declaratory Judgment Act states, \"When a proceeding under this Article involves the determination of an issue of fact, such issue may be determined in the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in which the proceeding is pending.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-261 (2005). This Court has held, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the trial court may determine only questions of law absent a waiver of jury trial.\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Hall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8551511\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/35/664/#p665\">\n    35 N.C.App. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 665,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20S.E.2d%20170\">\n    242 S.E.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (1978). The only factual determination of the trial court that plaintiffs challenge in this portion of their brief is that the trial court \"made the decisive Findings of Fact on the public policy issue.\" However, \"[s]ince the determinative question is one of public policy, the reasonableness and validity of the contract is a question for the court and not for the jury, to be determined from the contract itself and admitted or proven facts relevant to the decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Kadis v. Britt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8596759\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/224/154/#p158\">\n    224 N.C. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20S.E.2d%20543\">\n    29 S.E.2d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545 (1944).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also Farr Assocs. v.

Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing the jury, and this assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   II. Valuable consideration\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the trial court erred in concluding that the agreements of Calhoun and Harper were based on valuable consideration. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Our standard of review of a declaratory judgment is the same as in other cases. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-258 (2005). Accordingly, in a declaratory judgment action where the trial court decides questions of fact, we review the challenged findings of fact and determine whether they are supported by competent evidence.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v.

Patel's and Murphy's employment contract stated, \"no provision of this Agreement shall be enforceable by Company or Physician or any court of competent jurisdiction where local, state or federal laws and regulations and/or\n   <em>\n    the AMA Code of Professional Ethics prohibits and/or discourages the conduct described in or intent of the provision(s) sought to be enforced.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added). The trial court made findings that relate to the provision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   24. Diane Atkinson, the Executive Director of WHA, testified that the above provision was included in WHA's employee physician agreements to assuage concerns of potential physician candidates that WHA's contracts gave WHA the power to direct physicians to take unnecessary medical measures. She indicated that this provision was not intended to absolve the restrictive covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   25. At the time Murphy and H. Patel executed their Employee Physician Services Agreements and at the time of their departure from WHA, Policy E-9.02 of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics provided: Covenants-not-to-compete restrict competition, disrupt continuity of care, and potentially deprive the public of medical services. The (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs discourages any agreement which restricts the right of a physician to practice medicine for a specified period of time or in a specified area upon termination of employment, partnership or corporate agreement. Restrictive covenants are unethical\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they are\n   <em>\n    excessive\n   </em>\n   in geographic scope or duration in the circumstances presented, or\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they fail to make\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   accommodation of patients' choice of physician. (Emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of the purpose behind including Paragraph 14 in the employment contract. The related assignment of error states, \"The Court's Finding of Fact No. 24 in the Order and Final Judgment pertaining to Defendant-Appellee's alleged purpose or intent for including Paragraph 14 in the employment agreements of Drs. Murphy and H. Patel, on the grounds such finding is irrelevant and contrary to the law.\" In their brief, plaintiffs do not argue that testimony relating to the purpose of Paragraph 14 was irrelevant but rather that the testimony was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule and could not be used to interpret an unambiguous\n   provision of the contract. Since plaintiffs have failed to argue their portion of the assignment of error that stated the testimony was irrelevant, this portion of the assignment of error is abandoned pursuant to N.C. R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiffs have also failed to preserve the portion of their assignment of error that stated finding 24 is \"contrary to the law.\" North Carolina Rule of Appellate Procedure 10 states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (a) ...

Finding 24 establishes that Paragraph 14 \"was not intended to absolve the restrictive covenant.\" Since this finding addresses the issue of the intent behind the provision and is binding on appeal, it supports the trial court's conclusion that \"[t]he ... restrictive covenants contained in the employment agreements of\n   Plaintiffs Murphy and H. Patel are enforceable notwithstanding Policy E-9.02 of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics.\" Accordingly, given that plaintiffs did not assign error based on the trial court's failure to determine this issue as a matter of law, we do not address this issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See Viar, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   V. Counsel Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the trial court erred in awarding counsel fees to WHA because there is no statutory authority supporting an award of counsel fees on these facts. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the General Assembly intended N.C.
