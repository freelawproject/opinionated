(\"Terra-Mulch\"), and Profile Products, L.L.C. (\"Profile\"), and Electric Service Group, Inc.(\"ESG\"), for personal injuries sustained in a workplace accident. All defendants moved for summary judgment on grounds that plaintiffs could not satisfy the legal standard required to overcome the protections of Chapter 97 of the North Carolina General Statutes which limit plaintiffs' remedy to worker's compensation benefits. Following a hearing, the court granted summary judgment to Hoffman and Terra-Mulch, but denied same to Profile and ESG. Profile appeals. On 22 November 2005, Profile filed a petition for writ of certiorari. On 5 December, plaintiffs moved to dismiss this appeal as interlocutory. On 6 December 2005, plaintiffs filed a second motion to dismiss on the same grounds. For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lennie Hamby (\"Hamby\") worked as a dump truck operator for Terra-Mulch at its plant in Conover. Dump trucks delivered wood chips to the plant and dumped them whereupon they were poured into a pit containing two large augers. A 42\" guardrail separated the pit from a raised dock where Hamby stood to operate the truck. Hamby stepped around the guardrail and in trying to descend from the dock and fell into the pit. A co-worker testified that he tried to stop the augers, but the first emergency stop button was inoperable. Before the co-worker could reach another stop mechanism, the augers injured Hamby, causing the loss of part his left leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Profile appeals from a partial denial of summary judgment. \"Ordinarily, a partial summary judgment, because it does not completely dispose of the case, is interlocutory, and cannot be immediately appealed.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe v.

In such cases, third-party claims are permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Profile is a limited liability company and also the sole member-manager of Terra-Mulch. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-30(a) provides that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A person who is\n   <em>\n    a member, manager, director, executive, or any combination thereof of a limited liability company is not liable for the obligations of a limited liability company solely by reason of being a member, manager,\n   </em>\n   director, or executive and does not become so by participating, in whatever capacity, in the management or control of the business.\n   <em>\n    A member, manager, director, or executive\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    may, however, become personally liable by reason of that person's own acts or conduct.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-30(a) (emphasis supplied) (2006). Thus, while Profile cannot be held liable simply because it is the member-manager of Terra-Mulch, it could be personally liable for its own tortious conduct. The dissent cites N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-23, captioned \"Agency powers of managers\" as providing support for the contention that a member-manager is covered by the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. This statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Every manager is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its business, and the act of every manager, including execution in the name of the limited liability company of any instrument, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the limited liability company of which he is a manager, binds the limited liability company, unless the manager so acting has in fact no authority to act for the limited liability company in the particular matter and the person with whom the manager is dealing has knowledge of the fact that the manager has no authority. An act of a manager that is not apparently for carrying on the usual course of the business of the limited liability company does not bind the limited liability company unless authorized in fact or ratified by the limited liability company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-23 (2006). This statute appears to cover agency relationships pertaining to regular operation of the business, rather than liability for torts such as those alleged here. The North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act defines liabilities, debts and obligations as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (10a) Liabilities, debts, and obligations.- Have one and the same meaning and are used interchangeably throughout this Chapter. Reference to \"liabilities,\" \"debts,\" or \"obligations\" whether individually or in any combination, is deemed to reference \"all liabilities, debts, and obligations, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 57C-1-03 (2006). We believe that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-30(a) is the controlling statute on this issue, permitting Profile potentially to be held liable for its own acts and conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, plaintiffs' third amended complaint alleged gross negligence, as well as\n   <em>\n    Woodson\n   </em>\n   claims, against Profile and Terra-Mulch in its first claim. While the complaint does not clearly separate the different claims against the two defendants, plaintiffs clarified their assertions to the trial court. In their 3 June 2005 memorandum opposing summary judgment, and in their argument on the summary judgment motion, plaintiffs acknowledged Terra-Mulch as the employer against whom they could pursue a\n   <em>\n    Woodson\n   </em>\n   claim, and repeatedly asserted that they were pursuing \"a third-party claim against Defendant Profile, with that claim being grounded upon ordinary negligence principles.\" At the motion hearing, plaintiffs' counsel stated, \"We recognize that to reach the jury as against Terra-Mulch, we're restricted to\n   <em>\n    Woodson.\n   </em>\n   But with respect to the separate entity, Profile, a third-party case, counting it ordinary negligence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus, plaintiff contends that any verdict for or against Terra-Mulch (the employer) or Hoffman (the co-worker) would be on\n   <em>\n    Woodson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pleasant\n   </em>\n   claims, while a verdict on the claim against Profile would be based on the claims for negligence as alleged in the complaint. These claims have different elements, requiring different proof, and there would be nothing necessarily inconsistent about differing verdicts on these different types of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Profile also asserts that the trial court's order creates a significant conflict between Profile and Terra-Mulch which will work substantial injury if not immediately addressed. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Profile contends that as sole member manager of Terra-Mulch, the order puts Profile in a difficult position. The order allows plaintiffs to proceed against Profile as a third-party, and Profile, in turn, would be permitted to raise the issue of Terra-Mulch's negligence in defending against that claim. Thus, Profile could present evidence of Terra-Mulch's negligence in order to seek workers' compensation credit. N.C. Gen.Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00a7 97-10.2(e). Profile contends that if plaintiffs later successfully appealed the order granting summary judgment to Terra-Mulch, the evidence could be used in a subsequent trial against Terra-Mulch. Profile acknowledges that there is no previous case law to support its contention that this affects a substantial right. We are not persuaded that these circumstances constitute a substantial right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Profile next argues that the order created an adversarial relationship among Hoffman, Terra-Mulch and Profile which impaired its right to representation by counsel of its choice. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   All three of these parties have shared the same counsel and now face the prospect of retaining new and separate counsel to proceed. Profile cites several cases in support of this argument:\n   <em>\n    Travco Hotels v. Piedmont Natural Gas Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2503935\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/332/288/\">\n    332 N.C. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20S.E.2d%20426\">\n    420 S.E.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992),\n   <em>\n    Goldston v.
