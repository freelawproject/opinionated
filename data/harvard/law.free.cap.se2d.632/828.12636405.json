With respect to the permanent child support order, we uphold the trial court's decision to impute income to Mr. McKyer, but remand for further findings of fact regarding the calculation of the child support amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The McKyers were married in 1991 and separated in 2000. During the marriage, the couple had two sons, one born in 1995 and one born in 1998. From 1986 until 1998, Mr. McKyer played professional football for seven National Football League teams. In 1995, the couple moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, while Mr. McKyer played for the Carolina Panthers. Although the family remained in Charlotte, Mr. McKyer later played for the Atlanta Falcons and, in 1998, won the Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos. In May 2000, the McKyers separated, and Mr. McKyer moved out of the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. McKyer stopped playing football after the 1997-1998 season and hired an agent to help him find employment in communications as a radio host or football commentator. When that effort failed, he enrolled as a part-time student at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte; he continued to work towards a college degree throughout the proceedings below. At the time of the hearings at issue, Mr. McKyer worked one day per week at a local golf driving range as a \"supervisor/manager/ball guy\" and collected modest monthly payments from investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The McKyers' tortuous path through the North Carolina court system began in June 2000, when Mr. McKyer brought an action seeking primary custody of the couple's children. On 17 April 2001, District Court Judge Regan A. Miller entered an order awarding primary custody to Mr. McKyer and visitation to Ms. McKyer (the \"April 2001 Custody Order\"). The April 2001 Custody Order found that Mr. McKyer was \"not voluntarily reducing or minimizing his income to avoid his financial obligations to his family,\" but also limited Ms. McKyer's obligation to provide child support \"at this time to providing medical insurance through her employer for the children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. McKyer appealed from the April 2001 Custody Order. This Court affirmed, concluding that competent evidence in the record supported the trial court's findings of fact and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding custody to Mr. McKyer.\n   <em>\n    McKyer v.

The Equitable Distribution Order distributed the parties' marital and divisible property and debts and ordered the sale of the marital home. As part of the equitable distribution, Ms. McKyer retained the larger share of the home and was to remit a distributive payment to Mr. McKyer of $41,961.00. On 31 October 2001, Mr. McKyer appealed the Equitable Distribution Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court affirmed the Equitable Distribution Order in\n   <em>\n    McKyer v.

On 13 February 2002, Judge Miller dismissed this complaint on the grounds that he lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint sought to address issues raised in the appeal of the April 2001 Custody Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 27 March 2003, Mr. McKyer filed a motion to modify the April 2001 Custody Order, seeking primarily to change the visitation provisions. Ms. McKyer's response requested that the court change primary custody of the two children to her and impute income to Mr. McKyer for purposes of calculating child support. On 30 October 2003, Mr. McKyer filed an additional \"Motion in the Cause for Temporary and Permanent Child Support,\" seeking to have the April 2001 Custody Order modified and/or vacated and seeking \"a temporary and permanent order of child support retroactive and prospective to April 17, 2001.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2004, District Court Judge Rebecca T. Tin entered three orders, one addressing additional equitable distribution matters, the second addressing child custody (the \"August 2004 Custody Order\"), and the third providing for temporary child support (the \"August 2004 Temporary Support Order\"). In the August 2004 Custody Order, Judge Tin found: (1) a significant change of circumstances had occurred since the April 2001 Custody Order; (2) it was no longer in the best interests of the children that they be in the primary physical custody of Mr. McKyer; and (3) it was in the children's best interests that primary physical custody be granted to Ms. McKyer. Accordingly, the August 2004 Custody Order denied Mr. McKyer's initial motion for modification, granted Ms. McKyer's motion to change custody, and awarded Mr. McKyer visitation. Mr. McKyer appealed from this order on 23 August 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the August 2004 Temporary Support Order, Judge Tin found that any child support awarded to Mr. McKyer should be made retroactive to 30 October 2003 and calculated the amount owed by Ms. McKyer, under the Child Support Guidelines, for the period from 1 November 2003 until 31 May 2004. Judge Tin did not, at that time, address Mr. McKyer's request for retroactive child support for the period 17 April 2001 through 30 October 2003. Judge Tin further found that Mr. McKyer had a present temporary obligation to pay child support to Ms. McKyer beginning 10 June 2004 in the amount of $210.35 per month. The August 2004 Temporary Support Order reserved any ruling on defendant's motion to impute income to Mr. McKyer until the matter of permanent child support could be addressed, but provided that Mr. McKyer \"is hereby ordered to seek gainful employment immediately. He shall provide the Court with at least thirty (30) places where he has sought employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. McKyer immediately filed a motion to amend the August 2004 Temporary Support Order. He sought recalculation of the parties' child support obligations and the striking of the \"seek employment order\" based on the finding in the April 2001 Custody Order that Mr. McKyer was \"not voluntarily reducing or minimizing his income to avoid his financial obligations to his family.\" On 5\n   October 2004, Mr. McKyer filed another motion entitled \"Motion to Dismiss and/or Stay Temporary Child Support Order and Entry of Permanent Child Support Order Pending Appeal.\" He contended in the motion that he was entitled to have both the August 2004 Temporary Support Order and the entry of any permanent child support order dismissed or stayed because this Court had not yet resolved his appeal of the August 2004 Custody Order. Subsequently, however, Mr. McKyer's appeal of the August 2004 Custody Order was dismissed for failure to timely settle the record on appeal. On 31 August 2005, Mr. McKyer sought review of this dismissal by filing a petition for writ of certiorari. This Court denied the petition on 16 September 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On 13 January 2005, District Court Judge Jane V. Harper conducted a hearing addressing Mr. McKyer's motion to amend the August 2004 Temporary Support Order, Mr. McKyer's October 2004 motion to dismiss or stay that order, and the issue of permanent child support. Judge Harper subsequently entered an order (the \"January 2005 Permanent Support Order\"), concluding that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction over the child support issues following Mr. McKyer's appeal of the custody order. The January 2005 Permanent Support Order modified the parties' prior child support obligations, imputed income to Mr. McKyer, and calculated Mr. McKyer's permanent child support obligation. Mr. McKyer timely appealed this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On 14 February 2005, Judge Tin ruled on Mr. McKyer's 30 October 2003 motion to modify the April 2001 Custody Order to grant him child support from 17 April 2001 through 30 October 2003 (the \"February 2005 Support Order\"). The February 2005 Support Order concluded that Mr. McKyer was precluded, under\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   principles, from receiving retroactive child support from the entry of the April 2001 Custody Order until 30 October 2003 - the date Mr. McKyer had filed his motion seeking retroactive child support. With respect, however, to the period from 30 October 2003 until the entry of the August 2004 Custody Order switching custody to Ms. McKyer, the order concluded that Mr. McKyer was entitled to retroactive child support. Mr. McKyer also timely appealed the February 2005 Support Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Mr. McKyer argues that his appeal of the August 2004 Custody Order precluded any subsequent proceedings in this matter, including entry of the January 2005 Permanent Support Order and the February 2005 Support Order. With respect to this issue, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-294 (2005) (emphasis added) provides: \"When an appeal is perfected as provided by this Article it stays all further proceedings in the court below upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter embraced therein;\n   <em>\n    but the court below may proceed upon any other matter included in the action and not affected by the judgment appealed from.\n   </em>\n   \" This Court has held, based on N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-294, that \"once a custody order is appealed, the trial court is divested of jurisdiction over all matters\n   <em>\n    specifically affecting custody.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Rosero v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-294. Instead, Mr. McKyer argues that the law of the case doctrine required dismissal or stay of further proceedings while Mr. McKyer's appeal of the August 2004 Custody Order was pending. In support of this argument, Mr. McKyer points to the fact that when Ms. McKyer appealed the April 2001 Custody Order, the trial court dismissed Mr. McKyer's new child support complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. While Mr. McKyer claims that\n   <em>\n    McKyer II\n   </em>\n   summarily affirmed this dismissal, the record on appeal contains no notice of appeal from the dismissal and the text of\n   <em>\n    McKyer II\n   </em>\n   stated that it was only affirming the equitable distribution order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties, however, seem to agree that the dismissal order was encompassed within this Court's concluding statement in\n   <em>\n    McKyer II\n   </em>\n   that \"we have reviewed Mr. McKyer's\n   remaining assignments of error and have found them to be without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    McKyer II,\n   </em>\n   2003 N.C.App. LEXIS 1542 at *21-22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021791638\">\n    2003 WL 21791638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8. Nonetheless, this conclusion provides no hint of the basis for any affirmance and, consequently, there is no ruling that can constitute the law of the case for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See Hayes v. City of Wilmington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8626028\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/243/525/#p536\">\n    243 N.C. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20S.E.2d%20673\">\n    91 S.E.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681-82 (1956) (\"[A]s a general rule when an appellate court passes on a question and remands the cause for further proceedings, the questions there settled become the law of the case, both in subsequent proceedings in the trial court and on subsequent appeal....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In any event, the April 2001 Custody Order expressly addressed the issue of child support, the subject of the December 2001 complaint that was dismissed. That December 2001 action, therefore, fell within the scope of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-294. Because Mr. McKyer provides no argument regarding how his appeal of the August 2004 Custody Order, which did not address child support, divested the trial court of jurisdiction to decide questions of child support, this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Mr. McKyer argues that Judge Tin erred in refusing to modify the April 2001 Custody Order to award Mr. McKyer retroactive child support from 17 April 2001, the date the initial custody order was entered, through 30 October 2003, the date Mr. McKyer filed his motion seeking child support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Retroactive child support\" is either (1) support awarded for a period prior to the date a party filed a complaint seeking child support, or (2) a retroactive increase in the amount provided in an existing support order.\n   <em>\n    Cole v. Cole,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9128658\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/149/427/#p433\">\n    149 N.C.App. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20S.E.2d%2011\">\n    562 S.E.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14 (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, the April 2001 Custody Order was an existing order providing for payment of child support by Ms. McKyer in the form of health insurance and payment of uninsured medical expenses. Mr. McKyer argues in passing that \"[a]rguably, it can be stated that the order of 17 April 2001 was at best an interim order that could be modified and subject to retroactive child support at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    See Miller v. Miller,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248620\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/153/40/#p47\">\n    153 N.C.App. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=568%20S.E.2d%20914\">\n    568 S.E.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919 (2002) (noting that although a permanent support order may not be retroactively modified in the absence of a substantial change in circumstances, a temporary support order may be retroactively modified without showing such a change). Mr. McKyer did not, however, make this argument below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (\"In order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context.\"). Nor is this contention consistent with the proceedings following the entry of the order: the order was appealed to this Court; an opinion was filed affirming the order; and, subsequently, the parties sought modification of the order based on substantial changes in circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the April 2001 Custody Order was not a mere interim order, we are addressing the second type of retroactive child support described in\n   <em>\n    Cole,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9128658\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/149/427/#p433\">\n    149 N.C.App. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20S.E.2d%2011\">\n    562 S.E.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. McKyer presented no evidence of any emergency situation occurring between 17 April 2001 and 30 October 2003 and makes no argument suggesting that we recognize any other circumstances as justifying retroactive child support. Mr. McKyer has not even offered any explanation as to why child support should be retroactive to 17 April 2001, as opposed to the date that Ms. McKyer received the proceeds from the sale.

Because Mr. McKyer had made no showing that he was entitled to a retroactive increase in child support, the court's failure to consider this evidence was at most harmless error.

In addition to paying his own monthly mortgage and household bills, and $55/month child support, H spent about $2500 on the children's Christmas gifts in 2004. The court notes that H's $55/month payment is less than W spends for the children's health insurance. The court also notes that H spent more for the boys' Christmas gifts than he believes he should pay in child support over a period of 45 months, at $55/month, or 17 months at $145/month, the figure on the worksheet Ms. Shuford [Mr. McKyer's attorney] submitted after the January hearing. The $145 figure is less than half what W must spend for child care. It is less than a fourth what she must spend for the boy's [sic] vision and occupational therapy. It is not enough to meet the children's reasonable needs and expenses.

H's employer at the driving range is very flexible. H can, and does, take the boys with him to the driving range, which they enjoy.

Contrary to defendant's argument, the fact that Judge Miller did not believe in 2001 that Mr. McKyer was \"not voluntarily reducing or minimizing his income to avoid his financial obligations to his family\" does not preclude a contrary finding four years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nevertheless, the findings of fact on this issue are insufficient to support the trial court's determination of\n   <em>\n    the amount of income\n   </em>\n   that should be imputed to Mr. McKyer. A trial court must \"make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to allow the reviewing court to determine whether a judgment, and the legal conclusions that underlie it, represent a correct application of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Spicer v.

Rather, the court found that \"[n]o evidence was presented that [Mr. McKyer] could not work more hours at this employment.\" This finding is not sufficient to support the amount imputed. While Mr. McKyer did indeed state that his job at the golf range as a \"supervisor/manager/ball guy\" provided him with flexible hours, we see no basis to conclude that this necessarily means Mr. McKyer could move from a very limited, one day per week part-time job to full-time employment at the range.\n   <em>\n    See McDonald v.
