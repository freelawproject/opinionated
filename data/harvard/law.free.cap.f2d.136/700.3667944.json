Mascuch, appellee in Appeals Nos. 4695, Paulson v. Mascuch, and 4696, Hyland v. Mascuch, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, -, 136 F.2d 706, decided concurrently herewith, was also a party to this interference proceeding, but did not appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals, adverse to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-35\">The general subject matter of the invention is the same as in related cases hereinbefore referred to, viz., the shielding of spark plugs for airplanes to improve the operation of radios thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-36\">The count in issue reads as follows: \u201cIn combination, a spark plug comprising a metallic cap and a vertical stem having an outlet, a conductor having a connection with said stem at the outlet, a dielectric member mounted on said cap and enclosing said outlet and providing for the free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>movement of said connection therein and a thin metallic coating on said conductor and a thin metallic coating enclosing said member, said coatings being electrically connected with said metallic cap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The preliminary statement of Shumaker alleged conception of the invention on July 1, 1927, and reduction to practice on August 30, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Paulson in his preliminary statement alleged conception of the invention early in the year 1927 and reduction to practice \u201cin the early part of June 1928.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Both parties took testimony. By stipulation the <em>testimony was </em>made applicable to this interference, and also to Interference Nos. 69,428, 73,561, 73,562, 73,564 and 73,630, each of which is involved in some of the companion cases decided concurrently herewith as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Inasmuch as Shumaker is the junior party, the burden was upon him to establish priority of invention by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The issues herein, as in the said companion cases, involve principally questions of fact, and as the Patent Office tribunals concurred <em>in the </em>findings of fact, the rule is here applicable that such findings will be accepted by us unless shown to be manifestly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">In arriving at our conclusion herein it is necessary for us to consider only the dates of conception to which the respective parties are entitled, and whether Paulson derived the invention from Shumaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">It appears that Shumaker is an electrical engineer, a graduate of Ohio State University, and at all of the times hereinafter mentioned was in the employ of the War Department as a mechanical engineer in charge of the \u201cIgnition Unit Power Plant Laboratory\u201d Materiel Division at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio; that Paulson is chief engineer for the \u201cB. G. Corporation,\u201d a manufacturer of aircraft spark plugs, located in New York City, <em>to </em>which corporation his application has been assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Shumaker contends that the record establishes conception of the invention by him as early as July 15, 1927, as evidenced by a certain sketch in evidence, Shumaker Exhibit 4, bearing that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">With respect to this sketch the Examiner of Interferences in his decision stated: \u201cIt has also been held in interference 69,428 that Shumaker exhibit 4 did not disclose the invention therein claimed in issue, and the reasons for which it failed to support the issue in that case are deemed equally applicable here. It was also pointed out that Shumaker exhibit 4 was wholly uncorroborated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">In the companion cases, Appeals Nos. 4689, Shumaker v. Paulson, and 4690, Paulson v. Hyland, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, \u2014 , 136 F.2d 686, we held, upon the same record that is here before us, that Exhibit 4 was not sufficiently corroborated to establish conception by Shumaker as of its date and our holding there is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">Neither the Examiner of Interferences nor the board found any specific date for conception to which Shumaker is entitled, but impliedly found that the evidence establishes that he conceived the invention prior to any date to which Paulson is entitled, for both tribunals found lack of diligence by Shumaker in reducing the invention to practice, and of course, Shumaker would be chargeable with diligence only if he had conceived the invention prior to Paulson.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">At any rate, the evidence clearly establishes that Shumaker is entitled to a date for conception prior to any date which can be awarded to Paulson.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-17\">There is in the record a letter dated May 25, 1928, signed by Major MacDill, Shumaker\u2019s superior, but initialed by Shumaker, addressed to the B. G. Corporation \u201cAttention \u2014 Mr. G. M. Paulson, Chief Engineer,\u201d and with this letter there were inclosed certain drawings, disclosing the involved invention, which were also offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-19\">The last paragraph of said letter reads as follows: \u201cThis design is being forwarded for your comments and your opinion as to whether or not this plug could be satisfactorily constructed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-21\">In his testimony Paulson admits the receipt of this letter, and on June 1, 1928, he replied thereto as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-22\">\u201cWar Department Air Corps,</p>\n<p id=\"b765-23\">\u201cMateriel Division,</p>\n<p id=\"b765-24\">\u201cWright Field,</p>\n<p id=\"b765-25\">\u201cDayton, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-26\">\u201cAttention \u2014 Major Leslie MacDill,</p>\n<p id=\"A9B\">\u201cSubject: Shielded Spark Plugs.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Pa\">\u201cGentlemen:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-27\">\u201cIn reply to your letter of May 25th, the writer has designed and built shielded plugs of the same general construction as you propose, and is also working on a shield to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>fit over our standard Hornet spark plug. The shielded plug which has been built is constructed from our regular Model 1XA plug, and could also be built around the Model 1XB.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">\u201cThe plugs which we have ready for test are approximately the same length as our regular plug, except that the ignition wire goes directly into the end of the plug instead of fastening by a clip from the side. In the construction of these plugs mica has been used entirely for the insulating material, and the plugs seem to be as rugged and practical for general use as our regular line of plugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\u201cThe writer expects to be at Wright Field the first part of the coming week, and will have sample plugs along to show, and would like very much to talk over the problem with your engineers assigned to this work.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj-F\">\u201cVery truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201cThe B. G. Corporation</p>\n<p id=\"A1U\">\u201cBy: (Signed)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\u201cGeorge M. Paulson,</p>\n<p id=\"Ap5n\">\u201cChief Engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">\u201cGMP: MC\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">In the ordinary course of business Paul-son would have received the letter of May 25th not later than May 28, 1928, and Paul-son does not deny that he had received it on or before said date.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">It is therefore established that Shumaker conceived the invention not later than May 28, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">With respect to the evidence as to Paul-son\u2019s claimed conception, his first drawing disclosing the invention is dated May 29, 1928, but Paulson\u2019s testimony concerning this drawing is not corroborated by any witness. It is clearly established, however, that on June 5, 1928, Paulson delivered to the Navy Yard at Washington, D. C., a number of spark plugs embodying the invention, and these plugs were successfully tested on June 26, 1928. While these plugs were not of the same design as the design submitted to Paulson with the letter of May 25th, it is conceded that the plugs so made respond to the count here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">Paulson in his testimony is very vague and indefinite as to the time he claims to have conceived the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">It appears that on October 10, 1933, a patent was issued to Paulson for a shielded spark plug, of a character not here involved, the application for which was filed on September 4, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">With respect to said patent and the invention here involved, Paulson testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">\u201cQ9. Mr. Paulson, will you please state when you conceived the inventions here in issue, distinguishing, if you can, between the invention or inventions of your application and the invention or inventions disclosed by your patent? A. I would say I conceived the invention disclosed by the application and the patent, the general aspects, some time between December, 1926, and the time of the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">\u201cQ10. Is that as close as you can fix this important date or dates ? A. I would say yes, in view of the fact that my records show that I was working on the general problem during that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-17\">Upon the assumption that Paulson is an independent inventor we would be compelled to hold upon the evidence in the record that he conceived the invention after May 28th and before June 5th, the latter date being the date upon which he delivered spark plugs to the Navy Yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-18\">It being established that Shumaker is entitled to May 28th for conception of the invention, and that by that date it had been disclosed by him to Paulson, the question arises as to whether Paulson derived the invention from Shumaker. If he did, the successful testing of the spark plugs furnished to the Navy Yard, under well settled principles of law, inured to the benefit of Shumaker as an actual reduction to practice of the invention, although under his preliminary statement such reduction to practice would relate to August 30, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-19\">Upon this point the Examiner of Interferences in his decision, after holding that Shumaker\u2019s Exhibit 4 was not corroborated and failed to disclose the invention here involved, stated: \u201cIt is therefore felt that</p>\n<p id=\"b766-20\">Shumaker has not offered any substantial proof to indicate the clear and full disclosure to Paulson necessary to sustain an award in his favor on the ground of Paul-son\u2019s lack of originality. Anderson v. Wells, 122 O.G. 3014; 1906 C.D. 667.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">The examiner made no reference to the disclosure of the invention by Shumaker to Paulson in the drawings accompanying said letter of May 25, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-22\">The Board of Appeals, however, did consider said letter and drawings. In its decision it stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-23\">\u201cShumaker contends that the Examiner of Interferences has overlooked or disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>garded the testimony particularly with respect to Shumaker\u2019s drawings, Exhibits 3 and 23 to 27, inclusive, said to be made on May 21, 1928 and forwarded by Shumaker to Paulson with a letter, Shumaker Exhibit 22-b, dated May 25, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">\u201cThe examiner referred to Paulson\u2019s cross Exhibits 94 and 95C introduced to show that according to Shumaker\u2019s record, on dates of June 7 and June 13, 1928, Shumaker had made certain notations quoted on page 4 of the Examiner\u2019s decision to the effect that Paulson of the B. G. Corporation visited 'the Division and this Company is now working upon a radio-shielded plug and the original design was shown during Mr. Paulson\u2019s visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cPaulson stated in answer to Q.178, in regard to the drawing, SK-12502, which is Shumaker Exhibit 3, that when he received this letter from Shumaker and the accompanying prints, sketches had been made <em>in </em>regard to his own development and possibly some work had been done with parts to determine limits before manufacturing and that in his letter of May 22 he gave a very general description of the plug which he had worked out. Paulson, on page 108 of his brief, quotes from his letter of May 22, which constitutes Paulson Exhibit 2, as to the disclosure he had written to Shumaker. This letter stated, in substance, that he, Paulson, had worked out a carefully designed plug with radio shielding so that by bringing the Belden covering down to the top of the plug and attaching it there the ignition system is completely shielded as far as the plugs are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cWhile this description may not be as definitely specific as the count, it would indicate that Paulson had worked out a shielded plug of the same general nature as the count at least as early as May 22, 1928, which is prior to the date of Shumaker\u2019s letter of May 25, 1928 to Paulson enclosing his Exhibit 3. While Shumaker seems to have no recollection of this Paulson letter of May 22, the letter was identified by Paulson\u2019s stenographer, Mary Coen.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\u201cSince Shumaker\u2019s position here is that of charging derivation by Paulson, the burden is on him to prove this derivation and in view of the record, we are not conclusively convinced that Paulson derived the invention from Shumaker\u2019s disclosure to him and it is considered that the examiner\u2019s position here is properly taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">At this point we would observe that while the burden was upon Shumaker to establish derivation of the invention from him by Paulson, when Shumaker produced conclusive evidence of disclosure of the invention to Paulson prior to any proven date of conception by Paulson, he had made a prima facie case of derivation by Paulson from him; that while the burden of proof was not thereby shifted from Shumaker to Paulson, it was the duty of Paulson to go forward with proof to overcome the prima facie case made by Shumaker. See McCormick et al. v. Plumstead, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 925, 94 F.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The case of Greenwood v. Dover, 23 App. D.C. 251, presented facts very similar to those at bar. There the junior party Greenwood disclosed the invention to the senior party Dover prior to any established date of conception by the latter. Both parties were limited to a constructive reduction to practice by the filing of their respective applications. The court reversed the holding of the Commissioner of Patents which awarded priority of invention to the senior party Dover. In its decision the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">\u201cThe fact that Dover received a disclosure of Greenwood\u2019s conception in the course of an interview looking to arrangements for its manufacture for commercial purposes renders it necessary for him to prove with reasonable certainty that he had a prior conception of the same invention. Gallagher v. Hastings, 21 App.D.C. 88, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">\u201cMoreover, as Greenwood has been found to have had his conception at least as early as June 20, 1901, the burden is thrown upon Dover to prove a conception prior to that date. This, we are of the opinion, he has failed to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">The question remains whether upon the whole record Shumaker has established derivation of the invention by Paulson from Shumaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">The Board of Appeals, as will be noted from that portion of its decision hereinbefore quoted, gave considerable weight to a letter, Paulson\u2019s Exhibit 2, bearing the date of May 22, 1928, written by Paulson to Shumaker, the relevant portion of which as relied upon by the board reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">\u201cSince I saw you last I have been doing considerable experimental work on single cylinder engines with the Hornet plugs, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>have made some slight changes in the design of the plug which are very promising, especially for super-charging and super-compression engines. I have also worked out a carefully designed plug with radio shielding, so that by bringing the Belden covering down to the top of the plug and attaching it there, the ignition system is completely shielded as far as the plugs are concerned. This shielding will also serve for seaplane work where salt spray tends to give trouble. I believe that there is a market for such a plug and that it has some possibilities. We cannot be sure of this until we have run tests in the air, but we are assured by authorities on radio shielding that a completely shielded ignition system, plug and all, will practically eliminate radio interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">\u201cI hope to be in Dayton the latter part of this week or the first part of next week and will try to have a couple of sets along to show.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In the first place it is clear that the description set forth in said letter does not respond to the count here involved, and the board in effect so found. The mere fact that Paulson on May 22 had devised <em>some </em>kind of a shielded spark plug in no way indicates that he had conceived the invention here involved. That Paulson had, prior to May 1928, worked upon the problem of spark plug shielding is well established. It is also equally well established that for many months Shumaker had been working upon the same problem, as had Mascuch, the third party to the interference, who did not appeal from the board\u2019s decision. Indeed, Shumaker positively testified that he disclosed the invention of the count to Paulson long prior to May 1928, but this was positively denied by Paulson, and hence the board did not err in holding that Shumaker had not established disclosure of the invention to Paulson, prior to Paulson\u2019s receipt of the letter of May 25th.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">It also appears from Paulson\u2019s testimony that one Hyland, who is a party to the interferences, concurrently decided herewith, had also prior to May 28th worked upon the problem of the shielding of spark plugs and claimed that he was the prior inventor of a shielded spark plug, which to use the language of the board in referring to the Paulson letter of May 22nd was \u201cof the same general nature\u201d as the count involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">However, Hyland was not made a party to this interference, presumably because while he had invented a shielded spark plug \u201cof the same general nature\u201d as the count before us, his invention did not respond to all of the elements of the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">It follows from the foregoing that Paul-son\u2019s letter of May 22nd may not be considered as any evidence that he was in possession of the involved invention prior to the receipt by him of said Shumaker letter of May 25th.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Another circumstance of some significance is that in the Paulson letter of June 1 to Shumaker, hereinbefore quoted, it is stated that the B. G. Corporation had completed shielded plugs \u201cof the same general construction\u201d as proposed by Shumaker, from which it is argued that Paulson must have been in possession of the invention prior to Shumaker\u2019s disclosure to him in the letter of May 25th.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">However, with respect to said last named letter, Paulson testified as follows: \u201cQ178. At the time that you received this letter from Mr. Shumaker and the accompanying prints of his drawing SK-12502 of a dummy shielded spark plug, in what stage of development was your original 1-XA shielded spark plug? A. Sketches had been made, <em>possibly </em>some work had been done with parts to determine limits before manufacturing, and in my letter of May 22nd, I gave a very general description of the plug which I had worked out, that is, description \u00f3f a straight type shielded plug. (Italics ours)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">With respect to the length of time required to produce a spark plug embodying the invention Paulson was very vague and indefinite. Upon cross-examination he testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">\u201cXQ936. And those first plugs were completed sometime between May 28, ,1928, and June 5, 1928, I believe; is that correct ? A. They may have been made slightly before May 28, 1928. Without consulting all my correspondence exhibits, I would not be able to fix the date exactly.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">\u201cXQ937. On your very early development work on shielded spark plugs, I understood you to say that the making of the physical plug followed closely on the making of any sketches, is that correct? A. I could not state the exact days between the making of the sketches and the first production of the complete plug.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">\u201cXQ938. But it would be a relatively short time on the early development, wouldn\u2019t it? A. Might have been expressed in weeks or days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>It thus appears that Paulson was not at all certain that any work had been done upon the spark plugs embodying the invention prior to his receipt of the Shumaker letter of May 25th, and as one of his witnesses testified that it was a \u201churry up job,\u201d it is probable that the spark plugs sent to the Navy Yard on June 5th, which embodied the invention, were made after May 28th.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Furthermore, there is nothing in Paul-son\u2019s letter of June 1st to Shumaker claiming that he was a prior inventor of the invention disclosed in the Shumaker letter of May 25th.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The letter is subject to the construction that he had merely designed a different kind of plug, embodying the invention, which design, in fact, might be patentable to Paulson, but this is not a subject of inquiry here.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The Examiner of Interferences also relied upon a statement by Shumaker in his \u201cProject Record\u201d under date of July 11, 1928, Paulson Cross Exhibit No. 95-C reading as follows: \u201cMr. Paulson of the B. G. Corporation, visited the Division and had a modified design of a Hornet plug which they arc developing. The spindle is larger in diameter which allows a longer core without increasing the operating temperature. The baffle also forms the side electrodes and has four points. This construction should materially reduce electrode burning and be less liable to fouling than the present No. 4B. Some of these plugs will be submitted to the Division for test. This Company is now working upon a radio-shielded plug and the original design was shown during Mr. Paulson\u2019s visit. Some changes are desirable and when these are completed the Modified design will be submitted for comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The Examiner of Interferences also quoted from a letter of Shumaker to the B. G. Corporation, under date of June 13, 1928, as follows: \u201cDuring Mr. Paulson\u2019s visit to the Material Division, the shield design which he had worked out for use on the Model 1XA plug was discussed * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">We find nothing inconsistent in the above quoted statements, with his claim of prior conception and disclosure of the invention to Paulson. It is clear, as hereinbefore indicated, that the design worked out by Paulson embodying the invention was different from the design submitted by Shumaker embodying the same invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">It is true that prior to the declaration of this interference Shumaker never made any claim to Paulson that Paulson had derived the invention from him, but it is also true that so far as the record appears Paulson never definitely made any claim to Shumaker prior to the declaration of this interference that he, Paulson, had independently made the invention defined in the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Shumaker on September 18, 1928, filed with the \u201cPatent Liaison Unit of Wright Field\u201d what is termed a \u201cRecord of Military Invention\u201d as a basis for a patent application for the involved invention. The application itself, however, was not filed until July <em>7, </em>1931, and as hereinbefore noted, Paulson\u2019s application was filed on July 15, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">It also appears that on April 6, 1935, Paulson filed a motion to dissolve the instant interference upon the ground that the count is unpatentable to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">It may be that neither party was aware in May or June 1928, that the subject matter of the involved count defined an invention, and for that reason the evidence respecting it is, in many respects, indefinite, but there is a clear disclosure of the invention by Shumaker to Paulson, which disclosure is not denied by Paulson, and we are of the opinion that it is manifest from the record that Paulson has not established that he was in possession of the invention prior to such disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">It follows from the foregoing that it must be held upon the record before us that Paulson derived the invention defined in the count from Shumaker; that Paul-son\u2019s actual reduction to practice in June 1928 inured to the benefit of Shumaker, and the date of reduction to practice alleged in his, Shumaker\u2019s preliminary statement, is immaterial in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">In view of these facts, the question of diligence upon the part of Shumaker in reducing the invention to practice does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">For the reasons herein stated the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
