However, the drawings disclose precisely what the tribunals of the Patent Office held they disclosed, and we know of no authority, and none is cited by counsel for appellant, for holding that patent drawings are not proper as references in applications for design patents. Furthermore, the Primary Examiner stated in his final decision rejecting the appealed claim that \u201cIt is customary in the storage vessel art as well as the heat exchange art, <em>to use cylindrical containers\u201d </em>(Italics ours.) That statement is not challenged by any evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Counsel for appellant states in his brief that because of the design of appellant\u2019s dehydrator tube \u201csales by applicant\u2019s assignee have had a tremendous increase and number many thousands over normal. They have had an exceptional popularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">That statement of counsel may be true. However, there is no evidence of record to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Counsel further states in his brief that for \u201cutilitarian reasons\u201d a dehydrator tube \u201cshould be round in cross section so that it can be more inexpensively manufactured, more easily handled and so that when installed it will present few corners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">If the dehydrator tubes shown in the Refrigeration Supplies Catalog, which it is claimed in appellant\u2019s brief were owned by appellant\u2019s assignee, were objectionable from a utilitarian point of view because the walls of the cylindrical bodies are parallel throughout their entire length and because the caps on the ends of the cylindrical bodies extend laterally beyond the surfaces of the walls, it certainly would not require the exercise of inventive genius to provide rounded shoulders for such cylindrical bodies and arrange the caps at the ends thereof so that they would not extend or protrude laterally beyond the walls of the cylinder in view of the disclosures in the other references of record, if any such disclosures were needed, showing tubular vessels with rounded shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Several cases are cited in the brief of counsel for appellant. Some of those cases relate to infringement of letters patent, and have no application to the issues here presented. Other cases cited by counsel relate to the question of the type of utilitarian articles which are proper subject matter for design patents. Those cases apparently are cited for the purpose of showing that the tubular vessels in the Schworetzky and Hasche patents are not proper subject matter for design patents, and that, therefore, those patents are not proper to be considered as references in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">The answer to that argument of counsel is that there is no evidence of record ,to indicate that the tubular vessels disclosed in those references are not displayed when in use in the same manner as are appellant\u2019s dehydrator tubes.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">It is true, as claimed by counsel for appellant, that none of the references anticipates appellant\u2019s design. However, neither of the tribunals of the Patent Office held that appellant\u2019s design was anticipated by any of the references. What the tribunals of the Patent Office did hold was that, in view of the tubular vessels with rounded shoulders disclosed in the patents to Schworetzky and Hasche, it would not involve invention to provide the dehydrator tubes, disclosed in the Refrigeration Supplies Catalog, with rounded shoulders, such as in appellant\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">So far as the record discloses, appellant\u2019s design, as applied to dehydrator tubes, is new, and, when compared with the prior art dehydrator tubes, it may be more attractive and pleasing to the eye. However, in order to be patentable, appellant\u2019s design must involve invention. See In re Griffith, 86 F.2d 405, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 713, and cases therein cited and reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated we are of opinion that appellant\u2019s design does not involve invention, and that the appealed claim was properly rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
