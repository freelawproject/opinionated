W. Dodge Corporation, is the owner and publisher of The Architectural Record, a periodical which has been continuously published in this country since 1891. In 1938 appellee acquired the business and goodwill of The American Architect and Architecture, which periodicals were thereupon merged with The Architectural Record and have been continuously published since under the title The Architectural Record followed in smaller type with \u2018Combined with The American Architect and Architecture\u2019 on :he spine of the magazine, on the mast head, and sometimes on the cover. (See cover and title pages of the March, June and July 1938 issues, Appellee\u2019s Exhibits A and B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">\u201cAppellee owns the following registered trade-marks for periodicals (Class 38) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-14\">. No. Date Mark</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-15\">173,713 October 2, 1923 Architecture</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-16\">179,6\u00b018 February 12, 1924 The Architectural Record</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-17\">286,900 September 8, 1931 The American Architect</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-18\">362,185 November 15, 1938 American Architect and Architecture\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-19\">From the foregoing it appears that the mark or title in actual use by opposer is a consolidation of prior registered marks. It is not registered in its consolidated form, and the brief on behalf of applicant asserts : \u201cAppellee possesses no separate magazine \u2018American Architect\u2019 or \u2018Architecture\u2019 but only the single publication entitled \u2018Architectural Record combined with American Architect and Architecture.'\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-21\">We do not understand, however, that applicant claims abandonment on the part of opposer of its registered marks. The concluding paragraphs of applicant\u2019s brief read:</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">\u201cOpposer having adopted and used a composite title can not now pick out a single word from it and claim it separately as his title. Surely opposer is not entitled to monopolize arbitrarily a great number of names for the purpose of excluding others from the use of names appropriate to their products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">\u201cOpposer is not now using and never has used the title of applicant which is \u2018Architecture and Design.\u2019 The differences between the marks in issue outweigh their resemblance and as the goods are different per se, the decision of the Examiner of Interferences should be sustained, and the Commissioner reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">The Examiner of Interferences took the view that while there may not have been an abandonment of use by opposer of the registered marks as a title for a separate publication, \u201cthe only mark pleaded that may be properly considered here is this composite mark (c) [\u2018Architectural Record\u2019 prominently displayed in association with the legend \u2018Combined with American Architect and Architecture\u2019] which it was using at or about the date of the filing of the notice of opposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">The commissioner disagreed with the Examiner of Interferences upon this point, saying: \u201cSince no abandonment has materialized, each of the registrations must be presumed to be valid and in effect, so that if applicant\u2019s mark is confusingly similar to any of them it must be presumed that opposer will be damaged by registration of applicant\u2019s mark and the opposition must be sustained. D. J. Bielzoff Products Company v. White Horse Distillers, Limited, 107 F.2d 583, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 722.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-23\">We are of opinion that the view of the commissioner concerning this point is correct; that is to say, applicant\u2019s mark must be subjected to comparison with each of the registered marks in considering the likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-24\">The word \u201cArchitecture,\u201d embraced in applicant\u2019s mark, appears in two of op-poser\u2019s registered marks, to wit, in No. 173,713, supra, being there registered alone, and in 362,185, supra, where it appears in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>connection with the words \u201cAmerican [disclaimed] Architect and.\u201d The words \u201cArchitect\u201d and \u201cArchitectural,\u201d appearing in the other registrations, are, of course, closely related in meaning to the word \u201cArchitecture.\u201d Indeed, as stated, in substance, by the Examiner of Interferences, the terms \u201cArchitecture\u201d and \u201cArchitectural\u201d may be regarded as derivatives of the term \u201cArchitect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Copies of the periodicals of the respective parties showing the titles as arranged and used on the covers were placed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The word \u201cArchitecture\u201d in applicant\u2019s title as shown on its two exhibits in evidence (one dated October 1937 and one dated April 1940) is printed in somewhat fanciful type and is prominently displayed. The words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cDesign\u201d immediately below \u201cArchitecture\u201d are in script and are in fanciful form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">In opposer\u2019s title, upon the four samples in evidence, the word \u201cRecord\u201d is most prominently displayed, and all the other words are printed in comparatively plain type, varying somewhat in size. On two of them the notation \u201ccombined with American Architect and Architecture\u201d does not appear on the front cover, but only on the \u201cspine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\"> It is a matter of common knowledge of which we think judicial notice properly may be taken that the publishers of periodicals and magazines frequently \u2022 change the style of the title pages while retaining the same words in the titles, and the style which may be used upon one issue may differ from that used upon another. It is of no great aid, therefore, in considering the question of confusion, to look to the style or arrangement of the title upon any particular issue. So, the words rather than the forms and arrangement of the type used must be the matter of primary consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">In the instant case applicant points out that the word \u201cDesign\u201d does not appear in any of opposer\u2019s registered marks, and contends that the differences between the marks at issue outweigh their resemblance. Applicant also directs attention to, and places emphasis upon, the character of the contents of the periodicals issued by the respective parties, the manner of their distribution, and the type of subscribers to, \u25a0 or purchasers of, such periodicals. : '</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">The testimony (on behalf of both parties) in this case was stipulated with right reserved -by counsel to make objections, the objections to be attached to the stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">On behalf of applicant it was stipulated that its president, if called as a witness, would testify, inter alia:</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">\u201cThat \u2018The Architectural Record\u2019 is distinctly a trade magazine containing a great deal of editorial matter and is subscribed to principally by architects and draftsmen in the building trades. It contains a great deal of advertising, a few plates and most of its work is devoted to editorial columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">\u201cThat \u2018Architecture and Design\u2019 is an entirely different media. It contains no editorial matter and is devoted to plates of the work of one architectural firm, .engineer, or builder. The magazine\u2019s principal distribution today is by the firm whose work is shown in the issue in an endeavor by this firm to obtain new business, both for himself and the advertisers. The distribution today is mostly free and controlled and does not reach the field that is reached by \u2018The Architectural Record.\u2019 The architect, engineer, or builder, gives the distribution of the magazine \u2018Architecture and Design\u2019 to his clients or prin- . cipals whom he knows are considering new building operations and its entire distribu- . tion might take three years before, the issue is exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">\u201cThat no instances of actual confusion in trade between Applicant\u2019s magazine \u25a0 \u2018Architecture and Design\u2019 and Opposer\u2019s magazine \u2018The Architectural Record\u2019, has ever come to my attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-15\">\u201cThat Applicant\u2019s magazine \u2018Architecture and Design\u2019 is a magazine which is usually purchased by some one architect on account of the fact that his particular designs are illustrated in some particular issue, whereas Opposer\u2019s magazine \u2018The Architectural Record\u2019 is a regular trade magazine with a subscription list and is sold and distributed to architects and their affiliates in the building trade in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-16\">We have given the arguments made on \u25a0behalf of applicant full consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-17\">It is well known that there are published throughout the United States many newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals which bear, in whole or in part, the same titles. In what number titles of such publications have been registered as technical trade-marks under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, we are not advised, but, so far as we , are. advised, no question of the right so to register titles has ever been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>At any rate, applicant has not raised any question here respecting the validity of opposer\u2019s registrations, and applicant\u2019s right to register the title at issue as a technical trade-mark under the 1905 act must be considered under, and tested by, the statutes and rules applicable to registration of marks for merchandise. In other words, the periodicals of applicant and opposer must be regarded as merchandise in the sense in which the term \u201cmerchandise\u201d is used in section 5(b) of the 1905 trade-mark registration act, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 85(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">When so considered and tested, we agree with the conclusion reached by the Commissioner of Patents that applicant\u2019s mark is confusingly similar with op-poser\u2019s registered mark \u201cArchitecture,\u201d and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
