Neither did he state the times or places. <em>Held, </em>that while he was, perhaps, warranted in not giving the names of the persons because unknown to him, he is not warranted in omitting to state the times and places at which the offenses were committed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-10\">Irrelevant and redundant matter as defenses in such actions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-12\">Motion to make fifth paragraph in answer more definite and certain, <em>\u201c </em>by stating time and the name or names, and street or streets, or place or places, and the exact dates, with whom and where and when plaintiff has openly and notoriously prostituted herself for hire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-13\">The complaint was in the usual form by wife against her \u25a0husband for a divorce, <em>a vinculo, </em>on the ground of his adultery. The answer contained eight defenses; among others, that plaintiff was not his wife, and that he was never married to her, and denying any act of adultery on his part. The <em>fourth </em>defense alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s name was not Irene Tim, but was Irene Ashton. The <em>fifth </em>defense was as follows : \u201cThat, on the 20th day of March, 1869, the plaintiff was and ever since has been a common and notorious prostitute, and has, during all that time, openly and notoriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>prostituted herself for hire, and has, during all that time, at divers places in the .city of New York, committed adultery with divers men, 'hut with what particular men, or at what particular places in said city, this defendant is now unable to state more definitely. The <em>sixth </em>defense was an admission by defendant that he had committed \u201c adultery \u201d with the plaintiff, but that she was his mistress and not his wife, and that he had never held her out as such to the world, but that all his friends and acquaintances knew plaintiff to be his mistress and not his wife. The <em>seventh </em>defense alleged that he was engaged to be married to a very respectable young lady, of first-class standing in society, and the plaintiff becoming aware of the same, threatened to expose defendant\u2019s \u201c adulterous \u201d intercourse with her, and he, fearing exposure, paid her the sum of $800, and obtained from her a general release of all claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">The <em>eighth </em>defense charged that the action was only brought to extort money. Upon motion, justice Donohue struck out the fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth defenses, as irrelevant and redundant, holding that there were but two questions under the pleadings which were properly in issue, and material: <em>First. </em>Was the plaintiff the wife of the defendant ? <em>Second. </em>If she was, did plaintiff or defendant, or both, commit adultery? The motion to make <em>the'fifth </em>defense more definite and certain is now made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-6\"><em>George F. and J. C.
