That the affidavits were insufficient to give the judge jurisdiction to make the order of publication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">2d. That the order of publication was insufficient, as it did not direct the summons and complaint to be mailed, directed to Clarendon, the former place of residence of the defendant, and from which he had absconded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">We understand that the order appealed from proceeded on the last-mentioned ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-10\"><em>First. </em>The affidavits were amply sufficient to give the judge jurisdiction <em>(Affidavits John Smith, fols. </em>20 <em>to </em>24; <em>affidavits Horace J. Thomas, fols. </em>25 <em>to </em>29).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-11\">The affidavits show the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-12\">I. .That the plaintiff had a good cause of action against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-13\">2. That a summons and complaint in this action were duly issued to the sheriff of Orleans county, \u201c where the defendant resided tip to about first of June,\u201d 1860, for service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-14\">3. \u201c That the said sheriff endeavored to have the said summons and complaint served, but could not, for the reason defendant had absconded and left for California.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-15\">4. That, the sheriff wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that he had made diligent search for the defendant, for the purpose of serving said summons and complaint, and that defendant could not be found, for the reason that he had absconded and left for California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-16\">5. That plaintiff\u2019s attorney, then at the request of plaintiff, went to \u201c the late residence of the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ascertain what he could,\u201d relative to him; found some of his family still there, who refused to give any information about him, only that he had left\u2014was not there, but refused to give any information where he had gone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">6. The attorney then ascertained, from the immediate neighbors of the defendant, that he had gone to California; that he was largely indebted to various persons, some of whom were endeavoring to find him, for the purpose of serving process upon him, but were unable to do so by reason of his departure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">7. That before leaving he had executed a bill of sale of what property he left to his wife, who claimed to hold by virtue thereof <em>(Von Rhade </em>agt. <em>Von Rhade, </em>2 <em>N. Y. S. C. R., </em>491-495).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-7\">These affidavits are more than sufficient to give the judge jurisdiction to make the order; all that is requisite for this purpose is, that the affidavits should <em>tend to establish the facts, </em>of which the judge is required, by the statute, to he satisfied; and when such affidavits are produced, the judge acquires jurisdiction, and his acts are not void, although they may be erroneous and subject to be vacated on error or appeal <em>(Wells </em>agt. <em>Thornton, </em>45 <em>Barb., </em>390-394; <em>Collins </em>agt. <em>Ryan, </em>32 <em>id., </em>647; <em>Matter of Faulkner, </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>598, 601, 602; <em>Van Alstine </em>agt. <em>Erwin, </em>1 <em>Kern., </em>340, 341; <em>Skinnion </em>agt. <em>Kelley, </em>18 <em>N. Y., </em>355).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-8\">Within the authority of these cases the affidavits were sufficient, beyond all question, to give to the county judge jurisdiction to pass upon the question whether the order of publication should be made or not, and his order, therefore, was not void, whether the decision was such as this court would or would not have made on the same evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-9\"><em>Second. </em>The affidavits were not only sufficient to give the county judge jurisdiction, so that his order was not void, but were entirely sufficient to sustain the order, even if an application had been made at that time to set aside the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-10\">The affidavits furnished sufficient <em>jprima facie </em>evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>all the facts which the statute required to be shown to the satisfaction of the judge, to entitle the plaintiff to the order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">I will not repeat the affidavits, but refer the court to the above synopsis of them, and ask the court to compare them with the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\"><em>Third. </em>The order made by the judge was in all respects correct, and sufficient to justify the judgment afterwards entered in pursuance of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-7\">l\u00edo objection can be made to the order, except in the <em>direction </em>that the copy of the summons and complaint should be mailed to the defendant at San Francisco, California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-8\">The claim is, that it should have been directed to him at Clarendon, where he had resided, and where his family remained, on the ground that that was \u201c his place of residence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-9\">We deny that Clarendon was his place of residence, as shown by the affidavits. The affidavits show that Orleans county was \u201c where the defendant resided up to about the first of June.\u201d That that was \u201cthe late residence of the defendant.\u201d The summons was issued on the sixteenth of June, but could not be served, \u201c for the reason that defendant had absconded and left for California.\u201d \u201c That he was largely indebted -to various persons, some-of whom were endeavoring to find him, for the purpose of serving process on him, but could not, by reason of Ms departure.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-10\">That his family refused to give any information where he was-; that he had made a bill of sale of his property to his wife, who claimed to hold it by virtue thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-11\">This proves, <em>jpri/ma </em>faeie, the absconding of the defendant to California, to defraud his creditors, or to avoid the service of process. 'This proof is all the case admits of, as absconding debtors do not advertise their intentions, or take witnesses along with them to be sent back and testify to their movements and designs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-12\">\u201cA liberal indulgence must be extended to these proceedings, even upon questions of jurisdiction, if we would not render them a snare rather than a beneficial remedy \u201d <em>(Per </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Denio, <em>J., </em>11 <em>N. Y., </em>341; <em>Van Alstyne </em>agt. <em>Erwin). </em>The affidavits in this case were not so strong as in the present case, hut were held sufficient, by all the courts, to sustain an attachment against the - defendant as an absconding debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">So in this case, the <em>affidavits </em>were <em>sufficient to show </em>(however the fact might be) that Matson had absconded to California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">The fact that his family remained in Clarendon was not <em>conclusive </em>on that question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">If he absconded to California <em>without </em>an intention to return, his residence no longer remained in Orleans county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">The judge, from the affidavits, might well have concluded, and no doubt did so, that such was his intention. His order was therefore correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-9\">We may concede that the order to mail the summons and complaint to San Francisco was of ho service, because that was not shown to be his residence. But it was shown by the affidavits that that was as near as his residence could be ascertained, which was equivalent to saying that his residence could not be ascertained, and <em>that rendered any order to serve by mail unnecessary (Code, </em>\u00a7 135).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-10\">It is no answer to .this position to say that then Matson was not \u201ca resident of this state,\u201d within subdivision 2 of section 135, when the summons was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-11\">He was \u201c a resident of this state \u201d <em>when he </em>absconded, and that is all that the statute requires. It was intended to apply to just such a case as this appears on the papers to be, the case of a debtor absconding and taking his residence with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-12\">The statute does not contemplate that in such a case the summons and complaint shall be mailed to him at his <em>\u201c </em>late residence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-13\">If his residence, <em>when the order is applied </em>for, is known, or can with reasonable diligence be ascertained, the order must provide for service by mail addressed <em>to such place of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>residence. </em>If not known, or not capable of being ascertained, then no mail service is required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARy\">That we used due diligence to ascertain the residence, and failed, is clearly shown. We went to his \u201clate residence,\u201d inquired of such of his family as remained there, and of his late neighbors, without success.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>But whether the judge decided correctly or not, the affidavits were sufficient to require him to decide the question where the summons and complaint should be directed, and his order, though possibly erroneous, was not void <em>(Pinckney </em>agt. Hageman, 4 <em>Lans., </em>374; <em>Van Alstyne </em>agt. Erwin, 11 <em>N.

The criticism which the defendant\u2019s counsel asks us to indulge in would, if generally applied to such proceedings, render them extremely hazardous, not only to the parties setting them on foot, but to the officers concerned in their execution; for when we determine that a sufficient case was not made for the exercise of the judgment of the officer, we must consider the judge and all the parties trespassers in whatever they do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-8\">The opinion of judge Smith, in <em>Wells </em>agt. <em>Thornton, above cited </em>(45 <em>Barb., </em>393, 394), covers this case.

It is doubtful whether the statute in relation to the service of summons by publication <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 135) does not authorize (where the defendant is an absconding or concealed resident of the state) a general judgment, without previous attachment or seizure of any property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-10\">If that be the true interpretation of the statute, the court cannot by general rule deprive the party of the benefit of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-11\">The difference between subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 135 would seem to justify this position. Under subdivision 3, the rawi-resident cannot be proceeded against <em>unless he has property i/n this state.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-12\">But under subdivision 2, the absconding or concealed <em>resident </em>can be proceeded against, <em>whether he has any property in the state or not. </em>If this be so, Rule 34 cannot apply to cases under <em>subdivision </em>2, but only to cases under <em>subdivision </em>3. <em>Subdivision </em>3 <em>of section </em>246 tends to support our position.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-13\">2. That part of Rule 34 which requires the filing of security, for restitution, as the condition of entering the judgment, cannot be reconciled with the last paragraph of section 246 of the Oode.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-14\">That paragraph gives the discretion to the court that pronounces the judgment, to be exercised in each particular case according to its circumstances. It is at least questionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>whether the court can, consistently with the statute, <em>adjudicate in ad/oance </em>every such case that can arise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\"><em>Second. </em>But conceding the perfect validity of Buie 34, the failure to observe it by the court, in pronouncing judgment, renders such judgment erroneous or irregular, but not a nullity <em>(McNamara on Nullities and </em>Irregularities, 4, 5 <em>to </em>9, 87, <em>Law Library). </em>At page 7, Colebidge, J., is quoted as saying: \u201cIt is difficult sometimes to distinguish between an irregularity and a nullity; but I think the safest rule to determine what is an irregularity and what is a nullity is to see whether the party can waive the objection., If he can waive it, it amounts to an irregularity; if he cannot, It is a nullity.\u201d <em>TJie ease stated by way of illustration fully sustains owr position in this case (Horion </em>agt. Auchmoody, 7 <em>Wend., </em>202, 203; <em>Relyea </em>agt. <em>Ramsay, </em>2 <em>id., </em>604; <em>see cases cited on printed points, p. </em>3). The true rule must be that where the court has jurisdiction to render <em>any judgment, </em>the entry of a wrong judgment is an error or irregularity merely, and not a nullity. In cases of doubt, courts hold the proceedings to be irregularities rather than nullities <em>(McNamara, p. </em>6).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\"><em>Third. </em>If the judgment was erroneous or irregular merely, and not a nullity, then the defendant was too late with his motion <em>(See printed point V., and statutes and cases there cited; Soulden </em>agt. <em>Cook, </em>4 <em>Wend., </em>217).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-8\">The defendant has no merits, and after the notice given him thirteen years ago, and what he then said, he should not be relieved at this day.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-9\"><em>H.

What the sheriff wrote who had the summons, and what defendant\u2019s neighbors said to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on this question, are hearsay and not legal facts. The attorney does not state conversations with the neighbors, but gives his own conclusions \u2014 what he \u201cascertained\u201d from his conversations with them. This is not evidence upon which the judge had the power, judicially, to act <em>(Campbell </em>agt. <em>McCormick, </em>1 <em>How. P.

The defect is that the affidavits do not state evidence or proof tending to establish any of the particulars required by the Code, except the cause of action and the issuing of the summons.

The affidavit of Thomas, if it shows anything, proves that the defendant was a resident of the county of Orleans, June 1, 1860, and it states no fact tending to show that he did not continue to reside there at the date of the affidavit, August 15,1860, or that he did not reside there continuously. But, on the contrary, the facts sworn to show that he \u201c was a farmer and occupied a farm and carried it on, and had left his family in possession thereof, crops upon it, with team and farming utensils; a large quantity of firewood, and other personal property, and had some interest in the farm occupied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>him,\u201d were strong if not conclusive evidence that he then resided there. Therefore, as defendant\u2019s place of residence was known to the plaintiffs attorney to be in Orleans county, as shown by his affidavit, and as there was no evidence that he resided at San Francisco, California, the order, directing the summons and complaint to be sent to him through the post-office at that place, was void <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 135; <em>Hallet </em>agt. <em>Righters &amp; Salter, </em>13 <em>How.
