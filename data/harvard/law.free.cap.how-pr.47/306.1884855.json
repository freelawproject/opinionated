Y., </em>19) and <em>Stryker </em>agt. <em>Mott </em>(2 Paige, 387) were cases where the testatQr had declared that his <em>reed estate </em>should be under the charge, <em>management </em>and <em>disposition of his executors. </em>That the same should not be <em>sold or aliened; </em>but his executors and the survivor of them should lease the same, receive the rents and profits, and pay them over to certain of the devisees annually, and with power to <em>lease to the devisees. </em>The court, held that the will gave the executors such control over the real estate as necessarily required that they should hold the legal title, and hence a trust must be implied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">So in the case of <em>Bradley </em>agt. <em>Amidon, </em>the court held that the will gave the executor a control over the lands, <em>rents </em>and profits, which <em>necessarily repaired </em>that he should hold the <em>legal </em>title, and hence a trust must be implied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">All these cases are widely different from this, and I think the contestants\u2019 counsel will search in vain for a case like this, one in which the court has ever held that the executor necessarily took the legal title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-10\">III.

In the case of <em>Dodge </em>agt. <em>Pond, </em>judge Selden, speaking of what the testator has a legal right to do, says: \u201c He may give vested legacies and provide for their payment at a future day,\u201d and then he proceeds to show that the absolute ownership is not suspended in such a case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">The legacies in this case were vested beyond question <em>(Patterson </em>agt. <em>Ellis, </em>11 <em>Wend., </em>259; <em>Hone </em>agt. <em>Van Schaick, </em>20 <em>Wend., </em>564).

There1 is no difficulty in carrying out the general scheme of the will and declaring the direction for accumulation void. The court held, in <em>Ka/ne </em>agt. <em>Astor (5th of Sand., </em>467), that it is a paramount principle that the court shall carry out the general intent of the testator; and where a particular word, sentence or provision is repugnant to the general intent and design of the whole will, such word, sentence or provision must give way, rather than sacrifice the whole scheme of disposition disclosed by the' general tenor of the instrument. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-9\">This is in harmony with numerous decisions of the courts, and this brings us to the inquiry\u2014what was the general scheme in the testator\u2019s mind, as appears by the will itself?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>1.

The provision, that the executors should hold it for distribution and in. the meantime for accumulation, instead of being the foundation of the scheme and the pivot on which everything else turns, it was a <em>mere incident </em>to the scheme itself. It was simply <em>Ms way </em>of <em>distriiution </em>and settlement of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">Can it with any justice or even plausibility be said that the scheme of the will fails- and that the intention of the testator cannot be carried out because it cannot be done in just the way he intended, because the residuary legatees will receive somewhat less than, they otherwise would <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-10\">In all the cases to which I have referred and others^ where the court has held the direction to accumulate void, and yet has sustained the will, of course the intention of the testator was not fully carried out; but I have not found a case in which they did not carry out the general intention of the testator, wherever it could be done, although the direction to accumulate was declared void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-11\">The property in this case amounts, as appears by the eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>plaint, to $8,626.79. Giving Minnie Gray her $500, we have left $8,126.79. Paying the next three legacies of $2,000 each, we have still remaining $2,126.79; and, if the additional $500 is paid to Minnie Gray, there will remain $1,626.79 to go to the residuary legatees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">Why will not this carry out the intention of the testator ?

The real estate might have been held for accumulation without sale. The sale was necessary in order to pay the legacies, and is in no way illegal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">The,counsel for the contestants in this case claims that the real estate must be regarded as converted into personal property, and the whole fund must be treated as personal property, and the questions arising must be determined by the law applicable to personal property; and yet, again, he claims that the power to sell must be held to be a part of the illegal scheme, and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-10\">If so, then there has been no sale of the real estate, and it is not converted into personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-11\">The policy of the law is that wills shall be favored and sustained, and courts will see to it that the intention of a testator is not defeated in any case where it can be substantially carried out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-12\">In this case the testator had no lineal descendants.

Counsel for the heirs admits that Minnie Gray is entitled to the $500 in the section second; and yet the objections urged against the remaining bequests would seem to be quite as applicable to that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-20\"><em>Third. </em>The residuum or \u201c balance of the estate \u201d is given directly and absolutely to the three societies named in the eleventh section; the division to be made <em>\u201c </em>at the final settlement of the estate,\u201d whenever that may be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj7m\">I. It is true the accumulation mentioned in the ninth section, if legal, would add to the amount these residuary legatees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>would receive at the times therein mentioned ; but the direction for accumulation is clearly void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-5\">II. This being a direct gift of personal property and of its income to be accumulated, after or upon a future event certain, <em>without any </em>trust, the accumulation being illegal, the residuary legatees will take the income presently, and as it accrues (Sutherland, J., <em>n Lovett </em>agt. Kvngsland, 44 <em>Barb., </em>575).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">ITT. And it is upon this principle that Minnie Gray can take under the second section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>These defendants, therefore, submit that the several bequests in this will should be declared valid, and that only so much of the ninth section as is in conflict with the law against accumulations, be declared void.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b330-8\">Morgan,</author>\n<p id=\"A8r\">J.\u2014There is no dispute as to the facts of this case. The testator\u2019s estate was of the value of about $8,626.74; his real estate, consisting of a house and lot, was of the value of $3,000. He bequeathed the use of his real and personal estate to his wife, in case she survived him, during her natural life, and so much of the principal as might be necessary for her comfortable support. He then gave legacies of $100 and $400 to Minnie Gray, which are admitted to be valid. Next he gave legacies of $2,000 each, to three theological institutions, to be paid in the order named. Hext he gave specific legacies of certain books to two institutions named, of no great value. As these legacies amounted to $6,500, the personal estate, liable to be diminished by the bequest to the testator\u2019s wife, would not be sufficient to pay them, unless it were suffered to accumulate according to the directions of the testator in the ninth clause, or unless it should be increased by adding to it the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. The testator, however, made ample provision for the creation of a fund sufficient to pay these legacies; and, anticipating a residue, made provision for the disposition of that also.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">His wife having died prior to his death, no question can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>arise as to the bequest to her. \u00a1Nor is it perceived how the bequest of a life estate to her can affect the validity of the subsequent provisions of his will. ,</p>\n<p id=\"AOP\">It might have been an interesting inquiry, if she had survived the testator, to ascertain in whom the reversion of the real estate vested; because it was not devised, in terms, to any one, and it certainly could not be in abeyance, awaiting the action of the executors to convert it into personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"AMH\">The whole question in dispute arises out of the provisions of the ninth clause of the will. By that clause the executors are directed, as soo\u00f1 as convenient after the death of the testator and his wife, to sell all his real and personal property, except his United States bonds and his stock in the Skaneateles Iron Works, and invest the proceeds for accumulation, and to hold the whole amount, including the bonds and stock, for accumulation for five years. The executors are then directed, after the expiration of said five years, to convert the said, accumulation into cash (except the stock in the Skaneateles Iron Works), and to pay the three legacies of $2,000 each to the three theological institutions in the order named, so far as said accumulation shall provide for such payment. They are directed to hold the stock in the Skaneateles IronWorks five years longer; and, at the expiration of that period, the said stock and the accumulations thereof are to be converted into cash by the executors, and the remaining portion of the three legacies above mentioned paid. Afterward, on a final settlement of the estate, if there are sufficient funds, the executors are required to-give Minnie Gray an additional $500, if in their judgment she shall have used the previous bequest in a careful and prudent manner ; and the residue, after payment of all the previous bequests, the executors are directed to divide equally between three religions societies therein named.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">It will therefore be seen that, as to.the real estate, the testator, without any words of gift or devise, clothes his executors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>with a power of sale, and they are to take the proceeds as personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">After realizing the cash from a sale of the real and personal property, they are directed to hold it five years for accumulation, and then convert it again into cash and pay the three legacies of $2,000 each in the order named, so far as said accumulation shall provide funds for that purpose. Of course this fund must be under the control of the executors, and must be invested, collected and reinvested in their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In my opinion the authority given to sell the real estate is a power <em>m trust, </em>and the proceeds of the sale of both the real and personal property are by necessary implication given to the executors, <em>m trust, </em>to manage for the purpose of raising a fund out of which to pay the $6,000 in legacies, limited to take effect after five years; and the contingent legacy to Minnie Gray, and the residuary legacies, to take effect, if at all, after a? term of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">It is admitted that the direction for accumulation must be regarded as illegal and void. In that ease the annual income would belong to the next of kin or the residuary legatees. \u2019 If it should be determined that it belonged to the <em>residuary legatees, </em>the testator would succeed in evading the statute, for he would .be allowed to do indirectly what he is not permitted to do directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">A great many questions may arise out of the peculiar provisions of this will which it will be unnecessary to determine, as I have arrived at certain definite results which will dispose of the case and which I will proceed to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">(1.) Although there is no <em>trust term </em>granted to the executors, in words, such a term is necessarily to be implied. The directions to sell the real estate and to convert all his property into cash (with certain exceptions), and to hold the proceeds for a term of five years, with directions to invest the same in the meantime, and after payment of certain legacies to hold his stock in the Skaneateles Iron Works five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>longer, and after paying the balance of the three legacies of \u00a72,000 each, to divide the residue, which they may diminish by an exercise of discretion in giving another \u00a7500 to Minnie Gray, impose upon the executors active duties as trustees of his estate, as much as though' the testator had, in terms, described them as such. The executors necessarily took the legal title and the right to the possession of the property, if the directions of the testator can be sustained according to \u25a0 his manifest intention. Even as to real estate, courts have implied an estate in the executors <em>as trustees, </em>although no estate was given to them in words <em>(Perry on Trusts </em>\u00a7 313; <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>231, 239; <em>Brewster </em>agt. <em>Striker, </em>2 <em>N. Y., </em>19). And certainly there is no reason why the executors should not be deemed to have the legal title to the personal estate when similar duties are enjoined upon them <em>(See Knox </em>agt. <em>Jones, </em>47 <em>N. Y, </em>396). Personal property is subject to trusts as well as real estate, and the statute of perpetuities can no more be violated in the disposition of personal property than of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">(2.) The trust estate given to the executors cannot be sustained. It is limited to five years and ten years, and such a term is unauthorized <em>(Hone </em>agt. <em>Van Schaick, </em>7 <em>Paige, </em>233)..</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">(3.) The gifts of the three legacies of \u00a72,000 each are limited to take effect after a prescribed period of accumulation, and to be paid out of the accumulated fund as part of the subject matter of the gifts. The period being too remote, the gifts must fail <em>(Perry on Trusts, </em>\u00a7 396). Legacies dependent on a void trust fall with it <em>(Arnold </em>agt. <em>Gilbert, </em>3 <em>Scmd. Ch. P., </em>531; <em>Armory </em>agt. <em>Lord, </em>9 <em>N. Y., </em>403).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">A gift is too remote, unless, according to the intention of the testator, some person must necessarily be in. existence with legal power to dispose of the property within the period limited by the rules of law <em>(Curtis </em>agt. <em>Lunkin, </em>5 <em>Beav., </em>147; <em>Palmer </em>agt. <em>Holford, </em>4 <em>Russ., </em>403). If the trust exceed this boundary, it is void <em>in toto, </em>and cannot be cut down to the- legitimate extent <em>(Lewin on Trusts, </em>71, 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The gifts in the second clause, of $100 and $400 to-Minnie 'Gray, are entirely separable from the legacies subsequently \u25a0given, and also from the trust scheme, and may be sustained; for the statute against perpetuities only cuts off estates which .\u25a0are limited to take effect after the prescribed limit (Denio, J., <em>in Post </em>agt. Hover, 33 <em>N. </em>Y., 598).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u25a0(4.) As the trust must be declared void for contravening the statute of perpetuities,.the real estate of the testator will \u25a0descend to his heirs-at-law (1 <em>P. S., 123, </em>\u00a7 14; <em>Post </em>agt. Hover, supra, 599). And of course the personal estate must be distributed to the next of kin:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">(5.) These conclusions have been arrived at, although the decisions cited by the counsel for the legatees clearly show \u25a0that in construing wills the' court is at liberty to reject the \u2022direction for accumulation. If there was a valid trust, the gift might take effect by rejecting these directions; but the difficulty is, that the trust is in direct contravention of the ' statute of perpetuities, and the legacies of $2,000 each, as well as the contingent legacy, are only to take effect upon the termination of a trust which is void. If the gifts are paid, they must be paid by the executors after five and ten years, for the period cannot be shortened ; and they cannot be paid out of the fund provided for that purpose by the testator, but in due course of administration. This would entirely defeat the scheme devised by the testator for the disposition of his estate; and I do not think the courts are at liberty to strike out the trust term, as well as the directions for accumulation, for the purpose of paying legacies which are made dependent upon it. g This would not be carrying out the will of the testator, but, in effect, making a new will.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">If I am right in these conclusions, the result will be that \u25a0the executors had no authority to sell the1 real estate for the purpose of creating a fund as directed by the testator; nor was there any valid conversion of the real into personal estate. It was not the intention of the testator that the real estate should be converted into money for the purpose of distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>tion among his next of kin. There could he no conversion legally effected for the purpose of funding the <em>trust estate; </em>and no other object was contemplated in authorizing a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The bequests to Minnie G-ray of $100 and $400 are valid and should be paid out of the personal estate. The specific bequests of books in the seventh and eighth clauses of the will are also valid. The other legacies must fail with the void trust, upon the termination of which they were to take effect. Judgment must be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
