That on the next Tuesday, about May 2, 1871, the defendant Catharine requested, the plaintiff to leave the premises and surrender possession. That no rent was due till the Saturday night next ensuing. * *' * That thereupon, and on Tuesday, and Wednesday, May the third, the defendant unlawfully, and with a strong hand, entered said rooms and took therefrom portions of plaintiff\u2019s furniture, etc., and carried them down stairs to her wood shed, and attempted to take forcible possession of the said premises without due process of law, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s wishes and her rights, and that the defendant unlawfully and wrongfully interfered with plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">The referee certified <em>\u201c </em>that it was a disputed and litigated question at the trial as to whether the plaintiff was or not a tenant or trespasser upon the premises; that it was disputed as to whether the rent was paid up till the Saturday following the Tuesday when the cause of action arose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">The referee assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at twenty-five dollars, and directed judgment for that amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">The defendants now move to have the costs of plaintiff stricken from the judgment, and for an order that costs be taxed in their favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-8\"><em>Wynn &amp; </em>Porter, for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-9\"><em>D. </em>O'Brien, for plaintiff, opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b91-10\">Hardin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axc\">To enable the plaintiff to recover it was only necessary to allege and prove:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">1. The actual possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">2. Wrongful entry by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"AGc\">3. The damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>A general denial of these allegations, and evidence confined to them, would not have presented upon the pleadings or upon the trial the title to real property, nor <em>\u201c </em>a claim of title \u201d (7 <em>Wend., </em>495; 15 <em>Abb., </em>449).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">But the defendant alleged a right to interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s possession. The referee certifies \u201c it was a disputed and litigated question as to whether the- plaintiff was or not a tenant or trespasser upon the premises; \u201d and he also certifies \u201c it was disputed as to whether the rent was paid up till the Saturday following the Tuesday when the cause of. action arose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">It thus appears that the trial was not upon the question of actual possession of the plaintiff of the premises, <em>but the plaintiff\u2019s right to the possession </em>was challenged and disputed or brought in question upon the trial, and that question was determined by the referee in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u2022 The issue made by the plaintiff in respect to plaintiff\u2019s right of possession brought <em>\u201c </em>a claim of title to real property in question at the trial\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 304).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">In <em>Wile </em>agt. <em>Quackeribuss </em>(6 <em>Hill, </em>538), Beardsly, J., Clearly points out the distinction between an issue as <em>Aactual </em>possession and an issue as <em>to the right of possession, </em>and declares that the issue as to <em>the right of possession </em>involves a question as to a claim of title to real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The same principle has been asserted in numerous other cases, and controls the question presented here <em>(Rathbone </em>agt. <em>McConnell, </em>20 <em>Barb., </em>311; <em>S. C. affirmed, </em>21 <em>N. Y., </em>466; <em>Powell </em>agt. <em>Reese, </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>567; <em>Brownell </em>agt. <em>Kelly, </em>10 <em>How., </em>406 <em>and </em>414; <em>Muller </em>agt. <em>Beyard, </em>15 <em>Abb., </em>449; <em>Main </em>agt. <em>Cooper, </em>26 <em>Barb., </em>468; 25 <em>How., </em>289; <em>Croven </em>agt. Price, 53 <em>Barb., </em>443).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The. plaintiff is entitled to the costs of the action, and the motion is, therefore, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
