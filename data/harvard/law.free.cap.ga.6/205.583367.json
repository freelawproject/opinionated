Tried before Judge Alexander, November Term, 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-8\">Suit was commenced in the Superior Court of Muscogee County, on a note made by Lorenzo M. Biggers and Joseph Biggers, for the sum of $908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-9\">The defendants pleaded that said note was given for certain negroes, and among others, Betty; and that the consideration had partially failed in this, that said negro was imbecile in her mind, so as to be incapable of performing the ordinary duties and labors of a slave ; and farther pleaded, that the said Nelson had, at the time of the purchase, warranted the said negro to be \u201c healthy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-10\">Upon the trial, the following bill of sale was given in evidence : Georgia, Harris County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-11\">This, January 30th, 1844, received of L.

The defendant warrants the negroes to be slaves, and to be \u201c healthy.\u201d Does the warranty that the negroes are \u201chealthy,\u201d extend to soundness of mind? We think not, when taken in the common acceptation of the term. The term \u201c healthy\u201d properly applies to the sound condition of the body, and not to the mind. We do not say a person has a <em>healthy </em>mind, when we wish to convey the idea of a sound intellect, nor do we say a person has an <em>unhealthy </em>mind, when we wish to convey the idea of a weak intellect. A general .warranty of soundness, would, in our opinion, extend both to the body and mind of the slave, because the term sound is more comprehensive than the term healthy \u2014 hence we say, sound in body and mind, sound-minded man, good sound sense, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">The usual term \u201c sound,\u201d being omitted in this bill of sale, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the term \u201c healthy\u201d only inserted, we think it may fairly he presumed that it was the intention of the contracting parties, that the warranty should only extend to the body of the slave, and not to her mind. No decided case, directly in point, has been cited at the bar, nor have we been able to find any. For the reasons already given, let the judgment of the Court below be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
