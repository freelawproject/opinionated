The Court ruled it was not a good and valid statutory bond, and, we think, properly so ruled, for the reason, it appears, on the face of the bond, to have been taken and approved by only <em>two Justices </em>of the Inferior Court, whereas, by the 46th section of the Judiciary Act of 1799, Sheriff\u2019s bonds are required tobe <em>approved </em>by the Justices of the Inferior Court, or any <em>three of them.
