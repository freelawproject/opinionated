Hawk, was convicted of two counts of rape and sentenced to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2005, Hawk filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Athens County, to vacate his sentence. Hawk claimed that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Hawk\u2019s petition did not include an affidavit containing a description of each civil action or appeal of a civil action he had filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court, as required by R.C. 2969.25(A). Also, although Hawk claimed to be indigent, he did not include in his affidavit the statements required by R.C. 2969.25(C)(1), setting forth the balance in his inmate account for each of the preceding six months, as certified by his prison cashier, and the value of all other items of value owned by the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 4} On March 2, 2005, the court of appeals dismissed the petition for failure to comply with R.C. 2969.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. \u201c \u2018The requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory, and failure to comply with them subjects an inmate\u2019s action to dismissal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.
