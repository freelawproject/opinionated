R.C. 4121.121(B)(7) and 4121.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent Capital Coin Fund Limited (\u201cCapital I\u201d) was organized in 1998, and respondent Capital Coin Fund Limited II (\u201cCapital II\u201d) was organized in 2001, to facilitate the bureau\u2019s investment in rare coins. Capital I and Capital II are limited-liability companies engaged principally in buying and selling rare coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">{\u00b6 4} Beginning in 1998 and continuing until May 2005, Conrad authorized the bureau to invest in rare coins through these companies by using the State Insurance Fund\u2019s surplus and reserve. Capital I was organized with an initial contribution of $25,000,000 from the bureau and contributions from other organizers amounting to only $10,000. In sum, the bureau.has contributed at least $50,000,000 to these companies, and under the terms of the operating agreement between the coin funds and the bureau, has an ownership interest of at least 80 percent in them. The bureau is the sole investor in the companies other than their organizer-managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>{\u00b6 5} During this time, coins purchased by Capital I and Capital II on behalf of or for the account of the bureau were held by the companies or by dealers or other custodians designated by the companies; prior to May 2005, the bureau did not hold the coins. The dealers and other custodians would sell coins on behalf of or for the account of the bureau, either returning the proceeds less a fee or commission or investing the proceeds in other coins or investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 6} Capital I and Capital II purportedly kept records regarding the purchase, possession, and sale of coins and other transactions by or on behalf of the bureau. The companies\u2019 operating agreement provides that the bureau is entitled, at all times during reasonable business hours, to inspect the companies\u2019 books and to \u201chave on demand true and full information of all things affecting\u201d the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 7} On May 9, 2005, following widespread public disclosure of the existence of the bureau\u2019s coin investments, Conrad announced that the bureau would liquidate the investments and terminate its relationship with Capital I and Capital II.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 8} Relator, the Toledo Blade Company (\u201cBlade\u201d), is an operating division of Block Communications, Inc., and is principally engaged in the publication of a newspaper of general circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 9} On March 23, 2005, the Blade requested that the bureau provide access to records regarding the bureau\u2019s relationship with Capital I and Capital II and the bureau\u2019s investment in coins. On April 28, 2005, the bureau provided the Blade with access to reports of audits conducted for the bureau of inventories of coins in which the bureau had an interest or that were purchased with bureau funds and held by Capital I, Capital II, or third-party custodians designated by these companies. The bureau, however, initially redacted these audit reports, concealing the identities of specific coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 10} On April 26, 2005, the Blade requested that the bureau provide access to records of purchase and sale transactions involving coins in which the bureau had an interest or that were purchased with bureau funds. The request included records of each transaction from 1998 to the present, identifying the purchaser, seller, coins purchased and sold, and sale price. The bureau advised the Blade that these records were in the possession of Capital I and Capital II and that the bureau would request the companies to supply copies of these records to the Blade. The Blade did not receive these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 11} On May 11, 2005, the Blade filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus against respondents: the bureau, its administrator, Capital I, and Capital II. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Blade requests the writ to compel respondents to provide access to the requested records, including the bureau\u2019s unredacted audit reports of coin inventories and the companies\u2019 records documenting coin transactions involving coins in which the bureau had an interest. The Blade also requests an award of attorney fees. On June 16, 2005, respondents answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 12} In their answer, respondents assert that except for the transactional documents, they have now provided copies of the requested records to the Blade. They claim that they have provided the identity of the specific coins that they had previously deleted from audit reports and inventory records. Respondents further contend that the \u201c[acquisition costs\u201d within the requested transactional documents, which they have not released, \u201cconstitute trade secrets and may affect the ability of the Funds to recoup their investments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 13} This case is now before the court for its S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 14} Pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5), we must now determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Morrow Cty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 172, 2005-Ohio-685, 824 N.E.2d 64, \u00b6 4. Because it appears beyond doubt that the Blade is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief, a peremptory writ will be granted. <em>Dispatch Printing Co., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 172, 2005-Ohio-685, 824 N.E.2d 64, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 15} Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to seek compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Winkler, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 382, 2004-Ohio-1581, 805 N.E.2d 1094, \u00b6 4. And R.C. 149.43 \u201c \u2018is construed liberally in favor of broad access, and any doubt is resolved in favor of disclosure of public records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilbert v. Summit Cty., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 660, 2004-Ohio-7108, 821 N.E.2d 564, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hamilton Cty. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 374, 376, 662 N.E.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 16} The Blade\u2019s mandamus claim for unredacted audit reports of coin-inventory records is moot because respondents have now provided these records. See <em>State ex rel. Cranford v. Cleveland, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 196, 2004-Ohio-4884, 814 N.E.2d 1218, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 8 (\u201c \u2018In general, the provision of requested records to a relator in a public-records mandamus case renders the mandamus claim moot\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 17} The Blade also requests respondents\u2019 coin-transaction records. Respondents claim that these records are not subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43, because they \u201care not records kept by a public office,\u201d and the \u201c[acquisition costs within these [records] constitute trade secrets and may affect the ability of [respondents] to recoup their investments.\u201d For the following reasons, we hold that respondents\u2019 claims are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 18} The requested records meet the definition of \u201cpublic record,\u201d which means \u201crecords kept by any public office.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). The bureau is a state agency, which is included in the definition of a public office. See R.C. 149.011(A) (\u201c \u2018Public office\u2019 includes any state agency * * * or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government\u201d) and (B) (\u201c \u2018State agency\u2019 includes every * * * bureau * * * or other organized body established by the constitution and laws of this state for the exercise of any function of state government\u201d). The requested documents serve to \u201cdocument the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office\u201d so as to constitute records for purposes of the Public Records Act. R.C. 149.011(G). The requested documents were created by or on behalf of the bureau and its administration in furtherance of the administrator\u2019s statutory authority under R.C. 4123.44 to \u201cinvest any of the surplus or reserve belonging to the state insurance fund.\u201d They document those investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 19} Records in the possession of Capital I and Capital II are also subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43. These companies are public offices for purposes of the Public Records Act because they are entities \u201cestablished by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d Under R.C. 4123.44, the administrator of the bureau was authorized to invest certain bureau funds: the surplus or reserve belonging to the state insurance fund. These funds are invested, and all cash, securities, and other property are held \u201cin the name of the bureau.\u201d R.C. 4121.121(B)(7). Moreover, the coin companies were capitalized almost entirely by, and indeed owe their very existence to, money furnished by the bureau through the State Insurance Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 20} Even assuming that these limited-liability companies are not public offices as defined in R.C. 149.011(A), the records in the possession of Capital I and Capital II are still subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43. R.C. 149.43(C) permits a mandamus action against either \u201ca public office or the person responsible for the public record\u201d to compel compliance with the Public Records Act. This provision \u201cmanifests an intent to afford access to public records, even when a private entity is responsible for the records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 37, 39, 550 N.E.2d 464. \u201cIn order for a private entity to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>subject to R.C. 149.43, (1) it must prepare the records in order to carry out a public office\u2019s responsibilities, (2) the public office must be able to monitor the private entity\u2019s performance, and (3) the public office must have access to the records for this purpose.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Krings </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 654, 657, 758 N.E.2d 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 21} Capital I and Capital II maintain records in order to carry out the bureau\u2019s investment authority. The bureau can monitor the companies\u2019 performance and can inspect the companies\u2019 records and demand information in furtherance of their monitoring function. And it is has been reported that the bureau is now in control of Capital I and Capital II.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 22} The acquisition costs in the coin-transaction records do not constitute trade secrets, even if their disclosure would affect the ability of respondents to recoup their investments. In order for this information to constitute a trade secret exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43, it must appear to have been \u201cthe subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d R.C. 1333.61(D)(2). See, also, <em>State ex rel. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Ohio Environmental Protection Agency </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 166, 172, 724 N.E.2d 411; <em>State ex rel. Fisher v. PRC Pub. Sector, Inc. </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 387, 394, 650 N.E.2d 945. Respondents do not allege that they made any effort toward maintaining the secrecy of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 23} We recognize that in general, when a governmental body asserts that public records are exempt from disclosure and that assertion is challenged, an in camera inspection and further evidence and briefing are normally warranted. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 23, 31, 661 N.E.2d 180. Here, however, given the unique circumstances of this case, it appears beyond doubt that the requested records are public records subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43. Therefore, a peremptory writ is appropriate. See, e.g., <em>Dispatch Printing Co., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 172, 2005-Ohio-685, 824 N.E.2d 64, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 24} The Blade is also entitled to attorney fees it incurred in bringing this mandamus action. The public has an unquestioned financial interest in a state agency\u2019s and state administrator\u2019s investment of public funds, and so the Blade has established a public benefit. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Consumer News Serv., Inc. v. Worthington City Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 58, 2002-Ohio-5311, 776 N.E.2d 82, \u00b6 53. In addition, respondents have failed to comply with these legitimate records requests for invalid reasons. See <em>Dispatch Printing Co., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 172, 2005-Ohio-685, 824 N.E.2d 64, \u00b6 19. We order the Blade\u2019s counsel to submit a bill and documentation of evidence in support of its request for attorney fees, in accordance with the guidelines of DR 2-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>{\u00b625} Therefore, based on the foregoing, we grant a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel respondents to provide access to the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-6\">Gorman, Karpinski and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b234-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs and writes separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b234-8\">Bryant and Grady, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b234-9\">Thomas F.

Conrad has since resigned as administrator of the bureau and has been replaced by Tina Kielmeyer. Under Civ.R. 25(D)(1), as made applicable to this ease by S.Ct.Prac.R. X(2), Kielmeyer is automatically substituted for Conrad in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\">. In separate eases, a state senator and a different newspaper publishing company requested similar records from the bureau and its administrator. <em>[State ex </em>rel.] <em>Dann v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>case No. 2005-0913; <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>case No. 2005-0923. In <em>Dann, </em>however, the parties filed a joint application for dismissal without prejudice on June 22, 2005. In <em>Dispatch Printing Co., </em>the Dispatch filed an application of dismissal on June 23, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b234-14\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AvI\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">{\u00b6 26} From the outset, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation\u2019s \u201ctrade secret\u201d argument seemed more a delaying tactic than a legitimate legal issue. I concur that the bureau\u2019s acquisition costs are not a trade secret under R.C. 1333.61(D)(2). Additionally, I would hold that the acquisition costs do not constitute a trade secret under R.C. 1333.61(D)(1), which requires that the information at issue \u201cderives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by * * *, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">{\u00b6 27} How much the bureau paid for coins is irrelevant to how much they can be sold for. The market is the market. That is especially true in situations where, as here, the items sold are rare and unique. Also, any willing buyer would expect that since Ohio had an expert purchasing coins on the state\u2019s behalf, that expertise would allow the state to buy coins at bargain prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">{\u00b628} Further, the state reportedly has hired Sotheby\u2019s to sell the coin inventory. Presumably, that firm\u2019s expertise will allow the state to know the value of what it owns. The state will be an informed seller, and buyers will therefore know that the eventual selloff will not be akin to a garage sale where someone sells a Rembrandt for five dollars. The state will know what it is selling and what it is worth. And with bureau assets of over $21 billion, according to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>2004 annual report, the state can afford to wait if it does not immediately get the price it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">{\u00b6 29} Caveat emptor.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b235-5\">Grady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AuH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 30} I would not issue a peremptory writ of mandamus but would instead issue an alternative writ for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 31} This original action is governed by S.Ct.Prac.R. X. Section 1 of that rule expressly provides that the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2731 (\u201cMandamus\u201d) are applicable. Section 2 states: \u201cThe Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure shall supplement these rules unless clearly inapplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 2731.06 provides that an alternative writ is required in mandamus actions instead of a peremptory writ unless \u201cit is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for not\u201d performing the act that the writ would command. The Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation cites and relies on R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v), which exempts \u201c[r]ecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law\u201d from the requirements of the Public Records Act. R.C. 1333.61 et seq. prohibits release of trade secrets, which are therefore exempt from the requirements of the Act. <em>State ex rel. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Ohio Environmental Protection Agency </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 166, 172, 724 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 33} The bureau asserts that the \u201ctransactional documents * * * contain trade secrets exempt from disclosure. Release of the trade secrets may affect the ability of the [coin] Funds to recoup their investments.\u201d How that may be is not explained, but the assertion does not set up a special matter that is subject to the more particular pleading requirements of Civ.R. 9, including what effort, if any, the bureau has undertaken to maintain the secrecy of the information. R.C. 1333.61(D)(2). Therefore, it is sufficient that the defense is \u201csimple, concise, and direct,\u201d which it is. Civ.R. 8(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 34} The bureau\u2019s assertion may have the facial appeal of a dead mackerel in the moonlight, but it does set up an issue of fact that \u201cmust be tried, and further proceedings thereon had, in the same manner as in civil actions.\u201d R.C. 2731.09. In order to find that the assertion is \u201cno valid excuse,\u201d R.C. 2731.06, this court must assume a knowledge of the market in rare coins that it lacks. That assumption subjects the interests of contributing employers and injured employees to the risk of further possible losses, one that is not reasonably justified though the surrounding circumstances seem scandalous. The facts are best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sorted out by the further showings that an alternative writ of mandamus would require of the bureau.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b236-5\">Fritz Byers, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AdR\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Martin D.
