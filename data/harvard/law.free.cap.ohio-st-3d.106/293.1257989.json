(\u201cL &amp; L\u201d), built the dormitories in 1998 and 1999. Along with a parking lot and some recreational space, the dormitories are situated on a 20-acre parcel of land directly across the Hocking River from the college campus and are accessible by a bridge over the river. The college has no ownership interest or tax obligation with respect to the dormitories and has not applied for, and would not benefit from, the tax exemptions sought by L &amp; L.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">{\u00b6 3} The college has, however, worked closely with L &amp; L since the dormitories\u2019 inception. For instance, a vice president of the college assisted L &amp; L in securing financing for constructing the dormitories, while the college\u2019s development director assisted L &amp; L in designing the dormitories to meet student needs and promote the college\u2019s educational mission. The college entered into contracts with L <em>&amp; </em>L to list the dormitories, once completed, as \u201ccampus housing\u201d in student housing information.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">{\u00b6 4} Moreover, the college plays an active role in administrating the dormitories, which house only Hocking students. The college sets dormitory rules regarding smoking, alcohol use, pets, and quiet hours, etc., and coordinates student room assignments and move-in and move-out dates. In addition, the college collects student rental payments \u2014 whose annual amounts are jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>determined by L &amp; L and the college \u2014 deducts its management and operation costs plus an $8,000 annual marketing fee for promoting student occupancy in L &amp; L\u2019s dormitories, and forwards the balance to L &amp; L. Students who fail to pay rent are prohibited from registering for classes at the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 5} In 2001, L &amp; L sought an exemption with the Tax Commissioner for taxes owed or already paid on the property for tax years 2000 and 2001. Finding that the dormitories were exempt pursuant to R.C. 3357.14, the Tax Commissioner ordered all taxes, penalties, and interest for 2000 remitted and granted L &amp; L an exemption for 2001, which the Athens County Auditor appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). The BTA reversed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision, concluding that neither R.C. 3357.14 nor 5709.07(A)(4) allows private, for-profit entities like L <em>&amp; </em>L to receive tax exemptions for rental property used by technical college students.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 6} L &amp; L appealed to this court, claiming that regardless of whether the college or a private entity actually owns it, property \u201cconnected with\u201d or \u201cused by\u201d a technical college is exempt from taxation under either R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) or 3357.14. Conversely, the Athens County Auditor asserts that because the property is not \u201cconnected with\u201d the college within the meaning of R.C. 5709.07(A)(4), L &amp; L is prohibited from receiving an exemption pursuant to that statutory provision. And, with respect to R.C. 3357.14, the auditor argues that since the college does not own the property or have any obligation to pay taxes on it, L &amp; L cannot claim an exemption through the college solely because its students are housed in L &amp; L\u2019s dormitories.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 7} For the following reasons, we agree with the auditor\u2019s position and affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 8} We review a decision of the BTA to determine whether it is \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783. Although we \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion,\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789, \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm the BTA\u2019s decision. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. Moreover, any claimed tax exemption must be strictly construed, and the taxpayer must affirmatively establish a right to the exemption. <em>Campus Bus Serv. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 8. See, also, R.C. 5715.271, stating that \u201cthe burden of proof shall be placed on the property owner to show that the property is entitled to exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 9} We turn first to L &amp; L\u2019s claim that R.C. 3357.14 provides an exemption for the property in question. That provision states: \u201cA technical college district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any real or personal property acquired, owned, or used by\u201d the district.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, neither Hocking nor its technical college district is \u201crequired to pay any taxes or assessments\u201d on L &amp; L\u2019s property. Since L &amp; L is the sole property owner, it alone is responsible for paying taxes on that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">{\u00b6 10} While we recognize that the facts suggest that the college maintains a substantial relationship to the property, the BTA correctly concluded that the dormitories are not \u201cused by\u201d the college within the meaning of R.C. 3357.14. Instead, Hocking <em>students </em>use dormitories owned, insured, and operated by L &amp; L through its agreements with the college, and, as the BTA noted, \u201c[wjhile L &amp; L may have chosen not to exercise all of its rights on a consistent basis under its agreements with Hocking Tech, there has been no evidence offered to indicate that it has \u2018given up\u2019 its rights under said agreements or amended the agreements in such a manner as to permanently relinquish the rights and responsibilities it contracted for under said agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 11} L &amp; L has no education-related mission; it exists to earn a profit by renting temporary housing accommodations to students attending the college. The BTA reasonably determined that the General Assembly promulgated R.C. 3357.14\u2019s tax exemption to reduce the tax burden on higher education facilities; not to shelter private property owners who build and maintain student housing near college campuses. The General Assembly has enacted similar tax exemptions for state and municipal colleges and universities, community college districts, and university branch districts. See R.C. 3345.17, 3349.17, 3354.15, and 3355.11. None of these statutes, however, exempt private landowners from paying taxes on property located near, or even on, a college or university campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, we agree with the BTA\u2019s decision and hold that because R.C. 3357.14 grants a tax exemption only to \u201ctechnical college districts,\u201d and because L <em>&amp; </em>L\u2019s property is not \u201cused by\u201d the college within the meaning of the statute, L &amp; L is prohibited from receiving a tax exemption pursuant to R.C. 3357.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 13} We turn now to L &amp; L\u2019s contention that it is entitled to a property-tax exemption pursuant to R.C. 5709.07(A)(4). In reviewing this claim below, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>BTA, citing <em>Rickenbacker Port Auth. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 628, 631, 597 N.E.2d 494, concluded that because \u201ca property, to be exempt, must qualify under the criteria of the statute specifically applicable to that property,\u201d and because R.C. 3357.14 is the only statutory provision directly related to property-tax exemptions for technical colleges, R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) cannot provide L <em>&amp; </em>L with a property4ax exemption. While we agree that R.C. 3357.14 is the only appropriate statutory provision under which to consider L &amp; L\u2019s application for exemption, like the BTA, we will address L <em>&amp; </em>L\u2019s argument regarding the applicability of R.C. 5709.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 5709.07(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(4) Public colleges and academies and all buildings connected with them, and all lands connected with public institutions of learning, not used with a view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 18} Since L &amp; L is not itself a public college, academy, or public institution of learning, the critical inquiry with respect to this issue is whether L &amp; L\u2019s buildings are \u201cconnected with\u201d Hocking. As we noted in <em>Cleveland State Univ. v. Perk </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 1, 55 O.O.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577, privately owned buildings can be \u201cconnected with\u201d a college and can thus qualify for the R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Perk, </em>we concluded that \u201cbuildings located on the campus of a state university and used exclusively for classrooms and faculty offices are exempt from taxation, even though such buildings are not owned by the university, but are leased for a term of years, with provision for rental therefor, from a corporation for profit.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. The court added, \u201c[W]e think it clear that the buildings in question * * * are buildings \u2018connected\u2019 with a public college.\u201d Id. at 5, 55 0.0.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577. Significantly, however, Cleveland State University had \u201cobligated itself financially for the full amount of any real property taxes imposed on the buildings.\u201d Id. at 4, 55 0.0.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577. Because it leased the buildings and was contractually obligated to pay the taxes associated with them, the university, rather than the private owner, became the true beneficiary of the tax exemption in <em>Perk.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">{\u00b6 20} The dormitories at issue here are different. While privately owned buildings received the tax exemption in <em>Perk, </em>the taxpayer who benefited from the exemption was the public university rather than the separate private owner of the buildings \u2014 a significant distinction. In the case before us, the college does not own or lease the dormitories, is not contractually obligated to pay the taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>on the buildings, and has not applied for and would not benefit from the tax exemption sought by L &amp; L.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">{\u00b6 21} In examining the tax exemption now codified in R.C. 5709.07(A)(4), Ohio courts have repeatedly determined that the exemption must benefit the public college itself, not a separate private entity. See, e.g., <em>Denison Univ. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 17, 31 O.O.2d 10, 205 N.E.2d 896 (exempting Denison University from taxation on property it owned, including a carpentry shop, a storage shed, and the home of the university president); <em>Bexley Village, Ltd. v. Limbach </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 306, 588 N.E.2d 246 (exempting Capital University from taxation on a privately owned parking lot that the university had leased and on which the university had agreed to pay any taxes); <em>Ohio N. Univ. v. Tax Commr. </em>(1970), 21 Ohio App.2d 113, 50 O.O.2d 214, 255 N.E.2d 297 (exempting Ohio Northern University from taxation on its student union building when a private caterer hired by the university provided food service); <em>Kenyon College v. Schnebly </em>(1909), 21 Ohio C.D. 150, 31 Ohio C.C. 150, 1909 WL 1138, *3 (exempting Kenyon College from taxation on buildings it owned that served as the homes of faculty members and a janitor), affirmed without opinion, <em>Schnebly v. Kenyon College </em>(1909), 81 Ohio St. 514, 91 N.E. 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 22} Although L &amp; L has presented evidence that the college provides some administrative and marketing support to the dormitories, it cannot overcome its status as a private, for-profit company not engaged in the business of education. As indicated above, the General Assembly has never demonstrated any intent to provide private parties with such tax exemptions, and neither this court nor the BTA has ever interpreted these statutes in the manner suggested by L &amp; L. See, e.g., <em>Cleveland Student Hous. Assn. v. Tracy </em>(1995), BTA No. 93-P-1192, 1995 WL 312638, in which a private nonprofit owner of a student housing facility near Case Western Reserve University could not receive a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) when the university did not own or lease the property and was not obligated to pay any taxes on it. Therefore, even assuming R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) applies to technical colleges, L &amp; L cannot establish that its dormitories are \u201cconnected with\u201d the college, and L &amp; L does not qualify for the statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, because neither R.C. 3357.14 nor 5709.07(A)(4) permits L <em>&amp; </em>L to qualify for a tax exemption, we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Rich, Crites &amp; Dittmer and James R.
