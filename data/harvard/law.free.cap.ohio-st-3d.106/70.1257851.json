Because these records are peace-officer residential and familial information under R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) and exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p), we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\"><em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>Case No. 2004-0448</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Plain Dealer Publishing Company (\u201cPlain Dealer\u201d), publishes the Plain Dealer newspaper, which is circulated to the general public throughout the greater metropolitan area of respondent, the city of Cleveland, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">{\u00b6 3} Under General Police Order 1.3.08, Cleveland police officers must maintain current photograph-identification cards, and if the officers are not in uniform, they must display the identification cards on their clothing when they are in police or local court buildings. The Photo Unit of the Cleveland Police Division takes the pictures and prepares the identification cards, with new cards typically issued every five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In September 2002, the Plain Dealer requested that the Cleveland Police Division permit it to examine and scan \u201cthe identification photographs of all uniformed Cleveland police officers.\u201d The city denied the Plain Dealer\u2019s request based on the city\u2019s claim that \u201cthe photographs are not public records under O.R.C. 149.43 and release would violate the officers\u2019 federal constitutional right to privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">{\u00b6 5} In December 2002, Cleveland notified the Plain Dealer that it was establishing a procedure in which the city would notify individual police officers when the Plain Dealer requested their photographs and seek written consent from the officers to release their photographs. Cleveland expressed its concern that \u201cproviding [the Plain Dealer] with the requested photographs without obtaining permission from each individual affected officer might constitute a civil-rights violation\u201d that would subject the city to \u201cnumerous time-consuming and expensive lawsuits by individual police officers and/or their unions.\u201d The Plain Dealer questioned the city\u2019s reliance on constitutional privacy rights because \u201c[uniformed officers are visible on the streets daily, advertising by what they wear that they are police officers.\u201d Nevertheless, the Plain Dealer agreed to wait and see how the city\u2019s new procedure operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 6} In June 2003, the Plain Dealer received a press release from the Rotary Club of Cleveland notifying \u201cPhoto and News Editors\u201d of a photograph opportunity. The Rotary Club stated that it would present its annual Medal of Valor awards on June 12, 2003, at a public ceremony to three Cleveland police officers and three Cleveland firefighters. The press release listed the three officers by name. The Rotary Club noted that the three officers were being honored for their actions in confronting and arresting armed robbery suspects and that \u201c[e]ach recipient has been selected by his department chief and the Director of Public Safety in cooperation with the City of Cleveland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 7} On June 11, 2003, the Plain Dealer requested that the Cleveland Police Department provide it with photographs of the June 12 Rotary Club honorees, including the three police officers. On July 14, 2003, the city denied the Plain Dealer\u2019s request because the officers had \u201cdeclined to authorize release of their photograph[s].\u201d The officers withheld consent because of their concerns for their safety and that of their families. Nevertheless, two officers did not object to being photographed during the June 12 Rotary Club ceremony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, one officer\u2019s picture from the ceremony appeared in the <em>Plain Dealer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 8} On November 2 and 3, 2003, the Plain Dealer published articles about the city\u2019s multimillion-dollar annual cost in paying overtime to its police officers for attending court hearings. The Plain Dealer reported that officers had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>overtime pay to attend hearings that had been canceled weeks before and that several officers in the same cases submitted overtime cards with dramatically different hours, but each received the full amount of overtime compensation he claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">{\u00b6 9} Shortly before the publication of these articles, on October 31, 2003, the Plain Dealer notified the city that it was \u201cpreparing reports about the overtime pay that some Cleveland police officers have received.\u201d The Plain Dealer requested access to view and copy photographs of five uniformed police officers who would be named in the articles. On November 17, 2003, the city denied the Plain Dealer\u2019s request because each of the named officers \u201cdeclined to authorize release of [his] photograph.\u201d These officers declined to authorize release of their photographs because they were concerned for their own and their families\u2019 safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 10} On March 12, 2004, the Plain Dealer filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel Cleveland to provide photographs of the eight police officers that it had requested in June and October 2003. Cleveland answered the complaint, and on May 26, 2004, we granted an alternative writ. <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1456, 2004-Ohio-2569, 809 N.E.2d 31. The parties filed evidence and briefs, and the National Fraternal Order of Police (\u201cNational FOP\u201d), Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio, Inc. (\u201cOhio FOP\u201d) and Fraternal Order of Police, Cleveland Lodge No. 8 (\u201cCleveland Lodge No. 8\u201d) filed amici curiae briefs in support of the city\u2019s decision not to release the officers\u2019 photographs to the Plain Dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 11} On September 29, 2004, we granted the Plain Dealer\u2019s request for oral argument. <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 1459, 2004-Ohio-5056, 815 N.E.2d 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><em>State ex rel. Vindicator Printing Co. v. Youngstown, </em>Case No. 2004-1765</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 12} On July 4, 2004, a crowd of about 200 people attended an illegal fireworks display in the city of Youngstown, Ohio, respondent. A riot broke out when Youngstown police officers ordered the crowd to disperse. Five police officers were injured, and three people were charged with assaulting police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 13} One of the officers at the scene wrote a memorandum blaming in part the city administration for the riot because the city\u2019s deployment of police officers created \u201cdangerous conditions\u201d and \u201cbackup officers [were] miles away when officers [were] in need of assistance.\u201d The officer distributed the memorandum to the mayor, police chief, and the internal-affairs unit of the Youngstown Police Department. The city administration replied that the officer\u2019s memorandum had some merit but had exaggerated what had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Relator, Vindicator Printing Company (\u201cVindicator\u201d), is an Ohio corporation that owns and publishes the Vindicator, a newspaper that is circulated throughout the greater metropolitan area of Youngstown. In preparing a July 20, 2004 newspaper article describing the officer\u2019s memorandum and the city\u2019s response, the Vindicator requested that the city provide it with a photograph of the officer. The city refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 15} In September 2004, a grand jury indicted several persons for crimes arising from the July 4 riot. In October 2004, the Vindicator again requested that the city provide it with the officer\u2019s photograph, and the city again refused. The Youngstown Police Department had notified the officer of the requests, and he advised that if it was standard departmental practice not to release his photograph, then the police department should not release it.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 16} On October 20, 2004, the Vindicator filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel Youngstown to permit inspection and copying of the requested police officer photograph. On October 28, the Vindicator moved to consolidate this case with <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>case No. 2004-0448. The city filed an answer to the Vindicator\u2019s complaint, but did not respond to the motion to consolidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 17} On December 28, 2004, we granted the Vindicator\u2019s motion and ordered case No. 2004-1765, <em>State ex rel. Vindicator Printing Co. v. Youngstown, </em>consolidated with case No. 2004-0448, <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>for purposes of oral argument and decision. 104 Ohio St.3d 1436, 2004-Ohio-7079, 819 N.E.2d 1120. We also granted an alternative writ and ordered evidence and briefing. Id. The parties submitted evidence and briefs. Amici curiae the Columbus Dispatch, the Copley Press, Inc., Beacon Journal Publishing Company, the Associated Press, the Cincinnati Enquirer, E.W. Scripps Company, Cox Ohio Publishing, the Blade, the Ohio Newspaper Association, the Ohio Coalition for Open Government, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio Foundation, the Committee Against Sexual Harassment, and Copwatch filed briefs in support of the Vindicator.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Oral Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">{\u00b6 18} After these cases were consolidated, oral argument was held on April 26, 2005. The causes are now before us for a consideration of the merits of the Plain Dealer\u2019s and the Vindicator\u2019s mandamus claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Mandamus: R.C. 149.43</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">{\u00b6 19} The Plain Dealer requests a writ of mandamus to compel Cleveland to provide it with eight photographs of police officers. The Vindicator requests a writ of mandamus to compel Youngstown to provide it with a photograph of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>police officer. The Plain Dealer and the Vindicator claim entitlement to the requested photographs under the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 11; R.C. 149.43(C). We construe R.C. 149.43 liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosing records. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Cincinnati Bd. of Edn., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 6, 2003-Ohio-2260, 788 N.E.2d 629, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018Public record\u2019 means records kept by any public office.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). The Cleveland Division of Police keeps the photographs used for its police-identification cards. The Youngstown Police Department uses the photographs for police-identification cards and has put them in a \u201cmug\u201d book available for use by people who have complaints against officers. It is undisputed that a police department is a public office. R.C. 149.011(A); <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 142, 647 N.E.2d 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, despite Cleveland\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the photographs of Cleveland and Youngstown police officers constituted records for purposes of R.C. 149.43. \u201c \u2018Records\u2019 includes any document * * * created * * * by * * * any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d R.C. 149.011(G). The Cleveland photographs are created by the Cleveland Police Division and document the policy expressed in General Police Order 1.3.08 that police officers maintain current photographic identification cards and display them in police and court buildings when not in uniform. The Youngstown photographs are created by the Youngstown Police Department and document the policies that police officers have photographic identification cards and that the photographs are available for use by citizens to register complaints against police.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">{\u00b6 23} The Cleveland photographs, when incorporated into the police-identification cards, are used by Cleveland police officers to gain access to certain buildings and to identify themselves as police officers when any person requests identification. See <em>Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 12-14 (proposed agreement to settle investigation of city\u2019s police department constituted a public record for purposes of R.C. 149.43(A)(1) and 149.011(G)); Section 4.13 of the Rules and Regulations for the Conduct and Discipline of Officers and Employees of the Cleveland Division of Police (\u201cPersonnel shall furnish their name, rank, and badge number to any person who may request it\u201d); cf. <em>Henderson v. Chattanooga </em>(Tenn.App.2003), 133 S.W.3d 192, 204 (\u201cIn light of the very broad definition of public records and giving the Act a liberal construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tion, as we must, we cannot say that when a photograph of an officer is taken and placed in his or her personnel file, that it was not \u2018made * * * in connection with the transaction of official business by any governmental agency\u2019 \u201d). The Youngstown photographs can be used by the police department to permit citizens to identify police officers in order to register a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">{\u00b6 24} Therefore, the requested photographs are records under R.C. 149.011(G) and must be disclosed under R.C. 149.43 unless an exception to disclosure applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Exemption for Peace-Officer Residential and Familial Information</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 25} The cities assert that the requested photographs are exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p), which excepts \u201c[pjeace officer, firefighter, or EMT [emergency medical technician] residential and familial information\u201d from the definition of \u201c[pjublic record.\u201d At issue is the R.C. 149.43(A)(7) definition of \u201c[pjeace officer, firefighter, or EMT residential and familial information,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(7) \u2018Peace officer, firefighter, or EMT residential and familial information\u2019 means either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(a) Any information maintained in a personnel record of a peace officer, firefighter, or EMT that discloses any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(i) The address of the actual personal residence of a peace officer, firefighter, or EMT, except for the state or political subdivision in which the peace officer, firefighter, or EMT resides;</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(ii) Information compiled from referral to or participation in an employee assistance program;</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(iii) The social security number, the residential telephone number, any bank account, debit card, charge card, or credit card number, or the emergency telephone number of, or any medical information pertaining to, a peace officer, firefighter, or EMT;</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(iv) The name of any beneficiary of employment benefits, including, but not limited to, life insurance benefits, provided to a peace officer, firefighter, or EMT by the peace officer\u2019s, firefighter\u2019s, or EMT\u2019s employer;</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(v) The identity and amount of any charitable or employment benefit deduction made by the peace officer\u2019s, firefighter\u2019s, or EMT\u2019s employer from the peace officer\u2019s, firefighter\u2019s, or EMT\u2019s compensation unless the amount of the deduction is required by state or federal law;</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(vi) The name, the residential address, the name of the employer, the address of the employer, the social security number, the residential telephone number, any bank account, debit card, charge card, or credit card number, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>emergency telephone number of the spouse, a former spouse, or any child of a peace officer, firefighter, or EMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(b) <em>Any record that identifies a person\u2019s occupation as a peace officer, </em>firefighter, or EMT other than statements required to include the disclosure of that fact under the campaign finance law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA court\u2019s preeminent concern in construing a statute is the legislative intent in enacting a statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Van Dyke v. Public Emp. Retirement Bd., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438, \u00b6 27. To determine the legislative intent, we must review the language of the statute, \u201c \u2018reading undefined words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with the rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Pontillo v. Public Emp. Retirement Sys. Bd., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 500, 2003-Ohio-2120, 787 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 41, quoting <em>State ex rel. Portage Lakes Edn. Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 533, 2002-Ohio-2839, 769 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 36} Read in accordance with the rules of grammar and common usage, R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) manifestly includes the requested police officer photographs because they identify their occupation as peace officers. The Plain Dealer and the Vindicator do not deny that the language of R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) includes the requested photographs within the exemption for peace-officer residential and familial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 37} Instead, the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator argue that the \u201cGeneral Assembly could not have intended a literal construction\u201d of R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) because that would obviate the R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(a) subpart of the same exemption and the exemption for confidential law-enforcement investigatory records in R.C. 149.43(A)(2). The newspapers also argue that a literal construction would nullify other laws generally requiring peace officers to provide proper identification upon demand and would be absurd if applied to uniformed police officers. The Plain Dealer further claims that subsequent legislative amendments evince the General Assembly\u2019s intent to retain the court\u2019s holdings concerning police personnel records, that the city has waived any exemptions, and that access may be required under the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 38} The Plain Dealer\u2019s and the Vindicator\u2019s assertions are meritless. R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) unambiguously exempts the requested police officer photographs because they identify the officers\u2019 occupation as peace officers. R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p). \u201cIf a review of the statute conveys a meaning that is clear, unequivocal, and definite, the court need look no further.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Wilkins, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 112, 2004-Ohio-296, 802 N.E.2d 637, \u00b6 26. We need not resort to statutory construction when the statute is unambiguous. <em>State v. Evans, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 240, 2004-Ohio-2659, 809 N.E.2d 11, \u00b6 14. Instead, \u201cour inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>text is unambiguous.\u201d <em>BedRoc Ltd., LLC v. United States </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 176, 183, 124 S.Ct. 1587, 158 L.Ed.2d 338. Thus, when a statute is unambiguous in its terms, courts must apply it rather than interpret it. <em>Specialty Restaurants Corp. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 170, 2002-Ohio-4032, 772 N.E.2d 1165, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 39} Moreover, even were we to use the interpretative rules that the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator request, a different conclusion would not be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 40} Admittedly, we have on occasion noted that \u201cthe natural meaning of words is not always conclusive as to the construction of statutes\u201d and that no portion of a statute should be treated as superfluous unless it is manifestly necessary to do so. <em>D.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172, 773 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 22, 26. But surplusage does not always produce ambiguity, and the plain meaning of the statute is always preferred. <em>Lamie v. United States Trustee </em>(2004), 540 U.S. 526, 536, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 41} In fact, R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) does not render R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(a) or R.C. 149.43(A)(2) superfluous. For example, a record containing debit card information of a former spouse of a peace officer would not necessarily identify a person\u2019s occupation as a peace officer under R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b), but it would fall within the exemption for peace-officer familial and residential information as defined in R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(a). And a confidential law-enforcement investigatory record as defined by R.C. 149.43(A)(2) exempts information other than that defined in R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b), e.g., identities of uncharged suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 42} Nor does R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) nullify other regulations and policies requiring peace officers to identify themselves to persons upon request. See, e.g., Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-61; Rules and Regulations for the Conduct and Discipline of Officers and Employees of the Cleveland Division of Police, Section 4.13 (\u201cPersonnel shall furnish their name, rank and badge number to any person who may request it\u201d); Youngstown Police Department General Orders Manual, General Order 26, Rule 19 (\u201cEmployees shall furnish their badge number to any person requesting that information\u201d). Those regulations serve the related purpose of protecting the public from persons impersonating officers. That purpose could be subverted if people have access under R.C. 149.43 to the same photographs that Cleveland and Youngstown use to prepare police identification cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">{\u00b643} Consequently, instead of nullifying these laws, R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) complements them.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">{\u00b6 44} Furthermore, the application of the exemption to photographs of uniformed police officers does not create an absurd result. The General Assembly makes no distinction in R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) between uniformed and nonuniformed officers, and we will not construe it to imply one. See <em>State v. Hughes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E .2d 540 (\u201cIn construing a statute, we may not add or delete words\u201d). Cleveland introduced evidence that its undercover officers come from its ranks of uniformed police officers and that releasing photographs of uniformed police officers would jeopardize the city\u2019s ability to perform undercover work. Therefore, the exemption protects police and their families and assists the police in their investigative functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 45} In addition, subsequent amendments to R.C. 149.43 do not indicate any intent by the General Assembly to require disclosure of photographs of police officers. The Plain Dealer relies on <em>Spitzer v. Stillings </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 297, 142 N.E. 365, paragraph four of the syllabus, in which we held: \u201cWhere a statute is construed by a court of last resort having jurisdiction, and such statute is thereafter amended in certain particulars, but remains unchanged so far as the same has been construed and defined by the court, it will be presumed that the Legislature was familiar with such interpretation at the time of such amendment, and that such interpretation was intended to be adopted by such amendment as a part of the law, unless express provision is made for a different construction.\u201d <em>Spitzer </em>is inapplicable because we had not interpreted R.C. 149.43(A)(7) before the General Assembly enacted R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b), which became effective in June 2000. 2000 Sub.H.B. No. 539, 148 Ohio Laws, Part III, 6121. This case provides the court with our first opportunity to consider this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 46} Moreover, the history immediately preceding the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) supports the exemption of the requested police officer photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 47} In 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that police officers have a constitutionally protected privacy right in information contained in their personnel files, <em>including drivers\u2019 licenses containing their photographs, </em>which required the balancing of the interests of the officers against the interests of the city in releasing that information. <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 136 F.3d 1055, 1063-1064. The court further held that \u201cofficers are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the release of private information contained in their personnel files only where the disclosure of the requested information could potentially threaten the officers\u2019 and their families\u2019 personal security.\u201d Id. at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 48} In April 1999, we relied on <em>Kallstrom </em>to hold that police officers\u2019 files that contain the names of the officers\u2019 childr\u00e9n, parents, home addresses, telephone numbers, beneficiaries, medical information, and similar records are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act by the constitutional right of privacy. <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Cox </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 707 N.E.2d 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>{\u00b6 49} On June 29, 1999, following <em>Kallstrom </em>and <em>Keller, </em>the General Assembly passed Am.Sub.S.B. No. 78, which enacted the R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p) exemption for peace-officer residential and familial information. 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 8623, 8624-8625, eff. December 16, 1999. The amendment defined the exemption to include the items now specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 50} In April 2000, this court \u2014 citing the constitutional right of privacy \u2014 held that personal information about children who use a city\u2019s recreational facilities was exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. McCleary v. Roberts </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 365, 371-372, 725 N.E.2d 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 51} In May 2000, effective June 2000, the General Assembly amended R.C. 149.43(A)(7) to include subsection b. Sub.H.B. No. 539, 148 Ohio Laws., Part III, 6119.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 52} Based on this historical context, the General Assembly could have been justifiably concerned that the disclosure of certain personal information of police officers might endanger them and their families and compromise their constitutional privacy rights. The General Assembly could have reasonably concluded that the exemptions now contained in R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(a) were insufficient, necessitating the addition of subsection b in June 2000. Photographs in particular have been protected by the General Assembly in a different context. Cf. R.C. 4501.27(F)(5), which includes \u201can individual\u2019s photograph or digital image\u201d within the definition of \u201csensitive personal information\u201d that is to be disclosed by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles only under extremely limited circumstances, e.g., with the express consent of the person whose photograph is requested. R.C. 4501.27(B)(3)(a). The officers whose photographs were requested by the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator did not authorize the release of their photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">{\u00b6 53} Moveover, the Vindicator\u2019s suggested interpretation of R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) as limited to the specific information listed in subsection (A)(7)(a) but in records other than <em>personnel </em>records is not supported by the statutory language. Reading the exemption in this manner would require rewriting subsection (A)(7)(b). This we cannot do. <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b625.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 54} Additionally, even if we disagreed with any policy supporting the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b), \u201cthe General Assembly is the ultimate arbiter of public policy.\u201d <em>Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">{\u00b6 55} Finally, the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator argue that construing the R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) exemption literally to include <em>any </em>records identifying persons as police officers would prohibit access to many records that we have heretofore held to be subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act \u2014 a result that the General Assembly could not have intended. See, e.g, <em>Keller, </em>85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Ohio St.3d at 282, 707 N.E.2d 931 (internal-affairs records \u201cthat reflect on discipline, citizen complaints, or how an officer does her or his job\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 440, 444, 732 N.E.2d 969 (police personnel records); <em>State ex rel. Rasul-Bey v. Onunwor </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 119, 120, 760 N.E.2d 421 (routine offense and incident reports); <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 661 N.E.2d 187 (resumes of police-chief applicants).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">{\u00b6 56} In so arguing, the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator attempt to expand this case beyond the narrow issue before us: the applicability of the exemption to <em>police officer photographs. </em>Consequently, we will not address the applicability of the exemption to police records not at issue. This is consistent with our general rule that we will not issue advisory opinions. <em>State ex rel. Essig v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 481, 2004-Ohio-5586, 817 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 34; see, also, <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-5466, 816 N.E.2d 238, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Fortner v. Thomas </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 51 O.O.2d 35, 257 N.E.2d 371 (\u201c \u2018It has become settled judicial responsibility for courts to refrain from giving opinions on abstract propositions and to avoid the imposition by judgment of premature declarations or advice upon potential controversies\u2019 \u201d). We need decide only the case presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 57} Therefore, because the plain language of R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) includes police officer photographs within the exemption for peace-officer residential and familial information, the city has no duty to provide copies of the photographs to the Plain Dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Constitutional Right of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 58} Cleveland, Youngstown, and amici police labor unions also claim that the requested photographs are exempt from disclosure based on the officers\u2019 constitutional right of privacy. Constitutional privacy rights are \u201cstate or federal law\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v), which prohibits the disclosure of certain records. <em>State ex rel. WBNS TV, Inc. v. Dues, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 406, 2004-Ohio-1497, 805 N.E.2d 1116, \u00b6 41. Because of the manifest applicability of R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p) and (A)(7)(b) to exempt these photographs, however, we need not address this claim. Id. at \u00b6 46, quoting <em>State ex rel. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Henson, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 33, 2002-Ohio-2851, 770 N.E.2d 580, fn. 2 (\u201c \u2018courts decide constitutional issues only when absolutely necessary\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Waiver of Exemptions</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 59} The Plain Dealer and the Vindicator next assert that even assuming that the claimed exemptions apply, the cities waived their right to rely on those records by adopting policies affirmatively making identities of uniformed police officers available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>{\u00b6 60} This assertion lacks merit. \u201c \u2018Absent evidence that respondents have already disclosed the investigatory records to the public and thereby waived application of certain exemptions, the exemptions are fully applicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Dillery v. Icsman </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 312, 316, 750 N.E.2d 156, quoting <em>State ex rel. WLWT-TV5 v. Leis </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 357, 361, 673 N.E.2d 1365. There is no evidence here that Cleveland or Youngstown has already disclosed the <em>requested photographs </em>to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 61} Moreover, the fact that some members of the public may already know the physical characteristics of the police officers does not waive the exemptions. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 440, 447, 732 N.E.2d 969 (public knowledge of identity of uncharged suspect did not waive the city\u2019s right to rely on uncharged-suspect exemption). As amicus Cleveland Lodge No. 8 observes, \u201cthere is a substantial difference between an individual being identified as a police officer due to his uniform, vehicle, or badge number, and being identified by having his or her photograph published throughout Ohio.\u201d See, also, <em>United States Dept. of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Auth. </em>(1994), 510 U.S. 487, 500, 114 S.Ct. 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 325 (\u201cAn individual\u2019s interest in controlling the dissemination of information regarding personal matters does not dissolve simply because that information may be available to the public in some form\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 62} Therefore, Cleveland and Youngstown did not waive their right to rely on exemptions to preclude disclosure of the requested photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Constitutional Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 63} Finally, the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator assert that R.C. 149.43(A)(7)(b) would be unconstitutional if interpreted to inhibit the public\u2019s constitutional right of access to information concerning identities of uniformed police officers. The Plain Dealer cites several cases that refer to a \u201cconstitutional right of access to information concerning crime in the community, and to information relating to activities of law enforcement agencies.\u201d <em>Houston Chronicle Publishing Co. v. Houston </em>(Tex.Civ.App.1975), 531 S.W.2d 177, 186; <em>Caledonian Record Publishing Co. v. Walton </em>(1990), 154 Vt. 15, 21, 573 A.2d 296; <em>Sheridan Newspapers, Inc. v. Sheridan </em>(Wyo.1983), 660 P.2d 785, 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 64} Neither the Plain Dealer nor the Vindicator, however, raised this constitutional claim in its complaint. Nor did they seek to amend their complaints to raise this claim. Alternative writs were granted based on the allegations of the complaints, and evidence was presented by the parties without notice that the claim was being raised. Under these circumstances, we will not consider the merits of this improperly raised claim. See <em>State ex rel. Massie v. Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 584, 589, 669 N.E.2d 839; <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Reed </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 159, 160, 718 N.E.2d 428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(\u201cwe need not address the merits of Miller\u2019s constitutional claim because Miller did not raise this issue in his complaint or amend his complaint to include this claim, and appellees did not expressly or impliedly consent to litigation of this claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 65} Further, protecting this personal information about police officers from disclosure is no more offensive than protecting similar personal information in the custody of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. See R.C. 4501.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 66} And although both the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator cite <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973, in support of their constitutional claim, that case is inapplicable. In <em>Richmond Newspapers, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibits the \u201cgovernment from summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time that Amendment was adopted.\u201d Id. at 576, 448 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973. The facts here are considerably different. See, e.g., <em>Calder v. Internal Revenue Serv. </em>(C.A.5, 1989), 890 F.2d 781, 783 (\u201cno Supreme Court case has applied the two-tier analysis [of <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>and comparable cases] which looks for [a] history of openness and examines the significant role access plays in the judicial process to areas other than criminal proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 67} Based on the manifest clarity and applicability of R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p) and 149.43(A)(7)(b), we deny the writs. The Plain Dealer and the Vindicator are not entitled to the requested police officer photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Writs denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AMF\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\">.

Pictures that do not depict officers in their uniforms, however, do not \u201cidentify the officers\u2019 occupation as peace officers.\u201d A caption in a newspaper would identify the person in the nonuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>formed picture as a peace officer, but the Plain Dealer and the Vindicator are not seeking captions; they are seeking pictures. I dissent to the extent that the majority opinion enables the police departments in this case to circumvent the Public Records Act by not releasing pictures of nonuniformed police officers.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b199-4\">Baker &amp; Hostetler, L.L.P., and David L.
