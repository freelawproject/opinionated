Graham sought a writ of procedendo to compel appellee, Hancock County Court of Common Pleas Judge Joseph H. Niemeyer, to conduct an evidentiary hearing and rule on a new-trial motion in Graham\u2019s criminal case. On March 15, 2005, Judge Niemeyer denied Graham\u2019s motion because it was not timely filed. Judge Niemeyer then answered Graham\u2019s procedendo complaint and moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">{\u00b6 3} On April 6, 2005, the court of appeals dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. \u201cA writ of procedendo will not issue to compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bortoli v. Dinkelacker, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 133, 2005-Ohio-779, 823 N.E.2d 448, \u00b6 3. Judge Niemeyer has ruled on Graham\u2019s motion for new trial, and insofar as Graham challenges that ruling, he has or had an adequate remedy by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, Graham failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25(A)(1) because his affidavit of prior civil actions did not contain a \u201cbrief description of the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the civil action[s] or appeals]\u201d that he specified. Graham\u2019s noncompliance with R.C. 2969.25 warranted dismissal. <em>State ex rel. Norris v. Giavasis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 371, 2003-Ohio-6609, 800 N.E.2d 365, \u00b6 4.
