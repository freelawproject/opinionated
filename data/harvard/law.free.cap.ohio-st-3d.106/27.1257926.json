The property \u2014 identified in the county auditor\u2019s records as parcel number 06-00094.001 \u2014 is known as Laughlin Woods Apartments. A 40-unit apartment complex constructed in 1999 is on the property, which covers 4.092 acres of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">{\u00b62} For tax year 2001, the auditor fixed the true value of the property\u2014 including both the land and the improvements on it \u2014 at $1,909,770. Cambridge Commons argues that its property was worth only $870,000 that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">{\u00b6 3} Cambridge Commons presented its arguments first to the Guernsey County Board of Revision, which left unchanged the taxable value assigned to the property by the auditor. Cambridge Commons then appealed that decision under R.C. 5717.01 to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). The BTA found that Cambridge Commons had not presented sufficient evidence to support its claim that the auditor had overvalued the property, and the BTA therefore determined that the taxable value of the property should remain unchanged from the value set by the auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">{\u00b6 4} Cambridge Commons has now appealed to this court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cWhen cases are appealed from a board of revision to the BTA, the burden of proof is on the appellant, whether it be a taxpayer or a board of education, to prove its right to an increase or decrease from the value determined by the board of revision.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 564, 566, 740 N.E.2d 276. And when the BTA is considering testimony and appraisal reports about the value of property, \u201cthe BTA possesses wide discretion in evaluating the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>evidence and the credibility of the witnesses that come before it.\u201d <em>Fawn Lake Apts. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 609, 613, 710 N.E.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">{\u00b6 6} In this case, a state-certified real estate appraiser prepared a written appraisal report and testified before the BTA on behalf of Cambridge Commons. That appraiser \u2014 Thomas Kaliker \u2014 calculated a value for the property under three different methods: (1) the income-capitalization approach, which focuses on a property\u2019s capacity to generate income for the owner, (2) the sales-comparison approach, which focuses on the prices of comparable properties that have changed hands recently, and (3) the cost approach, which focuses on the cost of replacing the improvements on the property. Kaliker believed that the income-capitalization approach provided the most accurate measure of this particular property\u2019s value, and under that approach, he appraised the property\u2019s value at $870,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 7} The BTA found Kaliker\u2019s opinion unconvincing. The comparable properties that Kaliker examined in appraising the property were 19 to 28 years older than the Cambridge Commons apartment project, and, according to the BTA, Kaliker \u201cignored the significant differences in the comparables\u2019 expenses\u201d when calculating the income-generating value of the property at issue. The BTA concluded that Kaliker\u2019s appraisal did not offer \u201cprobative evidence\u201d on the question of the property\u2019s value, and therefore the BTA found that Cambridge Commons had not met its burden of demonstrating a value different from the one determined by the county auditor and the board of revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 8} We agree with Cambridge Commons that the BTA erred in criticizing some of appraiser Kaliker\u2019s calculations, but in the end, we conclude that the error did not change the outcome. The BTA found fault with Kaliker\u2019s report because it listed real estate taxes as an expense item for all of the other apartment complexes that he examined but listed no real estate taxes as an expense item for the Cambridge Commons property. Yet Kaliker\u2019s report explained that he first estimated the annual cash flow that the property in question would generate \u201cbefore real estate taxes\u201d and then factored in the relevant property tax rate when converting that cash-flow figure into an estimate of the property\u2019s market value under the income-capitalization approach. That approach was not a flawed one and did not \u201cdoubl[e] the tax liabilities in his income approach\u201d as the BTA claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 9} Even so, we are convinced that the BTA\u2019s apparent misstatement about this one part of Kaliker\u2019s income-capitalization analysis did not provide the sole basis for the BTA\u2019s conclusion that Kaliker\u2019s appraisal was unreliable. When discussing Kaliker\u2019s income-capitalization calculations, the BTA criticized his choice of comparable properties and his failure to make a larger adjustment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the age of those properties. And Kaliker\u2019s sales-comparison approach was flawed, according to the BTA, because he made \u201cinappropriate\u201d downward adjustments in his report when he listed recent sale prices of comparable properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 10} Even if we overlook the BTA\u2019s misstatement about the appraiser\u2019s treatment of real estate taxes in his income-capitalization calculations, the various other concerns identified by the BTA could reasonably have led it to conclude that the appraiser had failed to present a reliable estimate of the true value of the property at issue. In light of the discretion that we accord the BTA to decide the weight, if any, to be given to a witness\u2019s testimony, and in light of the fact that the burden of proof rested on Cambridge Commons to show that the value set by the board of revision was wrong, we cannot say that the BTA\u2019s refusal to adopt Kaliker\u2019s appraisal was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 11} Cambridge Commons argues as well that the BTA abused its discretion by rejecting Kaliker\u2019s adjustments for the age of the comparable apartment complexes without actually inspecting them. That argument is not well taken, however, because the BTA has no obligation to inspect property or to disprove a witness\u2019s testimony by gathering contrary information. To be sure, the BTA \u201cmay make such investigation concerning the appeal as it deems proper,\u201d R.C. 5717.01, but BTA hearings \u201cshall proceed in similar manner to a civil action,\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(0 (now (G)), with the BTA or its hearing officer serving in a quasi-judicial role. In reaching its decisions, the BTA may properly rely on the sworn testimony of the witnesses who appear before it, any exhibits admitted at BTA hearings, and the record certified to it by the county board of revision or the Tax Commissioner. No provision of Ohio law requires the BTA to inspect real or personal property when the value of that property is at issue before the BTA, and the same is true of any similar property alleged to be comparable to the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 12} As we have said, the BTA \u201cmay accept all, part, or none\u201d of a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Simmons v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 47, 48, 689 N.E.2d 22. \u201cWe will not reverse the BTA\u2019s determination on credibility of witnesses and weight given to their testimony unless we find an abuse of * * * discretion.\u201d <em>Natl. Church Residence v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 397, 398, 653 N.E.2d 240. The BTA\u2019s decision in a valuation case such as this will be undone by this court \u201conly when it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Throckmorton v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 227, 229, 661 N.E.2d 1095; R.C. 5717.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, the BTA\u2019s conclusion that the value of the property should remain unchanged from the value set by the auditor is reasonable and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>supported by the evidence, and the BTA did not abuse its discretion in reaching that conclusion. \u201cIn the absence of probative evidence of a lower value,\u201d a county board of revision and the BTA \u201care justified in fixing the value at the amount assessed by the county auditor.\u201d <em>Salem Med. Arts &amp; Dev. Corp. v. Columbiana Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 193, 195, 694 N.E.2d 1324. Because appellant Cambridge Commons failed to carry its burden of proof on the issue of valuation, and because the BTA\u2019s decision is supported by the evidence in the record, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b146-7\">James E.
