Count A charged Douglas with violating former R.C. 4511.19(A)(6) (\u201cNo person shall \u2022 operate any vehicle * * * within this state, if any of the following apply: The person has a concentration of seventeen-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of the person\u2019s breath.\u201d Am.Sub. S.B. No. 163, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3553, 3564). Count B charged Douglas with violating former R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) (\u201cNo person shall operate any vehicle * * * within this state, if any of the following apply: The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse.\u201d Am.Sub. S.B. No. 163, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3553, 3564). Counts A and B were both charged in one criminal case against Douglas in the Hamilton County Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Douglas moved to suppress the results of her breath-alcohol test. On October 8, 2003, appellee, Judge John H. Burlew, of the municipal court, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 4} On November 18, 2003, Douglas entered into an agreement with the state in which she pleaded no contest to Count A (R.C. 4511.19(A)(6)) in return for the state\u2019s dismissal of Count B (R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)). Judge Burlew sentenced Douglas upon her no-contest plea to Count A and dismissed Count B.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 5} Douglas appealed her conviction and sentence. She asserted that Judge Burlew erred in not granting her motion to suppress her breath-alcohol-test results. The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County reversed the municipal court judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings. <em>State v. Douglas, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030897, 2004-Ohio-5726, 2004 WL 2421847. The court of appeals determined that the state had failed to establish that it had substantially complied -with an Ohio Department of Health regulation governing the testing of breath-alcohol levels. Id. at \u00b6 5-7,11.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 6} On November 16, 2004, Judge Burlew granted the state\u2019s motion to set aside the dismissal of Count B. Judge Burlew then set the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 7} On December 17, 2004, Douglas filed a petition in the court of appeals, seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Burlew from exercising jurisdiction over Count B. Judge Burlew moved to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On January 21, 2005, the court of appeals granted Judge Burlew\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court upon Douglas\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">{\u00b6 9} Douglas asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing her prohibition action. In order to be entitled to the writ, Douglas must establish that (1) Judge Burlew is about to exercise judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018In the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging that jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Conkle v. Sadler, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 402, 2003-Ohio-4124, 792 N.E.2d 1116, \u00b6 8, quoting <em>State ex rel. Shimko v. McMonagle </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 426, 428-429, 751 N.E.2d 472. For the following reasons, Judge Burlew does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to set aside the dismissal of Count B and proceed on that DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201cUpon remand from an appellate court, the lower court is required to proceed from the point at which the error occurred.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Stevenson v. Murray </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 112, 113, 23 O.O.3d 160, 431 N.E.2d 324. This rule has been applied to criminal cases. See <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 240, 714 N.E.2d 867; <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 160, 2002-Ohio-4937, 783 N.E.2d 903, \u00b6 61; <em>State v. Leonard </em>(June 21, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1229, 2001 WL 697999.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 12} As Judge Burlew notes, the error occurred when he denied Douglas\u2019s motion to suppress her breath-alcohol-test results, which occurred <em>before </em>Douglas entered a plea of no contest to one DUI charge in return for the state\u2019s dismissal of the remaining DUI charge in the criminal case. Therefore, setting aside the dismissal of Count B is arguably supported by <em>Stevenson </em>and comparable cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 13} Moreover, the sole case relied upon by Douglas is distinguishable from this case. In <em>State ex rel. Flynt v. Dinkelacker, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 595, 2004-Ohio-1695, 807 N.E.2d 967, the court of appeals held that a trial court judge patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to reinstate a 15-count indictment when the indictment had been voluntarily dismissed by the state pursuant to a plea agreement. In <em>Flynt, </em>the court emphasized that permitting \u201c[a] conditional dismissal in a criminal matter would allow a prosecutor to keep a defendant perpetually indicted, without any idea concerning, or control over, when the matter would be resolved.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15; see, also, \u00b6 26 (\u201cThe state cannot reinstate a dismissed indictment and perpetually save a place in a judge\u2019s courtroom to prosecute the Flynts\u201d). By contrast, this case does not involve any perpetual condition. Furthermore, <em>Flynt </em>involved the dismissal of an entire indictment against the named relators, whereas this case involves the dismissal of one of two counts in the case against Douglas. Cf. Crim.R. 48(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cThe state may by leave of court and in open court file an entry of dismissal of an indictment, information, or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate\u201d). And as the court in <em>Flynt </em>noted, \u201cWhen a criminal case is dismissed, it is over \u2014 except in the case where the dismissal is appealed.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. Here, unlike in <em>Flynt, </em>a part of the criminal case <em>was </em>appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, we have held that a writ of prohibition will prevent the exercise of jurisdiction when an <em>entire case </em>has been dismissed. See, e.g., <em>Page v. Riley </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 621, 623, 710 N.E.2d 690 (\u201cWhen a trial court unconditionally dismisses a case or a case has been properly voluntarily dismissed * * *, the trial court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed, and a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction\u201d); see, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>also, <em>State ex rel. Hunt v. Thompson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 182, 183, 586 N.E.2d 107; <em>State ex rel. Rice v. McGrath </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 70, 577 N.E.2d 1100.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b299-9\">Lyons &amp; Lyons Co., L.P.A., and Robert H. Lyons, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AsS\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Scott M. Heenan, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, we have held that comparable claims of breached plea agreements or double jeopardy are remediable by appeal rather than by extraordinary writ. See <em>Howard v. Randle, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 281, 2002-Ohio-2122, 767 N.E.2d 268; <em>State ex rel. Seikbert v. Wilkinson </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 489, 491, 633 N.E.2d 1128; <em>Wenzel v. Enright </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 63, 623 N.E.2d 69, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 16} Based on the foregoing, Judge Burlew does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to set aside the dismissal of the DUI charge and proceed upon the charge. We need not expressly decide Douglas\u2019s claims that Judge Burlew lacks jurisdiction, because our review is restricted to whether Judge Burlew <em>patently and unambiguously </em>lacks jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Hummel v. Sadler, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 84, 2002-Ohio-3605, 771 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 32. Because Douglas has an adequate remedy by appeal to raise her claims, she is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. Traf.R. 20 provides, \u201cIf no procedure is specifically prescribed by these rules, the Rules of Criminal Procedure and the applicable law apply.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
