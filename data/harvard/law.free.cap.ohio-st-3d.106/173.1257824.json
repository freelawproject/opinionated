Marshall Jr. completed an employment application for appellant, Nick Strimbu, Inc. (\u201cStrimbu\u201d), on August 23, 2000. Marshall was asked to list all of his employers for the last ten years. The application also required Marshall to acknowledge by his signature his understanding that \u201cfalse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>or misleading information given in [his] application or interview(s) may result in discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 3} Marshall was hired by Strimbu as a truck driver in September 2000. On September 12, Marshall was injured when his truck was struck by another, and a workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed. On September 22, Marshall moved appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio for temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 4} On September 27, 2000, James Buchman, Strimbu\u2019s Human Resources Director, received a call from Ginny Prokes, an employee of Strimbu\u2019s third-party administrator. According to Buchman, Prokes discovered that Marshall had omitted PI&amp;I Motor Express from the list of former employers that he had recorded on his employment application. According to Buchman\u2019s notes, Prokes \u201csaid if [the] employee falsified his application] or made false statements[, Strimbu] could discharge him and he would not be eligible] for TT[C].\u201d Strimbu sent Marshall a discharge letter the next day, alleging that he had falsified his employment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 5} Marshall\u2019s motion for TTC was heard by a commission district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) on December 8, 2000. Among other defenses, Strimbu proposed that Marshall\u2019s firing was a consequence of his voluntary acts and therefore was the abandonment of his position. Strimbu therefore claimed that TTC was barred pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 401, 650 N.E.2d 469. The DHO rejected that argument, finding that Marshall had not violated a written work rule, as explained in <em>LouisianarPacific Corp. </em>Id. at 403, 650 N.E.2d 469. The DHO found insufficient evidence to establish that Marshall had falsified his employment application, noting that inherent in such an action was an intent to deceive. Persuaded by Marshall\u2019s testimony that he simply forgot about the omitted employer, the DHO found the requisite intent lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 6} The commission left that finding intact on appeal. Strimbu thereafter filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, seeking to have the Industrial Commission vacate its order holding that Marshall had not voluntarily abandoned his employment. The court of appeals denied the writ, upholding the commission\u2019s reasoning in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 7} A voluntary abandonment of the former position of employment can support TTC denial. <em>State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 45, 531 N.E.2d 678. We have continued to reaffirm that principle. <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 561, 563, 722 N.E.2d 67; <em>State ex rel. McCoy v. Dedicated Transport, Inc., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 25, 2002-Ohio-5305, 776 N.E.2d 51, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b291-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Hanna, Campbell &amp; Powell, L.L.P., and Lori A.

Plymale, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">{\u00b6 8} Firing can constitute a voluntary abandonment of the former position of employment. <em>Louisiana-Pacific Corp., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 403, 650 N.E.2d 469. Although not technically consented to, employment termination is often the result of the claimant\u2019s willing conduct, thus giving job loss a voluntary character. <em>State ex rel. Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 118, 121, 623 N.E.2d 1202. Specifically, a voluntary termination is one \u201cgenerated by the claimant\u2019s violation of a written work rule or policy that (1) clearly defined the prohibited conduct, (2) had been previously identified by the employer as a dischargeable offense, and (3) was known or should have been known to the employee.\u201d <em>Louisiana-Pacific Corp., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 403, 650 N.E.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 9} In the case at bar, the commission found, after being unconvinced that Marshall had violated a written work rule or policy, that Marshall\u2019s discharge did not constitute a voluntary abandonment. At issue is a clause in Marshall\u2019s employment application that states that by its signing, Marshall understood that \u201cfalse or misleading information given in [his] application or interview(s) may result in discharge.\u201d Marshall\u2019s application omitted reference to prior employment with PI&amp;I Motor Express. The litigants\u2019 arguments reveal a consensus that an omission \u2014 in order to constitute falsification \u2014 must be deliberate and motivated by an intent to deceive. Strimbu claimed, at the hearing, that the omission was deliberate and amounted to falsification. Marshall stated that it was inadvertent and that he simply forgot PI&amp;I while attempting to recount all of his employers over the past decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 10} The commission was persuaded by Marshall\u2019s testimony, and we \u2014 like the court of appeals \u2014 defer to that determination. The commission is exclusively responsible for determining evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 414, 417, 662 N.E.2d 364. Because this determination was within the commission\u2019s prerogative and was supported by evidence, we decline to find that it was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 11} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
