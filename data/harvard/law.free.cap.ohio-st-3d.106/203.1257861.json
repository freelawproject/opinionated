Trucinski worked for appellant, International Paper. In 1998, a chemical explosion at the plant injured Trucinski\u2019s left leg, resulting in an above-the-knee amputation. He was eventually fitted with a prosthesis and, in time, secured other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio awarded Trucinski scheduled-loss compensation under R.C. 4123.57(B) for the total loss of the left leg. Claimant later applied for compensation for permanent total disability (\u201cPTD\u201d), pursuant to R.C. 4123.58(C) and <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. Indus. Comm., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 37, 2002-Ohio-5306, 776 N.E.2d 62. The commission granted PTD in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">{\u00b6 3} International Paper unsuccessfully challenged Trucinski\u2019s PTD award in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. It now turns to this court on an appeal as of right, seeking to have <em>Thomas </em>overruled and claimant\u2019s PTD award vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">{\u00b6 4} Statutory PTD is established by \u201c[t]he loss or loss of use of both hands or both arms, or both feet or both legs, or both eyes, or of any two thereof.\u201d R.C. 4123.58(C). In 2002, <em>Thomas </em>declared the hand and arm to be distinct body parts for purposes of 4123.58(C). Consequently, the loss of an entire single extremity can equate to the loss of two body parts and statutory PTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 5} International Paper asks us to overrule <em>Thomas. </em>Stare decisis, however, compels our adherence to precedent unless (1) the challenged decision was wrongly decided at that time or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the challenged decision defies practical workability, and (3) overruling the decision would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at syllabus. Because International Paper cannot satisfy <em>Galatis, </em>we decline its request that we overrule <em>Thomas, </em>and we continue to adhere to its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 6} We are not persuaded that <em>Thomas </em>was wrongly decided. Given the absence of a statutory definition for the terms \u201carm\u201d and \u201cleg,\u201d we do not find that the <em>Thomas </em>court erred in construing the statute as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 7} Contrary to International Paper\u2019s assertion, this conclusion does not conflict with <em>State ex rel. Cook v. Zimpher </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 236, 17 OBR 474, 479 N.E.2d 263. <em>Cook </em>involved former R.C. 4123.57(C) (now 4123.57(B)), not R.C. 4123.58(C), as here. Workers\u2019 compensation terms, moreover, can have different meanings in different statutes. See <em>State ex rel. Kaska v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 743, 591 N.E.2d 235. That \u201cleg\u201d may include the foot for R.C. 4123.57(B) purposes does not compel the same interpretation for R.C. 4123.58(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 8} We also reject International Paper\u2019s claim that <em>Thomas </em>is constitutionally suspect. Its equal-protection argument fails because it cannot establish disparate treatment between similarly situated individuals. Regardless of the amputation site, so long as the commission has declared a total loss of use of an extremity, there is no dissimilar treatment \u2014 all such claimants will receive statutory PTD. There is no equal-protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 9} International Paper\u2019s argument on substantive due process is more vague, consisting of the broad assertion that <em>Thomas </em>is forcing it to \u201cpay for an injury that it did not cause.\u201d This declaration ignores the commission\u2019s determination long ago that Trucinski\u2019s injury occurred in the course of and arising from his employment with International Paper. That the claimant is not literally totally disabled does not mean that the legislature\u2019s decision to compensate him as if he were is invalid, nor does it mean that International Paper is paying for something unrelated to claimant\u2019s employment. There has been, therefore, no arbitrary deprivation of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 10} We are equally unconvinced that the decision defies practical workability \u2014 the second prong of <em>Galatis. </em>International Paper alleges dire financial consequences to the workers\u2019 compensation system as a whole and to the state\u2019s employers as a result of <em>Thomas, </em>but thus far \u2014 in the three years since the decision \u2014 that has not come to pass. There has been no evidence presented that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>indicates that injuries of this magnitude occur with sufficient frequency to constitute a significant burden on the system. Our experience bears this out: since <em>Thomas </em>was announced, only four cases invoking it have been decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 11} These facts contrast starkly with those in <em>Galatis. Galatis </em>was generated by the court\u2019s decisions four years earlier in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116, and <em>Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 557, 715 N.E.2d 1142. <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>held that an uninsured-motorist endorsement that identified \u201cyou\u201d as the named insured where \u201cyou\u201d was a corporation must extend coverage to an employee outside the course and scope of employment. <em>Ezawa </em>took <em>ScottPontzer </em>one step further by, in certain situations, extending that coverage to a family member of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 12} The practical ramifications of <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>were staggering:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. {\u00b6 13} <em>\u201cScott-Pontzer </em>and its progeny defy practical workability. The multitude of <em>post-Scott-Pontzer </em>issues before this court, the widespread criticism of the decision from other jurisdictions, and the numerous conflicts emanating from the lower courts indicate that the decision muddied the waters of insurance coverage litigation, converted simple liability suits into complex multiparty litigation, and created massive and widespread confusion \u2014 the antithesis of what a decision of this court should do. Attorneys are forced to file briefs and appendixes that are several inches thick in an attempt to form a coherent picture out of the post<em>iScott-Pontzer </em>morass.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 14} There is no such equivalent here. International Paper also accuses <em>Thomas </em>of creating a windfall for claimants because it awards statutory PTD irrespective of a claimant\u2019s ability to work \u2014 clearly a reference to Trucinski\u2019s resumed employment after receiving his prosthesis. International Paper misrepresents <em>Thomas. </em>Statutory PTD has long been awarded irrespective 'of a claimant\u2019s ability to work or even actual employment. See <em>State ex rel. Szatkowski v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 320, 322, 530 N.E.2d 880. Granting PTD compensation despite the ability to work was a choice of the legislature, not a creation of <em>Thomas, </em>and does not support overruling the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 15} International Paper alternatively argues that if not overruled, <em>Thomas </em>should at least be distinguished from this case because, unlike the present case, <em>Thomas </em>involved the arm, not the leg. We disagree. The loss of any extremity is devastating in a way that those who have not experienced such a loss can never truly understand. We decline to engage in a distinction that could be perceived as placing a value judgment on the degree and severity of the loss of an arm or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>leg. The General Assembly accorded equal weight to both types of losses in R.C. 4123.58(C). We will not disturb that determination.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-SX\">Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., Timothy L. Zix, and Majeed G.
