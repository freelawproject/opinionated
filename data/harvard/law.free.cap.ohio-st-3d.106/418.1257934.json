Hunter of Solon, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0009526, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1977. On February 27, 2004, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent in a second amended two-count complaint with violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and, based on stipulations and other evidence, made findings of misconduct and a recommendation, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">Facts Underlying Counts I and II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">{\u00b6 2} On April 6, 1999, respondent was appointed Evelyn Grundstein\u2019s guardian and was charged with overseeing Grundstein\u2019s welfare and assets, which exceeded $500,000. As guardian, respondent agreed to account for all expendi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tures and income and had authority to expend estate assets only upon probate court approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 3} From September 1999 through March 2001, while serving as Grundstein\u2019s guardian, respondent misappropriated at least $180,000 from the guardianship estate. Respondent withdrew this money for her own use through several bank counter checks totaling over $83,000, ATM transactions totaling an estimated $27,000, and 38 other checks totaling over $80,000. Respondent marked several of these checks as being compensation for \u201cattorney fees\u201d or a \u201cbusiness loan\u201d; however, she had no probate court approval for these payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent\u2019s embezzlement scheme began on September 14, 1999, when she withdrew without probate court approval over $84,000 from a $186,000 certificate of deposit belonging to her ward. Respondent then deposited these funds, dividing them between two bank accounts that she maintained for Grundstein\u2019s care. Her withdrawal cost the guardianship estate interest on the certificate of deposit and a $2,000 early-withdrawal penalty. Respondent later used these bank accounts as a source from which to misappropriate funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 5} Among numerous other transactions, respondent wrote a check to herself from a Grundstein bank account on September 17, 1999, for $31,000. On March 27, 2000, she wrote two bank counter checks also for her own use: one for $33,825.53 and another for $50,000. Respondent conceded under oath that she spent these sums for her own benefit; however, she could not specifically recall where much of the money went, and her bank records were of no help in explaining how she used the stolen funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 6} In November 2000, respondent began a solo law practice. Respondent used some of the stolen funds for her law firm startup and operation costs. She also used part of the funds for personal expenses, including acupuncture treatment and monthly massages.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 7} On Monday, April 2, 2001, Grundstein died. On the Saturday before Grundstein\u2019s death, as trustee of the Henry L. Wiech Trust, respondent moved $100,000 from the trust account to the Grundstein bank account to help conceal the prior theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent was later removed as Grundstein\u2019s guardian for failing to timely file a final account. Grundstein\u2019s next of kin hired attorney Kenneth Traeger to represent Grundstein\u2019s estate. Traeger reviewed guardianship paperwork and bank records and discovered respondent\u2019s extensive misappropriation. In May 2001, Traeger called respondent about his findings, but respondent failed to explain the reasons for the missing money. Afterward, she refused to return his telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>{\u00b6 9} When respondent did not reply to his inquiries, Traeger filed a motion to surcharge respondent for the missing funds. At a hearing in August 2001, respondent\u2019s attorney delivered a check to Traeger for $55,021.79 and also presented him with an application for $32,000 in legal fees for respondent\u2019s services as guardian. The application was never filed with the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 10} At a second hearing, respondent\u2019s attorney delivered another check to Traeger, this time for $42,000. Settlement discussions ensued and led to questions about the source of funds for the $100,000 deposit respondent made at the time of Grundstein\u2019s death. In response, respondent solicited a letter from Virginia R. Cook Lester, the primary beneficiary of the Wiech trust, in which Lester advised that she had lent respondent the $100,000 from the Wiech trust. The motion to surcharge was dismissed based on respondent\u2019s reimbursement and Lester\u2019s assurance that the $100,000 had come from a legitimate source.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 11} Lester was the stepdaughter of Henry L. Wiech, who died February 12, 2001. Wiech\u2019s estate contained approximately $33,000 in assets, and the Wiech trust was valued at an estimated $1,369,658. Wiech had chosen respondent to be executor of his will and successor trustee upon his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 12} In addition to being the primary beneficiary, Lester was also advisor to respondent as trustee of-the Wiech trust, and the declaration of trust required that respondent consult with Lester prior to making any distributions. Notwithstanding this restriction, respondent withdrew $100,000 from the Wiech trust on March 31, 2001, without Lester\u2019s knowledge and deposited it into the Grundstein bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent did not report her $100,000 withdrawal to Lester until late September or early October 2001. At that time, respondent recited a series of hardships and confessed to Lester that she had withdrawn $100,000 from the trust for her personal use. Respondent then assisted Lester in writing the letter designating as a loan the misappropriated $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent promised to repay the $100,000 by December 2001 with interest and to provide a signed promissory note documenting the loan. She did not also tell Lester that she had already used the money to partially repay funds that she had stolen from the Grundstein estate or that she hoped to exculpate herself for that theft with Lester\u2019s letter. Moreover, despite her promise, respondent neither repaid the $100,000 nor forwarded a promissory note by December 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">{\u00b6 15} The Ohio estate taxes for the Wiech estate were due in November 2001. Respondent, however, did not have the money to pay the taxes from either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>trust or the estate until October 2003. The Wiech estate was assessed over $5,000 in interest by the Ohio Department of Taxation for respondent\u2019s delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 16} Lester asked respondent repeatedly to send the promissory note for the $100,000 debt, but respondent did not do so until February 2003. Respondent also did not return many of Lester\u2019s telephone calls or respond to her letters asking for regular billing statements. And contrary to Lester\u2019s wishes, respondent did not provide bills for her time or account records from November 2002 through September 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 17} For serving as executor and attorney for the Wiech estate and trustee and attorney for the Wiech trust for the three years after February 2001, respondent was paid over $98,000. She did not, however, tailor her billing practices to the particular service provided. Respondent\u2019s records indicate that she charged attorney rates for completing nonlegal administrative tasks, including picking up mail, depositing checks, paying bills, and arranging for lawn care, house cleaning, and the delivery of necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 18} At a January 2003 deposition during the Grundstein investigation, respondent was asked whether she had misappropriated funds from any other sources. Respondent did not mention the $100,000 she took from the Wiech trust. Respondent has since claimed that after Lester\u2019s letter, which she argues ratified the $100,000 withdrawal, she considered the withdrawal a loan. At the panel hearing, however, respondent admitted that she viewed her withdrawal of $100,000 from the Wiech trust as a misappropriation. Because of respondent\u2019s silence on this issue, more than one year passed before relator discovered the Wiech trust embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 19} We find, consistent with the board\u2019s report, that by embezzling during a three-year period nearly $300,000 from two separate estates in her charge, respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (barring illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), 1-102(A)(4) (barring conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (barring conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on the fitness to practice law), 2-106(A) (barring the charge or collection of an illegal or excessive legal fee), 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of and protect all client funds upon receipt), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly pay requested funds that a client is entitled to receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">{\u00b6 20} In finding this misconduct, we reject respondent\u2019s argument that she did not commit a crime of moral turpitude. Respondent\u2019s embezzlement in the Grundstein case recently resulted in her conviction of felony theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02, for which we suspended her license to practice law for an interim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>period pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(l)(a). See <em>In re Hunter, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1554, 2005-Ohio-2424, 828 N.E.2d 110. Moreover, stealing from a guardianship, trust, or decedent\u2019s estate is illegal and immoral and violates DR 1-102(A)(3). See, e.g., <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Muhlbach, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 340, 2004-Ohio-6563, 819 N.E.2d 698, and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Hamilton </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 330, 725 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 21} Respondent argues, however, that her mental disability weighs heavily against a finding of moral turpitude because, according to the medical evidence, her depression \u201cinhibited\u201d her judgment during the periods that she repeatedly stole large sums of money. Respondent insists that her depression clouded her understanding of right and wrong and thus diminished the quality of her judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 22} We disagree. In explaining the severity of respondent\u2019s mental illness in 1999 and 2000, respondent\u2019s treating psychiatrist described her as \u201cclearly impaired in her ability to think clearly,\u201d but he also said that she had \u201cthe capacity to recognize reality\u201d and that her condition did not prohibit her from knowing right from wrong. Seizing on this testimony, relator\u2019s counsel urged the panel to account in its report for the difference between doing wrong while depressed and doing wrong because of depression. Although it is not clear that the panel or the board subscribed to this distinction, we do.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 23} No evidence established that respondent was so debilitated by her depression that she could not appreciate the gravity of her wrongdoing. Her own actions, in fact, dispel that notion. At the time of Grundstein\u2019s death, respondent realized that her theft would likely be discovered by whoever Grundstein\u2019s family selected to administer the estate. So immediately, respondent stole more money from another entrusted source to conceal her embezzlement. And months later, obviously still realizing the impropriety of her crime, respondent persuaded the unsuspecting Lester to \u201cratify\u201d her theft as a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 24} Where moral turpitude is disputed, an independent review of the circumstances underlying the illegal conduct is necessary to determine whether the conduct manifests the requisite lack of social conscience and depravity beyond any established criminal intent. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Burkhart </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 188, 191, 661 N.E.2d 1062. We have conducted that review in this case and agree with the board that respondent\u2019s theft was motivated by an unmitigated interest in personal financial gain at others\u2019 expense. Our conclusion warrants a finding that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 25} We also reject respondent\u2019s challenge to the board\u2019s finding that she charged an excessive fee. As discussed, the evidence establishes that respondent charged Lester legal fees for a variety of nonlegal services. This practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>overcharging violates DR 2-106(A). <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Alsfelder, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 375, 2004-Ohio-5216, 816 N.E.2d 218, \u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 26} In determining the sanction for this misconduct, we review the aggravating and mitigating features of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). We adopt the board\u2019s findings in aggravation that respondent committed her misconduct out of greed and deceit. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). And because respondent stole so much for so long, we also agree with the board that respondent engaged in a pattern of misconduct and committed multiple offenses. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). Moreover, we share the board\u2019s and panel\u2019s skepticism as to respondent\u2019s candor and find it implausible that she could have withdrawn sums as large as $83,000 but could not remember how she spent them. Consistent with the board\u2019s report, we find that respondent took advantage of Lester\u2019s kindness and trust to conceal the misappropriation of money from the Wiech trust and to give the appearance of repayment in the Grundstein case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 27} In mitigation, we find that respondent has no prior record of professional discipline. BCGD Prog.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). She also claims to have repaid the clients the misappropriated sums. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(c). We hold, however, that the restitution was not mitigating because it was neither timely nor in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 28} Respondent, who suffers from post-polio syndrome and other physical ailments, also presented two character witnesses and numerous letters of recommendation that described her integrity and competence apart from the committed misconduct. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e). The most extenuating circumstance of her case, however, is the mental disability from which she suffered during the underlying events. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 29} To have significant mitigating effect under BCGD Proc.Reg. (10)(B)(2)(g), a mental disability must be supported by all of the following: (1) a qualified health-care professional, (2) a determination that the mental disability contributed to the misconduct, (3) a sustained period of successful treatment, and (4) a prognosis from a qualified health-care professional that the attorney will be able to return, under specified conditions if necessary, to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 30} Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey C. Hutzler testified that he diagnosed respondent with major depression in 2001 and that in his medical opinion, she had shown symptoms consistent with that condition for at least the two previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>years. According to Dr. Hutzler, respondent\u2019s mental disability also partially caused the misconduct she committed. Respondent has responded successfully to treatment, Dr. Hutzler reported, and has recovered to the extent that her diagnosis is now major depressive disorder, recurrent type, mild. Dr. Hutzler considers respondent\u2019s prognosis to be good and, providing she continues to adhere to her treatment regimen, he is confident that she will have no debilitating recurrence of her former symptoms and can return to the competent and ethical practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 31} Relator advocated respondent\u2019s disbarment before the panel. Respondent requested a two-year suspension, with the entire suspension period stayed upon conditions, including a monitored probation period of respondent\u2019s law practice. The board acknowledged that disbarment is the presumptive sanction for a lawyer\u2019s misappropriation of client assets. Adopting the panel\u2019s recommendation, however, the board credited respondent\u2019s mitigating evidence, particularly her mental disability, and recommended an indefinite suspension. The board further recommended conditions for respondent\u2019s reinstatement, including a candid accounting of the embezzled funds, proof of full restitution, and continued treatment for her mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 32} Upon review, we find the recommendation to indefinitely suspend inappropriate. To protect clients and the public, to ensure the administration of justice, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession, see American Bar Association Center for Professional Responsibility, Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 &amp; Amend.1992), Standard 1.1., we instead order that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 33} Respondent raises three objections to the board\u2019s report. First, she contends that imposing an indefinite suspension is unfair and violates equal protection. In the second, she maintains that no evidence justifies an indefinite suspension. In the third, she asserts that the mitigation warrants a lesser sanction. As relator argues, the substance of all of her objections is that her case warrants a less onerous sanction than an indefinite suspension. We consider all the objections together.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 34} The appropriate sanction in a case of professional misconduct depends on \u201cthe duties violated, the actual injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. King, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 438, 2004-Ohio-5470, 816 N.E.2d 1040, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 35} Here, respondent knowingly breached her duty to her clients. As evidenced by her violations of DR 1-102(A)(4) and 9-102, respondent treated Grundstein and Wiech, to whom she owed a fiduciary duty, with deceit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>dishonesty. In violating DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(3), (4), and (5), respondent also compromised her duty to the public in general, ignoring the community\u2019s expectation that lawyers will protect their clients property and perform with integrity. Respondent\u2019s violation of DR 1-102(A)(5) and (6) and 2-106 similarly compromised her duty to her clients, the legal system, and the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 36} The injuries suffered due to respondent\u2019s transgressions were immense. Respondent misappropriated nearly $300,000 from an incompetent ward and a trust that she had promised to protect. She also engaged in conduct that was misleading and designed to hide her embezzlement from Lester, Traeger, the probate court, and relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 37} Although relator no longer advocates disbarment, relator observes that \u201c[t]he starting point for determining the appropriate sanction for misappropriation is disbarment.\u201d <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Churilla </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 348, 350, 678 N.E.2d 515. \u201cThe continuing public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires that the strictest discipline be imposed in misappropriation cases.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Belock </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 694 N.E.2d 897. Disbarment is the presumptive sanction for misappropriation. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Dixon, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 490, 2002-Ohio-2490, 769 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 38} Respondent urges us to impose a sanction even more lenient than an indefinite suspension, mainly because of her mental disability. She relies on <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Gerren, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-4110, 812 N.E.2d 1280, in which after taking into account mitigating features not including mental disability, we suspended a lawyer\u2019s license to practice for six months because he misappropriated over $12,000 that he was obligated to pay on a client\u2019s behalf to a medical provider. Respondent suggested that a similar sanction is appropriate here because in finding the theft of client funds in <em>Gerren </em>intolerable, we said that \u201cit is immaterial whether the [misappropriated] amount at stake is large or small.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 39} Our statement in <em>Gerren </em>was not intended to establish a rule that all lawyers who steal from their clients will receive a six-month suspension. It was intended to advise lawyers that if they misappropriate even a relatively small amount of a client\u2019s funds, their license to practice law will be suspended. For theft and dishonesty of the magnitude committed in this case, the appropriate sanction is disbarment, even considering respondent\u2019s mental condition. \u201cThe appropriate sanction when a lawyer knowingly converts funds for the lawyer\u2019s benefit is disbarment.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Wherry </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 584, 587, 722 N.E.2d 515. Accord <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Madden </em>(2000), 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Ohio St.3d 238, 730 N.E.2d 379; <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Bernardic </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 26, 656 N.E.2d 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 40} Respondent is therefore disbarred. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">Resnick, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b542-8\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b542-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b542-10\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">{\u00b6 41} I respectfully dissent from the sanction imposed on respondent by the majority. I believe that the record reveals the existence of mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the irrevocable sanction of permanent disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">{\u00b6 42} It is fully appropriate for disbarment to be the presumptive disposition in a disciplinary case when an attorney has stolen from clients. Respondent without question egregiously violated the trust of her clients and her responsibilities to them, as well as to the profession. However, by definition, a presumptive sanction of disbarment does not preclude the application of mitigation. That is, the presumption in favor of disbarment in the case of theft from clients is a rebuttable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">{\u00b6 43} This court has rightly acknowledged that the mental illness of an attorney, where proven, should be considered in mitigation when the relationship between that illness and the attorney\u2019s conduct meets certain criteria. Section 10(B)(2)(g) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d) instructs the board that it may consider mental disability as mitigating when all of the following are present:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(i) A diagnosis of a * * * mental disability by a qualified health care professional * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(ii) A determination that the * * * mental disability contributed to cause the misconduct;</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(iii) * * * [A] sustained period of successful treatment;</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(iv) A prognosis from a qualified health care professional * * * that the attorney will be able to return to competent, ethical professional practice under specified conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>{\u00b6 48} In adopting BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g), the court established as policy that, while attorney misconduct caused, in part, by an illness of the brain should not be excused, the fact of mental disability or illness should be meaningfully considered in determining a sanction. I am not persuaded that imposition of disbarment in this case is consistent with recognition of respondent\u2019s mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 49} In the case at bar, two competent and highly credentialed medical doctors \u2014 one a published author of medical texts and a professor of psychiatry at the Cleveland Clinic and the other a psychiatrist retained by the board itself\u2014 evaluated respondent\u2019s mental health at the time of her misconduct and following treatment. Both came to professional opinions that respondent suffered from a major depressive disorder. Their testimony clearly establishes the presence of each of the factors set forth in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 50} Jeffrey C. Hutzler, M.D., a psychiatrist, testified regarding respondent\u2019s mental health. Hutzler has served on the faculty of the medical schools of the Ohio State University and the Cleveland Clinic and first saw respondent as a patient in June 2001. He testified that respondent met the diagnosis of mental illness set forth in R.C. 5122.01(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and described her as having \u201ca substantial disorder of mood, * * * of memory, and * * * impaired judgment. * * * [S]he was clearly depressed, which was a problem of mood which was significant.\u201d Dr. Hutzler believed that respondent had first experienced depression in 1998 or 1999 and had not fully recovered by the time of their initial appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 51} Dr. Hutzler testified that her mental-health problems impaired her ability to distinguish right from wrong. When asked by a panel member whether respondent\u2019s major depression contributed to cause her acts of dishonesty, Dr. Hutzler responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that it certainly interfered with her judgment and certainly had an effect on her acts of dishonesty.\u201d In April 2004, his diagnosis of respondent was major depressive disorder, recurrent type, mild, and in remission. He recommended ongoing psychotherapy and testified that his prognosis for respondent was good and that she was likely to recover fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 52} At the request of the board, Dr. Peter Geier conducted an independent psychiatric evaluation of respondent in April 2003. He concluded that respondent had suffered from major depressive disorder from January 2000 through June 2001, but did not suffer from any mental illness at the time of the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>{\u00b6 53} These unrebutted opinions, expressed with reasonable medical certainty, demonstrated each of the criteria set forth in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g). In imposing the sanction of permanent disbarment despite this medical evidence, the majority has not given adequate credit in mitigation to respondent\u2019s diagnosed mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 54} In addition, the board received more than 30 letters of endorsement from individuals representing a wide spectrum of the community, including attorneys, judges, clients, and community activists. Despite the egregious misconduct proven by the board during the years surrounding the active phase of her depression, those who have known respondent over many years repeatedly described her as trustworthy, honest, and unusually caring towards her primarily elderly clients. Although such communications are often not relevant to the conduct for which a respondent is sanctioned, they are helpful here in placing respondent\u2019s conduct in perspective. One writer observed, \u201c[Cjlinical depression * * * must have been a significant factor in Sandra\u2019s recent problems as I cannot imagine Sandra engaging in such conduct under any other circumstance.\u201d The letters describe respondent as \u201ctrustworthy, altruistic, easy to work with and reliable\u201d; \u201cone of the most knowledgeable, caring and honest attorneys in the office\u201d; \u201cprofessional in her conduct, very honest and forthcoming\u201d; \u201chonest, fair and completely within the parameters of her legal expertise professionally\u201d; \u201cconcern[ed] for the feelings and welfare of her clients\u201d; \u201ca person of the highest degree of integrity and trustworthiness\u201d who has always adhered to the \u201chighest ethical standards\u201d and \u201chas [the colleague\u2019s] complete trust and respect\u201d; and \u201can excellent attorney \u2014 trustworthy, honest, accurate, and punctual with complete knowledge of the laws of Ohio.\u201d One client expressed her hope that respondent \u201cwill still be here when [she dies] to help [her] children in a difficult time as she has helped\u201d the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 55} The majority imposes the most severe sanction available for attorney misconduct, even though that sanction was not recommended by the panel that heard the witnesses or the board; nor is it now sought by relator. While this court is responsible for imposing attorney discipline in order to protect the public from a recurrence of similar conduct, we have adopted rules and programs that enable us to achieve this goal without ordering disbarment. Should respondent seek reinstatement from an indefinite suspension after the expiration of the two-year period established by Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B), she would be required to establish \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d that she \u201cpossesses all of the <em>mental, </em>educational, and <em>moral qualifications </em>that were required of an applicant for admission to the practice of law in Ohio at the time of * * * her original admission\u201d and that she \u201cis now a proper person to be readmitted to the practice of law in Ohio, notwithstanding the previous disciplinary action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Gov.Bar R. V(10)(E)(2) and (4). An application for reinstatement would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>trigger a hearing by the board to \u201ctake and report evidence relevant to the rehabilitation of the petitioner and his or her possession of all the <em>mental, </em>educational, <em>and moral </em>qualifications\u201d required of an applicant to the bar. (Emphasis added.) Gov.Bar R. V(10)(F). Even then, this court has the authority to order a conditional reinstatement. Gov.Bar R. V(10)(E)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b545-9\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert R. Berger, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AMX\">Mary L. Cibella, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 56} This record does not support disbarment. The public would be adequately protected by imposition of an indefinite suspension with the conditions recommended by the board and with the expectation that a full mental-health review would be conducted if and when respondent applied for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 57} The panel concluded that the matters offered in mitigation, particularly respondent\u2019s \u201cresolved mental disability which contributed to cause the misconduct she is charged with,\u201d justified a sanction less than disbarment. It concluded that \u201cthe interests of the profession and society would be better served by permitting her to return to the practice of law upon demonstrating restitution and continued mental health \u2014 and candidly admitting where the funds went which she stole.\u201d I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 58} I would accept the recommendation of the board and would indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio with the conditions proposed by the board.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">.
