The prayer of the complaint is that the plaintiff have judgment for the sum of $4,080, but there are no allegations in the complaint which will justify a recovery for a greater amount than the face of the policy, unless it be interest which had accumulated from the time of the alleged death of the assured until this :iction was instituted. The policy which is the basis of the action shows that the amount involved does not exceed $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Judgment having been rendered for the plaintiff, the cause was brought to this court on writ of error. Neither party has raised the question of jurisdiction, but section 37 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1098 [Comp. St. \u00a7 1019]) makes it' the duty of the District. Court to dismiss any cause, if at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the court that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute properly within the jurisdiction of said District Court. So far as the appellate courts are concerned the well established rule is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-8\">\u201cOn every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question Is that of jurisdiction, first, of this court, and then of the court from which the record comes. This question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise suggested, and without respect to the relation of the parties to it.\u201d M., C. &amp; L. M. Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382, 4 Sup. Ct. 510, 511, 28 L. Ed. 462; Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. R. v. Willard, 226 U. S. 413, 419, 31 Sup. Ct. 460. 55 L. Ed. 521; Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. v.

Ct. 598, 48 L. Ed. 870; Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. v. Nebraska, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is not the amount claimed in the prayer for relief which determines the jurisdiction of the court, if the unmistakable fact and legal certainty be that the plaintiff could not have had any reasonable expectation that she couki recovo-, exclusive of interest and costs, an amount within the jurisdiction of the court. In such a case it is the duty of the court to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction, although the ad damnum clause demands judgment for a sum sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court. Smith v. Greenhow, 109 U. S. 669, 3 Sup. Ct. 421, 27 L. Ed. 1080; North America, etc., Co. v. Morrison, 178 U. S. 262, 267, 20 Sup. Ct. 869, 44 L. Ed. 1061; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U.
