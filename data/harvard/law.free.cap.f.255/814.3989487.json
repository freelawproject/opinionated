The accident was due, it is alleged, to a. sudden release of the float from the bridge by the agents and employ\u00e9s of the defendant without giving any warning.

The able and experienced judge who presided at the trial of this case instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the jury very fully in a carefully prepared charge which covers 18 printed pages in the transcript of the record. The jury has given the plaintiff a verdict which is moderate in amount. Nevertheless we think it necessary to send this case back for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">The negligence with which the defendant is charged consists in two alleged omissions:</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">1. Failure to warn the deceased of the sudden release of the. float from the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">2. Failure to furnish sufficient light to enable the deceased to work in safety at the place where the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">It was admitted in this court that no warning of the. release of the float was given. At the trial the defendant introduced testimony to show that the L,ehigh Valley and the D. L. &amp; W. companies, engaged in similar operations, do not give warnings when a float is about to be released, but a man has to look out for himself. The following excerpt from the testimony tells its own story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-8\">\u201cQ. How does lie know what is going to happen? A. He has two eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">\u201cQ. Suppose ho is working in the hack of the boat, up very near the bumper? A. The way they work everybody looks out for\u2019himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">\u201cQ. The boat does take a very violent drop when she leaves the toggle. Xiins?' A. Naturally; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">\u201c(). If, at high tide, she takes, you say, a bigger drop than at low tide? A. Yes, she would take a bigger drop at high tide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">\u201c&lt;}. And she will take a drop sometimes as much as six feet at high tide? A. <em>More than </em>that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-13\">\u201cQ. Ilow much is the highest you know of? A. Eight to ten feet. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-14\">\u201cQ. You say a man should look out for himself? A. Yes, sir. <em>* * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-15\">\u201cQ. Suppose it is a watchman the first night he is on. there and doesn\u2019t know anything about it? A. He stands on his own responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-16\">\u201cQ. That is the way you work it? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-17\">\u201cQ. Thai applies to the crew? A. Everybody. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-18\">A). If a float is going to droj) six or eight or ten feet, and he doesn\u2019t know the drop is going to come, he is in danger, isn\u2019t he? A. If he don\u2019t know it, lu&gt; has no business being there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-19\">\u201cQ. He is in danger when that boat is going to drop, isn\u2019t he? A. If ho is in the way, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-20\">The jury were properly instructed and at great length on this branch of the case and were charged, among other things, that if they were reasonably satisfied from the evidence that it was the duty of defendant to give notice to Gallagher before the release of the float from the bridge, and negligently failed to give notice, that would entitle Mr. Gallagher\u2019s administratrix to damages; and that the burden was on the plaintiff reasonably to satisfy them that it was the duty of defendant to give that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-21\">The defendant asked the court to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-22\">\u201cYon cannot find any negligence on the part of defendant upon the ground <em>Unit no </em>warning was given that the float was to be released from the bridge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-23\">The request was refused and exception taken. This was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-24\">We come now to the second allegation of defendant\u2019s negligence, in that it failed to furnish sufficient light to enable the deceased to work in safety. The bridgeman was examined as to the lights on the bridge at the time of the accident. His testimony was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>\u201cQ. Were there any lights on the bridge at that time? A. Yes, the whole business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\">\u201cQ. Now, where were the lights, if you remember, Mr. Stanton? A. Bight ' over the entrance to the bridge \u2014 on the bridge work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">\u201cQ. And you now distinctly remember that the lights were lit there? A. Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201cQ. Did you have any difficulty in seeing the edge of the bridge and the' floats on bridge <em>4, </em>or only bridge <em>4, </em>on that night? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">\u201cQ. Did you have any difficulty in seeing at that place on any night that you worked there? A. See what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">\u201cQ. Were the lights sufficiently illuminated to see what you were working at at that place? A Sure; they might once in a while go out \u2014 something might happen to the dynamo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-9\">\u201cQ. On this night they didn\u2019t go out? A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-10\">\u201cQ. Was it necessary for\u2019the bridgeman to have lights working on bridge 4 and the other bridges on any night? A. Tes, sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-11\">\u201cQ. Was it possible for the bridgemen to perform their duties without lights? A Well, that I could not say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-12\">\u201cQ. Tou don\u2019t know? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-13\">\u201cQ. It would make it hard, would it not? A Tes, likely to get killed; that\u2019s about all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">Another witness, who was a floatman on the railway company\u2019s tug which was to pull out the float on which Gallagher was at work, and who was standing on the bridge about 15 feet from the point where the bridge met the float when the accident occurred, saw and recognized Gallagher when he was halfway down the float 100 feet away. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-15\">\u201cQ. And Gallagher was halfway down that float, or about 100 feet away from you, was he? A. Tes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-16\">\u201cQ. And you saw him working? A. Tes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-17\">\u201cQ. Did he have a light? A. I didn\u2019t see a light.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-18\">\u201cQ. Were there any lights on the float? A No, there were no lights on the float, but lights on Dock 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-19\">\u201cQ. And were there lights on the bridge? A Tes, sir; there was a light there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-20\">\u201cQ. Those lights were right over your head while you were standing there, weren\u2019t they? A. Tes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-21\">\u201cQ. And you could see plainly a distance of 100 feet, so that you could recognize Gallagher? A. Tes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-22\">\u201cQ. From the time you first saw him nailing this door, you say after he had finished that job he came walking toward you? A. Tes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-23\">In approaching the witness he was, of course, approaching the light on the bridge. One other witness, a deck hand on the tugboat, who, when the accident happened, jumped from the tugboat upon the bumper end of the float and then ran to the toggle end, was asked as to the lights, but testified as to the persons he saw and recognized on the bridge while he was standing on the float. There is not in the record any other evidence in- the plaintiff\u2019s case regarding lighting facilities. The defendant by the uncontradicted testimony of seven witnesses established the fact that there was a cluster of four 100-candle- power electric lights covered by a reflector about 15 feet from the place of the accident and that the lights were burning. The defendant at the close of the case stated that he had three other witnesses who, if called to the stand, would testify that the lights on the bridge were lit at the time of the occurrence of the accident and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>no system of warning employes of the release of the floats was used by defendant at that time. Counsel for plaintiff then conceded that if the witnesses were called they would so testify. There is absolutely no testimony in the case from any witness that the light was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Counsel for defendant asked the court to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">\u201cYou cannot find any negligence of the defendant upon the ground that there was not sufficient light at the place where deceased fell into the water.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The request was refused and an exception was taken. The refusal to give the request was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The rule is well established that a refusal to grant a specific request to withdraw from the jury one of several specific charges of negligence is fatal error if there is no substantial evidence to sustain the charge. The reason is that the appellate court cannot know but that the jury may have found its verdict upon the baseless charge. Wilmington Mining Co. v. Fulton, 205 U. S. 60, 27 Sup. Ct. 412, 51 L.
