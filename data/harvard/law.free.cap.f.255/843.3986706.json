The defendant answered, specifically pleading the general issue and by notice as to evidence to be offered thereunder substantially pleaded that the plaintiff through his own negligence contributed to the injuries sued for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b856-5\">The case was brought to trial before the court and a jury duly impaneled, and thereupon the plaintiff testified in his own behalf, substantially establishing the facts set forth in his declaration. This was followed with evidence to the contrary on the part of the defendant, mainly denying the facts testified to by piaintiff, and with evidence tending to show contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and impeaching the credibility of plaintiff and his witnesses. Then followed counter evidence in rebuttal, impeaching the credibility and character of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, and thereafter, according to the bill of exceptions, the following proceedings were had:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b856-6\">\u201cWhereupon, both the defendant and the plaintiff having rested, the court charged the jury in substance that if they believed the testimony of the plaintiff, and believed that the plaintiff had made out his case by the preponderance of the evidence, and that the plaintiff had been thrown from the train, then the jury would find a verdict for the plaintiff in such a sum as would compensate him, etc.; but, on the other hand, if was the duty of the plaintiff to satisfy the minds of the jury by a preponderance of the evidence that his theory of the case was true, and that .if he had failed to meet this burden, it was the duty- of the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b856-7\">\u201cThereupon, at about 4 p. m., the jury retired to consider of their verdict, and the attorneys both for the plaintiff and the defendant, after having waited in the courtroom for fully an hour in anticipation of the verdict, agreed that the verdict of the jury might be received by the clerk in the absence both of themselves and the court. Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys then left for Gulfport. Afterwards, about 7 p. m., the jury notified the clerk that they were unable to agree upon a verdict, and the clerk notified the court of this fact. Whereupon the court came to the courtroom, ordered the jury into their box, ascertained that they were unable to agree upon a verdict, reviewed the facts of the case to them, and then ascertained that they were still unable to agree upon a verdict. Thereupon the court peremptorily instructed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. All of which proceedings were had and done in the absence and without the knowledge or consent both of the plaintiff and his attorneys, and none of which became known to the plaintiff or his attorneys until the convening of court upon the following morning, when plaintiff was notified what proceedings had taken place, and that the following order had been entered on the minutes, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b856-8\">\u201c \u2018Aaron Grace v.

The United States District Court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant. At the conclusion of this trial hy the court and jury, the court Instructed the jury both pro and con as set out in the bill of exceptions, and thereupon, about 4 o\u2019clock p. m., the jury retired to consider of their verdict, and the attorneys both for the plaintiff and the defendant, after having waited in the courtroom for an hour in anticipation of the verdict, agreed that the verdict of the jury might be received by the clerk in the absence both of themselves and the court. Plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s attorneys then left for Gulfport. Afterwards, about 7 o\u2019clock p. m., the jury notified the clerk that they wore unable to agree upon a verdict and the clerk notified the court of this fact. Whereupon the court came to the courtroom, ordered the jury into their box, ascertained that they were unable to agree upon a verdict, reviewed the facts of the case to them, and then ascertained that they were still unable to agree upon a verdict. Thereupon the court peremptorily instructed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. All of which was done in the absence, and without the knowledge or consent, either of the plaintiff or <em>Ills attorneys, and none </em>of which became known to the plaintiff or his attorneys until the convening of court upon the following morning, when plaintiff was notified what proceedings had taken place, and that the following order had been entered on the minutes, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b857-5\">\u201c \u2018Aaron Grace v.

It is further ordered that the plaintiff have sixty days within which to present a bill of exceptions.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b857-7\">\u201cThe District Court erred in not discharging the jury and entering an order of mistrial. The jury had been out of their box with the case under advisement for several hours, and announced that they wore still unable to agree upon a verdict. Thereupon the court promptly instructed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, instead of discharging the jury and entering an order of mistrial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b857-8\">\u201cIV. The United States District Court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant when the testimony was directly in conflict, and when the testimony for the plaintiff, if believed by the jury, made out a perfect case for the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified that ho was riding upon the defendant\u2019s freight train by consent and with permission of the head brakeinan; that while he was so riding he was mercilessly ejected from the train while it was running at a rapid rate of speed, contrary to all the laws of decency and <em>humanity. </em>Certain features of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony were supported by several other witnesses. This testimony was denied hy, and was directly in conflict with the testimony of, the witnesses for the defendant. Instead of leaving the decision of this conflict in the facts to the jury, the court resolved the conflict in favor of the defendant, and instructed the jury to And for the defendant, thereby usurping the province of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b857-9\">\u201cThe United States District Court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant, where there was a material conflict in the testimony as above stated, and violated the right of the plaintiff under the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b857-10\">\u201cV. The United States District Court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant in the absence both of plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. This deprived plaintiff of his right to take a nonsuit. If plaintiff had been present when the court indicated its purpose to direct a verdict for the defendant, ir would have been open to the plaintiff to take a voluntary nonsuit, which would have enabled him to make fuller and better presentation of his ease, if the facts permitted, at another trial in another suit. But plaintiff and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>attorneys being absent, they were wholly deprived, of their right to adopt this course.\u201d (</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b858-4\">George S.
