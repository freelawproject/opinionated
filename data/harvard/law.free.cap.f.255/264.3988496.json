No person shall coat, powder or color with annatto, or any coloring matter whatever, any substance designed as a substitute for butter, whereby such substitute or product so colored or compounded shall be made to resemble butter, the product of the dairy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">The John F. Jelke Company was organized as an Illinois corporation m 1889, the stockholders being George P. Braun, John F. Jelke,'and L. V. Fitts; they were also directors and officers. The corporate name of the company at this time was Braun &amp; Fitts Company, and it succeeded to the business and purchased the assets of Braun &amp; Fitts, a partnership. John F. Jelke increased his holdings in the company, and plaintiff in error F. M. Lowry became its secretary in 1902, and continued in that position thereafter, and was so acting at the time of the trial. The change in name of the corporation occurred in 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">The George P. Braun Company is an Illinois corporation, and was organized December 5, 1904. In 1908 John F. Jelke became the owner of a large share of stock of this corporation, and shortly thereafter the directors were Ferdinand F. Jelke, F. M. Lowry, John F. Jelke, Jr., William M. Steele, and John F. Jelke. The record shows that both of these companies transacted a very large business, and that their principal place of business was at Chicago, 111.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-10\">Plaintiffs in error were all connected in some way with one of these two companies. John F. Jelke was secretary-treasurer and director of the Braun &amp; Fitts Company, later general manager, and still later president and practically the sole owner of the stock. His relations to the company were the same after it changed its name to the John F. Jelke Company. He also was the owner of over 80 per cent, of the stock of George P. Braun Company and was director thereof; his son being president. Francis M. Lowry was secretary of the Braun &amp; Fitts Company, later known as the John F. Jelke Company, and was secretary and director and stockholder of George P. Braun Company. Prior to his official connection with the Braun &amp; Fitts Company, he was credit man and assistant manager of the company. Plaintiff in error William M. Steele was office and sales manager of John F. Jelke Company from 1908 to the time of the indictment, and was director and stockholder in George P. Braun Company. Wiilliam P. Jackson, was manager of George P. Braun Company from May 11, 1898, to June 30, 1911. Harry E. Hitchins was salesman for Braun <em>&amp; </em>Fitts Company, later known as the John F. Jelke Company, from; May, 1902, to 1910. Hugh D. Cameron, was a former internal revenue officer, and then became salesman for Braun &amp; Fitts Company, and remained in that capacity from 1905 to 1910. William L. Lillard was salesman for the John F. Jelke Company from 1907 to 1909. L. B. Tull\u00eds was salesman for Braun <em>&amp; </em>Fitts Company for about nine years. Fred Rapp was salesman for George P. Braun Company from 1907 to 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">Abner D. Mize became a salesman for Braun &amp; Fitts in 1900, and left that employment in 1906. O. S. Martin, a former internal revenue agent, became a salesman for the Braun <em>&amp; </em>Fitts Company in 1901, later taking charge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>New ,York branch o\u00ed that company. Both Martin and Mize were discharged by ihe court on the ground that the statute of limitations had run against the offense so far as they were concerned. Philemon Berry, a former internal revenue collector, was for several years a salesman for the John F. Jelke Company, but he was never apprehended. Harvey P. McFarland was assistant and later chief shipping clerk for Braun &amp; Fitts Company, serving in that capacity from 1900 to the date of the indictment. He was found not guilty by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">To establish its charge of conspiracy, the government attempted to show, and claims the evidence clearly established, a motive on the part of the plaintiffs in error to commit the crime set forth in the indictment. It is claimed that this motive was established by showing: (a) That all of the plaintiffs in error were interested in increasing the sales of oleomargarine produced by the factories of the Jelke companies. All of the plaintiffs in error were either interested as stockholders or were salesmen who received commissions on sales made, (b) The testimony shows that in 1902, when the amended Oleomargarine Act went into force, there was no developed business in uncolored oleomargarine ; that the factories engaged in manufacturing this product had previously turned out colored oleomargarine; that the consuming public was not at this time disposed to purchase the uncolored product, (c) That at certain seasons of the year, when the price of butter was at its lowest, it was impossible to manufacture oleomargarine and sell it in competition with butter and at the same time pay a ten cents per pound tax. In other words, colored oleomargarine could not compete in the market with butter in the summer time and pay a ten cent per pound tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">Having established the motive, the government produced evidence tending to show a systematic and purposeful co-operation among the plaintiffs in error, as well as a common plan and very similar means, to get the colored oleomargarine produced by the Jelke factories upon the market without the payment of the tax of ten cents per pound thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">This proof came from the lips of many witnesses, the majority of whom were at one lime or another engaged in selling colored oleomargarine to consumers* in violation of the law. It is claimed that the evidence establishes a well-defined plan on the part of the plaintiffs in error to develop the business which was so uniformly followed as to indicate it was preconcerted, and consisted of salesmen of the Jelke Company (one or more of the plaintiffs in error) approaching a retail merchant engaged in handling butter and similar products and proposing, to him that he buy uncolored oleomargarine from the factory and engage in what was generally known, and throughout the testimony was described, as \u201cmoonshining\u201d \u2014 that is, coloring oleomargarine without paying the ten cents per pound tax thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">The government further claims that the testimony showed the plaintiffs in error,' as well as the John F. Jelke Company and George P. Braun Company, participated actively in carrying out the conspiracy and provided the means by which the object of such conspiracy might be attained. These means, among others, were; (1) The free distribution of coloring matter in bottles and cans to all purchasers of white oleomargarine. (2) The free dislribution of tub liner-s and top and bottom circles with the sale of white oleomargarine. (3) The delivery of white oleomargarine in soft and pliable condition, making it possible for the \u201cmoonshiner\u201d to more readily color his purchase. At the same time the colored oleomargarine was delivered in a hard state. (4) The delivery of white oleomargarine in tubs containing two pounds less than the tubs ordinarily carried. This permitted coloring matter to be <em>mixed </em>with the white oleomargarine and the weight would then correspond to the usual weight, thereby more effectually preventing detection. (5) The uncanceled stamps on tubs containing colored oleomargarine were so protected as to permit the \u201cmoonshiner\u201d to fill and refill the same tub and prevent detection in case a government inspector appeared. (6) The Jelke companies made false reports to the government as to tile names of the actual purchasers of white oleomargarine and the amounts thus purchased. The names of bakeries, not requiring a government license, were given as large purchasers, when in fact no purchases by such bakeries were made. This, it is claimed, was to prevent the government from tracing the output or successfully prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cuting the \u201cmoonshiner.\u201d (7) \u201cMoonshiners,\u201d arrested for violation of the law, were provided with bondsmen, legal counsel, and were assisted in other ways. (8) Delivery of oleomargarine in cheese boxes in place of oleomargarine tubs; the delivery of goods in. wagons bearing no name; the transfer of goods en route from factory wagons to other wagons; warning sent the \u201cmoonshiner\u201d of prospective visits from revenue agents; detailed instructions and advice to men known to be engaged in the \u201cmoonshining\u201d business as to the best methods and means of coloring white oleomargarine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">The government contends that these Various means were adopted by the plaintiffs in error, and were used by them singly and sometimes jointly, very generally for several years. It is claimed that each and every one of the plaintiffs in error participated, not once, but; many times, in accomplishing the end of the alleged conspiracy by the means indicated, and the statements made by the various co-conspirators to the \u201cmoonshiners\u201d who testified in the case established the preconcerted common plan, means and purpose as related above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The government further contends that the evidence showed that the officers of the Jelke companies called the salesmen together regularly (it is claimed on Saturday afternoons) where the plan of extending the business was discussed; that such plan called for a constantly increasing number of customers through the means heretofore set forth, and the salesmen were instructed to advance, if necessary, the difference between the retailer\u2019s license fee for selling colored oleomargarine over the license fee charged for selling uncolored oleomargarine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">None of the plaintiffs in error testified upon the trial in their own behalf either to dispute the statements made or to explain those susceptible of two inferences. On behalf of the plaintiffs in error, however, it is contended that each and every one of the so-called means or acts involving one or more of such plaintiffs in error, is explainable on the theory of the innocence of the plaintiffs in error of the crime charged. The government conceded that Braun &amp; Fitts, the John F. Jelke Company, and the George P. Braun Company had at all times paid license fees as manufacturers and the ten cent and one-quarter cent per pound on all oleomargarine manufactured and sold by them, and that all the goods purchased by the \u201cmoonshiners\u201d from such companies were tax paid according to law, and had been purchased and paid for at the time the \u201cmoonshiners\u201d colored the oleomargarine. Plaintiffs in error showed that the furnishing of free coloring fluid to retailers was not illegal, but was in fact sanctioned by the rulings of the Commissioner of Internal Kevenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">The plaintiffs in error assailed the credibility of the government witnesses and showed that many of them had been retail dealers who had colored oleomargarine and sold it in violation of the law. It appeared from the testimony that many of the government witnesses had been granted immunity, others had pleaded guilty and were awaiting sentence, while still others were serving their time in the penitentiary. Such further statement of the facts as may be pertinent to the questions considered will appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-8\">John Barton Payne and William S.

Is the indictment sufficient?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Plaintiffs in error appropriately and timely raised this question, and now claim that the \u201callegations set forth in the indictment do not constitute- a conspiracy to defraud the United States.\u201d The indictment is assailed:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(A) Because of the defects in the allegations wherein it is sought to describe the conspiracy, and</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">(B) Because of the defects in the allegations wherein it is sought to describe acts which are therein alleged to have been done to effect the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Contending that the specific allegations following the general charge of conspiracy in paragraph 5 of the indictment, limit and control the general allegations therein found, it is claimed the indictment is insufficient in so far as it attempts to charge the conspiracy for the following reasons: (a) Because not one of the defendants is alleged to be a manufacturer of oleomargarine as defined by section 3 of the act. (b) Because not one of the individuals named or unnamed therein was capable of defrauding or had the power to defraud the United States out of the tax of ten cents per pound, (c) Because the indictment lacks an allegation showing that the tax mentioned in section 19 of the indictment was the tax to become due upon the oleomargarine thus artificially colored, or, if this be not accepted, it does not appear but what the divers persons and individuals referred to in section 17 did not intend to pay the tax. (d) Because the series of these successive acts do not show the defendants agreed among themselves to cause the individuals to do the things named in the indictment at a certain place or certain places within the territory of tbo United States, (e) Because the indictment does not allege the period of time through which or the times which the- said oleomargarine thus artificially colored was to be sold by the divers individuals, (f) Because of the uncertainty as to the meaning of the verb \u201cto cause,\u201d it having been used with different meanings in the same indictment; likewise because of the uncertainty of the verb \u201cto furnish,\u201d and because of the uncertainty as to whether the profit accruing from the sale of artificially colored oleomargarine was to be for the profit of the defendants or of the divers individuals, and because of the uncertainty arising out of the omission of the words \u201cthe defendants\u201d or the words \u201csaid individuals\u201d in section 18 of the indictment, and because from all of the averments it is uncertain what is described in section 5 of the indictment as \u201ccertain oleomargarine artificially colored to look like butter of the shade of yellow,\u201d or what was referred to in section 17 of the indictment as \u201csaid oleomargarine thus artificially colored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">(B) The sufficiency of the indictment is also attacked because: (a) No act therein alleged to be \u201can act done to effect the object of the conspiracy\u201d is shown to be such an act within the rule laid down in Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 32 Sup. Ct. 793, 56 L. Ed. 1114, Ann, Cas. 1914A, 614. (k) Because it does not appear that any one of such overt acts was done after the conspiracy was formed, (c) Because the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of such conspiracy were not sufficiently described or particularized, in that they failed to identify the particular places or buildings in or at which the white oleomargarine and the coloring matter were delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The foregoing statement follows the order and analysis of the learned counsel for plaintiffs in error. In support of these criticisms of the indictment under consideration, we have been favored with a lengthy and elaborate brief, evidencing much learning and great industry, and containing a most complete collection of decisions bearing on the imperfections of indictments and the construction and definition of words and phrases, which in turn has invited a discussion by the court, which, if accepted, would result in an opinion unjustifiable in length and involve the discussion of legal questions that are no longer moot. While perhaps instructive, we are convinced that many of the criticisms made are hypercritical and evidence scholastic ingenuity, but if adopted in this case, or applied to the average indictment,' \u201cwould rightly bring odium upon the administration of justice in the minds of all sensible people, whether learned in the law or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACR\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Decisions that reject technical objections to criminal indictments are not now the exception, and an overwhelming array of authorities may be found that call for liberal construction of criminal pleadings.

A. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The rule by which the sufficiency of this indictment must be measured is well set forth in Harper v. United States, 170 Fed. 385, 392, 95 C. C. A. 555, 562:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">\u201cThe rules governing criminal pleadings have become less technical and more practical, but no less protective to the accused, since the Supreme Court in a series of cases beginning in the year 1893, notably Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539 [14 Sup. Ct. 680, 38 L. Ed. 545]; Evans v. United States, 153 U. S. 584 [14 Sup. Ct. 934, 38 L. Ed. 830]; Dunbar v. United States, 156 U. S. 185 [15 Sup. Ct. 325, 39 L. Ed. 390]; Cochran &amp; Sayre v. United Stats, 157 U. S. 286 [15 Sup. Ct. 628, 39 L. Ed. 704]; and Rosen v. United States, 161 U. S. 29 [16 Sup. Ct. 434, 480, 40 <em>L. </em>Ed. 606] \u2014 has under various circumstances declared that allegations in an indictment are sufficient if their meaning is \u2018clear to the common understanding\u2019; that, \u2018no impracticable standards of particularity should be set up\u2019; that \u2018few indictments under the national banking law are so skillfully drawn as to be beyond the hypercriticism of astute counsel\u2019; and that \u2018the entire indictment is to be considered in determining whether the offense is fairly stated.\u2019 The liberal tendency of the doctrine so announced has been followed by this court in Clement v. United States, 149 Fed. 305 [79 C. C. A. 243], Rinker v. United States, 151 Fed. 755 [81 C. C. A. 379], Stearns v. United States, 152 Fed. 900 [82 C. C. A. 48], and Morris v.

St. 1916, reads as follows':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">\u201cIf two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States in any manner or for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>purpose, and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be fined not more than ten thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The sufficiency of the allegations appearing in indictments attempting to charge a violation of this section has been challenged in the federal courts in so many cases that it is unnecessary to search elsewhere for precedents. The following leading cases throw much light upon the questions here under consideration, and an examination of them leads to the deduction of several general rules that go far toward solving the objections made by the plaintiffs in error: See United States v. Moore (C. C.) 173 Fed. 122; Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425, 28 Sup. Ct. 163, 52 L. Ed. 278; Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539, 14 Sup. Ct. 680, 38 L. Ed. 545; United States v.

Ed. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The general conclusions deducibffi from these cases are: (a) The conspiracy statute creates and defines an independent crime, and an offense against the statute is committed when \u201ctwo or more persons conspiro\u201d either (a) \u201cto commit any offense against the United States,\u201d or (b) \u201cto defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose\u201d etc., and (c) an overt act by one of the conspirators follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> (bi) An indictment is generally sufficient which charges a statutory crime substantially in the words of the statute, except in such cases where other precedents have been firmly established in analogous offenses at common law, or where such a charge would not fairly inform the accused of the nature of the charge preferred against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> (c) An indictment attempting to charge conspiracy is sufficient if it follows the language of the statute and contains a sufficient statement of an overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy, excepting where the object of the conspiracy is in itself lawful, and in such case the means must he set forth with such particularity as to disclose their illegality and the intended criminal intent, and except also those cases where the conspiracy is to defraud the government in a manner that would not permit of the defendants being fairly and reasonably informed of the character of the offense without such detailed statement of the means and the time and place being set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> (d) The antecedent crime, if any, which is the end and object of the conspiracy, need not be described with the same particularity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the conspiracy charge as in an indictment where the crime itself and not the conspiracy to commit it is the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">A wide difference between opposing counsel over two propositions explains much of the variance in their contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(a) The government contends that paragraphs 6-20 of the indictment set forth the means by which the conspiracy described in paragraph 5 was to be effected, while plaintiffs in error contend these sections contain a more specific and detailed statement of the conspiracy, and therefore control and limit the general charge of conspiracy found in section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(b) Plaintiffs in error attack the sufficiency of the allegations in paragraphs 6-20, even if the court should conclude that they are but a statement of the means which the plaintiffs in error adopted to carry their conspiracy into effect, and base their attack upon the omissions heretofore pointed out. The government, on the other hand, contends that these \u201cmeans\u201d (paragraphs 6-20), were not necessary allegations, but were inserted to more fully apprise the plaintiffs in error of the character of the charge preferred against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Construing the whole indictment, we are of the opinion that such' allegations as appear in paragraphs 6-20 set forth the means by which the general conspiracy was to be effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We cannot escape the conclusion that the fair intendment of the pleading was to set forth the conspiracy in paragraph 5, the means by which it was to be carried out appearing in paragraphs 6-20. The overt acts in furtherance thereof (21 in number) appear in paragraphs 21-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The second question is determined by conclusion (c) heretofore set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">While counsel for plaintiffs in error strenuously contend that this rule no longer prevails in the federal courts, we are convinced that the great weight of authority supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">In United States v. Dennee, Fed. Cas. No. 14,948, Judge Woods, in overruling an indictment, used this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">\u201cA somewhat careful consideration of tlie authorities convinces me that the better reason is with those who deny the necessity of setting out the means by which the conspiracy was to be carried into effect. But it seems clear that the statute upon which this indictment is based was intended to relieve the pleader from any supposed necessity of setting out the means agreed upon to carry out the conspiracy, by requiring him to aver some act done in furtherance of the conspiracy, and making. such act a necessary ingredient of the offense. In the case of Com. v. Shedd, 7 Cush. [Mass.] 514, the court said, that \u2018the great difficulty in giving effect to the allegation of overt acts in an indictment for conspiracy on a motion in arrest of judgment for insufficiency of the indictment, is this, that overt acts are merely alleged by way of aggravation of the offense, and though alleged, they need not be proved, and the alleged conspiracy might be found by the jury without proof of the precise overt acts charged to have been done in pursuance of the conspiracy.\u2019 That difficulty does not exist here, for the overt act is a part of the offense, and must be proved, as laid in the indictment. The reason given in the case just quoted from, why the averment of overt acts cannot have effect in the indictment for conspiracy, does not apply. In my opinion, therefore, this indictment which avers the conspiracy, and tiren sets out the overt act done to carry it into effect, is sufficient, and it is not necessary to aver the means agreed on to effect the conspiracy. The averment of acts done to effect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>-object of tho conspiracy, and which must be proven to sustain the indictment, is more than the -equivalent of an averment of means agreed on to carry it into effect. This objection to the indictment is not well taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In United States v. Goldman, Fed. Cas.

Arnold, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">We have not overlooked the contention of counsel for plaintiffs in error that this rule is contrary to the holding of the Supreme Court, as announced in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 557-559, 23 L. Ed. 588, and Evans v. United States, 153 U. S. 584, 14 Sup. Ct. 934, 38 L.

The indictment failed to assert any specific right which it was claimed th\u00e9 defendants had invaded, and the court held it bad, because unable to say that a crime.in fact had been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The case of Evans v. United States, supra, is not out of harmony with the conclusion here reached. Quoting from Wharton\u2019s Criminal Eaw, the court there says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201c \u2018Tiie means of effecting the criminal intent,\u2019 says Mr. Wharton, \u2018or the circumstances evincive of the design with which the act was done, are considered to be matters of evidence to go to the jury to demonstrate the intent, and not necessary to be incorporated in an indictment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Having disposed of the general objections that underlie the specific criticisms heretofore set forth, we deem it unnecessary to discuss all of the various questions raised at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">(A, a) It was not necessary to charge in the indictment that the defendants were manufacturers of oleomargarine. Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425, 28 Sup. Ct. 163, 52 L. Ed. 278; United States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370, 29 Sup. Ct. 123, 53 L. Ed. 230. Moreover the fair and legitimate inference from the entire indictment is that the plaintiffs in error were manufacturers of oleomargarine within the definition of the Act. See sections 7, 13, 15, 17, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">(A, b) The criticism that the indictment was insufficient because the individuals named or unnamed were not capable of defrauding the United States out of the tax, must likewise be rejected. The crime of conspiracy may be fully committed without the name of a single person who was to color the oleomargarine without paying a tax thereon, being agreed upon. United States v. Holte, 236 U. S. 140, 144, 35 Sup. Ct. 271, 59 L. Ed. 504, L. R. A. 1915D, 281; United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78, 35 Sup. Ct. 682, 59 L. Ed. 1211; Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425, 28 Sup.

United States, 152 U. S. 539, 14 Sup. Ct. 680, 38 L. Ed. 545, where the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">\u201cIn other words, if certain facts make out the crime, it is sufficient to charge those facts, and it is obviously unnecessary to state that which is not essential. Can it be doubted that if these defendants entered into a conspiracy to defraud the United States of public lands, subject to homestead entry, at the given office in the named county, the crime of conspiracy was complete even if no particular tract or tracts were selected by the conspirators? It is enough that their purpose and their conspiracy had in view the acquiring of some of those lands, and it is not essential to the crime that in the minds of the'conspirators the precise lands had already been identified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>See, also, Hyde v.

St. \u00a7 9079).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We are convinced that the indictment, giving to all of the words their fair meaning in view of the entire context, thoroughly and with reasonable definiteness apprised the plaintiffs in error of the offense with which they were charged, as well as the means by which, and the places and the time where, the object of the conspiracy was to be consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The failure of the indictment to negative the exception found in section 16 of the Oleomargarine Act, does not subject the indictment to demurrer. The correct rule is laid down in United States v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. Co., 163 Fed. 519, 520, 90 C. C. A. 329, 330, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cThe first of these [objections] is that the plaintiff does not, negative the matter of the exception created by the proviso to section 6 of the Act of March 2, 1893, as amended by the Act of April 1, 1898, which gives the right of action for the penalty. This objection must fail, because it is opposed to the settled rule that an exception created by a proviso or other distinct or substantive clause, whether in the same section or elsewhere, is defensive, and need not ho negatived by one suing under the general clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">See, also, Ledbetter v. United States, 170 U. S. 606, 18 Sup. Ct. 774, 42 L. Ed. 1162; Schlemmer v. Buffalo, etc., Co., 205 U. S. 1, 27 Sup. Ct. 407, 51 L. Ed. 681; Smith v. United States, 157 Fed. 721, 85 C. C.

Ed. 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Indictments charging violation of the Oleomargarine Act but which did not negative any of the exceptions found in the act have been sustained. Enders v. United States, 187 Fed. 754, 109 C. C. A. 502; Hardesty v. United States, 168 Fed. 25, 93 C. C. A. 417; May v. United States, 199 Fed. 42, 117 C. C. A. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">B. The various criticisms of the indictment appearing under this head will be considered together. Much of the argument in support of these objections is based upon the erroneous contention that paragraphs 6-20 set forth the conspiracy, and not the means by which the conspiracy was to be accomplished. We have been unable to accept the contention of the plaintiffs in error in this respect, and likewise reject the objections now made pertaining to the overt act. In United States v. Rabinowich, supra, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">\u201cThere must he an overt act; but this need not be of itself a criminal act; still less need it constitute the very crime that is the object of the conspiracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Paragraph 21, the material portion of which is repeated in each of the 21 overt acts, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201cThat in pursuance of the said conspiracy and in order to effect the object of the same, the said defendants,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This language answers the contention that the indictment is bad because it does not appear that the overt acts followed the forming of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We conclude that the indictment describes acts by one or more of the parties to tire conspiracy to effect the object of the cofispiracy within the definition of the Conspiracy Act. See Houston v. United States, 217 Fed. 854, 133 C. C. A. 562; Witte v. Shelton, 240 Fed. 265, 273, 153 C. C. A. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> Does the evidence support the verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Plaintiffs in error, and each of them, strenuously insist that the court erred in refusing to take the case from the jury: (1) Because the evidence failed to establish the alleged conspiracy. (2) Because there was no proof that any of the plaintiffs in error committed any one of the overt acts charged in paragraphs 21 \u2014 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">In conspiracy cases, the proof must, from the very nature of the charge, consist largely of circumstantial evidence. Rarely can the government find documentary proof of any unlawful combination to defraud it or to violate its laws. The test of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction under this section has not infrequently been set forth. See Marrash v. United States, 168 Fed. 226, 229, 93 C. C. A. 511; Alkon v. United States, 163 Fed. 811, 812, 90 C. C. A. 116; Wharton\u2019s Criminal Daw (10th Ed.) \u00a7 1401; 2 Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law, \u00a7 227; United States v. Hamilton, Fed. Cas. No. 15,-288; United States v. Lancaster (C. C.) 44 Fed. 896, 10 L. R. A. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">In the present case the question whether the proof is sufficient to sustain a conviction is one that has required careful study. Many violations of the oleomargarine law are clearly shown. Participation in these violations by salesmen of the Jelke Company, including the plaintiffs in error, is likewise clearly established, but the proof of the unlawful combination \u2014 the conspiracy charged \u2014 rests solely upon the deduction and inferences from facts established on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">After examining all of the testimony carefully from the standpoint of each of the plaintiffs in error, we are convinced that there was evidence sufficient to support the conviction. The claims of the government, set forth in the statement of facts, find support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Single isolated instances tending to establish the conspiracy charged are explainable upon the theory of each of the plaintiff\u2019s innocence, but all of the evidence leads the mind logically to the conclusion that the plaintiffs in error, prompted by a desire to profit through increased sales of oleomargarine, conspired to accomplish their purpose by a violation of the Oleomargarine Act. The extent of the operations, and the similarity with which the illegal practices were conducted, invites the belief and justifies the conclusion that it was the result of a premeditated plan. Because of the common interest and continued participation in various illegal acts by the same parties, the plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>error, the jury was justified in finding there was a premeditated plan, a conspiracy to which all the plaintiffs in error were parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Nor should it be conceded that all of the individual acts standing alone were perfectly consistent with the innocence of the plaintiffs in error. Some of these isolated facts are so suggestive of criminality and consistent with the charge of the indictment as to shake, if not to entirely remove, the presumption of innocence upon which the plaintiffs in error throughout the trial so persistently rested. To' illustrate : It appears that one of the plaintiffs in error sought out a butler and egg retailer and gave him the name of a baker, that he might use and advised him to purchase white oleomargarine in this baker\u2019s name from the John F. Jelke Company. In a single year the Jelke Company sold this \u201cmoonshiner\u201d under a fictitious baker\u2019s name 183,576 pounds of white oleomargarine.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Bakers were excepted from certain provisions of the law (see section 16), and in order to get the advantage of these exceptions and to prevent the government from detecting the \u201cmoonshiner\u2019s\u201d business, the various plaintiffs in error advised retailers to make cash purchases of white oleomargarine from the Jelke factory in the name o\u00ed a nearby baker. In six months the names of 12 bakers appeared on the books of the company as having purchased 34,034 pounds of white oleomargarine. Upon the trial it was proven that 11 of these bakers had not purchased a pound of white oleomargarine during that period, while one had purchased 72 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Another \u201cmoonshiner\u201d was advised to purchase in the name of Heins and to give his street number as 5102 Elizabeth street. The Jelke Company books showed that Mr. Heins purchased on January 7, 1908, 7,500 pounds of white oleomargarine, the street number being 5102 Elizabeth street. Upon the trial it appeared that Heins was a fictitious person and that at 5102 Elizabeth street there was a little cottage occupied by a widow, Mrs. Schmidt.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">These were but a few of the many instances of fraud that were practiced upon the government. Nor does the record fail to connect the plaintiffs in error with these transactions. Frequently not one, but two or three of them, on various occasions, participated in the \u201cmoon-shining\u201d business, and invariably, according to the testimony, the \u201cmoonshiner\u2019s\u201d entry into the illegal business was brought about through persuasion by one or more of the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">This is not a case where an uncorroborated statement of an accomplice stands contradicted by the sworn testimony of the defendant. It is a case where the testimony of many alleged accomplices, corroborated by other evidence, stands undisputed by the statement of any one of the plaintiffs in error. Notwithstanding the jury was required to find the conspiracy from deductions and inferences drawn from undisputed facts, we are convinced that the record justifies the ruling of the co\u00fart in denying the motion of the plaintiffs in error to direct a verdict in their favor, based on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Plaintiffs in error further contend that the proof fails to connect auv one of them with the overt acts charged in the indictment. It is claimed that the deliveries of white oleomargarine specified in the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>dictment were made by the John P. Jelke Company, and not by any of the plaintiffs in error. It appears that some of the plaintiffs in error were officers, directors, and stockholders of the John P. Jelke Company, An examination of the indictment (paragraphs 21-22) shows that the pleader did not restrict the government to proof of actual delivery of white oleomargarine by one of the co-conspirators but included in all the overt acts the statement that one of the co-conspirators <em>\u201ccaused to be delivered </em>* * * a la,rge quantity * * * of white oleomargarine,\u201d etc. We conclude that the evidence is in strict accord with the allegations of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><em>Motion to Elect. </em>\u2014 At the close of the trial each of the defendants moved the court to compel the government to elect \u201cto proceed to the jury on only one of the several conspiracies joined in the indictment.\u201d The court\u2019s refusal to grant the motion is assigned as error. This motion i's based upon the position of the plaintiffs in error, heretofore considered, that the indictment charged a conspiracy to conspire followed by numerous charges of conspiracy entered into between the plaintiffs in error and each of the \u201cdivers individuals\u201d named and unnamed and therein referred to. We are unable to accept this contention. The indictment charged but one conspiracy, and that appeared in paragraph 5. There being but one charge of conspiracy, the court properly denied the motion of plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> <em>Instructions. </em>\u2014 An examination of the record in this case well illustrates the impracticability, if not the impossibility, of the trial judge giving each requested instruction correctly stated. The requested instructions in this case wer\u00e9 innumerable. If printed in the ordinary brief, they would cover 100 pages. The proposed instructions that were refused, and to which exceptions were taken, and which constituted a very small part of the requested instructions, cover 23 pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The trial judge covered the substance of much of these requested instructions, and clearly and succinctly and with reasonable elaboration presented the issues which were involved in this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Only a few of the criticisms will be separately considered, although we have endeavored, in view of the importance of this case, to carefully consider each and every assignment of error and all the contentions in respect thereto. We are not justified in setting forth the entire pharge of the court to the jury, because of its length, although it would be but fair to the learned trial judge that this be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> The most serious criticism presented by plaintiffs in error arose out of the court\u2019s use of the' following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201cii <em>is the position of the defendants that many of these witnesses were fellow wrongdoers with the defendants; </em>that they helped to commit a crime and that, therefore, their testimony should be rejected in this ease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 particular attack is directed to the words printed in italics. We agree with counsel for plaintiffs in error that this language was unfortunate, and, standing alone, misstated the defendants\u2019 position. It was not the defendants\u2019 position that they were wrongdoers, noi did they admit that they were <em>fellow </em>wrongdoers with any of the government witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>But this criticism, like many others, must be viewed in the light of the entire charge. The sentence complained of was given when the court was obviously speaking of the testimony of accomplices, and when he was pointing out the dangers of predic\u00e1ting a conviction upon the testimony of men who were themselves wrongdoers. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">\u201cI shall also at tills time refer to the situation of many of the witnesses. They have been referred to by counsel in arguments both to the court and to you as \u2018accomplices.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cIt is the position of the defendants that many of these witnesses were fellow wrongdoers with the defendants, that they helped to commit a crime, and that, therefore, their testimony should be rejected in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cIt is the law that the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is subject to rejection, and when, therefore, in a case it appears to you that the witness in testifying discloses the fact he is an accomplice, you are not at liberty at the outset to reject his testimony, but it simply advances to you to inquire respecting the question of whether his testimony stands alone, whether Hiere is proof in the case which corroborates him in respect to what he testifies to; and if you find there is proof acceptable to you, which is corroborated, then you are not at liberty to reject his testimony solely because he was an accomplice, but you are required then to proceed with an analysis of his testimony as you proceed with the analysis of the testimony of other witnesses respecting whom that infirmity does not exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The following further reference to the testimony of an accomplice was made by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cIf you find any witness has deliberately sworn falsely as to any material matter in the case, you are at liberty to reject the whole of his testimony, unless you find it is corroborated by other credible evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">We cannot believe that any of the defendants were prejudiced by the criticized portions of the charge when read in the light of all tho instructions quoted. The impression which the court conveyed to the jury by this language was unfavorable to those witnesses who testified for the government, and who were referred to as \u201caccomplices.\u201d The court intended by this language to warn the jury against conviction upon the testimony of accomplices. It was a further elaboration of his charge previously made bearing upon the weakness of testimony given by co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Plaintiffs in error complain because of the court\u2019s definition of the words \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d and because of the language used by the court in reference to the burden of proof. They further complain because the court ignored the rule which makes the presumption of innocence, evidence upon which a reasonable doubt may be based. The first paragraph of the charge clearly made the presumption of innocence in favor of each one of the defendants a fact in evidence which the jury was required to consider and weigh on <em>each </em>and <em>every one </em>of the issues presented. The language used in defining reasonable doubt is supported by many authorities and is in harmony with the language usually used on similar occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The criticism directed to the court\u2019s definition of an overt act is answered by the case of Witte v. Shelton, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Criticism is made of the following language used by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cWhile the fact is for you to find, gentlemen, I express to you the opinion,, you need not accept it if you do not care to, and if your judgment leads you to the contrary you may reject it; but I express to you the opinion that, aside from the alleged disclosures made by these defendants, there is corroborative evidence in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">&gt; This was not error. Simmons v. United States, 142 U. S. 148, 155, 12 Sup. Ct. 171, 35 L. Ed. 968; Vicksburg &amp; Railroad Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S. 545, 7 Sup. Ct. 1, 30 L. Ed. 257; United States v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R., 123 U. S. 113, 8 Sup. Ct. 77, 31 L. Ed. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In fact, upon all of the evidence in this case it would not have been error for the court to charge the jury as a matter of law that there was corroborative evidence supporting the alleged declarations of the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The government contends that no proper exception was taken by plaintiffs in error to present the various questions raised by the court\u2019s-charge to the jury, or its failure to charge as requested, and reliance is pla'ced upon the case of Allis v. United States, 155 U. S. 117, 15 Sup. Ct. 36, 39 L. Ed. 91. We have chosen, however, to examine the charge fully, as well as the requested instructions, to determine whether the trial judge held the scales of justice in even balance, saying all that was necessary to guard the rights of the accused. We find no-reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> <em>Evidence. </em>\u2014 Error is assigned because the court admitted evidence of transactions occurring prior to July 1, 1902, when the Oleomargarine Act went into force.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In this respect the trial judge possessed much discretion as to the period of time during which he would allow the government to produce testimony showing, or tending to show, the motive for the conspiracy, as well as the intent with which the acts were committed. Heike v. United States, 227 U. S. 131, 33 Sup. Ct. 226, 57 L. Ed. 450, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">. The history of this industry, as well as the laws affecting it, were receivable in evidence, in order that the jury might better understand the claims of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">But it is contended that numerous specific acts of fraudulent transactions prior to July 1, 1902, were received in evidence for no other purpose than to prejudice the jury against the plaintiffs in error. If the purpose and the sole purport of this testimony was merely to show the defendants were willing to violate the laws of the land, it was, of course, erroneously admitted. On the other hand, this evidence was admissible if the acts described were closely connected with and involved in the object of the conspiracy, and were quite similar to the subsequent acts of the conspirators, of which the government complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Prior to July 1, 1902, there was an oleomargarine act in force. Although the tax on colored oleomargarine was increased under the latter act, and the incentive to violate the law through illegal marketing of their product was greater, it was nevertheless the same motive-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(differing only in degree) that actuated plaintiffs in error prior to 1902 as it was subsequent to 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The conspiracy was not established by any written documentary proof, but was deducible from the facts and circumstances heretofore related. Many of these acts of themselves were innocent and harmless. Whether these various acts tended to establish the unlawful conspiracy, or were mere innocent acts of the defendants, depended upon the intent and purpose with which they were committed. As throwing light upon this question of intent, the court rightly permitted the government a wide range. Whether innocently committed or performed with criminal intent to accomplish the ends of the conspiracy might well be established by proof of acts of a similar character practiced by the same parties even though they occurred prior to 1902. To illustrate: The government claims that prior to 1902 the defendants caused tubs to be made with an extra hoop, upon which revenue stamps were placed; that the retailer immediately removed the extra hoop without canceling the stamps; that such practice on the part of retailers was approved by, and in fact suggested by, defendants. It was in reference to this testimony, showing the use of this extra hoop prior to 1902, that most of the complaint of the plaintiffs in error under this heading is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Obviously, the use of a tub with three hoops is not of itself an act that would invite suspicion or point to guilt on the part of the defendants. But if it appeared that one of the hoops was an extra hoop, used for no other purpose than to carry the revenue stamps, and was in fact placed on the tub for the purpose of assisting the retailer in avoiding the revenue law, its presence was no longer consistent with the theory of innocence. After 1902, similar means (see subdivision 5 of statement of means in statement of facts) were adopted, which of themselves were perfectly innocent. The protection of revenue stamps upon the tubs containing colored oleomargarine may have been practiced with no criminal intent, but if they were placed there so as to permit the \u201cmoonshiners\u201d to fill and refill the same tubs, and to prevent detection in case a government inspector appeared, a different deduction followed. The practice of providing the extra removable hoop to carry the revenue stamp, that the retailer might avoid the provisions of the revenue act prior to 1902, is so similar in character to the practice of providing the revenue stamp with a protection that would permit the retailer to violate a similar law (followed after the act of 1902) as to justify the admission in evidence of the former practice in order to throw light upon the intention of the same parties under the later practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The rule applicable is well laid down in Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 358, 10 L. Ed. 987:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">\u201c * * \u00ab where the intent of the party is matter in issue, it has always been deemed allowable, as well in criminal as in civil cases, to introduce evidence of other acts and doings of the party, of a kindred character, in order to illustrate or establish his intent or motive in the particular act directly in judgment. Indeed, in no other way would it be practicable, in many cases, to establish such intent or motive, for the single act, taken by itself, may not be decisive either way; but when taken in connection with others of like eharac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>ter and nature, the Intent and motive may be demonstrated almost with a conclusive certainty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">See, also, Wharton on Criminal Evidence (10th Ed.) p. 145; Williamson v.

The government contends that its purpose in offering this statute was the same as it had when offering evidence of transactions prior to 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">It appeared that the amount of colored oleomargarine sold to the \u201cmoonshiners\u201d was inconsiderable as compared to the amount of uncolored oleomargarine thus sold. The profit upon a pound was the same to the Jelke companies, whether the oleomargarine was colored or uncolored. Plaintiffs in error asserted that under the federal law they were strictly within their rights in selling either colored or uncolored oleomargarine provided the government tax was paid on each sale. In other words, they claimed that this \u201cmeans\u201d was perfectly consistent with innocence on their part. The government, on the other hand, contended that the sale of colored oleomargarine under certain circumstances shown in the case, while of itself lawful under the federal law, was nevertheless not made by the plaintiffs in error innocently, but was merely one of the \u201cmeans\u201d used in connection with many others by' which plaintiffs in error assisted \u201cmoonshiners\u201d in avoiding prosecution. It was for the purpose of throwing light upon the intent of the plaintiffs in error in causing these sales of colored oleomargarine to be made, and for no other purpose, that the existence of the Illinois statute became relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">It is quite apparent that the manufacturers, without any greater profit accruing from the sale of colored oleomargarine than was obtainable from selling a like quantity of uncolored oleomargarine, would not have risked the possibility of arrest and conviction for violation of the state law, unless they hoped to increase their total sales by helping the \u201cmoonshiners\u201d develop the illegal business. It was by reason of the concurrence of several acts, heretofore termed \u201cmeans,\u201d that the intent of the plaintiffs in error in selling \u201cmoonshiners\u201d colored oleomargarine became important.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">This deduction is strengthened when the record is examined to ascertain the actual amount of colored oleomargarine' thus sold to the recognized or professional \u201cmoonshiners.\u201d The salps of colored product were so small (and the profits necessarily so limited) that one questions the sincerity of the assertion that plaintiffs in error were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>nocent of any intent to provide means by which the \u201cmoonshiners\" might evade the law. One can hardly escape the conclusion that the plaintiffs in error would never have taken the chance of prosecution by the state authorities in view of the small sales of colored oleomargarine to these recognized \u201cmoonshiners,\u201d if it were not for the fact that the sale of a single tub of colored oleomargarine made it possible for the plaintiffs in error to sell thousands of pounds of tmcolored oleomargarine to the same purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">We conclude that, under the circumstances disclosed in this case, the Illinois statute was relevant on the question of intent of the plaintiffs in error in selling colored oleomargarine to certain \u201cmoonshiners.\u201d See cases cited under last heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Nor can we agree with the statement of counsel for plaintiffs in error that the state law was in direct conflict with the federal law. The positions of the state and federal governments were somewhat analogous to the positions of the United States government and some states on the liquor traffic. The imposition of a federal tax upon retail liquor dealers is not inconsistent with the act of any state or community which prohibits the sale of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In the present case it appeared that the state of Illinois prohibited the manufacture and sale of colored oleomargarine, but did not prohibit the manufacture and sale of uncolored oleomargarine. The federal law imposed a tax (almost, but not quite, prohibitive) upon colored oleomargarine, while the tax upon uncolored oleomargarine was nominal. It is obvious that the two laws were not repugnant to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">That the position of the government was understood by the court and jury is shown by the following statement of the counsel for the government made on trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cIt is their [defendants\u2019] intention which is the subject ox examination, because your honor will charge the jury if all these things were done innocently \u2014 in the ordinary and usual course of business of these defendants, they cannot bring in a verdict of guilty. They can base and predicate a verdict of guilty only upon a finding that those various acts [means] were done with a criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Again, it is doubtful if the mere reception in evidence of the Illinois statute under any circumstances constituted reversible error. The trial occurred in Illinois. The court and jury were presumed to know the law, and were required to take judicial notice of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Nor does the record show that all of the Illinois statutes complained of were read to the jury by the government\u2019s attorney. At least a portion of the law, not hearing on any portion read by the government\u2019s attorney, was read to the jury by the defendant\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\"><bracketnum>[12]</bracketnum> <em>Cross-Examination. </em>\u2014 It is claimed the court unduly restricted counsel for plaintiffs in error in their cross-examination of government witnesses. In considering this assignment of error, we must bear in mind that there were many defendants, and many able attorneys representing them. The government witnesses were numerous, and a situation was disclosed by many of them that was not disputed. Their testimony given on direct examination, in some instances at least, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>not such as to call for long cross-examinations. Many of them \u00e1dmitted they had Been convicted of criminal offenses or were under indictment. Some admitted that immunity had been offered them. These discrediting facts being admitted, the ends of justice could hardly be furthered by humiliating these witnesses. There is certainly a limit to the extent that a witness may be cross-examined. Nor is it proper for an able counsel to convert a cross-examination into an argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The trial judge is in the best position to determine how far the cross-examination should proceed, and, when- convinced that the facts are all presented and fairly before the jury, the examination of a witness, either on direct or cross examination, should cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><bracketnum>[13]</bracketnum> Complaint is also made because it is claimed the court permitted the government to cross-examine its own witnesses. It appears from the record that the court upon its own motion, but not in the presence of the jury, directed the attorneys for the government to take certain witnesses into the adjoining room and read to them the testimony of such witnesses given before the grand jury, and then recall them and renew certain questions that had previously been answered evasively. The following appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201cThe Court: Now, these two witnesses Salvo and Paule \u2014 of course, I am not particularly interested in what testimony goes in, what its quality is; but if the government claims that these two witnesses have definitely committed themselves before the grand jury to conversations that they now happen not to recall, in my judgment their attention should be called definitely in some way to those conversations. <em>They appear to he rather conveniently forgetful.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">\u201cMr. Wilkerson: We ought to have a chance to straighten out their testimony, because we will have to deal with them on the theory that they testified falsely here, if they do not; that is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">\u201cThe Court: I feel that is why I wanted these witnesses to state \u2014 if the government has the record of the grand jury and claim those men did definitely commit themselves to conversations, which, according to the ordinary course of human events a man would not forget so readily. I think the attention of the witnesses should be called to that testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">**********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">\u201cThe Court: X don\u2019t mean in open court. I mean take a number of these witnesses into the District Attorney\u2019s office \u2014 I don\u2019t care whether it is in your presence or not \u2014 and read that to them and then recall them to the stand and ask them whether, since the testimony has been called to their attention, they still adhere to what has been said on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">**********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t like a witness to leave the stand under the condition these witnesses did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">The testimony given by these witnesses before the grand jury was thereafter read to them, and the witnesses were recalled, and conversations which they had previously stated they had forgotten were then related.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Is this error? We think not. When a witness upon the trial of any case, whether criminal or civil, convinces the court that he is \u201cconvenientfy forgetful,\u201d the trial judge is amply justified in taking matters into his own hands, and on his own motion taking such steps as will lead to the ascertainment of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">It is true that trials in criminal cases should be so conducted as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>insure the acquittal of the innocent, but it must not be forgotten that they are also conducted for the purpose of convicting the guilty, and in all cases the court should endeavor to get the real facts- \u2014 the truth. When the judge is convinced that a witness is conveniently hiding behind the answer, \u201cI can\u2019t recall,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d which is tantamount to perjury, he fails in his duty if he does not take such necessary steps as will reawaken the witness\u2019 conscience and his memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In the present case, in respect to the matter under consideration, the action of the trial court is to be commended rather than criticized.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Many other objections to the ruling of the court in admitting evidence appear in the briefs of plaintiffs in error. They need not be separately considered. Some are, for want of proper objections, not properly before us. Others must be overruled because plaintiffs in error misconstrue the court\u2019s ruling. Still others pertain to testimony that had no bearing upon the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We fail to discover reversible error in the admission of evidence over the timely and proper objections of plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The case has been fully and we believe fairly tried. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b301-9\">MACK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AKW\">(dissenting). Proof of earlier similar acts is admissible for the purpose of establishing the motive, design, or intent which accompanied the later and alleged criminal transactions. That such evidence may he prejudicial to a defendant by establishing that he committed other crimes does not make it inadmissible; it compels, however, the exercise of caution on the part of the court in receiving it, and in instructing the jury as to its proper scope, ^and on counsel in using it in argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">In this case, such proof would be admissible to show that the later acts, susceptible of an innocent or criminal interpretation, were done with criminal intent; specifically, in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud the government out of the ten cents per pound tax levied on the sale of colored oleomargarine.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Motive, however, is in no maimer involved; if defendants, with criminal intent, did what they are charged with having done, the motive, money making, was apparent from the transactions themselves. That they had a like motive in earlier criminal transactions is immaterial; proof, therefore, of such other dealings, merely to show a readiness to violate the law of the land in order to increase their business and the profits thereof, is inadmissible. Its only tendency is to prejudice the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The Illinois statute forbidding the sale of colored oleomargarine had no bearing whatever on the innocence or guilt of defendants or on their motive, design, or intent in committing the acts charged against them. The evidence is clear that defendants, like all other oleomargarine manufacturers, sold very much more white than colored goods, both before and after the federal act of 1902 had imposed a heavy tax on the sale of colored oleomargarine. Every such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>sale was in violation of the Illinois law; proof of the law and sales thereunder demonstrated only that defendants, for a commercial profit, were ready to risk an Illinois criminal prosecution both before and after 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The only inference to be drawn therefrom bearing on the present charge is that, as defendants were ready to violate Illinois law in order to make money, they were also ready to conspire to commit a federal crime for the same purpose. As well might proof of the law for-' bidding larcenies and embezzlements and of the violation thereof be admitted; the inference would be equally cogent.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">While the federal court takes judicial notice of state statutes, and while, of course, proof of the sale of colored goods after 1902, as part of the present case, is admissible, even though it necessarily shows a violation of Illinois law, the introduction of the statute itself and the proof of its violation prior to 1902 was, in my judgment, without justification. Whatever the purpose of the government\u2019s counsel, the necessary effect of this serious error was to prejudice the jury; an effect greatly enhanced by the use of the evidence in the argument and in no wise mitigated by any instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The evidence as to the use before 1902 of extra hoops on tubs to facilitate the destruction of the revenue stamp was, in my judgment, also inadmissible. It tended to show a conspiracy between some of the defendants to defraud the public by enabling tax-paid oleomargarine to be sold as butter and to defraud the government by evading payment of the wholesale oleomargarine dealers\u2019 license.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The acts charged against defendants in the carrying out of the present alleged conspiracy are of a different character and have a different purpose. No swindling of the public is involved; the alleged criminal intent is not to defraud generally, or even to defraud the government generally, but specifically to defraud it by evading payment of the new and totally different tax on colored oleomargarine.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The effect of this evidence, too, was necessarily prejudicial to defendants. As counsel said in argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">\u201cThe dealer could sell this oleomargarine as butter. That was the state of mind of John F. Jelke prior to 1902. He was willing to violate the law, without respect or regard to the laws of the United States. He made these tubs and put them up in such a way that his customers could defraud the people whom they were selling the goods to by selling this oleomargarine to them as butter, and made it possible for these dealers to defraud this government out of the whole license, by fixing the tubs up so that they could sell as butter, thereby deceiving the revenue officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\u201cAh, gentlemen, that situation shows the state of mind of John F. Jelke away back prior to 1902, and if at that time John F. Jelke would violate the law, John If. Jelke would assist these various dealers and customers of his in violating the law for the purpose of making a market for his oleomargarine, there is no reason to think that John F. Jelke would not violate the law in 1902, 1903, and 1906. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">\u201cThat transaction back in 1900, gentlemen of the jury, is for the purpose of showing the motive and state of mind towards the United States, and the enforcement of the law, of the defendant John F. Jelke.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">While in my judgment the court erred in unduly limiting the cross-examination, it is unnecessary to enlarge upon this point, especially as, in itself, it might not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>While agreeing, as I do, with much of the majority opinion, especially as to the validity of the indictment, I am impelled to the conclusion that, for the errors specified, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
