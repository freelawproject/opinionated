As a further defense it pleads that, when the cotton was delivered to it, it executed and delivered to the party delivering it a receipt which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">\u201cNot responsible for loss by damage, fire, flood, or other agencies, unless caused by the willful act or gross negligence, of this company\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-19\">\u2014which receipt was accepted by' the bailor, and that no part of the cotton was destroyed by its willful act or gross negligence. These receipts were issued and delivered in January, 1915. There was a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>to a jury, and a verdict for the plaintiff. The Compress Company requested the court, among other special requests, to charge the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that the following provisions contained in each of the receipts issued by the defendant to the plaintiff, or his grantors, for each of the bales of cotton delivered by plaintiff to defendant, and in the latter\u2019s possession at the time of the fire, to wit: \u2018Not responsible for loss by damage, fire, flood, or other agencies, unless caused by the willful act or gross negligence of this company\u2019 \u2014 constitutes a part of the contract of bailment, and is a valid and binding provision thereof, and before plaintiff will be entitled to recover in this case he must show to your satisfaction by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant\u2019s agents or employes were guilty of some act or omission contributing to the destruction of plaintiff\u2019s cotton by the fire in question, which was willfully performed or omitted, or which amounts to gross negligence or fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u201cYou are instructed that the defendant in this case, in any event, was only bound to use ordinary care in providing a reasonably safe place for the storage of the cotton, and was hound only to take such precautions and adopt such safeguards as an ordinarily prudent person would adopt to protect his own property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that one who undertakes to care for or to provide custody for goods for hire has a legal right to limit his liability by special contract, so as to cover only such damage as may be caused by the willful or gross negligence of the party in caring for said property or providing storage therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that a custodian for hire, who has limited the liability thereunder to only such damages as may be caused by the willful or gross negligence of such person, can only be held liable for such damage as naturally resulted from the willful act of such person in caring for said property or for such damage as has resulted from the gross negligence of such person in taking care of said property while in his possession\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u2014all o\u00a3 which requests were by the court refused and proper exceptions saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The court in its charge instructed the jury on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">\u201cA proposition which may well be disposed of at the outset is that the provision in the tickets for this cotton against responsibility, unless caused by the willful act or gross negligence of the company is not valid, because contrary tq the public policy of this state. The principle which applies in a case of this kind and which governs in this case is that the defendant, being a bailee for hire of plaintiff\u2019s cotton, -would become answerable in damages to the plaintiff in case of the loss of the cotton, through its negligence pr\u00f3ximatoly causing such loss, but not otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">To this part of the charge a proper exception was saved by the Compress Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The issues are therefore narrowed to the single proposition of law, whether the provision contained in the receipts and accepted by the plaintiff, that the Compress Company is not responsible for loss or damage by fire, flood, or other agencies, unless caused by the willful act or gross negligence of the defendant, is valid. In Clark v. United States, 95 U. S. 539, 542 (24 L. Ed. 518), it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\">\u201cA bailee for hire is only responsible for ordinary diligence and liable for ordinary negligence in the care of the property bailed. This is not only the common law, but the general law, on the subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">It is equally well settled that a bailee, in the absence of a statute prohibiting it, may limit his liability by contract, except for gross negligence, willful act, or fraud.

R., 83 Mo. 112, 53 Am. Rep. 558; Butler v. Greene, 49 Neb. 280, 68 N. W. 496; Sanchez v. Blumberg (Tex. Civ. App.) 176 S. W. 904; Evans v. Nail, 1 Ga. App. 42, 57 S. E. 1020; Direct Nav. Co. v.

In the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition Case it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">\u201cIs there good reason why the notice given by the Exposition Company to exhibitors, that it would- \u2018in no way be responsible for damages or loss of any kind, * * * however originating,\u2019 should not be given full effect according to its terms? We perceive none.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The learned trial judge considered himself concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Inland Compress Co. v. Simmons, 159 Pac. 262, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cThe writers on bailments seem- to agree that the parties to a bailment contract may regulate the responsibilities of the bailee by special contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">But he further held that a contract by a compress company, identical with that in the instant case, \u201cis against the public policy of the state and therefore void.\u201d This opinion was filed July 11, 1916. It will be noticed that the decision in that case is not based on any statute of the state, but on a general proposition of law, declaring for the first time in the judicial history of the state that such a contract is against tire public policy of the state. The only statute of the state cited in the opinion is section 1109 of the Revised Statutes of 1910, which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cA bailee for hire must use at least ordinary care for the preservation of the thing bailed\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\u2014which is merely declaratory of the common law and the general law on the subject, as was held in Clark v. United States, supra. Is that decision, rendered long after the contract involved was made, conclusive on the national courts ? When a ruling of the highest court of a state is controlling, when the same question arises in an action pending in a national court of that state, has been determined by the national Supreme Court so frequently, that it has ceased to be an open question. Dike most important legal principles, it has been of gradual growth, until it has finally become a well-established rule of law. In Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 360, 30 Sup. Ct. 140, 143 (54 L. Ed. 228), the court, after a full review of the former rulings of that court on the subject, epitomizes the law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cWe take it, then, that it is no longer to be questioned that the federal courts in determining cases before them are to be guided by the following rules: (1) When administering state laws and determining rights accruing under those laws, the jurisdiction of the federal court is an independent one, not subordinate to, but co-ordinate and concurrent with, the jurisdiction of the state courts. (2) Where, before the rights of the parties accrued, certain rules relating to real estate have been so established by state decisions as to become rules of property and action in the state, those rules are accepted by the federal court as authoritative declarations of the law of the state. (3) But where the law of the state, has not been thus settled, it is not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>right, but the duty, of the federal court to exercise its own judgment, as it also always does when the case before it depends upon tba doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudence. (4) So, when contracts and transactions are entered .into and rights have accrued under a particular state of the local decisions, or when there has been no decision by the state court on the particular question involved, then the federal courts properly claim the right to give effect to their own judgment as to what is the law of the state applicable to the case, even where a different view has been expressed by the state court after the rights of parties accrued. But even in such cases, for the sake of comity and to avoid confusion, the federal court should always lean to an agreement with the state court if the question is balanced with doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Applying these rules, giving full weight to that part of the decision in the Kuhn Case that, \u201cfor the. sake of comity and to avoid confusion, the federal court should always lean to an agreement with the state court, if the question is balanced with doubt,\u201d we are of the opinion that the law is well settled that the contract of bailment in the case at bar is valid, and not against public policy, so far as it affects contracts entered into prior to the decision in the Inland Compress Co. Case, and that the court erred in refusing to give the instructions here \u25a0 inbeforc set out, asked by the defendant, and charging the jury \u201cthat the limitation of liability in the warehouse receipts was invalid, because contrary to the public policy of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The cause is reversed, with directions to grant a new trial and proceed in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
