To say the least, it is not clearly made to appear by the record that the finding of fact upon which apparently the rejection of the claim was based was wrong. The record does not show the commission of any error calling for a reversal of the decree appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">That decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
