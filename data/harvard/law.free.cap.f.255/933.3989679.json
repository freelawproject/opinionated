Not. Parke, Davis &amp; Co. 90, 92 &amp; 94 Maiden Dane, New York. [P. D. &amp; Co. Brand Insect Powder P.

The motion and the demurrer were overruled. There was a trial resulting in the conviction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Each count of the information undertakes to charge an offense under the Act of Congress of April 26, 1910, known as the Insecticide Act, c. 191, 36 Stat. 331 (Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 8765-8777). That act includes a prohibition of the shipment in interstate commerce of adulterated or misbranded insecticides, and makes such a shipment a misdemeanor. It defines the terms \u201cinsecticide,\u201d \u201cadulterated,\u201d and \u201cmisbranded,\u201d as used in the act. The following are provisions of the act :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018insecticide\u2019 as used in this act shall include any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any insects which may infest vegetation, man or other animals, or households, or be present in any environment whatsoever. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">\u201cFor the purpose of this act an article shall be deemed to be adulterated\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-11\">\n<em>\u201cParis Green.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-12\">\u201cIn the case of paris green: First, if it does not contain at least fifty per centum of arsenious oxide; second, if it contains arsenic in water-soluble forms equivalent to more than three and one-half per centum of arsenious oxide; third, if any substance has been mixed and packed with it so as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or strength.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-13\">\n<em>\u201cLead Arsenate.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-14\">\u201cIn the case of lead arsenate: First, if it contains more than fifty per centum of water; second, if it contains total arsenic equivalent to less than twelve and one-half per centum of arsenic oxid (As205); third, if it contains arsenic in water-soluble forms equivalent to more than seventy-five one-hundredths per centum of arsenic oxid (As205); fourth, if any substances have Been mixed and packed with it so as to reduce, lower, or injuriously affect its quality or strength: Provided, however, that extra water may be added to lead arsenate (as described in this paragraph) if the resulting mixture is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>labelled lead arsenate and water, the percentage of extra water being plainly and correctly stated on the label.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-4\">\n<em>'\u2018Other Insecticides or Fwn.gioides.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-5\">\u201cIn the case of insecticides or fungicides, other than paris green and lead arsenate: First, if its strength or purity Call below the professed standard or quality Tinder which it is sold; second, if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part for the article; third, if any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or in jiart abstracted; fourth, if it is intended for uso on vegetation and shall contain any substance or substances which, although preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating insects, shall be injurious to such vegetation when used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018misbranded\u2019 as used herein shall apply to all insecticides, paris greens, lead arsenates, or fungicides, or articles which enter into the composition of insecticides or fungicides, the package or label of which shall bear any statement, design, or device regarding such article or the ingredients or substances contained therein which shall be false or misleading in any particular, and to all insecticides, paris greens, lead arsenates, or fungicides which are falsely branded as to the state, territory, or country in which they art' manufactured or produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">\u201cThat for the purpose of this act an article shall he deemed to be misbranded \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-8\">\u201cIn the case of insecticides (other than paris greens and lend arsenates) and fungicides: First, if it contains arsenic in any of its coinbiimiions or in the elemental form and the toial amount of arsenic present (expressed as per centum of metallic arsenic) is not stated on the label; second, if it contains arsenic in any of its combinations or in the elemental form and the amount of arsenic in water-soluble forms (expressed as pel\u2019 centum of metallic arsenic) is not stated on the label; third. 3C it consists partially or completely of an inert substance or substances which do not prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate insects or fungi and 'does not have the names and percentage amounts of each anti every one of such inert ingredients plainly and correctly stated on the label: Provided, however, that in lieu of naming and stating the percentage amount of. each and every inert ingredient the producer may at his discretion state plainly upon the label the correct names and percentage amounts of each and every ingredient of the insecticide or fungicide having insecticidal or fungicidal properties, and make no mention of the inert Ingredienls, except in so far as to state the total percentage of inert ingredients present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">The act provides for the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Commerce and Labor making uniform rules and regulations for carrying- out the provisions of the act. The term \u201cinsect powder\u201d is not found in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The subjects of the alleged shipments were packages libeled as alleged in the information. The words on the label, except those stating weight and. the name and address of the defendant, were: \u201c1\u201d. D. &amp; Co. Brand Insect Powder P. D. &amp; Co.\u201d In the connection in which the letters \u201cP. D.\u201d are found on the label, they are to be taken as used as the initials of a previously stated name. The bracketed words of the label import insect powder of the named brand. The term \u201cinsect powder\u201d is one which was in common use long before the enactment of the statute. Judicial cognizance is taken of the meaning of words or terms in common use. The following is the definition of the term given in the Century Dictionary: \u201cA dry powder used to kill or expel insects; an insecticide or inscctifuge.\u201d That definition is followed by this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-12\">\u201cThe principal kinds, used against museum and household pests, are the Persian, made from the dry flowers of pyrethrum rosoum; the Dalmatian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>(also called Persian), from those of pyrethrum cinerariae-folium; and the Oalifornian, also made from the last-named plant, all of which are known as buhach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Where words in everyday use are put upon labels, they are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning so far as they have one, unless it is disclosed that their use was under such circumstances that they conveyed a different meaning. Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby v. United States, 210 Fed. 148, 127 C. C. A. 14; United States v. 150 Cases of Fruit Puddine (D. C.) 211 Fed. 360. The information does not allege any facts or circumstances from which it could be inferred that the term \u201cinsect powder,\u201d as used in the label, had a meaning other than the one it has in everyday use. If the word \u201cinsecticide\u201d had been used, it would have conveyed the same meaning, except that it would not have indicated that the thing referred to was a dry powder. The use of either of jthe words is not inconsistent with the thing referred to being a mixture containing ingredients lacking in purity or insecticidal value. And the use of either of them does not constitute a profession of standard or quality or a statement of the ingredients or substances contained in the thing referred to. The statute specifies ingredients of paris green and lead arsenate the presence or absence of which is given such effect that those articles are to be deemed adulterated. Those provisions are not applicable to insecticides other than the ones named. So far as appears, at the time of the alleged shipments, no regulation had been prescribed which purported to deal with the use of the word \u201cinsect powder\u201d- on labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The first count of the information undertook to charge that the subject of the alleged shipment was adulterated within the meaning of the provision of the statute that an article should be deemed to be adulterated \u201cif\u201d its strength or purity fall below the professed standard or quality under which it is sold.\u201d It does not attempt to charge that the thing shipped was adulterated within the meaning of any other clause of the statute\u2019s definition of that term. That count failed to state facts constituting the offense attempted to be charged, in that it failed to show that the alleged label or any part of it imported a professed standard or quality under which the subject of the alleged shipment was sold. It imported no more tiran that the thing referred to was a powder intended to be used to kill, repel, or mitigate insects.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">The second count of the information undertook to charge that the subject of the alleged shipment was \u201cmisbranded\u201d within the meaning of that part of the statute\u2019s definition of that term which makes it apply to all insecticides, etc., \u201cthe package or label of which shall bear any statement, design or device- regarding such article or the ingredients or substances contained therein which shall be false or misleading in any particular.\u201d There was no attempt to charge that the thing shipped was misbranded within the meaning of any other clause of the statute\u2019s definition of that term. The charge as made in that count involves the assumption that the word or term \u201cinsect powder\u201d amounts to a statement which was false and misleading, though the thing referred to is one which properly is identified or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>described by that name as it applied ordinarily and customarily. That assumption is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-3\">The conclusion is that the averments of neither count of the information showed the commission of any criminal offense. The court erred in ruling otherwise. Its judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b949-4\">SHEPPARD, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">(dissenting). The evidence at the trial established the trade meaning of \u201cprofessed standard\u201d of insecticide, namely, a powder made of the flower heads of the pyrethrum plant. The evidence further showed that the introduction of more than 10 per cent, of stems of the plant into the powder reduced its purity and efficacy relatively in proportion to the quantity of powdered stems put into the article. The insect powder of defendant put on the trade was shown to contain 50 per cent, of powdered stems. Stems were shown to have only a slight insecticidal value, and by the terms of the statute the percentage amount of the inert ingredient should be plainly stated on the label. I think the information charges an offense under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The evidence in my opinion made out a case of at least misbranding, and the judgment should not be disturbed.
