While in the possession of the charterer the barge was left by one of the railroad company\u2019s tugs at the end of Pier 39, Brooklyn, outside'of two other barges. This occurred shortly after midnight of February 26-27, at which time' the weather was calm. By noon of February 28 the wind had arisen, and before that time lighter 262-F, belonging to the Erie Company, was moored at the same pier end, and to and alongside of the Nicholson, by a tug not belonging to the railroad company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">When the wind arose the 262-F and the Nicholson began to pound, and the situation became dangerous for both. Before 2 p. m. of the 27th the master of the Nicholson by telephone applied for assistance to the Erie office from which he was accustomed to receive orders. No help arrived until about 4 p. m., before which time the Nicholson had received considerable injury by pounding against No. 262-F.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-14\">Pier 39, Brooklyn, is much exposed to northwesterly winds, and on February 26th the United \u2019States Weather Bureau had displayed in all the usual places around the harbor warning against a northwest storm. This action was brought to recover for the injuries received as above stated, and two tug masters in the service of respondent railroad company were examined concerning the movements of the barges above named. Neither of them seem to have observed the storm warning, and one of them (the master whose tug had left.the Nicholson at Pier \u00a79) deposed that he did not take \u201cstorm warnings into consideration when [putting] boats at piers in the harbor, unless it [was] blowing at the time\u201d; and when asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you rely on those storm warnings?\u201d answered, \u201cNot always.\u201d The District Court granted a decree for libelant; respondent brings this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-15\">Herbert Green, of New York City, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-16\">Macklin, Brown &amp; Purdy, of New York City (William E. Purdy, of New York City, of counsel), for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b66-17\">Before WARD, ROGERS, and HOUGH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-18\">HOUGH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Azl\">While entertaining no doubt that the charter, by virtue of which respondent was in possession of the Nicholson, amounted to a demise, we do not ground decision on the relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>thus established. The libel does not require consideration of this point, but charges in common form negligence in mooring and leaving the barge in \u201can' exposed, unsafe, and dangerous position.\u201d We agree with the trial court that this charge is sustained by the joint effect of the following considerations: 4</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> 1. It was some evidence of negligence that the navigators of respondent paid no attention to the official warnings of the northwest storm, which was the principal cause of libelants\u2019 damages. It is not held that mere failure to observe storm warnings or to obey them is conclusive proof of negligence; but it is evidence of a failure in that ordinary care and skill which is a master mariner\u2019s duty. In substance we agree with the remarks on this subject contained in The Salutation (D. C.) 239 Fed. at page 423. The evidence herein shows that the testifying masters considered it no part of their duty either to observe or give weight to the Weather Bureau\u2019s advice. This was an error; we think such duty exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">2. Probably the proximate cause of the Nicholson\u2019s damage was the placing outside of her of the Erie lighter 262-F. When this was done, the weather was apparently getting worse and the storm about to burst. The mooring of this lighter against the Nicholson was not done by respondent, but by another tug, apparently acting under the orders of the agent for a steamship loading near by, to whom, however, respondent had intrusted the charge of its lighter 262-F. Plainly the owner of that lighter does not escape responsibility to third parties by employing or permitting another person to handle and move said lighter. For the purposes of this case it is respondent that placed the 262-F against the Nicholson and left her there, whatever may be the. rights and remedies of the Erie Company over and against the persons performing this piece of carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">3. It was further evidence of negligence that at a time when the danger was imminent, if some damage had not already been done, the railroad company did not more swiftly furnish assistance to any boat in its charge. A delay of two hours in sending a tug to South Brooklyn, when a high northwest wind was known to be injuring vessels in such an exposed position as is here shown, cannot be excused by anything in the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the decree appealed from is affirmed, with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
