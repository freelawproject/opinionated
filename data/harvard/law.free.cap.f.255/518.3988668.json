A clerk in the maritime department of the railroad company answered the telephone, and the charterers\u2019 officer inquired, \u201cWill you tow three of our barges, two of them to Providence and one to Fall Kiver?\u201d The answer was in the affirmative, a rare was agreed upon, and agreement made that libelant\u2019s tugs were to go to Bed Hook and take charge of the barges forthwith. No investigation concerning the relation of the New York, etc., Company to the barges was made, and libelant\u2019s agent deposed that he Inferred, from the use of the phrase \u201cour barges#,\u201d that the New York, etc., Company owned the barges to be towed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">libelant's tugs took the barges to Hammond\u2019s Flats, near Throgg\u2019s Neck, and it there became necessary to use longer hawsers for towing through the Sound and at sea. It thou appeared that the barges had no hawsers proper for this purpose, and of this fac-t the tugmaster apprised libelant\u2019s marine superintendent, who thereupon communicated telephonically with the charterers, and was requested and agreed to use the tug\u2019s hawsers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">The vice president of the charterers testified that he conducted this last telephone conversation, and in the course thereof apprised libelant\u2019s marine superintendent that the barges wore under charter to the New York, etc., Transportation Company, and that the charterers had supposed that proper hawsers came with the boats. This libelant\u2019s marine superintendent denied, but admitted that a few days after the towage was completed he was informed by the Southern Transportation Company that they owned the barges, and that bills for the towage had been made out against the several \u201cbarges and owners in care of New York &amp; Boston Transportation Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">' The charterers failed to pay the towage bills, as: they were admittedly bound to do under the charter party, whereupon libelant filed a libel against each barge, claiming Hens for the towage aforesaid because (as alleged in the libels) the \u201cservices were necessary for said barge, wore rendered upon her credit, and by the general admiralty law, as well as by the Act of Congress of June 23, 15)10\u201d (Act .Tune 23, 1010, c. 373, 30 Slat. 601 [Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 7783-77871), became \u201cvalid and subsisting maritime Hens.\u201d The District Court held that no liens had been created, and dismissed all the libels, whereupon libelant took these appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-8\">Alexander &amp; Ash, of New York City (Peter Alexander, of New York City, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-9\">Barry, Wainwright, Thacher &amp; Symmers, of New York City (James K.

The contention for a lien under the act of 1910 necessarily rests on the assertion that towage \u2014 at least for barges without motive power of their own \u2014 must he considered one of the \u201cother necessaries\u201d for which liens are recognized or conferred by the first section of the act (U. S. Comp. St. \u00a7 7783).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">As to the effect of this statute on existing law, our views are sufficiently expressed in The Oceana, 244 Fed. at page 82, 156 C. C. A. 508; and as to the specific, question whether towage is included in the phrase \u201cother necessaries,\u201d we think the opinion of Veeder, J., in The J. Doherty (D. C.) 207 Fed. at pages <em>999, </em>1000, entirely satisfactory, and adopt the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Consequently none of these libels can be sustained under the statute ; towage not being a \u201cnecessary\u201d within the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> 2. It is not doubted that under general maritime law a lien for towage may be created, or that there is a presumption of pledge supporting lien, in respect of at least many of the essential assistances to navigation, of which towage is one. The Alligator, 161 Fed. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">But such a presumption is rebuttable, and means little more than that the burden of producing evidence to show the facts lies upon him that denies a pledge so natural and frequent as one for (inter alia) towage. Therefore, in respect of towage, the facts must always be examined before any lien can be asserted, as was done in this court in The Sarah Cullen (D. C.) 45 Fed. 511, affirmed 49 Fed. 166, 1 C. C. A. 218, and The Stroma, 53 Fed. 281, 3 C. C. A. 530. For the same principle, see The Wandrahm, <em>67 </em>Fed. 358, 14 C. C. A. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Upon such inquiries the real question often is that presented by this litigation, viz.: How far may one furnishing services to a vessel, without any actual knowledge of her ownership, agents or charterings, and dealing with some person other than the master, shut his eyes, avoid or neglect all inquiry, and rest upon an authority to contract, which is in essence nothing more than an inference from an apparent act of authority?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">We lay aside all decisions concerning liens asserted to rest on dealings with a shipmaster. The authority of a master by virtue of his office is so ancient, extensive, and universally accepted as to give to the \u201ccaptain\u2019s orders\u201d a standing quite different from the agreements of all other agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In this instance libelant was plainly employed to perform a service maritime in its nature, the subject of a maritime contract and capable of supporting a maritime lien. But such lien could arise only by the hypothecation express or implied of the credit of the vessel, and that pledge, like any other, must rest on the act of the owner, even though such owner\u2019s efficient act consisted only in permitting another to be his agent. While any one who appoints an agent takes the risk of liability growing out of, not only the agent\u2019s power, but its abuse, the mere fact of acting like an agent does not make an agent out of the actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">There are only two states of fact possible in this case. Either libel-ant was told before any substantial part of the towage service was rendered that the person procuring the towage was a charterer, or else nothing more was known until after services rendered than that the New York &amp; Boston Transportation Company in and of New York, had asked to have \u201cour barges\u201d towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The District Court found the first state of facts to be the truth. It came to that conclusion, after seeing and hearing the witnesses, and we perceive no reason to disapprove that finding. If so, there was no lien by general law irrespective of statute, under The Valencia, 165 U. S. 264, 17 Sup. Ct. 323, 41 L. Ed. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">If, however, we adopt (for argument\u2019s sake) the second state of facts, then the libelant was requested by a corporation apparently of New York, and in New York, to tow \u201cour barges.\u201d Eibelant\u2019s infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ence from such a request must have been that a New York owner was in his home port seeking to make a contract for towage. But we hold as matter of fact that libelant had no right to infer an ownership from, the use of the word \u201cour.\u201d It is surely common knowledge that a master, a seaman, a ship\u2019s husband, and indeed almost any one connected with the management or upkeep of a vessel, commonly and naturally refers to that vessel in a possessive sense as well as in the feminine gender. In short, this tug owner made no inquiry, literally knew nothing, and sought to know nothing, about the relation of the hirer to the barges. Such circumstances amount to shutting one\u2019s eyes to keep out the light, and successfully rebut any presumption of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
