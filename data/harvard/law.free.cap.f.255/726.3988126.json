The undisputed facts are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b739-4\">That on October 7, 1908, John B. Henderson, .Tr\u201e recovered in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri a judgment against the county of Dallas. Mo., for 81,023,020.1\u00bb, with interest specified in the judgment, which judgment was duly assigned by Mr. Henderson to the defendant in error. The judgment was on bonds issued by the county of Dallas in 1870-1871, under the provisions of a special act of the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate the Laclede &amp; Ft. <em>Scoti </em>Railroad Company,\u201d approved January 11, 1860. Laws 1859-60, p. 434. Section 14 of that act provided: \u201cIt shall be lawful for the county court of any county in the state to subscribe to the stock of said company, or invest its three per cent, fund or any other internal improvement fund belonging to the county, as stock in said road; and for the stock subscribed in behalf of the county, may issue the bonds of the couni y to raise the funds to pay for same, and to take proper steps to protect the interests of the county, may appoint an agent to represent the county, vote for it, and receive dividends. Any incorporated city, town, or company may subscribe to the stock in said railroad company, and appoint an agent to represent its interests, give its votes, and receive dividends, and may take proper steps to guard and protect the interest of the said city, town or company.\u201d This act was silent as to tax levies for the payment of the bonds or interest At the time these bonds were issued, there was a general statute relating to such subscriptions, which provided: (section 18, page 338, General Statutes of Mo. 1865): \u201cBut the total amount of tax levied for railroad purposes in any one year, in any county, city or town, shall not exceed thirty per centum of the subscription made by such eounry, city or town.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b739-5\">On the petition of the judgment creditor an alternative writ of mandamus was issued by the court requiring the judges of the county court of the county, which under the laws of the state levies all county taxes, to show cause why they should not he compelled to levy and cause to bo collected a tax to pay the judgment of the relator. A return was made to the writ, and on May 1, 15)12, after a hearing, the court granted a peremptory writ of mandamus, directing the county judges to levy, for the current fiscal year, 1012, a special tax to realize the sum of $70,500 upon the taxable property of the county, and when collected to be paid' on the judgment. This writ was disobeyed, and no tax whatever levied, although duly served on the respondents. At the April term, 1913, of the court, the relator filed another petition for mandamus, in which it was alleged that at the October term, 1912, writs of attachment for contempt had been Issued by the court against the county judges and placed in the hands of the United States marshal for the district, but could <em>not be </em>served, as they evaded <em>arrant by </em>concealing themselves. The prayer was to the effect that they be required to levy a ta.x to raise the said sum of $70,500 for the year 1912, and a tax to collect a similar sum for the year 1913, or in the aggregate sum of $141,000. The petition further prayed That the marshal should serve the alternative writ, when issued, on each of the respondents in person, if they he found by diligent search, and, if either of them cannot be found by diligent search, the delivery of a copy thereof to be delivered to a member of the family of such defendant over the age of 15 years at the usual place of abode of such defendant: The court granted the petition for the alternative writ at the April term, 1913, and that it be served as prayed in the petition. Nothing was accomplished under this order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b739-6\">At the April term, 1917, another petition, reciting the facts as set out in the petition of 1913, that no tax has ever been levied to payt this judgment, prayed that they .be required to levy a tax to net $70,500 for each of the years 1912, 1913, and \u00cd917, a total sum of $211,500, to be served in the same maimer as provided by the judgment entered in 1913. The court made an order in conformity with the prayer of the petition. The marshal\u2019s return shows that being unable, after diligent search, to serve the plaintiff in error with the writ, he \u201cdelivered a certified copy of it to Ruby Evans, a member of the family of J. S. Evans, associate judge of the county court of said county, over the age of 15 years, in the absence of J. S. Evans, whom I was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>locate after diligent search.\u201d At the October term, 1917, the cause came on for hearing, whereupon the court found that the respondent had been properly served with the alternative writ, and granted the peremptory-writ as prayed in the petition, directing service thereof on the defendants in person, \u201cif they can by diligent search be found, and, if they cannot be found by the marshal after diligent search, then by delivering a copy of said writ to a member of the family of said defendant who cannot\u2018be found over the age of 15 years at the usual place of abode of such defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-4\">The marshal\u2019s return shows the service on the defendant Evans was made by delivering a certified copy of the writ to Ruby Evans, in the same manner as shown by his return of service of the alternative writ hereinbefore set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-5\">On March 27, 1918, the defendant in error filed a petition for attachment against the three'county judges, including the plaintiff in error, setting out the proceedings hereinbefore recited, and that with full knowledge and due notice of the order of the court, and of the peremptory writ, and of all the proceedings prior thereto, but with the intent to attempt to defeat the ends of justice, and to hinder and delay the enforcement of the order of the court, they have entirely failed to comply with the commands of the peremptory writ of mandamus, and have failed and refused to make the levy as directed to be made by said writ, and in all things have failed to comply therewith, and- have by their actions defied this court, and disobeyed the writ and mandate of this court, and are' now in open, palpable, and flagrant contempt of this court. Upon presentation of this petition the court ordered an attachment of the bodies of the defendants. The writs were duly issued and the plaintiff in error arrested by the marshal. The plaintiff in error thereupon filed a motion to quash the peremptory writ of mandamus and the attachment issued and founded thereon, assigning as grounds therefor:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-6\">\u201cMrst.

Rev. St. 1909, defines the summons as the original writ where not otherwise provided. Section 1760 of that chapter authorizes service of process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cThird. By leaving a copy of the petition and writ at his usual place of abode, with some person of his family over the age of fifteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> There is no reason why this provision of the statute is not broad enough to authorize service of a writ of mandamus in the manner prescribed. But, even were it otherwise, we are of the opinion that the national courts are not controlled by state statutes, but may prescribe such rules and orders, as may be necessary. Section 918, Rev. St. (Comp. St. \u00a7 1544), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cThe several Circuit and District Courts may, from time to time, and in any manner not inconsistent with any law of the United States, or with any rule prescribed by the Supreme Court under the preceding section, make rules and orders directing the returning of writs and processes, the filing of pleadings, the taking of rules, the entering and making up of judgments by default, and other matters in vacation, and otherwise regulate their own practice as may be necessary or convenient for the advancement of justice and the prevention of delays in proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Section 262, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162 [Comp. St \u00a7 1239]), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">\u201cThe Supreme Court and the District Courts shall have power to issue writs of scire facias. The Supreme Court, the Circuit Courts of Appeals, and tlie District Courts shall have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">In Collin County National Bank v. Hughes, 152 Fed. 414, 81 C. C. A. 556, and on rehearing 155 Fed. 389, 394, 83 C. C. A. 661, this court passed on the question of the issiiance of a writ of scire facias. After a careful review of the authorities it was held under section 716, Rev. St. (now section 262 of the Judicial Code), the national courts are not restricted by the methods prescribed by the state practice, and may order writs of scire facias to revive judgments to be served outside the state. In Hills &amp; Co. v. Hoover, 220 U. S. 329, 336, 31 Sup. Ct. 402, 405 (55 L. Ed. 485, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 562), it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">\u201cIt follows that where the state statute, or practice, is not adequate to afford the relief which Congress has provided in a given statute, resort must be had to the power of the federal court to adapt its practice and issue its writs and administer its remedies so as to enforce the federal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">As the writ in this case was issued, not in an original action, the national courts having no jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, except as ancillary to its judgments rendered by it, the writ cannot be distinguished from a writ of scire facias to revive a judgment. In Memphis v. Brown, 97 U. S. 300, 302 (24 L. Ed. 924), it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">\u201cA mandamus to collect a tax for the payment of a judgment, or a mandamus to pay a judgment, is process in execution, and nobody heretofore has ever questioned the power of a court to control its own final process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>As the court found that, owing to the willful acts of the respondents in the mandamus proceedings, by concealing themselves to evade service of process, the court below, for the purpose of preventing a failure of justice, prescribed for a service which is in effect the same as is authorized by the statutes of Missouri. Equity rule 13 (198 Fed. xxii, 115 C. C. A. xxii) authorizes such'service of subpoenas in equity, even if there is not willful evasion of the service of process. Therefore, even if the state statutes had required a personal service, and none other, it would not be binding on the national courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In construing section 918, Rev. St., it has been held that a summons made returnable according to a rule of the federal court, and not in conformity with a changed state statute, is proper. Shepard v. Adams, 168 U. S. 618, 18 Sup. Ct. 214, 42 L. Ed. 602; Boston &amp; Maine R. R. v. Gokey, 210 U. S. 155, 28 Sup. Ct. 657, 52 L. Ed. 1002. In Van Doren v. Pennsylvania R. R., 93 Fed. 260, 269, 35 C. C. A. 282, 290, the court, in reply to a contention that the national courts must, under section 914, Rev. St. (the Conformity. Act, Comp. St. \u00a7 1537) follow the practice of the state courts in which it is held, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cThe Circuit Courts are not bound to conform to state practice or pleadings in subordinate details where such conformity would result in gross or substantial injustice to litigants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">It is not even claimed that he had no notice of the granting, issuance, and service of the writ in conformity with the order of the court. \u2019 In view of these facts, we are of the opinion that the order of the District Court for the service of the writs was authorized by the laws of the United States, and the service was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is next claimed that the judgment awarding the peremptory writ is absolutely void, as the general law of the state, in force when the bonds, upon which the relator\u2019s judgment was based, hereinbefore quoted from General Statutes of Mo. 1865, limited the tax, which may be levied for railroad purposes in any one year, to 30 per centum of the subscription made by a county, and the writ, which the plaintiff in error was charged to have disobeyed, commanded a greater levy than 30 per cent, of the subscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Although there was no express provision in the act, by authority of which the bonds upon which relator\u2019s judgment is based were issued, to levy a special tax for their payment, it has been conclusively determined by the Supreme Court in actions arising under acts of the state of Missouri, containing the identical provision found in this act, that the power to tax is necessarily an ingredient of such power to contract. Ralls County Court v. United States, 105 U. S. 733, 736, 26 L. Ed. 1220; Scotland County Court v. United States, 140 U. S. 41, 45, 11 Sup. Ct. 697, 35 L. Ed. 351. The fourteenth section of the act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">\u201cIt shall be lawful for the county court of any county in the state to subscribe to the stock of said company, * * * and for the stock subscribed in behalf of the county may issue the bonds of the county to raise the funds to pay for same, and to take proper steps to protect the interests of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">In the cases cited it was held that such a provision carried with it the power to levy a tax to pay bonds issued thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Assuming that the special act, under which the bonds were issued, is subject to this general act (but see Bunch v. United States, 252 Fed. 673, 679, - C. C. A. -, decided by this court, Sept. 2, 1918) the contention is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">When the first peremptory writ of mandamus was issued in 1912, it only commanded a tax levy to produce $70,500. The county court disobeyed this mandate. Thereupon another petition for a mandamus was filed in 1913, alleging that fact, and asking for a peremptory writ to compel the levy of a tax for the two years, for $70,500 each, or a total of $141,000. This was granted, but again the county court refused to levy any tax, as commanded. When in 1917 the relator filed the third petition for a mandamus, he set out the failure and refusal of the county court to levy the taxes as commanded for the years 1912 and 1913, and prayed for a mandamus, commanding the county court to levy in the aggregate sum of $211,500, to' make up the amounts, which should have been levied and collected in obedience to the writs issued in 1912 and 1913, and to be levied for the year 1917, and the court granted this prayer of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In East St. Louis v. Amy, 120 U. S. 600, 604, 7 Sup. Ct. 739, 741 (30 L. Ed. 798), the same question was involved, except that no writs of mandamus had been issued therefor, and the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u2018\"Che law required a tax to be levied annually sufficient to pay all interest as it accrued, and the principal wben due. This was neglected, and consequently there is now a large accumulation of a debt which ought to have been paid in installments. Thus far the inhabitants have been allowed to escape taxation at the times it ought to have been laid, and to which they were under constitutional obligations to submit. The accumulation of the debt was caused by their own neglect as members of the political community which had incurred the obligation. Such being the case, we see no reason why it was not in the power of the court to order a single levy to meet the entire judgment, which was all for past-due obligations. Whether such a tax would be so oppressive as to make it proper not to have it all collected at one time was a question resting in the sound discretion of the court in ordering the collection. There is nothing here to show that there ought to have been a division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">To the same effect are Hicks v. Cleveland, 106 Fed. 459, 465, 45 C. C. A. 429; Padgett v. Post, 106 Fed. <em>600, </em>603, 45 C. C. A. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Again, if the court erred in requiring too large a tax levy, the error*could only be corrected by writ of error, and not. by a collateral attack on the judgment, as is attempted in this proceeding. Bunch v. United States, supra, where the authorities are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
