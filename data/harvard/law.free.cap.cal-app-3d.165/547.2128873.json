Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of robbery with the personal use of a firearm allegation (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 12022.5), and a prior serious felony conviction for attempted exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a peace officer. (\u00a7\u00a7 417, subd. (b); 664; 667.) Defendant contends (1) the offense of attempted exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a police officer is not a \u201cserious felony\u201d for enhancement purposes; (2) the prior conviction providing the basis for enhancement must have resulted from a \u201ctrial\u201d rather than a plea; (3) enhancement under section 667 is not authorized by section 1170.1; (4) the court erred in imposing the upper term for the robbery conviction on the basis of multiple victims; and (5) the court erred in failing to give credit for presentence custody time. We find merit in the contention that attempted exhibition of a firearm is not a \u201cserious felony\u201d under section 667 and shall strike the five-year term imposed for this enhancement. In all other respects, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">On February 17, 1984, a complaint was filed charging defendant with eight counts of burglary in the second degree, one count of burglary in the first degree, and three counts of robbery with the personal use of a firearm. An additional allegation charged defendant with a prior \u201cserious felony\u201d conviction for attempted exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a peace officer. (\u00a7\u00a7 417, subd. (b); 667.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The robbery counts arose out of a single incident in which defendant and two companions robbed the employees of a restaurant in Chico. At the time of defendant\u2019s arrest on the present charges, he was in custody in the Nevada County jail following a judgment sentencing him to six years imprisonment for an unrelated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Defendant pleaded guilty to the first degree burglary charge, to one count of robbery with the use of a firearm and admitted the prior conviction. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>court sentenced defendant to the upper term of five years for the robbery conviction, citing as aggravating circumstances that the crime involved multiple victims and extensive planning and defendant had previously been committed to the California Youth Authority without success. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 421(a)(4), (a)(8), (b).) The court added a two-year consecutive enhancement for the firearm use (\u00a7 12022.5) and a five-year consecutive enhancement for the prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667). The court sentenced defendant to 16 months for the burglary conviction, ordering it to run consecutively for the reason that the crimes were committed at different times and places. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 425(a)(3).) The total term imposed was 13 years 4 months, to run concurrently with the sentence in the Nevada County conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Defendant contends the attempted exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a peace officer is not a \u201cserious felony\u201d invoking the five-year enhancement for prior convictions under section 667. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Section 667 provides generally that any person convicted of a \u201cserious felony\u201d who previously has been convicted of a \u201cserious felony\u201d shall receive an additional five-year consecutive sentence for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subdivision (d) of section 667 defines \u201cserious felony\u201d as a serious felony listed in subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>(c) of section 1192.7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among the serious felonies listed in subdivision (c) is \u201c[a]ny attempt to commit <em>a crime </em>listed in this subdivision other than an assault.\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(25); italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The list of serious felonies does not include exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a peace officer and the attempted commission of such offense is not a serious felony under section 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The People contend defendant\u2019s prior conviction comes under subdivisions (c)(8) and (c)(23), which, respectively, encompass \u201cany felony in which the defendant uses a firearm\u201d or \u201c[a]ny felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7, subds. (c)(8), (c)(23).) However, subdivision (c)(25) refers only to attempts to commit \u201ccrimes\u201d listed in that subdivision. There is no \u201ccrime\u201d of \u201cfelony with use of a firearm\u201d or \u201cfelony with personal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u201d distinct from the underlying felony in which the weapon is used. Rather, when charged and proven in connection with the commission of a felony, \u201cuse of a firearm\u201d and \u201cuse of a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d are enhancements for which a separate sentence distinct from the underlying felony is imposed. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022, 12022.5.) The use enhancements do not exist separately as \u201ccrimes.\u201d That defendant attempted to exhibit a firearm in the presence of a peace officer, is a felony in itself. It is not a \u201cfelony in which the defendant uses a firearm\u201d or \u201cpersonally used a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d in which the weapon use is an additional element.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Accordingly, we conclude the attempted exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a peace officer, in violation of section 417, subdivision (b), is not a \u201cserious felony\u201d under sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c). This conclusion comports with the tenor of the specific crimes listed in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>1192.7. The exhibition of a firearm in the presence of a police oflicer is punishable by a maximum of one year in the county jail or in state prison, and in section 1192.7 the Legislature has selected only the most serious of all offenses for the five-year enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">We shall order the five-year enhancement term stricken.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The five-year consecutive term imposed for defendant\u2019s prior conviction is ordered stricken. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to prepare a new abstract of judgment in conformity with this opinion and to furnish a copy thereof to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Puglia, P.
