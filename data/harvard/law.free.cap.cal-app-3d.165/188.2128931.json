We hold that the board\u2019s order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">We summarily denied applicants\u2019 petition for writ of review; however, the Supreme Court granted applicants\u2019 petition for hearing and retransferred the matter to this court with direction to issue a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Jack Wehr was employed as a maintenance man by respondent San Luis Obispo Coastal Unified School District for several years until his death on August 31, 1982. His widow Roberta, on behalf of herself and their minor son Jack, Jr., applied for death benefits as dependents (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4702), claiming that the decedent\u2019s liver injury resulted from industrial exposure to chemicals and infectious bacteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">Evidence presented by applicants included testimony of the widow and two of decedent\u2019s coemployees (Mr. Callaway and Mr. Weir), a list of products that the school district\u2019s maintenance men were exposed to in their work, and medical reports of Doctor Silipo.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">Mr. Callaway testified that he had worked with the decedent for five years, but not the last two years. Their work included servicing and cleaning rain gutters, sewers, boilers, heating units, urinals, attics and basements.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Coemployee Weir testified that he worked with decedent the last six months on toilets and sewer lines, some of which emitted unpleasant odors. During the last week of decedent\u2019s employment, they worked on a \u201cvery clean job\u201d installing a leach line from a septic tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The widow testified that the decedent, age 55, had been in good health a month prior to Friday, August 27, 1982. On that day, he returned home from a week working on a sewer and complained that he \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling well\u201d and had a headache, sore throat and fatigue. Four days later he was admitted to a hospital and died that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The autopsy report did not establish the cause of Mr. Wehr\u2019s death. The amended death certificate indicated that the cause of death was endotoxic shock due to \u201cFatty infiltration of Liver, Severe\u2014undetermined cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Applicants also presented in evidence a letter prepared and signed by Mr. Lascelles, a director of the school district\u2019s building and grounds. The letter set forth a list of products used by decedent in his employment, such as \u201cRectorseal,\u201d a pipe threading compound; \u201cWD-40\u201d and \u201cEzy-off,\u201d penetrants; \u201cKrylon,\u201d \u201cAnytime,\u201d and \u201cLawson &amp; State,\u201d spray paints; \u201cBiatron,\u201d a drain cleaner; \u201cDap,\u201d a glazing compound; \u201cSynkoloid,\u201d a sparkling paste; \u201cHenry\u201d and \u201cFloormastic,\u201d adhesives; soldering fluxes; brazing fluxes; soldering acids and gasoline. Applicant also occasionally used paint thinners, epoxy glues, wood fillers, stains, paint removers, solvents, boiler compounds, fiberglass resins and concrete adhesives.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">All of the products on the aformentioned list are sold to the general public. There was no evidence as to the actual chemical composition of the listed products.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The evidence included reports of two physicians, Doctor Silipo and Doctor O\u2019Neill. Neither physician had examined Mr. Wehr. Consequently, their reports were based solely on applicant\u2019s \u201chistory.\u201d Both physicians concluded that the cause of Mr. Wehr\u2019s death was unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Doctor Silipo acknowledged that the precise agent or agents responsible for Mr. Wehr\u2019s death were unknown, and that the exact cause of death was problematical and undetermined. Nevertheless, Doctor Silipo opined three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>possible causes of death: job exposure to chemicals, job exposure to infectious bacteria, and a combination thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">As to chemical exposure, Doctor Silipo based his opinion on a table in \u201c \u2018an article, \u201cEffects on the Liver of Chemicals Encountered in the Work Place,\u201d by Susan Pond, in the Western Journal of Medicine . . . .\u2019\u201d The table, entitled \u201cWorkplace Chemicals That Have Produced Hepatic Effects in Animals or Humans or Both,\u201d set forth approximately 60 specific chemicals. Doctor Silipo stated that the chemicals in the table are compatible with the \u201cchemicals\u201d (brand products) in the list prepared by Mr. Lascelles, and opined that \u201cWe can make a good case for the [decedent\u2019s] exposure to a wide variety of chemicals, including those known to be potentially injurious to the liver as an agent or agents involved in his terminal illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">It is noteworthy that except for gasoline, no item in the table relied upon by Doctor Silipo appears in the list prepared by Mr. Lascelles.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Doctor O\u2019Neill, on the other hand, concluded that the decedent\u2019s fatty liver condition was not explained on available information nor on presumption of chemical exposure. The varied origins of the fatty liver make it impossible to speculate as to a source without documenting or validating physical findings such as microscopic changes indicative of some specific process. It was also mere speculation to broadly mention various materials the decedent may have come in contact with in working in sewers and having been exposed to various other microbiologic pollutants. The information available does not document any specific hepatic toxins, and the microbiologic exposures are equally vague. \u201cI have not seen any information which would clearly outline his cause of death, much less indicate an occupational relationship between that unknown cause of death and any exposures he had in the workplace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The WCJ found that each applicant was entitled to one-half of the $75,000 death benefit. In his report on reconsideration, the WCJ concluded that applicants met their burden of proving industrial causation of death, noting that although Doctor Silipo\u2019s report acknowledged that the cause of death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>was unknown, problematical and undetermined, Doctor Silipo had opined three possible causes of death: exposure to chemicals, infection, and a combination thereof. The WCJ concluded further that since there was no possible basis for finding nonoccupational exposure to chemicals, Doctor Silipo correctly opined that decedent\u2019s work environment was the most likely cause of the liver disease resulting in death; and thus, Doctor Silipo\u2019s opinion is not based on speculation, but on a thorough examination of possible options, and therefore, was substantial evidence to support the finding of industrial causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The WCJ also considered historical inaccuracies in Doctor Silipo\u2019s report, especially as to Doctor Silipo\u2019s assumption that decedent worked around open sewer lines the entire week before his death. Although noting that such assumption was clearly inconsistent with the testimony that the leach line work was a \u201cvery clean job,\u201d the WCJ nevertheless concluded that in view of the decedent\u2019s overall job duties and the dirth of possibilities of nonindustrial exposure, Doctor Silipo\u2019s conclusions seemed the most reasonable. The WCJ stated further that he agreed with Doctor Silipo that chemical exposure on the job was the most likely cause of decedent\u2019s liver disease which was the principal cause of his death; and therefore, the incorrect history regarding exposure to infectious agents did not negate Doctor Silipo\u2019s opinion regarding industrial causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The board granted reconsideration, determined that applicants did not meet the burden of proving industrial causation, rescinded the WCJ\u2019s findings, and found no industrial causation. In its opinion on reconsideration, the board set forth excerpts from the death certificate, the autopsy report, and the reports of Drs. Silipo and O\u2019Neill, and then concluded: \u201cBased on our review of the record, including the foregoing, we are persuaded that applicant has not met the burden of establishing that decedent sustained an injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment which resulted in his death on August 31, 1982. The death is unexplained. There is no evidence of decedent\u2019s being exposed to any large amount of chemicals that would cause this kind of liver damage and death. Moreover, this record does not establish exposure to an infecting agent during-the relevant period. Accordingly, reconsideration will be granted to find that decedent\u2019s death is not compensable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Applicants had the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Wehr\u2019s death arose out of his employment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 514, 520 [179 Cal.Rptr. 605]; <em>O'Hare </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 629, 633 [112 P.2d 915].) \u201c \u2018Preponderance of the evidence\u2019 means such evidence as, when weighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>with that opposed to it, has more convincing force and the greater probability of truth.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5.) \u201cWhen weighing the evidence, the test is not the relative number of witnesses, but the relative convincing force of the evidence.\u201d (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Contrary to applicant\u2019s contention, the section 3202 rule of liberal construction in favor of the employee does not apply to the burden of proof required by section 3202.5. The Legislature expressly provided that \u201cNothing contained in Section 3202 shall be construed as relieving a party from meeting the evidentiary burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Even assuming, as asserted by applicants, that the burden of proof eases or shifts in cases involving death of an employee in mysterious circumstances (C<em>alifornia State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at pp. 517-519; see <em>Haft </em>v. <em>Lone Palm Hotel </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 756 [91 Cal.Rptr. 745, 478 P.2d 465]; <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 323 [187 Cal.Rptr. 869]), it was incumbent on applicant to at least produce prima facie evidence that Mr. Wehr\u2019s death arose out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Here, as the board concluded in determining that applicants failed to meet their burden of proof, there was simply no evidence of the cause of death itself, let alone evidence that the death was industrially related. All of the medical evidence, including the autopsy report, the amended death certificate, and the reports of both physicians, established that the cause of death was unknown and undetermined. Even Doctor Silipo conceded that the cause of death was unknown, undetermined, and problematical. Of the \u201cpossible\u201d causes of death suggested by Doctor Silipo, one was based on 'Doctor Silipo\u2019s incorrect assumption that Mr. Wehr had been exposed to infectious bacteria in the last week of his employment. As to the other suggested possibility, chemical exposure, there was no evidence that the products Mr. Wehr was exposed to contained the chemicals that could cause \u201cHepatic Effects.\u201d Moreover, when weighed with that opposed to it, Doctor Silipo\u2019s speculative opinion clearly lacked convincing force and probability of truth. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5.) The board did not err in determining that applicants did not meet their burden of proving industrial causation of Mr. Wehr\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Even if it were assumed that applicants met their burden of proof under an easing or shifting theory, the board\u2019s finding of no industrial causation is supported by substantial evidence.  The board, as ultimate trier of fact, clearly had the power to resolve conflicts in the evidence, make its own credibility determinations, and upon reconsideration to reject the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>WCJ\u2019s finding of industrial causation. <em>(Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451].) Granted that in making its own findings the board should resolve all reasonable doubts in favor of the employee in accordance with the section 3202 rule of liberal construction <em>(ibid.), </em>section 3202 \u201cauthorizes neither the creation of nonexistent evidence nor the creation of a conflict in the evidence which does not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>(Sully-Miller Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 916, 926 [166 Cal.Rptr. 111].)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Viewed in the light of the entire record <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 280-281 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978]; <em>Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 317), substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that Mr. Wehr did not sustain industrial injury resulting in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The board\u2019s order denying reconsideration is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Stone, P. J., and Gilbert, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 2, 1985, and petitioners\u2019 application for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 30, 1985. Bird, C. J., was of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Doctor Silipo concluded his report as follows: \u201cThe bottom line of this whole problem, as I see it, is as follows: [f] 1. He clearly had very significant liver disease. [1] 2. Chemicals and/or infection are common causes of such liver disease. [113. We know he was exposed to a great variety of chemicals at work, so much so, that Mr. Lascelles was actually \u2018somewhat surprised at the variety of products which these people use.\u2019 [1] 4. The man was working in and/or around a sewer and/or a cesspool one week prior to his death. There was no question he was exposed to significant viral and bacterial agents. [1] 5. By contrast, his personal habits and his home environment\u2014to the best of my knowledge\u2014are considered to be ideal and in a very marked contrast to potentially harmful agents which surrounded him at work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
