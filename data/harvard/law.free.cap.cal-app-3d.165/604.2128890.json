He contends: \u201cThe superior court erred in finding that the required warnings of possible consequences of appellant\u2019s guilty plea were sufficient under section 1016.5 of the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">On May 10, 1983, appellant entered a plea of guilty to possession of cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351). Through an interpreter, appellant was advised of and personally waived his rights to jury trial, confrontation and cross-examination, and of his privilege against self-incrimination. Additionally, appellant was admonished: \u201cMs. Wurthman [Deputy District Attorney]: If you are an alien, this plea could cause you to be excluded from the United States\u2014residency\u2014denied naturalization, or denied the right to re-enter the United States. [1] Do you understand that? The Defendant: Yes.\u201d Appellant was subsequently sentenced to state prison for a term of two years and that term of imprisonment has been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">On June 4, 1984, apparently in the face of deportation proceedings, appellant petitioned the trial court which accepted the original plea for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>of error <em>coram nobis, </em>asserting lack of compliance with Penal Code section 1016.5 because the word \u201cdeportation\u201d was not utilized in the admonition and he was unaware of these consequences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied the petition as follows: \u201cThe court being advised in the matter, having before it a copy of the transcript of the plea taken from this defendant on May 10, 1983, and in particular, starting at line 22 where the district attorney advised the defendant of the immigration consequences, the court finds that the law was complied with, ft] The defendant was properly advised, and stated that he understood those rights; and he was present in court with the district attorney; and also there was an interpreter, ft] The petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention is without merit. Appellant was advised that his \u201cplea could cause [him] to be excluded from the United States,\u201d and this admonition clearly constituted \u201can appropriate warning of the special consequences . . . which may result from the plea.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d); see also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 973, 982 [169 Cal.Rptr. 52]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lizarraga </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 815, 818-819 [118 Cal.Rptr. 208].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The order under review is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Roth, P. J., and Gates, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Penal Code section 1016.5, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cPrior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: [1] If you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
