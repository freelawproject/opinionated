J.</author>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The issue in this case is whether a telephone company and cable television company had to secure a private property owner\u2019s consent before cable television equipment was installed on a telephone pole situated on the telephone company\u2019s easement on the property. We find that no such consent was required as the cable equipment was within the scope of the easement which the telephone company apportioned to the cable company.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">Benjamin B. Salvaty and Marion R. Salvaty are appealing the dismissal of their second amended complaint after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrers of respondents Falcon Cable Television (Falcon) and Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (Pacific). Amici curiae briefs have been filed on Falcon\u2019s behalf by the California Cable Television Association and by Tele-Communications, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Appellants\u2019 second amended complaint contained causes of action for inverse condemnation, trespass, nuisance, unfair business practices as proscribed by Business and Professions Code section 17200, and false and fraudulent misrepresentation as proscribed by Business and Professions Code section 17500.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">According to the second amended complaint and the documents which were judicially noticed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the facts were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">Appellants reside and own a lot in the City of Alhambra. In 1926, when appellants\u2019 predecessors in interest conveyed the lot, they reserved \u201cunto themselves, their heirs and assigns, an easement over, across and upon the rear five (5) feet of the premises hereby conveyed, for the construction, operation, repair and maintenance thereon and thereover of a pole line for the stringing of telephone and electric light and power wires thereon; provided, however, the second parties may occupy and utilize the surface of said strip of land subject to said easement in a manner not inconsistent therewith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In 1979, Pacific and Falcon entered into a license agreement (pole attachment agreement) under which Pacific contracted to permit Falcon to place its equipment in or on Pacific\u2019s conduit system and telephone poles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement included a requirement that Falcon obtain from \u201cprivate owners of real property any and all permits, licenses or grants <em>necessary </em>for the lawful exercise of the permission granted by any application approved hereunder. ...\u201d (Italics added.) The agreement emphasized that Falcon\u2019s use of Pacific\u2019s equipment was only a license and would not create any ownership or property rights in that equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In 1980, the City of Alhambra awarded a franchise to Falcon to provide cable television services within the city limits. The franchise agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>contained a provision authorizing Falcon to install its equipment on any public street and on property rented or leased from other persons, including any public utility. The city also adopted an ordinance making it unlawful for any private property owner to interfere with a cable television company\u2019s access to the private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Pursuant to its agreement with Pacific and the franchise from the city, Falcon installed cable television equipment on appellants\u2019 property without seeking or obtaining appellants\u2019 consent. This lawsuit ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Pacific and Falcon have taken divergent positions both here and below. Pacific argues that it authorized Falcon to install the cables on surplus pole space but gave it no right to use the easement, and that Falcon should have obtained appellants\u2019 permission as the pole attachment agreement required it to obtain any necessary permission. Falcon contends that no permission was necessary because the cable attachment was within the scope of the easement. We question the logic of Pacific\u2019s position, but need not explore it as the correctness of Falcon\u2019s position justified the trial court\u2019s granting the demurrers of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In 1980, the Legislature enacted section 767.5 of the Public Utilities Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as emergency legislation to regulate the use by cable television cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>porations of surplus space on public utility poles and other equipment. Section 767.5, subdivision (b), is particularly pertinent: \u201c(b) The Legislature finds and declares that public utilities have dedicated a portion of such support structures to cable television corporations for pole attachments in that public utilities have made available, through a course of conduct covering many years, surplus space and excess capacity on and in their support structures for use by cable television corporations for pole attachments, and that the provision by such public utilities of surplus space and excess capacity for such pole attachments is a public utility service delivered by public utilities to cable television corporations, ft] The Legislature further finds and declares that it is in the interests of the people of California for public utilities to continue to make available such surplus space and excess capacity for use by cable television corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">As appellants point out, section 767.5 concerns relations between public utilities and cable television corporations and states nothing regarding private property owners. The section does, however, show a strong public policy in favor of encouraging the type of cable attachments involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Appellants argue strenuously that cable television equipment was not within the scope of the easement here, which provides only for \u201ca pole line for the stringing of telephone and electric light and power wires thereon. . . .\u201d <em>Faus </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 350, 355-358 [62 Cal.Rptr. 193, 431 P.2d 849], and <em>Norris </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 41, 47 [67 Cal.Rptr. 595], counsel to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In <em>Faus, </em>the grantors conveyed easements from 1901 to 1911 for public electric railway service. In 1955, public motor coach service was substituted pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission. The Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the change of use terminated the easement, stating: \u201cOur courts have been receptive to the contention that changed economic and technological conditions require reevaluation of restrictions placed upon the use of real property. ...\u201d <em>(Faus </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 355.) As the court analyzed the problem, the real issue was whether the use in a particular case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>consistent with the primary object of the grant. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 356-357.) \u201c[T]he sole and exclusive purpose [of the substitution] has merely been to up-date the transportation system so that a modem vehicular means of transport may be utilized in place of an outmoded one.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 358.) Given the public interest in improved transportation, the substitution was proper. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Similarly, in <em>Norris </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks., supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 41, an easement of lake front property had been granted in 1930 for highway purposes. The state built the highway. In 1964, the state began using a portion of the area for a vista point and roadside rest. <em>Norris </em>relied upon <em>Faus </em>in holding that these changes were not a surcharge of the easement \u201cbut a contemplated prospective modernization of a legitimate highway use.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 47-48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In the case at bench, the addition of cable television equipment on surplus space on the telephone pole was within the scope of the easement. Although the cable television industry did not exist at the time the easement was granted, it is part of the natural evolution of communications technology. Installation of the equipment was consistent with the primary goal of the easement, to provide for wire transmission of power and communication. We fail to see how the addition of cable equipment to a preexisting utility pole materially increased the burden on appellants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We are further persuaded by the reasoning of the New York court in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Capitol Cablevision System, Inc. </em>(1976) 52 App.Div.2d 313 [383 N.Y.S.2d 674], which has been cited to us by amicus California Cable Television Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In <em>Hoffman, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors had granted to a power company, a telephone company, and \u201c \u2018their respective successors and assigns\u2019 \u201d the right to construct and operate equipment \u201c \u2018for the distribution of electricity and messages upon, under, along or across the property which we own.\u2019 \u201d (383 N.Y.S.2d at p. 676.) The companies executed pole attachment agreements with a cable television system granting a license to install coaxial cables on existing utility poles. The agreements included a provision that any necessary authorizations be obtained from the landowner. The plaintiffs refused their permission and sought an injunction to prevent entry onto their land.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">In holding that the injunction was properly denied, <em>Hoffman </em>first found that the easements were in gross rather than appurtenant as they were independent of the ownership or possession of any specific property of the utilities. (383 N.Y.S.2d at p. 676.) This is equally true of the easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>here. (See 3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Real Property, \u00a7 341, p. 2041; Civ. Code, \u00a7 801; <em>City of Anaheim </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Cal. </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 763, 767 [147 Cal.Rptr. 336].)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The <em>Hoffman </em>decision continued: \u201cBecause the utilities did not divest themselves of all control over their easements in their agreements with defendant, the interest acquired by the latter cannot be considered an assignment, such as is specifically permitted by the original grant of the easements. The transactions must rather be considered as attempts by the utilities to apportion their easements (see 5 Restatement of the Law, Property, \u00a7 493). [t] Whether aii easement in gross is apportionable depends largely on whether it is viewed as exclusive as opposed to nonexclusive (5 Restatement of the Law, Property, \u00a7 493, subds. [c] and [d]). Although exclusive easements are not generally favored by our courts [citation], the very nature of the said 1954 easements obtained by the utilities indicates that they were intended to be exclusive vis-a-vis the grantor. There is no claim that plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor had, at the time the easements were granted, any authority for, any intention to seek authority for, or any interest whatsoever in \u2018the distribution of electricity and messages\u2019 via the said easements. Nor is there any indication that plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor or plaintiffs have at any time sought to treat the utility easements as non-exclusive by seeking to share with Niagara Mohawk or New York Telephone in \u2018the distribution of electricity and messages\u2019 by the easements.\u201d (383 N.Y.S.2d at p. 676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Similarly here, the easement is exclusive vis-a-vis appellants, who clearly have no interest in providing utility services, and cannot interfere with the easement owner\u2019s facilities. (See, e.g., <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Igna </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 338, 341 [25 Cal.Rptr. 247].) \u201cThough apportionability may be to the disadvantage of the possessor of the servient tenement, the fact that he is excluded from making the use authorized by the easement, plus the fact that apportionability increases the value of the easement to its owner, tends to the inference in the usual case that the easement was intended in its creation to be apportionable.\u201d (5 Rest., Property, \u00a7 493, com. [c], p. 3054.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In holding that the easement could properly be apportioned to the cable company, the <em>Hoffman </em>court was further influenced by the facts that the cable equipment would not impose an additional burden on the servient tenement; was consistent with the policy of broadly interpreting easements to meet progressive inventions; and that cable television rendered a valuable educational and public service. (383 N.Y.S.2d at pp. 677-678.) The same considerations apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Finally, the <em>Hoffman </em>court found that the language of the attachment agreement did not mean that the landowner\u2019s consent was required, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>agreement required only that necessary permission be obtained, and such permission was not necessary. (383 N.Y.S.2d at p. 678.) Again, the same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">A similar result was reached in <em>Jolliff </em>v. <em>Hardin Cable Television Co. </em>(1971) 26 Ohio St.2d 103 [55 Ohio Ops.2d 203, 269 N.E.2d 588]. The <em>Jolliff </em>court held that an easement granted to a power company \u201cfor the purpose of transmitting electric or other power, including telegraph or telephone wires,\u201d could be apportioned by the power company to permit attachment of a cable television company\u2019s equipment to the easement. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 590.) The <em>Jolliff </em>court found that \u201cattachment of a television coaxial cable, which is comprised of bound wires for transmitting high frequency electrical impulses, . . . constitutes no more of a burden than would the installation of telegraph and telephone wires.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Finally, we note that <em>Loretto </em>v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 419 [73 L.Ed.2d 868, 102 S.Ct. 3164], on which appellants rely, is clearly distinguishable from the case before us. <em>Loretto </em>held that a New York statute requiring a landlord to permit installation of cable television facilities upon his property amounted to a taking of private property for which compensation was due. Unlike the case at bench, there was no easement of any kind involved in <em>Loretto. </em>Here, we have an easement and the cable equipment was within the scope of that easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In light of our conclusion that the installation of Falcon\u2019s cable was proper, appellants have failed to state a cause of action under any of their theories. The demurrers were properly sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Arguelles, J., and Shumsky, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 15, 1985.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The trial court took judicial notice of two ordinances of the City of Alhambra and the pole attachment agreement between Pacific and Falcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Appellants argue that the pole attachment agreement was not a proper subject for judicial notice because there was no proof that it had been filed with the Public Utilities Commission, as required by section 489 of the Public Utilities Code and <em>Cal. Community Television Assn. </em>v. <em>Gen. Tel. &amp; So. Cal. Edison Co. </em>(1970) 71 Cal.P.U.C. 123, 129. It is true that the copies of the agreement proffered to the trial court were not certified. However, appellants referred repeatedly to the agreement throughout their complaint, and alleged on information and belief that it had been approved by the commission. The trial court was given no reason to believe otherwise. Given the references to the agreement in the complaint, Falcon and Pacific were entitled to present the trial court with the complete document.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Appellants\u2019 counsel states in a footnote in their brief that when he went to the local Public Utilities Commission office, the staff there were unable to locate information that the agreement had been filed. We decline to consider that information, which was not part of the record below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The complaint does not indicate how or when Pacific acquired the rights to the easement which had been reserved in 1926.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Public Utilities Code section 767.5 reads: \u201c(a) As used in this section: [1] (1) \u2018Public utility\u2019 includes any person, firm, or corporation, except a publicly owned public utility, which owns or controls, or in combination jointly owns or controls, support structures or rights-of-way used or useful, in whole or in part, for wire communication.
