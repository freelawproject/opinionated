Code, \u00a7 602) alleging that on June 9, 1983, 14-year-old Damon H. violated Penal Code sections 286, subdivision (c) (sodomy with a person under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger than he), and 288, subdivision (a) (lewd and lascivious act on child under 14 years of age). The court declared the minor a ward and placed him in a group home. On appeal, the minor contends the court erred by permitting the victim\u2019s mother to testify that the victim told her, \u201cDamon put his weenie in my butt.\u201d As we conclude the juvenile court properly admitted this evidence, we shall affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">At the jurisdictional hearing on July 7, 1983, it was stipulated that the victim, two-year, nine-month-old Colby, was incompetent to testify. Colby\u2019s mother testified she permitted Colby and his brother Jessie, age 4 years, 10 months,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to go on a bike ride one day with their neighbor Damon and his 12-year-old brother Vance. Colby rode on the back of Damon\u2019s bike to a corral area where they watched cows. The others followed on separate bikes. On the return trip Colby rode with Vance.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">When the boys arrived at Colby\u2019s house about 40 minutes later, Colby was crying and sobbing. Damon immediately explained to Colby\u2019s mother that Colby had fallen down while running and had cried all the way home. Colby\u2019s mother asked her son, \u201cWhat is the matter? Did you fall?\u201d Colby replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Several minutes later when his mother touched his buttocks while trying to pick Colby up, the two-year-old began crying very loudly and volunteered that his buttocks hurt. His mother then asked him why, to which Colby replied, \u201cBecause Damon put his weenie in my butt.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objection to this evidence as inadmissible hearsay was overruled, the court noting the statement fell within the spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240). Colby\u2019s mother went on to testify that prior to making this declaration Colby had never been exposed to sexual conduct of any sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Later in the day in question, Colby underwent a physical examination by Dr. David Walls, a physician in general practice. Dr. Walls testified Colby had four rectal lacerations and fresh blood in the same area. The doctor was of the opinion that Colby had been the victim of recent trauma, which was caused by a blunt, rather than sharp, instrument and not by a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Testifying in his own defense, Damon said that during the break in the bike ride at the corral he saw Colby fall and begin crying immediately. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Damon\u2019s brother Vance testified that he and Jessie were separated from Damon and Colby for a while during the bike ride. During that separation, Vance could see Damon for the whole time and Colby for at least part of it. Vance also stated he never saw Colby fall down that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\n<em>The Hearsay Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The minor first urges that Colby\u2019s out-of-court statement, \u201cDamon put his weenie in my butt,\u201d constituted inadmissible hearsay since it did not, as the court ruled, fall within the spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Evidence Code section 1240,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon which the court relied in overruling the minor\u2019s hearsay objection, provides as follows: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: [fl (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and [fl (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   This section permits admission of a spontaneous declaration notwithstanding the fact the declarant is too young to testify. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Orduno </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 738, 745 [145 Cal.Rptr. 806].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Colby\u2019s declaration satisfied subdivision (a) of section 1240 in that it described the assaultive conduct to which Damon had subjected Colby a short time earlier. As for the question posed by subdivision (b), whether Colby offered this description spontaneously, we deem it appropriate to review carefully the discernible sequence of events leading up to Colby\u2019s inculpatory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">We note preliminarily that he made the statement within 10 minutes of his return from a bike ride which lasted almost 40 minutes. The event that prompted Colby\u2019s excitement appears to have occurred about halfway through the bike ride since Colby\u2019s resultant crying caused the group to turn for home. When the group reached Colby\u2019s home, Damon explained to Colby\u2019s mother that the tearful child had cried \u201cthe whole ride home.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Colby apparently would not reveal his reason for crying to his mother, save denying he had fallen down during the ride. Assuming Colby was merely tired, his mother left him alone for the next \u201cminute or so.\u201d When she returned to find Colby still sobbing, she picked him up by placing one hand on his buttocks, whereupon Colby began crying loudly again. He shortly complained that his buttocks hurt. She carried him into a bedroom then asked him to explain why it hurt. Colby blamed Damon.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Although Colby was hesitant to explain his crying, this did not make his declaration any less spontaneous.  It is well settled that neither lapse of time between the relevant event and the declaration describing it nor the fact that the declaration was elicited by questioning deprives the statement of spontaneity if it nevertheless appears to have been made under the stress of excitement and while the declarant\u2019s reflective powers were still in abeyance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 1176 [81 Cal.Rptr. 5, 459 P.2d 259, 39 A.L.R.3d 541]; citations omitted.) \u201cIn making this difficult determination, the court must consider all of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 653, 661 [202 Cal.Rptr. 289].)  We are satisfied that for all of the bike ride home and until he made the declaration in dispute, Colby remained in an extremely excited state. As such, the court could reasonably have concluded his reflective powers, to the extent a child of two years and nine months may reflect under these circumstances, were held in abeyance throughout this critical period. The eventual declaration was, therefore, spontaneous under section 1240.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, Colby\u2019s statement was spontaneous in relation to its most immediate impetus, his mother\u2019s touching of his lacerated rectal area. By this act she caused her son pain and distress, which he immediately attributed to Damon\u2019s prior conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The determination that the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>facts exist to permit admission of a spontaneous declaration is vested in the trial court whose ruling should not be disturbed unless those facts are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 660). The court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>The Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\"> The minor next contends that, regardless of whether Colby\u2019s statement fell within any recognized hearsay exception, its admission violated his constitutional right to confront his chief accuser.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   The right of confrontation is not absolute <em>(Herbert </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 661, 667 [172 Cal.Rptr. 850, 19 A.L.R.4th 1276]) and not every statement made by a declarant not present at trial is required to be excluded, although the clause was intended to exclude some hearsay. <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 63 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 605-606, 100 S.Ct. 2531].) In considering the confrontation clause and hearsay evidence, the U.S. Supreme Court has said the focus of its concern \u201chas been to insure that there \u2018are indicia of reliability to \u2018afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u2019\u201d (Ma<em>ncusi </em>v. <em>Stubbs </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 204, 213 [33 L.Ed.2d 293, 301, 92 S.Ct. 2308].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The plurality opinion in <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1970) 400 U.S. 74 [27 L.Ed.2d 213, 91 S.Ct. 210], discussed four factors deemed relevant to reliability: (1) whether the hearsay statement contained an express assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>about past fact, (2) whether the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge about the subject of his statement was established by independent evidence, (3) whether there was a substantial possibility of faulty recollection, and (4) whether the statement was made under circumstances indicating its reliability. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 88-89 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 227].) In <em>Mancusi </em>v. <em>Stubbs, supra, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court said that \u201csome of these \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 referred to in Dutton\u201d must be present for the hearsay to be admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (408 U.S. 204 at p. 213 [33 L.Ed.2d at p. 302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">While it is, of course, true that admission of a statement may violate the confrontation clause even though it was admitted under a recognized hearsay exception <em>(People </em>v. <em>Orduno, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d 738 at p. 747, citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 149, 155-156 [26 L.Ed.2d 489, 495, 90 S.Ct. 1930]), no California case has suggested that admission of a spontaneous declaration is per se violative of the Confrontation Clause. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 747-748.) In fact, recently the U.S. Supreme Court, in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. 56, in acknowledging \u201c[t]he complexity of reconciling the Confrontation Clause and hearsay rules,\u201d held that the requisite reliability to satisfy the sixth amendment\u2019s requirements <em>\u201ccan be inferred without more . . . where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay excep</em>tion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 66 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 608], italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Under the facts of the instant case, we are satisfied defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by admission of Colby\u2019s spontaneous declaration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Applying the factors enumerated in <em>Dutton, </em>Colby\u2019s explicit de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>scription of the conduct to which Damon had subjected him a short time earlier clearly derived from the child\u2019s first-hand knowledge, thus making remote the possibility it was the product of faulty recollection. That Colby was in a position to acquire such knowledge is amply demonstrated by Damon\u2019s testimony, which placed Colby under his care during the entire bike ride. As noted <em>ante, </em>the spontaneous nature of the declaration is evident from the fact it followed immediately after a time of extreme and unwavering mental distress that all but nullified Colby\u2019s reflective powers. Additionally, we take notice of another indicium of this declaration\u2019s reliability, namely the lack of any evidence suggesting prior exposure of Colby to this or any sort of sexual conduct. In view of the foregoing circumstances, we hold Colby\u2019s statement was reliable. Application of the hearsay exception in the instant case rests upon a sufficiently solid foundation that admission of this evidence comports with the substance of the constitutional protection. (See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. 56, at p. 66 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, at pp. 607-608].) There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Evidence of Colby\u2019s spontaneous declaration, augmented by the testimony of Dr. Walls that Colby had been subjected to trauma by means of a blunt instrument, constitutes substantial evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The judgment (order sustaining the petition) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aun\">Evans, Acting P. J. and Carr, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-13\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\">It was also stipulated that Jessie was incompetent to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Hereinafter, all references to an unspecified code are to the Evidence Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\">\u201cThe theory underlying this exception is that the declarant\u2019s lack of opportunity for reflection and deliberate fabrication supply an adequate assurance of the statement\u2019s trustworthyness.\u201d <em>(Box </em>v. <em>California Date Growers Assn. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 266, 272 [129 Cal.Rptr. 146].

The statement was deemed inadmissible as it \u201cwas not a part of the <em>res gestae </em>but a declaration of a past event. . . . [T]o be within the rule of <em>res gestae </em>the \u2018declaration must be \u201cthe natural and spontaneous outgrowth of the act or assault,\u201d and not a mere narration of a past transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 670.) The enactment of section 1240 has created a rule which is not coterminous with the scope of res gestae. As Presiding Justice Gardner discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Orduno, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d 738, at p. 744, fn. 1: [1] \u201cOlder practitioners will remember the popularity of the phrase \u2018res gestae.\u2019 As Witkin says, (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) p. 517), \u2018The early cases used the phrase \u201cdeclarations part of the res gestae\u201d loosely to describe several sorts of admissible hearsay and nonhearsay statements including verbal acts and excited or spontaneous utterances.\u2019 However, the new Evidence Code, modem writers and modem courts have abandoned the use of this rather ill-defined phrase. Res gestae has now gone the way of the great auk, the passenger pigeon and high button shoes.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Colby\u2019s hearsay declaration identified the minor as his assailant. \u201cIt has long been . . .
