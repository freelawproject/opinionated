Fitzgerald, Jr., appeals from the summary judgment granted by the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas in favor of both defendants-appellees Claude L. Davis and Y. Jean Davis (\u201cDavises\u201d) and interve-nor-appellee West American Insurance Company (\u2018West American\u201d). Appellant raises two assignments of error asserting that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of both West American and the Davises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">In the underlying wrongful-death complaint against the Davises and their sixteen-year-old son, Chadd Davis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cChadd\u201d), appellant alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Chadd negligently shot and killed Fitzgerald, and that the Davises breached their duty to protect Fitzgerald by virtue of their voluntarily allowing Chadd to invite Fitzgerald into their home. Appellant also alleged that the Davises were negligent in owning, controlling and maintaining the gun that Chadd used to shoot Fitzgerald, in allowing Chadd access to the gun, and in supervising Chadd so as to prevent his negligent handling of the gun and accidental shooting of Fitzgerald, a foreseeable event. West American, the Davises\u2019 homeowners\u2019 insurer, intervened in the action, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration that it had no duty to defend Chadd or to indemnify Chadd against any judgment that might be rendered against him in favor of appellant, because Fitzgerald\u2019s death was expected or intended and its policy excluded bodily injury expected or intended by the insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>The record discloses that on December 14, 1993, while in the Davises\u2019 home, Chadd killed Fitzgerald by shooting him in the head three times with a .22-caliber revolver taken by Chadd from under the mattress of his parents\u2019 bed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a signed statement to the police,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chadd maintained that the initial shot to Fitzgerald\u2019s head occurred accidentally while the two were practicing dance steps in the kitchen. He explained that he cocked the hammer, and with his finger on the trigger, he and Fitzgerald \u201cbumped or something\u201d and \u201cthe gun went off while [Chadd] was in front of Fitzgerald.\u201d Fitzgerald fell, with a gunshot wound to his forehead. Chadd stated that he put the gun down and attempted to stop the bleeding with some paper towels. He then picked up the gun and shot Fitzgerald twice more in the head. When Chadd\u2019s eleven-year-old foster brother returned from school, he saw Fitzgerald\u2019s body and suggested that Chadd call the police. Chadd claimed that he was too frightened to do so and enlisted his brother\u2019s help in hiding Fitzgerald\u2019s body on the back porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The following day at school, Chadd told a friend, Bradley Dunn, that he had shot somebody in the head. That afternoon, when Dunn met Chadd at the Davises\u2019 home,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Chadd told him that he had argued with Fitzgerald about a set of hair clippers allegedly stolen by Fitzgerald, and that he shot Fitzgerald because he thought that he was going to punch him. Chadd also told another friend, Jeremy Ballew, that he shot Fitzgerald because he stole hair clippers. Chadd\u2019s mother testified that she noted after Fitzgerald\u2019s death that hair clippers were missing. Chadd and Dunn disposed of Fitzgerald\u2019s body by loading it into the trunk of Mr. Davis\u2019s automobile and dumping it at an undeveloped industrial park. Chadd paid Dunn for his help by giving him the watch he removed from Fitzgerald\u2019s wrist. At approximately 5:00 p.m. the following evening, a man walking his dog discovered Fitzgerald\u2019s body and summoned the police. Subsequently, Chadd was convicted of murdering Fitzgerald pursuant to R.C. 2903.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the movant has the initial burden to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining to be litigated, that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that it appears from the evidence, when viewed most strongly in the nonmovant\u2019s favor, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C). Once this burden is met, the nonmoving party has the reciprocal burden of producing evidence on the issues for which it bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 526 N.E.2d 798, 801; Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In her first assignment of error, appellant basically argues that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of West American because the insurer failed to demonstrate that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Chadd intended or expected to injure Fitzgerald. In its judgment entry, the trial court specifically declared that the injury to Fitzgerald was both expected and intended by Chadd, and therefore excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that an insurance company is under no obligation to its insured, or to others harmed by the actions of an insured, unless the conduct alleged of the insured falls within coverage of the policy. Coverage is provided if the conduct falls within the scope of coverage defined in the policy, and not within an exception thereto.\u201d <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 36, 665 N.E.2d 1115, 1117. The homeowners\u2019 policy at issue in this case provides personal liability insurance for bodily injury caused by an occurrence to which the policy applies. The policy defines an occurrence, in part, as an accident which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury. The policy also contains a provision excluding personal liability coverage for bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In <em>Physicians Ins. Co. v. Swanson </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 189, 569 N.E.2d 906, the court determined that, in order to prevail in a declaratory judgment action on the basis that bodily injury is expected or intended by the insured and, thus, excluded from coverage, the insurer must demonstrate that the injury itself was expected or intended. \u201cExpected or intended\u201d injury has been defined as \u201cspecifically intending] to cause the resulting harm or * * * substantially certain that such harm will occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 569 N.E.2d at 911, quoting <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Abernathy </em>(1984), 393 Mass. 81, 84, 469 N.E.2d 797, 799. The two words are in the disjunctive; thus, \u201c[i]f the harm is not intentional in the sense of being purposeful, it must, at the very least, be expected as \u2018substantially certain\u2019 to result.\u201d <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Roberts </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 532, 537, 624 N.E.2d 343, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In coming to its conclusion that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Chadd either intended or expected to injure Fitzgerald, the trial court considered, among other evidence, Chadd\u2019s murder conviction, deposition transcripts, and statements to the police. Although it only needed to find one of the two exclusionary factors to preclude coverage, the trial court correctly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to when the intent and the expectation of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Chadd was convicted of murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.02. Murder includes the culpable mental state that the perpetrator purposely caused the death of another. \u201cPurposely\u201d is defined as with a \u201cspecific intention to cause a certain result.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(A). In <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded that a conviction for aggravated murder was sufficient to establish the intent to injure because intent was an essential element of the crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court considered Chadd\u2019s murder conviction, for which intent was an essential element, as evidence that Chadd intended to injure Fitzgerald, <em>i.e., </em>to cause his death. In coming to its conclusion that Chadd intended to harm Fitzgerald, the trial court also considered the evidence that Chadd fired three shots at Fitzgerald\u2019s head at close range, that he paid Dunn for his assistance, and that he tried to cover up the killing. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The trial court also determined that Chadd expected to injure Fitzgerald, in part, based on Chadd\u2019s statement that he thought of the gun under his mother\u2019s mattress, retrieved it, cocked the hammer, placed his finger on the trigger, and danced around in proximity to and in front of Fitzgerald. He claimed the first shot was accidental, but offered no explanation for the subsequent shots. Chadd\u2019s mother and father both testified that they had told Chadd that guns were dangerous. His father testified that he had not trained Chadd in the use of firearms, but had let him shoot firearms in the air \u201ca couple of times.\u201d His father further testified that the .22-caliber revolver had no safety, that the trigger was \u201cnot an easy pull,\u201d and that \u201cyou would have to put pressure on it to really pull it.\u201d His mother also testified that she told Chadd she had the .22-caliber revolver for protection, and that he was not to go near it. She also testified that Chadd said the murder was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Under the facts of the case, the trial court determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact, that West American was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that it appeared from the evidence, when viewed most strongly in favor of appellant, that reasonable minds could only conclude that Chadd both expected and intended Fitzgerald\u2019s injury. We find no error and, thus, overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>In her second assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Davises. She argues that the Davises were negligent in allowing Chadd access to the gun and in failing to supervise adequately him so to prevent him from handling their gun. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Davises without providing its analysis for doing so. In the proceedings below, the Davises argued that the question of negligence should be determined based on premises liability. Appellant argued that negligent parental supervision was the appropriate theory. From our review of the transcript of the proceedings, it is obvious that the trial court considered the Davises\u2019 negligence pursuant to both premises liability and negligent parental supervision. Not being able to ascertain from its judgment entry, however, which analysis the court ultimately applied, we conclude that negligent parental supervision is the correct analysis, and that the court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of the Davises.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">First, we note that, at common law, parents are not ordinarily held liable for the tort of their child. <em>Huston v. Konieczny </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 214, 217, 556 N.E.2d 505, 509. Liability may arise, however, based upon the parents\u2019 conduct where the \u201cinjury committed by the child is the foreseeable consequence of the parent\u2019s negligent act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, in this case, any liability on behalf of the Davises results from their own alleged negligence in the control of their gun and the supervision of their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Ohio courts recognize three situations where parents\u2019 negligence results in liability in connection with the conduct of their child: (1) negligent entrustment of their child with \u201can instrumentality (such as a gun or car) which, because of the child\u2019s immaturity or lack of experience, may become a source of danger to others\u201d; (2) \u201cfailure to exercise reasonable control over the child when the parent knows, or should know, that injury to another is a probable consequence\u201d; and (3) consenting, sanctioning, or directing a child\u2019s known wrongdoing. <em>Huston v. Konieczny, 52 </em>Ohio St.3d at 217-218, 556 N.E.2d at 509. See, also, Annotation, Liability of Person Permitting Child to Have Gun, or Leaving Gun Accessible to Child, for Injury Inflicted by the Latter (1959), 68 A.L.R.2d 782; Annotation, Parents\u2019 Liability for Injury or Damage Intentionally Inflicted by Minor Child (1974), 54 A.L.R.3d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In order to overcome a properly supported motion for summary judgment on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must identify a duty owed him by the defendant. <em>Keister v. Park Centre Lanes </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 19, 3 OBR 20, 443 N.E.2d 532. \u201cThe existence of a duty in a negligence action is a question of law,\u201d <em>Mussivand v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265, 270, and depends on the foreseeability of the injury. <em>Huston v. Konieczny, </em>52 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>at 217, 556 N.E.2d at 508. \u201cInjury is foreseeable if a defendant knew or should have known that his act was likely to result in harm to someone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">It is the first two situations delineated in <em>Huston v. Konieczny </em>that are arguably applicable, to this case. \u201cParents of minor children have a duty to exercise reasonable control over their children in order to prevent harm to third persons, when the parents have the ability to control the child and they know, or should know, that injury to another is a probable consequence.\u201d <em>Haefele v. Phillips </em>(Apr. 23, 1991), Franklin App. No. 90AP-1331, unreported, 1991 WL 64896, citing <em>Huston v. Konieczny. </em>In other words, the duty is to exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable injury to others. <em>Haefele v. Phillips, supra. </em>\u201cTo establish foreseeability of the act or injury [pursuant to negligent supervision], plaintiff must prove that specific instances of prior conduct were sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that the act complained of was likely to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, whether the Davises owed Fitzgerald a duty turns on whether a reasonably prudent person would have been put on notice by Chadd\u2019s prior acts that it was likely that he would injure Fitzgerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Negligent entrustment of a gun includes not only presenting the gun to a child, but also having a gun accessible to a child. <em>McGinnis v. Kinkaid, </em>(1981), 1 Ohio App.3d 4, 9, 1 OBR 45, 49-50, 437 N.E.2d 313, 318. Neither party argues that a gun is not a dangerous instrumentality. We are unwilling to adopt the doctrine that the owner of a gun \u201cshould be held absolutely liable for any injury that occurs when he permits or leaves the firearm accessible to children.\u201d See <em>Bilicic v. Brake </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 304, 309, 581 N.E.2d 586, 589. Likewise, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that a gun being accessible to a sixteen-year-old always constitutes a danger to others. Thus, the query is whether a parent knows or should know that because of the child\u2019s age, judgment, or experience, the gun may become a source of danger to others. See <em>McGinnis v. Kinkaid, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The following facts are undisputed. The Davises left a loaded .22-caliber revolver between the mattress and box springs of their bed. The gun had been loaded by Mr. Davis and placed under the mattress by Mrs. Davis for her protection while Mr. Davis was out of town in August 1993. Ordinarily, the loaded gun would have been replaced in a locked safe in the Davises\u2019 closet, but they forgot to do so. Mrs. Davis had informed Chadd that the gun was under her mattress for her protection and warned him not to touch it. Neither parent had provided him training, although Chadd had shot a gun before under his father\u2019s supervision. Both parents warned Chadd that firearms were dangerous, could harm someone, and should not be pointed at anyone. Chadd had access to the Davises\u2019 bedroom, but neither parent knew that Chadd had previously taken the firearm out of their bedroom to show his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Chadd had been a good student until a point in his junior-high-school years. He had one appearance in juvenile court concerning his acceptance of a stolen jacket from another boy in trade for his own. According to his mother, Chadd was absolved of any wrongdoing. He attended a private Christian school for a short time when his grades began to founder. His mother withdrew him when another student alleged that Chadd and another student were passing what appeared to be marijuana between themselves. The alleged marijuana was never found. Mrs. Davis reported that Chadd displayed no behavioral problems, and did not fight or otherwise engage in violence. Worried about his grades, she consulted his school counselor about seeking additional counseling, but was told that he was \u201cjust a teenage boy\u201d and would eventually get focused again.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Chadd would arrive home approximately three hours before his father each week night and would supervise his foster brothers. He would call his mother upon arriving home as he had been requested to do. The parents knew that Chadd disobeyed the house rule not to allow children in the house when they were not at home, because neighbors would tell them about such visits or they would find items broken from the children\u2019s \u201croughhousing.\u201d They would discipline Chadd for breaking the rule by revoking privileges. He would accept the punishment after trying to talk his parents out of it. The Davises knew that Chadd had taken Mrs. Davis\u2019s car keys from her bedroom dresser, and that Chadd and his friends drove her car without her permission and without having a license or permit. When Mrs. Davis discovered that this had been occurring, she corporally punished Chadd.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Accordingly, based on the foregoing undisputed facts, we hold, as a matter of law, that Fitzgerald\u2019s injuries were not foreseeable in that the cited specific instances of prior conduct were insufficient either to put a reasonable person on notice that Chadd was likely to shoot Fitzgerald or to show that the Davises knew or should have known that because of Chadd\u2019s age, judgment, or experience the gun could become a source of danger to others. Therefore, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b850-9\">Doan, P.J., Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\">. The separate entries granting summary judgment in favor of the Davises and West American contain language consistent with Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-11\">. Chadd is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-12\">. Neither appellant nor West American raises the issue of an insurer\u2019s duty to defend being separate from its duty to indemnify an insured. See <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118; <em>Four-O Corp. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(Feb. 13, 1991), Hamilton App. No. C-890831, unreported, 1991 WL 17216. Instead, both parties argue the applicability of the \"expected or intended\u201d exclusion to the facts of this case without distinction being made as to the two duties. Chadd, the person to whom the duty to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>may be owed, in the context of the applicable summary-judgment motions, is not a party to this appeal. Thus, we will not discuss the duties separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">.
