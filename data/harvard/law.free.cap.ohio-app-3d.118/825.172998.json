Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">This appeal is brought by defendant-appellant Dale M. Walters from a judgment of the Sidney Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">On January 9,1996, Walters was stopped after the officer observed him driving erratically. The officer conducted a field test and arrested Walters for driving under the influence of alcohol. Walters refused a chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">On April 30,1996, this case was heard before a jury. On May 2,1996, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Walters filed his notice of appeal on May 30, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">Walters makes the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-18\">\u201cThe trial court erred in not taking corrective action when the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in her cross-examination of Walters concerning witnesses not called, including suggestions of what that potential testimony might have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-19\">\u201cThe trial court erred in not taking corrective action when the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by arguing that Walters\u2019 failure to call witnesses was because that testimony would have been unfavorable to him without a basis in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>evidence for that argument, in expressing a personal opinion that Walters was guilty, in expressing a personal opinion on the credibility of the witnesses, and in making statements concerning Walters\u2019 state of sobriety not based on the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">App. R. 18(C) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">\u201cIf an appellee fails to file his brief within the time provided by this rule, or within the time as extended, he will not be heard at oral argument * * * and in determining the appeal, the court may accept the appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Here, the state has failed to file a brief. We are accepting Walters\u2019s statement of facts and issues as correct pursuant to App. R. 18(C). Upon a reading of the brief, Walters\u2019s argument reasonably supports a reversal. Therefore, we do not address the individual assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The judgment of the Sidney Municipal Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b862-10\">Shaw, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b862-11\">Hadley, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b862-12\">Hadley, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">I concur with the majority opinion for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">Appellant Dale M. Walters appeals from his conviction of driving under the influence. After a jury trial, appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of ninety days\u2019 imprisonment, with forty-five days suspended, and assessed a $750 fine plus court costs. Execution of his sentence was stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">On January 9, 1996, appellant went to dinner with some friends and drank . three beers while there. After dinner, appellant left for work a few hours later and stopped at a house to see if an employee scheduled to work the second shift was there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No one answered the door and appellant was asked to leave by a police officer who appeared shortly after appellant\u2019s arrival at the house. Appellant left the neighborhood and began traveling to his job. En route to his job, appellant was stopped for erratic driving in the parking lot of his job site. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Pursuant to his stop, appellant performed a field test and was subsequently arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Appellant was then taken to a police station, where he refused a chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On April 30 and May 2, 1996, appellant was tried before a jury, and a guilty verdict was returned. At his trial, the prosecutor questioned appellant about possible witnesses not called by either party during her cross-examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecutor repeatedly asked appellant why certain people were not called to testify on his behalf<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and implied in her questions that he did not call them to testify because they knew that he was drunk that night. Appellant\u2019s counsel made numerous objections to this line of questioning and was overruled repeatedly by the trial court. A motion to strike all of the questions and answers was again made prior to closing argument, as well as a motion to admonish the jury. Again, the trial court overruled the objection and denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Additionally, appellant\u2019s attorney moved that the prosecution not be allowed to argue the failure of appellant to call witnesses or speculate as to what their potential testimony would be. That motion was also overruled. The trial court further rejected jury instructions concerning the failure to call witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the defense did not call these witnesses because they knew he was drunk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, she expressed her opinion as to appellant\u2019s physical state on the night he was arrested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Again, appellant\u2019s counsel repeatedly objected during the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">At the conclusion of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, all defense motions were renewed and subsequently overruled in their entirety by the trial judge. After deliberations, the jury found appellant guilty of driving under the influence, a violation of R.C. 4511.191.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Appellant claims that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced by the prosecutor committing misconduct coupled with the failure of the court to take remedial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, appellant asserts the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\u201cThe prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct in her cross-examination of the defendant with respect to witnesses not called, including suggestions of what said witnesses <em>may </em>testify to if called, and the lower court erred in not sustaining objections and taking other appropriate corrective action with respect to said misconduct and in refusing to instruct the jury to disregard said improper questions and suggestions.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\u201cThe prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct in arguing that, the failure of defendant to call witnesses was because such witnesses would be unfavorable to him and in speculating what the testimony of the uncalled witnesses would have'been if they had been called and in making improper and unfounded comments about defendant\u2019s state of sobriety not based on the evidence and in expressing her opinion that the defendant was guilty and in expressing her personal belief as to the credibility of witnesses, and the lower court erred in not sustaining objections and taking other appropriate corrective action with respect to said misconduct and in refusing to instruct the jury to disregard said improper argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Because both of these assignments of error are so closely related, they are addressed simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The Supreme Court of Ohio stated the standard of review relative to prosecuto-rial misconduct in <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 OBR 379, 402, 473 N.E.2d 768, 792-793:</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">\u201cOhio courts have suggested that the effect of counsel\u2019s misconduct \u2018must be considered in the light of the whole case.\u2019 See, <em>e.g., Mikula v. Balogh </em>(1965), 9 Ohio App.2d 250, 258 [38 O.O.2d 311, 315, 224 N.E.2d 148, 155]. And where misconduct of counsel \u2018 * * * is of such a prejudicial character that the prejudice resulting therefrom cannot be eliminated or cured by prompt withdrawal, and admonition and instructions from the court of the jury to disregard it, a new trial should be granted, or the judgment reversed, notwithstanding cautions, admonition, and instructions by the trial judge.\u2019 <em>Book v. Erskine &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1951), 154 Ohio St. 391, 401 [43 O.O. 334, 338-339, 96 N.E.2d 289, 294].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">Moreover, absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s determination of whether a prosecutor has gone beyond the bounds permitted. <em>Pang v. Minch </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 194, 559 N.E.2d 1313, 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Appellant initially contends that the prosecutor erred in questioning him about potential witnesses that were not called and further implying that had they been called, they would have testified that appellant was drunk that night. Specifically, appellant cites the following line of questioning as being prejudicial to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">\u201cQ. Okay. And didn\u2019t she call and complain about you because you were drunk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know the extent of her conversation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">During a trial, an attorney may not present information that is not in evidence to a jury under the pretext of asking questions. See <em>State v. Hunt </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 372, 375-376, 646 N.E.2d 889, 890-892; 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (2 Ed.1980 and 1986 Supp.) 3.91, Standard 3-5.9. Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">\u201cIt is indisputable that at the trial level it is highly improper for a lawyer to refer in colloquy, argument, or other context to factual matter beyond the scope of the evidence or the range of judicial notice. This is true whether the case is being tried to a court or a jury * * <em>State v. Daugherty </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 91, 92-93, 534 N.E.2d 888, 890.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">By referring to the alleged belief of a person who had not been called to testify, the prosecutor in this case was attempting to introduce testimony that was not supported by admissible evidence. While an attorney\u2019s lack of familiarity with the Rules of Evidence may affect the question of whether misconduct was intentional or inadvertent, ignorance of the Rules of Evidence does not render questioning allowable where it would be otherwise improper. <em>State v. Smidi </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 177, 183, 623 N.E.2d 655, 658-659. Therefore, the trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s objections to questions that were asked of appellant that were not supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Appellant further maintains that the prosecutor again committed misconduct during her closing argument. The standard for prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments was set out in <em>State v. Braxton </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 28, 41, 656 N.E.2d 970, 978-979:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">\u201cThe test regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant. * * * In making this determination, an appellate court should consider several factors: (1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Furthermore, the closing argument is considered in its entirety to determine whether it was prejudicial. <em>State v. Moritz </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 150, 157, 17 O.O.3d 92, 96-97, 407 N.E.2d 1268, 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Specifically focusing on the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument, it is noted that the following remarks were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\u201cHe calls her from the car phone and he still, she still wasn\u2019t answering the door. Why? Because something was going on with this man. He wasn\u2019t acting right. I venture to guess that he was drunk. If he wasn\u2019t, why wouldn\u2019t he call her as a witness? * * * Sara Martin could have testified to that or does he put anyone else to generate [sic ] supposedly that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">\u201cWhere were they to testify? I venture to guess that his other friends, when he stopped snowblowing there at DAP, they saw him. They could have testified. They were supposed to be his friends and they weren\u2019t. He didn\u2019t call them to testify. Where\u2019s all the people at C &amp; C that saw him out there? * * * Where are they? Why didn\u2019t he put them on? * * * They\u2019re not here. * * * He knows he\u2019s drunk. Everybody he saw that night knew he was drunk and that\u2019s why th\u00e9y\u2019re not here today. * * * Why aren\u2019t they in here? We found out about it on direct examinations. Ask the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Throughout this argument, appellant\u2019s attorney made repeated objections which were, in turn, overruled by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Generally, sustaining or overruling objections during closing argument is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Montes </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 539, 551, 636 N.E.2d 378, 385-386. Rulings on such objections, therefore, will be reversed only upon a clear showing that the trial court abused that discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">Although prosecutors have wide latitude to comment in closing argument, they cannot intentionally mislead the jury by means of improper remarks or insinuations. Specifically, the prosecutor must avoid expressing personal beliefs or opinions as to a defendant\u2019s guilt and should refrain from commenting upon matters that are not in evidence or drawing inferences that are not supported by the evidence. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 318-319, 470 N.E.2d 883, 885. Moreover, during closing arguments, \u201cit is improper for counsel to * * * make statements which are intended to get evidence before the jury which counsel was not entitled to have the jury consider.\u201d <em>Drake v. Caterpillar Tractor Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 346, 347, 15 OBR 468, 470, 474 N.E.2d 291, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">In reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s closing rebuttal argument in appellant\u2019s case, I find that the prosecutor not only expressed her opinion as to appellant\u2019s guilt,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>she also made several statements that were not supported by the evidence concerning why appellant did not call certain witnesses to testify on his behalf. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s objections during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">However, misconduct of a prosecutor at trial will not be considered the sole grounds for reversal unless that conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. In making that determination, an appellate court must look at the evidence notwithstanding the improper conduct in deciding whether the error is harmless or not. See <em>State v. Byrd </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 79, 512 N.E.2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">A finding of harmless error requires a reviewing court to conclude that the jury would have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt absent the prosecutor\u2019s comments. <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d at 15, 14 OBR at 319, 470 N.E.2d at 885. In the present case, the trial court never admonished the prosecutor nor gave any instructions to the jury to disregard any potential prejudice that might have arisen as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s actions during the trial. Therefore, I cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would have found defendant guilty had there been no misconduct on the part of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the appellant\u2019s two assignments of error are well taken. In accordance with this opinion, I concur that appellant\u2019s conviction should be overturned and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-16\">. The house belonged to that employee\u2019s girlfriend, Sara Martin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\">. Both parties were required to disclose witnesses fourteen days before trial pursuant to an order by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-11\">. Among those potential witnesses appellant was questioned about were the people he had had dinner with earlier that evening, potential employees who may have observed appellant's arrest, and a girlfriend of one of appellant's employees whom appellant had visited earlier that evening.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b863-12\">. Specifically the prosecutor stated: \u201cEverybody he saw that night knew he was drunk and that's why they're not here today.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b863-13\">.
