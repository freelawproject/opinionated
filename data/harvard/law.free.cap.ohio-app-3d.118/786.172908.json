The trial court ruled that prejudgment interest is subject to postjudgment interest and is merged with the underlying damage award for purposes of postjudgment interest. The appellant appeals the trial court\u2019s ruling and assigns the following error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting plaintiff-appellee\u2019s request for \u2018postjudgment interest on prejudgment interest,\u2019 in violation to R.C. 1343.03.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">After viewing the record and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the trial court is correct. Here, appellee was awarded $2,486,933.86 for appellant\u2019s negligence. Thereafter, the trial court awarded him $964,793.87 in prejudgment interest. He then moved to merge the two awards and have postjudgment interest calculated thereon. The trial court granted his motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">We conclude that postjudgment interest may be calculated on prejudgment interest and that postjudgment interest on prejudgment interest is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>compounded interest. When interest is in fact a part of the debt owed, awarding interest upon the interest that is a part of the debt is not compounded interest. <em>Singer v. Celina Group </em>(May 30, 1995), Stark App. No. 0333, unreported, 1995 WL 495427 (relying on <em>Anketel v. Converse </em>[1866], 17 Ohio St. 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><em>Singer </em>also held that prejudgment interest shall be merged with the underlying damage award for purposes of postjudgment interest. Because prejudgment interest is a part of the judgment and like all other components is merged into a single judgment, we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision. See <em>Quality Engineered Installation, Inc. v. Higley S., Inc. </em>(Fla.1996), 670 So.2d 929 (prejudgment interest becomes a part of a single total sum adjudged to be due and owing, with postjudgment interest then accruing on the merged total).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assigned error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b824-8\">Patricia Ann Blackmon, Nahra, and Spellacy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
