This court consolidated the appeals <em>sua sponte </em>on October 1, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">The appellants each challenge the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court\u2019s June 17,1996 decision and order granting appellee Emanuel Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and overruling the appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">Appellant Tomkins Industries (\u201cTomkins\u201d) advances three assignments of error in case No. CA-16025. First, Tomkins contends that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to decide Hudson\u2019s appeal from an Industrial Commission order. Consequently, Tomkins argues that the trial court should have granted its motion to dismiss. Next, Tomkins claims that the trial court lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>jurisdiction to vacate an Industrial Commission order denying Hudson additional partial disability compensation. Finally, Tomkins asserts that the trial court erred by granting Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and the Industrial Commission of Ohio advance two assignments of error in case No. CA-16029. The administrator and the Industrial Commission first contend that the trial court erred by overruling their motion to dismiss. Next, they claim that the trial court erred by granting Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The two consolidated appeals stem from a work-related injury Hudson sustained on November 5, 1993. Following his injury, Hudson filed an application for compensation and medical benefits with the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. The bureau allowed Hudson\u2019s claim for \u201camputation of left index, middle and ring fingers.\u201d Thereafter, on June 30, 1994, Hudson filed a motion with the bureau seeking additional compensation pursuant to R.C. 4123.57(B) for the loss of use of his left hand. In relevant part, R.C. 4123.57(B), which discusses the computation of benefits for partial disabilities, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\u201cIf the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more fingers by amputation or ankylosis and the nature of his employment in the course of which the claimant was working at the time of the injury or occupational disease is such that the handicap or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal handicap or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact into consideration and increase the award of compensation accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of compensation for loss of a hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation denied Hudson\u2019s R.C. 4123.57(B) request for additional compensation in an August 29, 1994 order. Hudson subsequently appealed that ruling to the Industrial Commission. On October 21, 1994, a district hearing officer granted Hudson\u2019s motion for \u201can award for the loss of use of the left hand.\u201d In his order granting additional compensation, the hearing officer explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201cIt is the finding of the Hearing Officer that this claim has been previously allowed for AMPUTATION OF LEFT INDEX, MIDDLE AND [RING] FINGERS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">\u201cThe claimant\u2019s motion filed 6-30-94 requesting an award for the loss of use of the left hand is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">\u201cThe District Hearing officer finds that the claimant has had his left index, middle and ring fingers amputated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">\u201cFurther, the District Hearing Officer finds that this loss has resulted in a handicap greater than that which would normally be expected because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>claimant has been precluded from returning to his former position of employment. Therefore, the claimant is granted an award for the loss of use of the left hand pursuant to O.R.C. 4123.57(B). * * * The claimant\u2019s prior award for the amputation of his left index, middle and ring fingers is to be subtracted from this award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Tomkins appealed the foregoing ruling to an Industrial Commission staff hearing officer on November 1, 1994. The staff hearing officer subsequently denied Tomkins\u2019s appeal on November 28, 1994, stating, \u201cIt is the finding and order of the Staff Hearing Officer that the employer\u2019s appeal be denied, and the finding and order of the District Hearing Officer be affirmed for the reason that it is supported by proof of record and is not contrary to law.\u201d Tomkins then filed another timely appeal to the Industrial Commission on December 8, 1994, challenging the staff hearing officer\u2019s ruling. The commission issued an order refusing to hear Tomkins\u2019s appeal on December 16, 1994. Thereafter, Tomkins filed a request for reconsideration, asking the Industrial Commission to reconsider the December 16, 1994 ruling. The Industrial Commission granted Tomkins\u2019s request for reconsideration on May 9, 1995, and vacated the order denying Tomkins\u2019s appeal. In its order accepting the matter on appeal, the Industrial Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cAfter publication of this order, the file is referred to Legal Services to docket before the Members of the Industrial Commission. The issue to be heard is the Employer\u2019s Appeal filed December 8, 1994, from the order of the Staff Hearing Officer dated November 28, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\u201cThe decision is based on the possibility of an error in the previous Industrial Commission order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The Industrial Commission then held a June 20, 1995 hearing on Tomkins\u2019s appeal. In its findings of fact and order, the commission stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u201cIt is the finding of the Industrial Commission that this claim has been previously allowed for: \u2018amputation of left index, middle and ring fingers.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">\u201c6-27-95 \u2014 After further review and discussion, it is the order of the Industrial Commission that the employer\u2019s appeal filed on 12-8-94 be granted and that the Staff Hearing Officer order of 11-28-94 be vacated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">\u201cIt is the decision of the Industrial Commission that the claimant is not entitled to an additional award under R.C. 4123.57(B) for loss of use of the left hand. Although the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more fingers by amputation, the claimant is not entitled to compensation that \u2018shall not exceed the amount of compensation for loss of a hand\u2019 under R.C. 4123.57(B), because he has failed to demonstrate that the handicap or disability resulting from the loss of the fingers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>exceeds the normal handicap or disability resulting from the loss of such fingers due to the nature of claimant\u2019s employment in the course of which he was working at the time of the injury. * * * Based upon a review of claimant\u2019s job duties on the date of injury, the videotape evidence, and the report of Dr. Cunningham, the Commission finds that claimant is able to return to his former position of employment as a punch press operator. The Commission also finds that the employer offered the claimant his former position of employment with some modifications to ease his return to work. As such, claimant\u2019s handicap or disability does not exceed the normal handicap or disability due to the nature of his employment as a punch press operator and the claimant, therefore, is not entitled to an award for loss of use of his left hand pursuant to R.C. 4123.57(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Appellee Hudson subsequently filed a complaint appealing the foregoing ruling to the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. In response, the appellants filed motions to dismiss Hudson\u2019s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Hudson opposed the appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss and moved for summary judgment. In support of his summary judgment motion, Hudson argued that the Industrial Commission lacked continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52 to reconsider its prior order and ultimately vacate his award of additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In its ruling on the parties\u2019 motions, the trial court identified the critical issues as (1) whether the trial court possessed subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Hudson\u2019s appeal from the Industrial Commission\u2019s ruling and, if so, (2) whether the Industrial Commission possessed continuing jurisdiction to reconsider its prior order and vacate Hudson\u2019s award of additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Addressing the first issue \u2014 its own jurisdiction to hear Hudson\u2019s appeal \u2014 the trial court correctly recognized that Industrial Commission orders concerning the extent of a claimant\u2019s disability are not appealable to a common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 (formerly numbered 4123.519). <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175. Furthermore, the trial court correctly recognized that the only decisions a common pleas court may review pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 are Industrial Commission decisions involving a claimant\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 584 N.E.2d at 1178-1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In the present case, however, the trial court rejected the appellants\u2019 characterization of Hudson\u2019s appeal as raising an \u201cextent of disability\u201d issue. The trial court explained that Hudson was not challenging the Industrial Commission\u2019s determination regarding the extent of his disability. Instead, the trial court concluded, Hudson\u2019s appeal challenged the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction, pursuant to R.C. 4123.52, \u201cto hear and to re-hear the appeal of the staff hearing officer\u2019s decision.\u201d Additionally, the trial court reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Hudson\u2019s appeal \u201cfundamentally revolves around the claimant\u2019s right to continue to participate in the State Insurance Fund.\u201d Finally, relying upon <em>State ex rel. Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 277, 586 N.E.2d 1077, the trial court accepted Hudson\u2019s argument that challenges to the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction must be raised by appeal to the common pleas court rather than through mandamus. Consequently, the trial court concluded that R.C. 4123.512 granted it jurisdiction to hear Hudson\u2019s appeal, and the court denied the appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The trial court then addressed Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. First, the court noted that the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 4123.52 to reconsider a prior order is limited to cases involving changed circumstances, fraud, or clerical error. The trial court found none of these factors present in Hudson\u2019s case. The trial court also concluded that the Industrial Commission failed to follow its own administrative standards. Specifically, the trial court ruled that the commission violated Resolutions 94-1-6 and 92-1-3. The former provision provides that the \u201cIndustrial Commission will permit appeals to be heard from orders of Staff Hearing Officers\u201d in cases involving fraud, newly discovered evidence, unusual questions, or when the commission desires to set policy. Similarly, Resolution 92-1-3 provides that the Industrial Commission shall review requests for reconsideration by using the following criteria: (1) newly discovered evidence, (2) mistake of fact or law, or (3) unusual legal, medical, or factual problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The trial court then found the Industrial Commission\u2019s reason for granting reconsideration (\u201cthe possibility of an error in the previous Industrial Commission\u2019s order\u201d) outside the criteria established by the Revised Code and the commission\u2019s own regulations. Finally, the trial court ruled that the Industrial Commission also failed to utilize the administrative appeal process pursuant to R.C. 4123.511. For these reasons, the court granted Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and reinstated the district hearing officer\u2019s order for additional compensation. The appellants subsequently filed timely appeals from the trial court\u2019s June 17, 1996 decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In its first two assignments of error, Tomkins contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to review the Industrial Commission\u2019s order. Likewise, in their first assignment of error, the Administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and the Industrial Commission also contend that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear Hudson\u2019s appeal. The appellants each contend that mandamus, rather than an appeal to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, was the proper method to challenge the Industrial Commission\u2019s ruling. Consequently, the appellants claim that the trial court erred by overruling their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>motions to dismiss Hudson\u2019s appeal. Given the substantial similarity of these assignments of error, we will combine them for our appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In essence, the appellants each contend that the Industrial Commission\u2019s ruling related to the extent of Hudson\u2019s disability. They properly note, as did the trial court, that such decisions are not appealable to a common pleas court. <em>Afrates, supra; Felty v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 602 N.E.2d 1141; <em>State ex rel. Kroger Co. v. Stover </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 229, 31 OBR 436, 510 N.E.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">As the Ohio Supreme Court explained in <em>Felty, </em>\u201cThe only decisions of the commission that may be appealed to the courts of common pleas under R.C. 4123.519 [now 4123.512] are those that are final and that resolve an employee\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the State Insurance Fund.\u201d <em>Felty, supra, </em>at 238, 602 N.E.2d at 1145. Furthermore, the court noted that \u201c[a] decision by the commission determines the employee\u2019s right to participate if it finalizes the allowance or disallowance of an employee\u2019s \u2018claim.\u2019 The <em>only </em>action by the commission that is appealable under R.C. 4123.519 is this essential decision to grant, to deny, or to terminate the employee\u2019s participation or continued participation in the system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 239, 602 N.E.2d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Notwithstanding this clear rule, the trial court accepted Hudson\u2019s argument that his appeal did not challenge the Industrial Commission\u2019s substantive decision concerning the <em>extent </em>of his disability. Rather, the trial court concluded that Hudson\u2019s appeal challenged the Industrial Commission\u2019s <em>continuing jurisdiction </em>to render its decision. The trial court then ruled that challenges to the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction must be appealed to the court of common pleas rather than through mandamus. In support of its decision, the trial court relied upon <em>State ex rel. Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 277, 586 N.E.2d 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">In <em>Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, </em>the claimant had suffered a work-related injury and received compensation and medical benefits under Ohio workers\u2019 compensation laws. More than ten years after he received the last compensation on his claim, the worker sought temporary total disability compensation. The Industrial Commission ultimately affirmed a staff hearing officer\u2019s decision granting the temporary total disability benefits. Appellant Superior\u2019s Brand Meats subsequently brought an original action in mandamus in the court of appeals, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Industrial Commission had lost continuing jurisdiction over the claim because of the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Franklin County Court of Appeals, however, found the issue of the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction not properly before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>because such a question must be resolved through an appeal to the court of common pleas rather than through mandamus. The Ohio Supreme Court agreed, stating: \u201cSuch a determination of whether the statute of limitations governing R.C. 4123.56, 4123.57 and 4123.58 had run would be one concerning the claimant\u2019s right to participate in the State Insurance Fund rather than one as to the extent of disability and, as such, would be appealable to the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.519. * * * A decision by the commission upon the question of its continuing jurisdiction, being appealable, may not be presented to an appellate court by way of an original action such as mandamus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 586 N.E.2d at 1080, citing <em>State ex rel. Consolidation Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 281, 284, 18 OBR 333, 335-336, 480 N.E.2d 807, 809-810.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In light of the foregoing language, the trial court concluded that Hudson properly challenged the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction by appealing to the common pleas court. Consequently, the court ruled that it possessed jurisdiction to hear Hudson\u2019s appeal. After reviewing the record and relevant case law, however, we disagree. In our view, Hudson was required to challenge the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction by initiating a mandamus action in the Franklin County Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we first note that <em>Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, supra, Consolidation Coal, supra, </em>and <em>Valentino v. Keller </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 173, 38 O.O.2d 412, 224 N.E.2d 748, upon which Hudson relies, all involved continuing jurisdiction rulings based upon the applicable statute of limitations. For example, the Ohio Supreme Court explained in <em>Valentino </em>that whether the claimant was entitled to have his claim reinstated in light of the applicable statute of limitations was a question concerning the claimant\u2019s \u201cright to continue to participate in the fund.\u201d <em>Valentino, supra, </em>at 175, 38 O.O.2d at 414, 224 N.E.2d at 750. The court further noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u201cThe Industrial Commission has the power, upon a motion for reinstatement of the claim, to determine whether ten years has elapsed since the last compensation or benefits were received by the claimant. Its determination of that question adversely to the applicant is jurisdictional and, thus, entitles him to appeal to the Common Pleas Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175-176, 38 O.O.2d at 414, 224 N.E.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The Ohio Supreme Court approvingly quoted this language in its <em>Consolidation Coal </em>ruling. See <em>Consolidation Coal, id. </em>at 284, 18 OBR at 335-336, 480 N.E.2d at 809-810.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">This court does not dispute that an Industrial Commission ruling concerning the reinstatement of a dormant claim implicates a claimant\u2019s \u201cright to continue to participate\u201d in the State Insurance Fund. However, the present case does not involve a continuing jurisdiction question regarding the Industrial Commission\u2019s ability to reinstate a prior claim. Rather, as Hudson acknowledges, the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>case involves the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to modify its prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In Hudson\u2019s view, this distinction is irrelevant. In his brief to this court, Hudson asserts that \u201call decisions [a]ffecting jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission and whether or not it properly continued to exercise its jurisdiction are appealable to the Common Pleas Court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We disagree. In <em>State ex rel. Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati Hwy. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 41, 42, 24 O.O.3d 37, 38, 434 N.E.2d 279, 281, the Franklin County Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201c \u2018The Industrial Commission has discretion to determine whether there is evidence of fraud, new or changed circumstances occurring subsequent to * * * [an] order, or a mistake prejudicing one of the parties prior to [the] exercise of * * * [its] continuing jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 4123.52 to change * * * [an] order which has * * * become final. * * *\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Bd. of Edn. v. Johnston </em>(Franklin Co. Ct. of Appeals No. 77AP-910, June 22, 1978), unreported, affirmed (1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 132 [388 N.E.2d 1383, 12 O.O.3d 128], The exercise of this discretion is a proper subject matter for the issuance of a writ of mandamus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently relied upon <em>Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati Hwy. Co. </em>in <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Metal Container Corp. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 85, 556 N.E.2d 168. There the court considered whether mandamus was the appropriate vehicle to challenge the Industrial Commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to modify or change a former order in cases involving mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 556 N.E.2d at 169-170. A unanimous court found mandamus proper, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u201cAppellants also challenge appellee\u2019s resort to mandamus, contending that the commission\u2019s February 2, 1997 order could have been appealed under R.C. 4123.519. Appellants, however, misdefine the issue before us. The relevant question here is not one of appellee\u2019s right to participate in the State Insurance Fund for a \u2018back\u2019 injury but is instead whether a mistake sufficient to invoke the continuing jurisdiction provisions of R.C. 4123.52 existed. We find this latter question to be the proper subject matter for a writ of mandamus. <em>State, ex rel. Highway Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 41, 24 O.O.3d 37, 434 N.E.2d 279.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 556 N.E.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Similarly, in the present case, the relevant question is not Hudson\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for a hand injury. The Industrial Commission long ago allowed Hudson\u2019s claim for the amputation of his fingers, and no Industrial Commission order ever terminated his right to that compensation. Unlike Industrial Commission rulings about statutes of limitations precluding the reinstatement of claims, the Industrial Commission\u2019s ruling in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>simply did not implicate Hudson\u2019s ability to participate or to continue to participate in the compensation fund. Regardless of the commission\u2019s decision, Hudson still received compensation for the amputation of his fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Thus, as in <em>Saunders, supra, </em>the relevant inquiry does not concern infringement upon Hudson\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether changed circumstances, fraud, newly discovered evidence, or some other valid criteria enabled the Industrial Commission to exercise continuing jurisdiction, reconsider its prior order, and modify Hudson\u2019s compensation award. In light of <em>Saunders </em>and <em>Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati Hwy. Co., supra, </em>we believe that this question properly is answered through an original action in mandamus. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Morrow v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Jan. 26, 1993), Franklin App. No. 91AP-1508, unreported, 1993 WL 264730, affirmed (1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 236, 643 N.E.2d 118 (noting that \u201crespondent also objects to the referee\u2019s finding that R.C. 4123.519 -does not provide relator with an adequate remedy at law so as to preclude the issuance of a writ of mandamus. The issue here is not whether relator has a right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund based on additional conditions, but whether the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction was properly invoked. This question is properly raised in a mandamus action. <em>Saunders.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Having determined that the Industrial Commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction did not affect Hudson\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund and, therefore, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear Hudson\u2019s appeal, we sustain the appellants\u2019 assignments of error. Furthermore, given his inability to pursue relief through an appeal to the common pleas court, Hudson should have initiated an original action in mandamus in the Franklin County Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In light of our holding on this assignment of error, we need not consider the appellants\u2019 remaining assignments of error. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider Hudson\u2019s appeal. Consequently, the court should have sustained the appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss without reaching the merits of Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s June 17, 1996 decision and order denying the appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss, sustaining Hudson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and reinstating the district hearing officer\u2019s order of additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-9\">Wolff and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
