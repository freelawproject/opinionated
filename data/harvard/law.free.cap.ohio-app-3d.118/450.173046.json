The facts are set out in appellant\u2019s brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201cLinda Murphy and the appellant have three children. Two of the children were visiting at their paternal grandmother\u2019s residence. The appellant was present at the residence. At approximately 6:30 p.m. Linda arrived at the residence with her current spouse to pick up the children. The two children got into the car. . They were crying. Linda got out of the car to see what was going on. The grandmother came outside to meet Linda. She advised Linda not to go inside. Linda went inside. She saw the appellant and confronted him about their children crying. The appellant told Linda to leave. Linda tried to talk with him about the children. The appellant told Linda to leave. Linda continued to try to talk with him about the children. The appellant got a hold of Linda\u2019s neck, spun her around so that she was facing out the door, and kicked her in the arm. Linda ran to her car. The incident lasted two to three minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Murphy proceeded directly to the office of the Jackson County Sheriff. Present were Deputy Sue Matteson and Sergeant Aric Yates. Murphy explained what had happened. Deputy Yates prepared a complaint reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201cCOMPLAINT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">\u201cOn or about 12-9, 1995 at 18:30 AM7PM in/at 101 Hill St. GlenRoy City of Jackson, Jackson County, Ohio, you did unlawfully cause or attempted to cause physical harm to you, your family, or household.

The trial was held on April 9, 1996 and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Sentence was imposed on April 17,1996. Additional facts will be set forth when necessary in the disposition of the two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On February 2, 1996, which was prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to dismiss. His memorandum in support argues that Sergeant Yates could not issue the complaint because he had no personal knowledge of the facts upon which the complaint was based. On April 8, 1996 appellee filed a motion to amend the complaint in the following form.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cNow comes the State and moves the Court to amend the Complaint herein by either substituting the name of Linda Murphy in the jurat or that of Sgt. Aric Yates on the line of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u201cSuch an amendment does not change the name or identity of the crime changed [sic] in the complaint. A memorandum is filed herewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Immediately prior to trial, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m gonna allow the amendment. I want the amendment to be formal. Mr. Forshey, I want you to strike Linda Murphy\u2019s name from the affidavit and we\u2019ll proceed and substitute Sgt. Aric Yates\u2019 name for her name, then I want you to alter the unlawfully to knowingly. I want you to have the Defendant served with this amended complaint and I want that, you know, let\u2019s do that before we start trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">After the ruling, the complaint was amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">\u201cCOMPLAINT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cOn or about 12-9, 1995 at 18:30 AM/PM in/at 101 Hill St. GlenRoy City of Jackson, Jackson County, Ohio, you did unlawfully knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to you, your family, or household.

There was no merit in the motion since there is no requirement under Crim.R. 3 that the complaint be based upon the personal knowledge of the affiant. The issue is discussed in detail in <em>State v. Villagomez </em>(1974), 44 Ohio App.2d 209, 73 O.O.2d 215, 337 N.E.2d 167:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cThe purpose and function of a complaint is to inform the accused of the crime of which he is charged. It forms the essential basis of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and the subsequent trial and judgment. It must, therefore, contain the essential elements required by Criminal Rule 3. Once filed, however, knowledge of the affiant is immaterial to the criminal cause. The issue is whether or not the crime was committed not whether the affiant had personal knowledge of each element of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cIn <em>State v. Biedenharn </em>(1969), 19 Ohio App.2d 204 [48 O.O.2d 338, 250 N.E.2d 778], it is said in the syllabus:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201c \u2018Personal knowledge of the commission of an offense is not a prerequisite to the filing of an affidavit therefor under Section 2935.09, Revised Code, which provides for accusation by affidavit to cause arrest for prosecution.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201cThere is nothing in the Criminal Rules substituting a complaint for the affidavit which would modify the essential reasoning of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">\u00ab * * * \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">\u201cUnder the rule above cited, it is not necessary that the one signing a complaint personally know all the facts constituting the elements of the offense. He may rely upon the testimony and investigation of others to establish matters not within the orbit of his personal knowledge. Few persons are personally aware of all elements of an offense and must necessarily so rely.\u201d <em>Villagomez </em>at 211, 73 O.O.2d at 216, 337 N.E.2d at 169-170.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Appellant contends that the filing of a valid complaint is necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. We agree. See <em>New Albany v. Dalton </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 307, 661 N.E.2d 1132. The question thus posed is whether the complaint in the case <em>sub judice </em>meets the requirements for validity under Crim.R. 3, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">\u201cThe complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall also state the numerical designation of the applicable statute or ordinance. It shall be made upon oath before any person authorized by law to administer oaths.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The complaint\u2019s function is to advise the defendant of the offense with which he is being charged and provide the basis for invoking the jurisdiction of the court. The complaint in the case <em>sub judice </em>states the essential facts of the offense. It also sets forth in the numerical code section the alleged violation. It is in writing and sworn to before a notary. It is sufficient under the rule to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. The rule does not require that the victim sign as complainant. While the better practice would have been for the officer to expressly sign as complainant, given the fact that the officer in swearing to the complaint as the issuing-charging law enforcement, the striking by the court of the victim\u2019s name and insertion of the officer\u2019s name was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Neither do we find any error in the action of the trial court in allowing amendment of this complaint by adding \u201cknowingly\u201d and not requiring reissuing of the complaint. The amendment of a complaint is authorized by Crim.R. 7(D). That rule was construed in <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144, wherein the court held in paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201cAn indictment, which does not contain all the essential elements of an offense, may be amended to include the omitted element, if the name or the identity of the crime is not changed, and the accused has not been misled or prejudiced by the omission of such element from the indictment. (Crim.R. 7[D], construed and applied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Manifestly, the amendment of the complaint did not change the name or identity of the crime. Further, there is nothing to demonstrate that the accused was misled or was prejudiced by the omission of any element from the complaint. Because of the latter conclusion, and even though the amendment necessarily amended the substance of the complaint, proceeding to trial after amendment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The second assignment of error asserts that the court erred in its instructions respecting the element of \u201cknowingly.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R.C. 2919.25(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">\u201cNo person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>R.C. 2901.22, which defines culpable mental states, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201c(B) A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The statutory definition is embodied in Section 409.11 of the Ohio Jury Instructions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\u201c409.11 Knowingly R.C. 2901.22(B)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201c1. KNOWINGLY. A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when (he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result) (he is aware that his conduct will probably be of a certain nature). A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist. R.C. 2901.22(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">\u201c2. ALTERNATE. Knowingly means that a person is aware of the existence of the facts and that his acts will probably (cause a certain result) (be of a certain nature.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">\u201cCOMMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cEvidence of mistake, accident, lack of information or other innocent reason negate the existence of knowledge and do not constitute an affirmative defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">\u201c3. HOW DETERMINED. Since you cannot look into the mind of another, knowledge is determined from all the facts and circumstances in evidence. You will determine from these facts and circumstances whether there existed at the time in the mind of the defendant an awareness of the probability that_.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">The court\u2019s jury instructions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">\u201cBefore you can find the defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the 9th day of December, 1995, in the County of Jackson, in the State of Ohio, the Defendant, Thomas Robinette, Jr., knowingly caused or attempted to cause physical harm to a family or a household member. As I said, this statute, violation of the statute is commonly known as domestic violence statute. Let me explain what some of the terms in that statute mean. Knowingly means a person acts knowingly. Regardless of his purpose, when he is aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>that his conduct will probably cause a certain result. The person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist. Since you can not look into the mind of another, knowledge is determined from all the facts and circumstances in evidence. <em>You mil determine from these facts and circumstances whether they\u2019re existent at the time in the mind of the defendant. That is, I\u2019m sorry, at the time, in the mind of the complaining witness. That is Linda Murphy. An awareness of the probability that she was afraid that the Defendant would cause physical harm to her.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Under R.C. 2919.25(A), the necessary elements of the offense are (1) the accused knowingly (2) caused or attempted to cause (3) physical harm (4) to a family or household member. It is readily apparent that the mental state of the complaining witness was not an element. The jury should not have been so instructed, and that instruction constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Conceivably, the court through inadvertence or confusion was giving a charge more appropriate for offenses under R.C. 2919.25(C), which is a separate and distinct offense from R.C. 2919.25(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">R.C. 2919.25(C) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cNo person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">An examination of the remainder of the charge does not reflect any correction of the erroneous instruction. Rather, in charging on the portion of the R.C. 2919.25(A) respecting attempt, the jury was instructed to apply the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d previously given by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">On review we have no way to determine how the jury utilized the incorrect instruction. Conceivably, the jury could have found that the victim, Linda Murphy, was afraid that appellant would cause physical harm to her, and on that basis concluded that the element of knowing conduct by appellant was established without reference to other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The erroneous charge was not a mere technical misstatement but was a positive misdirection of the jury. Under the circumstances, we reject appellee\u2019s urging that the error was harmless and hold that it was a substantial error to appellant\u2019s prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Accordingly, the second assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-14\">Harsha and Peter B. Abele, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\">. The objection to the jury instruction and ruling thereon does not appear in the original transcript of proceedings but the transcript was corrected pursuant to App.R. 9(E) by stipulation of the parties and order of the court. The order of the court reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">\u201cIt is Ordered that the following be added to the transcript of the trial, on page 117 at the fourteenth line from the top.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">\u201cThe correction to be made is to provide to the Court of Appeals the content of the conversation which took place at the bench. After the jury instructions were read by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Court to the jury, counsel for the Defendant objected to the instruction given on the element of 'knowingly.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI8\">\"The basis of the objection was that the instruction guided the jury to consider the mental state of the alleged victinn.as opposed to the mens rea of the Defendant. The objection was overruled by the trial court. Afterwards, the proceedings continued as indicated by the transcript.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
