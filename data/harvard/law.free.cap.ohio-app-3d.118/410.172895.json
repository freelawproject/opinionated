This is an issue of first impression in this district. We hold that under the statutory definition provided by the legislature, a person living in a same-sex relationship may commit domestic'violence upon the other, though each case will turn on its attendant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">I. Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">In late April 1996, Dave Thompson, Joe Fields, Fields\u2019s son, Joe Jr., and defendant-appellant, Ronnie Yaden, went to a flea market. Fields and Yaden began to argue, and the group returned to Fields\u2019s apartment. Thompson and Joe, Jr. left the apartment temporarily. As the argument became louder, Fields threatened to call the police unless Yaden quieted down.' Fields testified that Yaden ripped the phone from the wall and threw it, striking Fields in the forehead. Yaden then allegedly punched Fields in the stomach. When Thompson returned, he saw the broken telephone on the floor. According to Thompson, Fields picked up the phone receiver and hit himself in the head with it. Yaden denied hitting Fields either in the head or in the stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Fields and Yaden had been living together as a same-sex couple for approximately four years, but had broken up shortly before this incident. While living together, Fields and Yaden had a sexual relationship, shared expenses, and attended social activities together. Fields testified that he had made a commitment to be with Yaden during this time. After the breakup, Yaden continued to keep personal belongings in Fields\u2019s apartment and would stay with Fields when he had no other place to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>At the time of the incident, Fields was married to a woman; however, the nature and extent of that relationship was unclear in the record. Fields admitted that he took four different psychotropic medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Based upon this record, the trial- court found Yaden guilty of a violation of R.C. 2919.25(A), domestic violence. Yaden has appealed, arguing that (1) a same-sex relationship cannot give rise to an offense under the domestic violence statute, because one partner cannot be \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d as defined in the statute; and (2) the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">II. \u201cLiving as a Spouse\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Yaden argues that the trial court erred when it found that a same-sex relationship falls within the statutory definition of \u201cliving as a spouse.\u201d Yaden asserts that people who are not permitted legally to marry cannot live as though a marriage has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">R.C. 2919.25(A) states that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\u201d R.C. 2919.25(E)(1)(a)\u00ae defines \u201cfamily or household member,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201c[a] spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender.\u201d R.C. 2919.25(E)(2) further defines \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d as \u201ca person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, or who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within one year prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.\u201d Thus, Yaden asserts that he and Fields did not \u201ccohabit\u201d when they were living together for the four years prior to the incident, because, in his view, same-sex couples cannot \u201ccohabit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Yaden moves away from defining \u201ccohabitation\u201d and focuses instead on how the phrase \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d \u201cconjures up visions of a couple together without the benefit of a license but appearing in all other aspects to be husband and wife.\u201d The statute defines \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d as a person who is otherwise <em>cohabiting or has cohabited </em>with the offender within one year of the alleged act.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The definition of \u201ccohabitation\u201d in the context of domestic violence in a same-sex relationship controls our decision on this issue. Jurists across the country have struggled to provide guidance. Because the Ohio Supreme Court has not spoken on this issue, we set out some definitions from courts across the country. One caveat to this compilation of definitions is that they are taken from a mix of various contexts that emphasize different aspects of \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Each unique set of facts giving rise to each court\u2019s focus on certain aspects over other aspects illustrates the complexity, difficulty, and danger in creating some all-encompassing definition to describe intimate relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In Alabama, cohabitation means \u201csome permanency of relationship coupled with more than occasional sexual activity between the cohabitants.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In California, cohabitation means \u201can unrelated man and woman living together in a substantial relationship manifested principally by a [sic ] permanence, or sexual, or amorous intimacy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Delaware, the alimony statute defines cohabitation as \u201cregularly residing with an adult of the same or opposite sex, if the parties hold themselves out as a couple, and regardless of whether the relationship confers a financial benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Delaware Supreme Court has defined cohabitation as an \u201carrangement existing when two persons live together in a sexual relationship when not legally married.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In New Jersey, cohabitation is \u201cgenerally residing together in a common residence * * * where they generally engage in some, but not necessarily all of the following: meals taken together at the residence; departing from and returning to the residence of the other for employment and/or social purposes; maintaining clothing at the other\u2019s residence; sleeping together at the residence, or the residence of the other; receiving telephone calls at the residence or the residence of the other.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Other definitions include: \u201cliving together as husband and wife\u201d (Illinois);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201ca significant live-together relationship\u201d (Iowa);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cthe mutual assumption of those marital rights, duties, and obligations which are usually manifested by married people including but not necessarily dependent on sexual relations\u201d (Kentucky);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cliving together as husband and wife without a legal marriage having been performed\u201d (Maryland);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cliving together as man and wife, though not necessarily implying sexual relations\u201d (North Carolina);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cliving together in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>house\u201d (South Carolina);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cdwelling or living together; community of life\u201d (Texas);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cdoing things ordinarily done by spouses\u201d (Texas);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and \u201cliv[ing] together permanently or for an indefinite period and assuming] the duties and obligations normally attendant with a marital relationship.\u201d (Virginia).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">These definitions are not terms of art, but rather descriptions designed to assist fact-finders to discover whether the unique circumstances surrounding individual relationships can be categorized for some legal purpose, generally concerning alimony or domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Against this backdrop of definitions, we turn to Ohio jurisprudence in this area. Cohabitation has not been defined by the Ohio Supreme Court. In <em>State v. Williams, </em>this court followed <em>State v. Van Hoose </em>and held that \u201ccohabitation\u201d is \u201ca man and a woman living together in the same household and behaving as would a husband and wife.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But the context of our decision and the decision upon which it was based concerned opposite-sex relationships and did not involve same-sex cohabitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">How literal should our interpretation be of \u201ca man and a woman\u201d or \u201chusband and wife\u201d as defined under the <em>Van Hoose </em>or <em>Williams </em>facts in which the cohabitors were men with women? The court in <em>Van Hoose </em>held that the elements that constitute living together in the same household as husband and wife pose a question of fact in each particular case \u2014 for example, in cases in the divorce/alimony context one key element for inquiry is financial support.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It would be fair to suggest that because same-sex couples were not contemplated under the facts of these Ohio cases, their definitions do not exclude same-sex couples. As illustrated by the many definitions above, \u201ccohabitation\u201d takes on different meanings in different contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The Second District Court of Appeals has defined cohabitation in the alimony context as the \u201cvoluntary assumption of obligations equivalent to those arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>from a ceremonial marriage.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Fifth District Court of Appeals has defined cohabitation in the context of domestic violence as living together in a sexual relationship when not legally married.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The seminal Ohio case with facts describing domestic violence in a same-sex relationship is <em>State v. Hadinger.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Hadinger, </em>the Tenth District Court of Appeals compiled various definitions given for cohabitation and stated that the only common thread among those definitions was simply \u201cliv[ing] together in an intimate relationship.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Hamilton County Municipal Court has agreed with <em>Hadinger </em>that same-sex couples are subject to the domestic violence statute.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the only two Ohio cases that have considered the issue both hold that same-sex couples are covered by the definition of cohabitation. This reasoning comports with the list of definitions described above, but more guidance is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In short, definitions of \u201ccohabitation\u201d have two fact-specific prongs: financial support and consortium. Factors that establish financial support include shelter, food, clothing, utilities, and perhaps commingled assets. Factors that establish consortium include mutual respect, fidelity, emotional support, affection, society, cooperation, solace, comfort, aid to each other, friendship, conjugal relations and companionship.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The facts that rise to the level of \u201ccohabitation\u201d are unique to each case, and can only be sifted on a case-by-case basis by triers of fact.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The <em>Hadinger </em>court concluded that, by the language of R.C. 2919.25, the legislature intended to protect persons who are cohabiting, regardless of sex. It is true that same-sex couples are not permitted to be \u201cspouses\u201d of each other. But the definition of \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d includes a larger segment of couples\u2014 not only \u201cspouses\u201d but also \u201ceohabitors.\u201d Opposite-sex couples who \u201ccohabit\u201d are protected. We can see no tangible benefit to withholding this statutory protection from same-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Furthermore, R.C. 2919.25 has been amended four times since <em>Hadinger </em>was decided. We can safely assume that the legislature was fully aware of the <em>Hadinger </em>decision when it drafted these amendments.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, the legislature implicitly endorsed <em>Hadinger </em>when it declined to alter the definition of \u201ccohabit\u201d to exclude same-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">For these reasons, R.C. 2919.25 applies to same-sex couples that \u201ccohabit\u201d as described above. Under our facts, the testimony is more than sufficient to establish that Fields and Yaden cohabited. Accordingly, we overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">III. Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">When considering a manifest-weight claim, we inquire whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential element's of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the record.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Fields testified that Yaden hit him in the head with a phone and in the stomach with his fist. Yaden asserts that this testimony was not credible because Fields was on psychotropic medication. Yaden further asserts that Thompson testified that Fields struck himself with the phone, creating reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Fields\u2019s psychiatric condition, based solely on the disclosure of medications that he took, did not render him incompetent to testify.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The credibility of Fields\u2019s and Thompson\u2019s testimony and the weight given to their testimony were a matter for the trier of fact.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">We are satisfied that the trial court was well within its discretion when giving weight to Fields\u2019s testimony in the context of the whole record, notwithstanding his undisclosed \u201cpsychiatric condition.\u201d As Yaden raises no other weight-of-the-evidence issues, we overrule this assignment of error. Accordingly, we overrule both assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-11\">Doan, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-13\">.
