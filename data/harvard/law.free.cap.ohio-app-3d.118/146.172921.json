The trial court determined that appellant was not entitled to deny insurance coverage to appellees Sally J. Mills, Jason Hewitt, Thomas Thorn, Randy Hicks, and the estate of Sean Wright. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The case stems from an automobile accident that occurred on October 17, 1994. The automobile, a 1986 Chevrolet Cavalier owned by Sally J. Mills, was being driven on a rural road in Wayne County by Mills\u2019s son, Jason Hewitt. In addition to Hewitt, the occupants of the vehicle were Thorn, Hicks, and Wright. Hewitt lost control of the vehicle and crashed; as a result, he, Thorn, and Hicks sustained injuries, and Wright was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Hewitt lived with Mills and her husband in Wayne County. He owned his own automobile, a 1976 Ford Mustang. Mills had specifically arranged with her own automobile insurer, Wayne Mutual Insurance Company, to have Hewitt excluded as a driver from her policy in order to lower her premiums. Wayne Mutual and Mills signed an endorsement to that effect, and Hewitt was specifically excluded as an insured driver of Mills\u2019s automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Hewitt purchased his own insurance for the Mustang from appellant. That policy contained provisions for both liability coverage and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. After being impleaded as a third-party defendant in this litigation, appellant filed a motion seeking a declaratory judgment. Specifically, appellant requested that the trial court declare that \u201cProgressive, pursuant to its policy, does not owe a defense or coverage to Sally J. Mills and Jason M. Hewitt\u201d as a result of the accident. The other parties were joined or intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Various responses to appellant\u2019s motion were filed. On October 31, 1995, the trial court issued a journal entry denying appellant the requested relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant then appealed to this court, and presents two assignments of error. The first of these concerns whether appellant is obligated to provide <em>bodily injury liability </em>coverage (\u201cliability\u201d); the second pertains to whether appellant is required to provide <em>uninsured/underinsured motorist </em>coverage (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred by ignoring the evidence and the clear provisions of the policy in declaring bodily injury liability coverage under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">At the outset, we note that the trial court did not explicitly \u201cdeclare\u201d that any coverage existed for any party. Rather, the trial court simply stated that appellant\u2019s arguments in support of its request for a fading of no coverage were without merit. Nonetheless, we will consider whether this finding was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">According to the policy issued by appellant to Hewitt, appellant agreed to \u201cpay damages, other than punitive or exemplary damages, for which an insured person is legally liable because of bodily injury or property damage arising out of an accident.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Appellant contends that Hewitt was not an \u201cinsured person\u201d at the time of the accident and, consequently, that no coverage should be provided. The policy defines \u201cinsured person\u201d as \u201cyou or a relative with respect to an accident involving your insured car [or] a non-owned car.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>A. \u201cInsured Car\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Appellant contends that Hewitt was not driving his \u201cinsured car\u201d at the time of the accident. According to the policy, Hewitt\u2019s \u201cinsured car\u201d was defined as \u201cany car described on the Declarations Page <em>[ie., </em>Hewitt\u2019s Mustang] or any replacement car [.]\u201d A \u201creplacement car\u201d was \u201ca car * * * that you [Hewitt] own and which has taken the place of the [Mustang] due to * * * mechanical breakdown or deterioration of the [Mustang], rendering it permanently inoperable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The trial court found that Hewitt was driving his mother\u2019s Cavalier as a \u201creplacement car\u201d because the Mustang was \u201cpermanently inoperable.\u201d The trial court concluded that, since the term \u201cpermanently inoperable\u201d was ambiguous, it was to be strictly construed against appellant and, therefore, in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">We find this decision to be erroneous. First, the deposition of Hewitt\u2019s mother indicates that, although Hewitt had indicated that the Mustang had mechanical difficulties, the Mustang was driven several months after the accident for nearly two miles down the road for storage in a neighbor\u2019s barn. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that, even if the Mustang was later rendered permanently inoperable, Hewitt knew that to be the case on the date of the accident. In fact, Mills indicated that Hewitt did not believe that the car was permanently disabled, and that she and her husband spent several thousand dollars attempting to \u201cfix up\u201d the Mustang to \u201cmake it nice\u201d for Hewitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Second, the record, especially the deposition of Mills, is quite specific regarding ownership of the vehicles. Hewitt at all times was the registered owner of the Mustang, and owned no other car. Mills was at all times the sole registered owner of the Cavalier. Hewitt never owned the Cavalier; therefore, regardless of whether the Mustang was or was not \u201cpermanently inoperable,\u201d since the Cavalier was not owned by Hewitt and was not taking the place of the Mustang, as required by the clear terms of the policy, it could not be a \u201creplacement car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Moreover, the policy also stated that \u201cif you want coverage to apply to a replacement car, you must notify [appellant] within 30 days of its acquisition^]\u201d The record does not indicate that any such notification was ever provided. Hewitt was not driving either his insured Mustang or a replacement car as required by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">B. \u201cNon-Owned\u201d Car</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The policy provided that, if Hewitt was driving either his insured car or a \u201cnon-owned\u201d car, liability coverage would be provided. A \u201cnon-owned car\u201d as defined in the policy was \u201cany car, other than your insured car, which is not owned by, registered to, or furnished lot regular or frequent use by you, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>nonresident spouse, or a resident of the same household as you while in the custody of or being operated by you or a relative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The trial court did not consider the \u201cnon-owned car\u201d argument in the context of liability coverage. Rather, the trial court stated that \u201cProgressive denies any liability under the <em>uninsured/underinsured </em>portion of the Policy * * * based on the definition of a non-owned car.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, it is clear from the language of the policy that it is <em>liability </em>coverage which is invoked if Hewitt is driving a non-owned car. UM/UIM coverage is discussed in Part IV of the policy, while liability insurance is confined to Part I; only the section discussing liability coverage makes any mention of a \u201cnon-owned car.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The trial court determined that, pursuant to the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s decision in <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Alexander </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 397, 583 N.E.2d 309, syllabus, insurance contracts which exclude UM/UIM coverage for \u201chousehold vehicles,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>vehicles owned by the insured or a member of his household, are void as against public policy and R.C. 3937.18(A). As stated in <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 481, 639 N.E.2d 438, 441:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cR.C. 3937.18 is the yardstick by which all exclusions of uninsured motorist coverage must be measured. Under <em>Alexander, </em>the statute mandates coverage if (1) the claimant is an insured under a policy which provides uninsured motorist coverage; (2) the claimant was injured by an uninsured motorist; and (3) the claim is recognized by Ohio tort law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">This court has repeatedly adopted the <em>Alexander </em>standard in considering such clauses in various insurance contracts. However, the clear holding of both <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin </em>is that <em>UM/UIM </em>coverage is not to be denied under such clauses. Neither decision addresses whether <em>bodily injury liability </em>coverage is subject to such a mandate. Moreover, the statute construed in both decisions, R.C. 3937.18, specifically addresses UM/UIM insurance, not bodily injury liability insurance. No party cites any authority for the proposition that the <em>Alexander </em>doctrine should be extended beyond UM/UIM coverage to encompass other forms of casualty insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Appellees contend that the term \u201cpermanently inoperable\u201d and \u201cregular use\u201d are ambiguous. They argue that since the terms are vague, they should be construed in favor of coverage, as the trial court determined. As a general rule, this is correct. Language in a contract of insurance reasonably susceptible of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>more than one meaning will be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Nevertheless, this rule cannot be employed to create ambiguity where there is none. See <em>Dunfee v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 301, 306, 590 N.E.2d 1365, 1368. After a thorough consideration of the policy at issue, we find nothing ambiguous or vague\u2019about these terms or the definitions discussed above. The rule of liberal interpretation in favor of the insured does not require a court to adopt a forced or strained construction of an insurance contract. <em>W. Res. Mut. Cas. Co. v. Eberhart </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 93, 99, 610 N.E.2d 481, 485-486. Where an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous on its face, the words of the policy must be given their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Johnston v. Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health, Inc. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 655, 657, 589 N.E.2d 432, 433; <em>Michigan Property &amp; Cas. Guar. Assn. v. Booth </em>(Sept. 2, 1992), Wayne App. No. 2722, unreported, 1992 WL 217840, at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">It is clear that the policy applies the \u201cnon-owned car\u201d criteria (the \u201chousehold vehicle\u201d exclusion) to the question of liability coverage. That requirement states that Hewitt is insured while driving a car other than the Mustang only if that other car is not owned, registered to, or furnished for the regular use of Hewitt or someone residing in his household at the time Hewitt was using the car. Since the Cavalier was owned by, registered to, and used regularly by Hewitt\u2019s mother, with whom Hewitt lived, the Cavalier was not a \u201cnon-owned car\u201d within the meaning of the policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, appellant was not required to provide bodily injury liability coverage to Hewitt when he was driving the Cavalier.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred by ignoring the evidence and the clear provisions of the policy in declaring uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Appellant asserts that the trial court committed error by finding that UM/UIM coverage should be provided to Hewitt and his passengers. As noted above, the trial court\u2019s journal entry did not specifically declare that coverage existed; it merely stated that appellant\u2019s arguments in support of its denial of coverage were meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The trial court determined that, pursuant to <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin, supra, </em>appellant was prohibited from denying UM/UIM coverage on the basis of its \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d found in the \u201cnon-owned car\u201d provision. However, the policy itself, as we have noted, directly applies the \u201cnon-owned car\u201d concept only to liability insurance. Moreover, as discussed below, even if we were to find that the \u201cnon-owned car\u201d provision was improperly invoked with respect to UM/UIM coverage, it is apparent that UM/UIM coverage is available only to insured <em>persons, </em>regardless of whether an exclusion pertaining to <em>vehicles </em>is valid or unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Part IV of the policy states that appellant will pay damages \u201cfor bodily injury to an insured person which that person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured * * * or an underinsured motor vehicle[.] * * * The bodily injury must be caused by accident[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u201cAccident\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201can unexpected and unintended event that causes bodily injury or' property damage and arises out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of your insured car or a non-owned car.\u201d A \u201cnon-owned car\u201d is, as discussed above, defined subject to the \u201chousehold exclusion,\u201d as \u201cany car, other than your insured car, which is not owned by, registered to, or furnished for regular or frequent use by you, a nonresident spouse, or a resident of the same household as you while in the custody of or being operated by you or a relative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Appellees argue that, because (1) the UM/UIM coverage is contingent on the injury arising from an accident, (2) an \u201caccident\u201d is contingent on the use of an insured car or a non-owned car, and (3) a \u201cnon-owned car\u201d is defined to exclude vehicles owned by other household members, appellant indirectly employs a \u201chousehold\u201d exclusion to deny UM/UIM coverage. Such exclusions have been held contrary to public policy and R.C. 3937.18 when used for such a purpose. See <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">However, appellees\u2019 arguments ignore the initial language of the policy, which states that appellant will pay UM/UIM benefits \u201cfor bodily injury <em>to an insured person[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although the UM/UIM coverage section or the policy might be interpreted as containing a household exclusion based upon the definitions of \u201caccident\u201d and \u201cnon-owned car,\u201d that language was not the basis for appellant\u2019s denial of UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The policy states that bodily injury to an insured person will be covered if it is caused by an accident. Thus, even if we adopt appellees\u2019 contention that the policy illegally attempts to limit the class of automobiles in which compensable bodily injury might occur, the injury must still occur to an insured person in order for coverage to be mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Appellant denied coverage because appellees were not \u201cinsured persons\u201d in the first place, and, therefore, were ineligible for coverage. Part IV.l (the UM/UIM section) of the policy defines \u201cinsured person\u201d as \u201c(a) you [Hewitt] or any relative; (b) any person while occupying your insured car.\u201d The policy further defines \u201cyour insured car\u201d as Hewitt\u2019s Mustang or a \u201creplacement car.\u201d We determined, in our discussion of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, that the Cavalier, since it was owned by Hewitt\u2019s mother, was neither Hewitt\u2019s insured car nor a replacement car.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Although it is true that <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin </em>prohibit denial of UM/UIM coverage on the basis of the \u201chousehold\u201d or \u201cother owned vehicle\u201d exclusions, neither of those cases prohibits the parties to an insurance contract from defining who is to be an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the terms of the policy. Indeed, the <em>Martin </em>court specifically stated that \u201cthe statute mandates coverage if (1) <em>the claimant is [a named] insured </em>under a policy[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins., </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 481, 639 N.E.2d at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the uninsured motorist statute is not to provide coverage for an uninsured vehicle but rather to afford <em>the insured </em>additional protection in the event of an accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Watson v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 195, 197, 532 N.E.2d 758, 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">If the claimant is not an insured, then he may be denied coverage. See <em>Wright v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(Jun. 27,1995), Coshocton App. No. 94-CA-18, unreported, 1995 WL 495441.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Ohio courts have consistently held that insurance contracts must be construed in accordance with the same rules as other written contracts. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Shuff </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 172, 173, 21 O.O.3d 108, 108-109, 423 N.E.2d 417, 417-418; <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096, 1101-1102, certiorari denied (1993), 507 U.S. 987, 113 S.Ct. 1585, 123 L.Ed.2d 152. An insurance contract \u201cmust be given a fair and reasonable interpretation to cover the risks anticipated by the parties.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio App.2d 19, 21, 31 O.O.2d 65, 66, 206 N.E.2d 227, 228; <em>W. Res. Mut. Cas. Co. v. Eberhart, </em>81 Ohio App.3d at 98, 610 N.E.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In this case, the parties to the insurance contract agreed that only persons who were riding in Hewitt\u2019s insured car (the Mustang or a replacement) were to be \u201cinsured persons\u201d eligible for coverage. Since Hewitt was driving neither his insured car nor a \u201creplacement car,\u201d his passengers were not insured persons. Appellees argue that appellant is, in effect, contravening the purposes of R.C. 3937.18 and attempting to circumvent the prohibitions of <em>Alexander </em>by employing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>a restrictive definition of what constitutes an \u201cinsured person.\u201d However, this argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellees, unlike the claimants in <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin, </em>are not seeking payment of coverage pursuant to policies of their own. Instead, they essentially contend that, because they were riding in an automobile driven by a person who possessed UM/UIM coverage, they are entitled to relief under the UM/UIM provision of that driver\u2019s policy, even though appellees are not named insureds thereunder. We cannot agree that the decisions in <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin </em>contemplated such a bizarre application.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Moreover, a fair and reasonable construction of the policy yields the conclusion that appellant only agreed to provide coverage to. Hewitt or any potential passengers so long as Hewitt was driving a specific automobile. Such an agreement does not attempt to contravene the public policy behind R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The trial court applied the <em>Alexander </em>doctrine to overrule appellant\u2019s denial of UM/UIM coverage; however, that doctrine is inapplicable here, since denial of coverage was not made on that basis. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the matter is hereby remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-10\">Reece, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b191-11\">Quillin, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-14\">. A lawsuit involving this insurance policy was also filed. We determined the outcome of that litigation in <em>Wayne Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mills </em>(July 17, 1996), Wayne App. No. 95CA0083, unreported, 1996 WL 397127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\">. The trial court characterized its decision as a ruling on a motion for summary judgment, and specifically denied that relief. Since the record indicates that appellant never filed a motion for summary judgment, but instead filed only a motion seeking a declaratory judgment, we will presume that the trial court addressed the declaratory judgment request, and proceed to consider the merits on that basis. We note further that neither party has objected to the trial court\u2019s characterization of the pleadings and its ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b185-12\">. The policy contains two separate definitions of an \u201cinsured person, \u201d each of which is expressly made applicable only to a certain section of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Part 1 of the policy, the liability section, under the heading \u201cAdditional Definitions Used in This Part Only,\u201d defines insured persons as \"(1) you or a relative with respect to an accident involving your insured car, a non-owned car, or a utility trailer while being towed by your insured car[;] (2) any person driving your insured car with your permission and within the scope of such permission!]]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Part IV (the UM/UIM coverage section) states that \u201d[t]he \u2018Definitions\u2019 Section of your policy applies to this Part IV, except the definitions of \u2018Insured Person\u2019 and \u2018Accident,\u2019 and under Part IV * * * \u2018Insured Person\u2019 means (a) you or any relative; (b) any person while occupying your insured car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\">. As discussed below, UM/UIM coverage was dependent upon whether Hewitt was driving his \u201cinsured car\u201d or a \u201creplacement car,\u201d whereas liability coverage was premised upon whether Hewitt was driving his \"insured car\u201d (the Mustang or a \u201creplacement car\u201d) or a \"non-owned car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. Appellees contend that there is no evidence that Hewitt frequently used the Cavalier; this statement, even if true, is irrelevant. If the Cavalier was furnished for regular use to Hewitt or a member of his household, it was, under the policy definition, not a \"non-owned car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
