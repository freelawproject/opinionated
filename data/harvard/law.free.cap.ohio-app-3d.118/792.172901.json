Hafner &amp; Sons, Inc. and Toad, Inc. (\u201cHafner\u201d) allege that in 1994, a sanitary sewer line operated across their land \u201cerupted\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>deposited raw sewage and human waste over approximately two acres of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The record reveals that the sewer line in question is an interceptor sewer that receives sanitary flow during dry weather and a combination of sanitary flow and storm-water runoff during wet weather. This flow is conveyed by the sewer line to the Little Miami Treatment Plant (\u201cthe Plant\u201d). Apparently, the Plant would be flooded and damaged by the combined flow through this sewer any time that the Little Miami River reached water surface levels corresponding to an Ohio River stage of forty-three feet. To protect the Plant, the interceptor sewer is equipped with a sluice gate that defendant-appellee Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewer District (\u201cMSD\u201d) closes to block the flow any time there is a danger that the sewer flow will flood the Plant. Testimony indicates that this is an annual event.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">When the sluice gate is closed, the sewer backs up. Hafner\u2019s property is located in a flood plain with four manholes from the sewer. The backup from the closed sluice gate overflows through these manholes and deposits huge quantities of raw sewage and human waste products on Hafner\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The MSD had notice of these backups as early as 1983, but as of this litigation had done nothing to alleviate the problem.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1994, the overflow was so great that it allegedly covered approximately two acres of Hafner\u2019s land. In Hafner\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">\u201cA: It used to be farming area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">\u201cQ: What is it now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">\u201cA: About 20, 30 inches of crap, whatever come[s] out of sewers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">\u201cQ: And is it still there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">\u201cA: Yep.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Based upon these facts, Hafner filed his action with little more specificity than to indicate that he believes that the MSD, through defendant-appellee Hamilton County Board of Commissioners (\u201cthe county\u201d), is liable for the removal of the sewage from his property and resultant damage to the property\u2019s value. Following an arbitration award to Hafner, the county filed an appeal in the court of common pleas and a motion for summary judgment. Following a review of two depositions, a letter and various filings and briefs, the trial court entered summary judgment for the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Hafner has appealed to this court, alleging in one assignment of error that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because (1) the operation and maintenance of a sewer system is proprietary, implying that municipalities may be held liable for negligent operation and/or maintenance; (2) the easement through Hafner\u2019s property did not authorize the MSD to overburden the easement, implying that the overflow constituted a taking of Hafner\u2019s property; and (3) a municipality that operated a sewer system that was so inadequate that it overflowed onto Hafner\u2019s property created either a nuisance or an appropriation by encroachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Therefore, we must first decide whether the damage to Hafner\u2019s property from the sewer was caused by governmental or proprietary functions of the county to determine whether the county is entitled to immunity. If the county is not immune from liability, we must determine whether a cause of action exists to hold it liable for the damage to Hafner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We turn first to what functions of the sewer system caused the damage, whether these functions are proprietary, and whether municipalities may be held liable for these functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">R.C. 2744.02(B)(2) states that a political subdivision is liable in damages in a civil action for loss to property allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or of any of its employees \u201cwith respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Hafner claims that the MSD\u2019s operation of the sewer caused the damage. R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d) defines as one \u201cproprietary function\u201d \u201cthe maintenance, destruction, operation, and upkeep of a sewer system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The county claims that the backup was caused by the design of the sewer system, a governmental function that entitles municipalities to immunity. See R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Thus, the question of whether the county may be liable turns on whether the backup was caused by the design of the interceptor sewer or whether the backup was caused by the maintenance, operation and upkeep of the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">According to G. Stephen Minges, Superintendent of the Waste Water Collection Division of the MSD, the sewer was most probably designed and installed in the early 1950s. The first complaints to speak of with regard to overflow from the sewer in question occurred in April 1983, when Hafner first complained about sewage overflow from the interceptor sewer. The inspector, City Engineer J.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Bishof, stated in a letter to the MSD that the overflow \u201crepresents] a nuisance to Mr. Ha[f]ner and a potential health hazard to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">There is scant evidence \u25a0 in the record to identify a cause for the sudden overflow that did not exist previously, but Hafner reasonably opined in his deposition testimony that the increase in upstream subdevelopments had caused a corresponding increase in flow through the sewer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">While Hafner had no complaints before 1983, the frequency and volume of backups increased until 1994, when the backup covered two acres of his property. It is premature to suggest that evidence could not be produced to show that the sewer, while designed to be adequate<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the 1950s, is no longer adequate in the 1990s. But it remains clear that Hafner has suffered through backups every year since bringing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Both parties see the operative act as the closing of the sluice gate. The county sees this act as a discretionary function of the government to protect the Plant. We see this as an issue of fact (1) whether the closing of the gate was an act within the scope of MSD\u2019s authority, (2) whether the act involved the exercise of discretion and judgment, and (3) whether the gate was closed in good faith. <em>C &amp; D Partnership v. Gahanna </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 359, 15 OBR 480, 474 N.E.2d 303. However, this act is not the dispositive act in this case, because the county had sufficient notice \u2014 eleven years of notice \u2014 of the problem with this sewer overflowing onto Hafner\u2019s property without taking any action to solve the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The dispositive act, or in this case omission, to be proven by Hafner is the MSD\u2019s failure to maintain the sewer servicing upstream property owners \u2014 or more specifically, MSD\u2019s failure to upgrade the sewer from its original design to adequately accept the flow of sanitary effluents, despite eleven years of notice that the sewer periodically, and eventually annually, backed up and deposited raw sewage and human waste on Hafner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Particularly instructive in defining MSD\u2019s omission as either proprietary or governmental are cases decided prior to the 1985 passage of the Ohio Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, which abrogated the public-duty/special-duty theory of municipal liability. See, generally, R.C. Chapter 2744. The Eighth District Court of Appeals, for example, held that \u201cwhere a municipality fails to <em>maintain </em>a public improvement such as a sewer system and thereby effectively takes private property in that municipality for its own use by casting surface waters upon that property, it must pay compensation for the property taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>under Art. I, Sec. 19 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>November Properties, Inc. v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(Dec. 6, 1979), Cuyahoga App. No. 39626, unreported (citing <em>Masley v. Lorain </em>[1976], 48 Ohio St.2d 334, 2 O.O.3d 463, 358 N.E.2d 596).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">The courts have clearly considered the inadequacy of sewers to be a failure to maintain them in a manner to adequately accept upstream flow, rather than to reflect a defective design. We agree with this reasoning. The design of the 1950s in this case was apparently adequate \u2014 until 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Thus, we hold that the failure to upgrade sewers that are inadequate to service upstream property owners despite sufficient notice of the inadequacy can best be described as a failure to maintain or upkeep the sewer. See, also, <em>Hedrick v. Columbus </em>(Mar. 30, 1993), Franklin App. Nos. 92AP-1030 and 92AP-1031, unreported, 1993 WL 104713. But, see, <em>Alden v. Summit Cty. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 460, 679 N.E.2d 36. If proven, this failure would constitute the breach of a proprietary duty and would expose the county to liability under R.C. 2744.02(B)(2). Therefore, summary judgment is premature in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">As an affirmative defense, the county claims that it cannot be held liable because the backup was caused by an act of nature. This defense is appropriate in cases where \u201cextreme natural events * * * cannot be realistically engineered against.\u201d <em>Hedrick, supra; </em>see, also, <em>Piqua v. Morris </em>(1918), 98 Ohio St. 42, 120 N.E. 300. The backups in this case are the result not of \u201cone-hundred-year rains\u201d but of mere annual precipitation. Thus, this defense lacks merit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">It seems clear that additional evidence must be presented before a satisfactory resolution can be achieved in this case. Hafner must demonstrate that a failure to upgrade the sewer from its original design to adequately accept the flow, despite eleven years of notice that the sewer periodically overflowed on Hafner\u2019s property, caused the damage to Hafner\u2019s property. Currently, there is only an <em>ipso facto </em>assertion that the sewer design of the 1950s is no longer adequate in the 1990s. However, this assertion, in addition to the obvious length of the notice, the severity of the problem and the frequency of its occurrence, is sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. In <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the party moving for summary judgment must be able to point to some specific evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) that affirmatively shows that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support its claims. Here, the county\u2019s conclusory assertion that Hafner has no evidence to present is insufficient to identify the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Accordingly, we sustain the assignment of error, reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b834-6\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b834-7\">.
