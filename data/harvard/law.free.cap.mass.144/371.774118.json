There was also evidence tending to show the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">It was also in evidence, that at the time Lappen sold lot 1 to Kane in 1872, he told Kennedy that he had now made his, Kennedy\u2019s, right of way to Fifth Street a matter of record, so that no one could hereafter interfere with it; and it was also shown that no interference with or obstruction to its use was made after said deed in 1872, until the plaintiff refused and obstructed its use to the defendant and her tenants in 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The defendant contended that the intent of Lappen in the reservation in his deed to Kane was clearly to confirm and give a right of way to Kennedy over said passageway, as an abutter thereon ; and asked the judge to rule that, even if Kennedy had not acquired a right of way by prescription, yet he had acquired it by the said reservation in said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">The judge refused so to rule, and found, as matter of fact, that, up to the time of Lappen\u2019s deed to Kane, the use by Kennedy of said passageway was permissive; that, after that time, it was used as a matter of right; and ruled that as twenty years had not elapsed since said adverse user began, the defendant had acquired no right of way by prescription, or by the reservation in said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">The judge found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-6\"><em>O.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACe\">The only exception is to the ruling of the court that a right of way over the plaintiff\u2019s land was not reserved as appurtenant to the defendant\u2019s land by the deeds under which the plaintiff claims. The plaintiff derives her title from one Lappen, who, in 1872, conveyed the lot now owned by' her to one Kane, who subsequently -conveyed it to the plaintiff. Both deeds contained the words, \u201c There is a passageway on the southeasterly side of said premises, which is to be used in common with the abutters thereon.\u201d The defendant\u2019s land abuts on the southeasterly side of. the plaintiff\u2019s land; and the contention for the defendant is, that a right of way in favor of the defendant\u2019s land was reserved in the deed. At the time of the conveyance from Lappen to Kane, there was a passageway four feet wide, over which a right of way had been granted by Lappen as appurtenant to adjoining land which he had before that time conveyed. The deed refers to an existing passageway, and the natural construction of it is, that it excepts from the grant the existing right of way, and not that it creates a new right. The words, \u201c which is to be used in common with the abutters thereon,\u201d do not necessarily include the defendant\u2019s land. The passageway abutted upon the two lots in the rear which Lappen had sold, and the language may well be taken to refer only to those abutters on the way who had rights in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>But if there had been an express reservation of the right of way to the defendant\u2019s grantor, it would not have created an easement in him. He was not a party to the deed, and a reservation in a deed cannot create an easement in a stranger to it. <em>Stockwell </em>v. <em>Couillard, </em>129 Mass. 231, 233. <em>Young, petitioner, </em>11 R. I. 636. <em>Bridger </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>45 N.

It was held that it could not operate as a reservation to the three, because one of them was not a conveying party, but, as the indenture was executed by the lessee, it might operate as a grant from him to the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The declarations of Lappen at the time of his deed to Kane are not competent to affect the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\n<em>.Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
