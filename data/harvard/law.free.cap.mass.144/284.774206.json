J. Hill, in apparent good condition, as described below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-8\">\u201cDescription and estimated value, 12 cows at $75 each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-9\">\u201c To be transported over its road and delivered in like good order to the next company or carrier (if going beyond its own line of road) for them to deliver to the place of destination of said live stock. It being distinctly understood that this company assumes no liability beyond the end of its own road, and that, so far as it acts as agent for other parties participating in the joint transit aforesaid, said parties are separately liable. It is also understood that the owner or owners shall load, unload, and feed at their own risk and expense, and assume all risk of loss or damage from any cause, kind, or nature except from collision of trains, in which case this company shall not be held liable for loss for a greater sum than' specified above in this agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201c The rates for transporting live stock are based upon and intended only for those of ordinary value, viz.: . . . . cows $75.....Animals of a greater value than the above will be charged at the rate of 50 per cent additional for every . . . . $75 additional value for cows. ..... The same additional charge will be made for any part of this increased value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">\u201c And it is further agreed that the conditions named herein, applicable to this road, shall apply to each and every railroad between the point of shipment and the point of destination.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">It was further agreed, that the price paid, as freight money, for the transportation of the animals enumerated i\u00fa the shipping agreement among which the cow injured was included, was based on the estimated values stated in that part of the agreement entitled \u201c Description and estimated value,\u201d and in this freight money the defendant shared; and that the Fitchburg Railroad Company transported the animals safely to the end of its line, and there delivered them to the defendant, who thereupon undertook to transport them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">The plaintiff also offered evidence tending to show that Smith was employed by him merely to attend to the care and transportation of the cattle ; that Smith had no authority, other than appears from the facts herein stated with reference to his employment, to agree to any valuation of the animals; that he did not read the agreement which he signed, although he had full opportunity to do so, and did not, in fact, know that said agreement contained any valuation of the animals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-9\">The judge ruled that the amount of damages which the plaintiff could recover was limited to $75, and interest thereon from the date of the injury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $80.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-10\">If the ruling was correct, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, a new trial to be had.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-11\"><em>S. </em>Lincoln, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-12\"><em>Gr.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADj\">This case is substantially covered by the decision in the recent case of <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Lake &amp; Shore Michigan Southern Railroad, </em>187. Mass. 33. The plaintiff seeks to distinguish it on the ground that the shipping agreement in the present case in effect provides that the carriers shall not be liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>,at all, except in case of a collision of trains, and in that case only for the valuation specified; that the attempted total exemption from liability is invalid, and therefore the only limitation of-liability is in respect to a loss from collision; and that there was no collision in this case. He contends therefore that he may recover the value of his cow, irrespective of the shipping agreement. But this would not be giving a fair construction to the agreement. The value of each cow was estimated at $75, and the rates for transportation were based upon and intended only for cows of that value. Cows of greater value were to be charged at an additional rate. Taking the whole agreement together, the liability of the defendant is limited by the valuation expressed in the shipping agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s agent, Smith, had charge of the plaintiff\u2019s animals, for the purpose of their transportation, and the plaintiff is bound by the shipping agreement made in his behalf by Smith. <em>Squire </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>98 Mass. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
