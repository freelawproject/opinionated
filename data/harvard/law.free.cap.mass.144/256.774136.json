M. Elliot, the tiusband of the plaintiff, (who testified that he was acting for the plaintiff,) for a sale of the premises; that he, Hannaford, made an oral contract with the plaintiff through her husband, on October 12 or 13,1883, to sell said premises to the plaintiff upon the following terms: $100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>was to be paid on the delivery of the deed, and $100 was to be paid on January 1, following, and $600 during the year from the first payment was to be paid on the second mortgage; that the date of that payment was not fixed, but was to be within the year; that there was a first mortgage of $2000 on the place, and the second mortgage was to be $1400, all to be paid within three years; that some time early the following week, but on what day he could not state, he made memoranda of said sale upon two books, one of which was as follows: \u201c Oct. 13.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auk\">There was no memorandum signed by the defendant, \u201c or by some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized,\u201d as required by the statute of frauds. Pub. Sts. <em>a. </em>78, \u00a7 1. Hannaford made no memorandum until after the defendant had contracted to sell the land to another purchaser, and had so informed Hannaford; whereby his authority ceased. Moreover, the contract as made by Hannaford was not expressed in either memorandum. The terms of sale were omitted. If Hannaford was authorized to make, in behalf of the defendant, the contract as testified to by him, he was not authorized to make a memorandum of it which differed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>respect to the terms of sale. <em>Morton </em>v. Dean, 13 Met. 385. <em>Coddington </em>v. Goddard, 16 Gray, 436, 443, 445. <em>Dodd </em>v. Farlow, 11 Allen, 426. <em>Boardman </em>v. Spooner, 13 Allen, 353. These objections are sufficient to defeat the action, without considering others. <em>Judgment for the defendant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
