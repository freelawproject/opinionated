Sts. c. 162, \u00a7 17, requiring the magistrate to certify \u201c that he is satisfied there is reasonable cause to believe\u201d that the charge contained in the affidavit on which the arrest is asked for is \u201c true ; \u201d and warrants the arrest of the debtor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-7\">Contract upon a poor debtor\u2019s recognizance, entered into on May 24,1884, under the Pub.

Trial in the Superior Court, before Blodgett, J., who ruled that the action could not be maintained, and directed a verdict for the defendants ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-4\"><em>B.

The affidavit was in proper form, but the magistrate certified \u201c that after due hearing I am satisfied, upon the evidence, that the charge made in said affidavit is true,\u201d instead of certifying that \u201cI am satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge made in said affidavit is true.\u201d Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>162, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\"><em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>130 Mass. 298, decides that a recital in the certificate of the magistrate that \u201c satisfactory cause \u201d has been shown, is not equivalent to a statement that he is satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge contained in the affidavit is true. The reason is, that the statutes require that the certificate of the magistrate shall show that there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific charges contained in the affidavit, or some of them, are true. See <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>5 Allen, 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\"><em>Stone </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>13 Gray, 575, is cited as deciding, among other things, that an affidavit under the St. of 1857, <em>c. </em>141, \u00a7 17, is not sufficient to authorize an arrest on mesne process, if the affiant makes oath that \u201c he believes said defendant has property not exempt from being taken in execution,\u201d &amp;c., but does not also make oath that \u201c he has reason to believe \u201d this. The affidavit required was that of the plaintiff, or of some one in his behalf, and the oath of such a person that he believes a charge to be true was held not to be the same in substance as an oath that he both believes it, and has reason to believe it. See <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Melius, </em>8 Allen, 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">But the magistrate, in determining what is proved to his satisfaction, acts judicially upon evidence; and we are of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that he cannot judicially find and certify that he is satisfied, upon the evidence, that a charge is true, without finding that there is reasonable cause to believe it to be true, and that the certificate in this case necessarily involves the finding that there is, in the judgment of the magistrate, reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
