This will is somewhat inartificially drawn, but the testatrix has expressed in language as positive and definite as could be chosen, and with some unnecessary repetition, apparently to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>force and emphasis thereto, her intention to give absolute and unconditional legacies of $10,000 each to her brothers, the defendants Emery B. and Gardner P. Fisher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-4\">By article 6 of the will- she creates a fund of $20,000 for the . use of her mother during her life, but, though the legacies are coincident in amount with this fund, they are not given out of the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">Article 7 commences thus: \u201c I give, devise, and bequeath out of my estate, after my said mother\u2019s decease, .... the sum of ten thousand dollars each,\u201d &amp;c. Having completed the sentence in which these legacies are given, she disposes, in a new sentence, of the remainder of said principal sum or insurance, or its increase thereon, but, as though this allusion to this remainder of said principal sum might raise an implication or create an inference that the two legacies above mentioned were limited to or contingent upon the existence of said fund, she adds, \u201c But it is hereby provided, and it is my will, that at any time after the decease of my said mother, if my said brothers, or the survivor of them, shall request my said trustees in writing, desiring the full payment of the ten thousand dollars to each of them without condition, that the same shall be paid to them absolutely; \u201d and then, that, \u201c if requested by the survivor of my said brothers, tho full sum of twenty thousand dollars, absolutely, without condition, out of my estate, by said trustees shall be paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">She seems to have striven, by continued iteration and the use of most emphatic language, to express her intention that this sum of $20,000 should be paid out of her estate. The words \u201cout of my estate\u201d were fitly chosen, and they had a definite meaning, which was distinctly in the mind of the testatrix. In article 2 she directs her executors to pay for a watch \u201c out of any funds belonging to my estate.\u201d In article 5 she gives five legacies of $50 each \u201c out of my estate.\u201d By article 6 she creates the fund of $20,000 for the benefit of her mother out of certain policies of insurance payable to her, but if these prove insufficient, she adds, \u201c then out of any moneys belonging to my estate.\u201d In article 7, now under consideration, she continues the use of these words by giving these legacies \u201c out of my estate,\u201d and declaring that the same shall be paid without condition \u201cout of my estate.\u201d In article 8 she requests her executors, \u201c with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>any funds in their hands belonging to my estate,\u201d to purchase certain books for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-4\">The word \u201c estate \u201d in a will includes everything, unless restrained by particular expressions. <em>Turbett </em>v.

If, by implication, it could be held that these legacies were made payable out of the fund created by article 6 of the will, then these two legacies are demonstrative, and not specific.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">In <em>Savile </em>v. Blacket, 1 P. Wms. 777, Lord Chancellor Macclesfield said: \u201c If a legacy was given to J. S. to be paid out of such a particular debt, and there should not appear to be any such debt, or the fund fail, still the legacy ought to be paid, and the failing of the <em>modus </em>appointed for payment should not defeat the legacy itself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">In <em>Paivlefs </em>case, T. Ravm. 335, the testator, by will made in 1619, gave a legacy to his niece in these words: \u201cI do ordain and give to my dear niece F. R., second daughter of my brother, D. R., the sum of \u00bf\u00a3500, which my sister, the Lady Cholmeley, hath now in her hands of mine, as by her bond made to me and my heirs appears.\u201d He died in 1669. About ten years before his death the Lady Cholmeley paid to him the \u00bf\u00a3500, ahd whether this legacy was due was the question.. It was resolved \u201cthat the legacy was due, though the security was altered; because it is a pure legacy, neither <em>legatum nominis </em>nor <em>legatum debiti; </em>and the words are only to show that he meant the legacy should be as certain to her as he could make it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-8\">In <em>Rider </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>2 P. Wms. 328, it is said in argument: \u201c Where a sum certain is given out of any fund, if the testator himself in his lifetime receives it, whereby his personal estate is increased, this must be made good to the legatee out of some other part of the personal estate; but where the thing given is specific, viz. such a debt, or the residue of the said debt, and the testator himself afterwards receives in this debt, as the devise is specific, and the thing <em>in specie </em>by the act of the testator does not continue to have any subsistence, this is properly and reasonably an ademption of the legacy; and that it is a material distinction where the testator himself calls in a debt which he has devised by his will, and where the debtor, unprovoked or uncalled upon, pays it in; for in the latter case it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>said to be the act of the testator, and therefore would be no ademption nor revocation of the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-4\">In <em>Cartwright </em>v. Cartwright, before Lord Bathurst in 1775, a note of which appears in the decision of <em>Ashburner </em>v. <em>Macguire, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 114, the bequest was, \u201c I give \u00bf\u00a31400 for which I have sold my estate this day, &amp;c.\u201d The testator afterwards received the whole money, paid it to his banker, and drew out of his hands \u00bf\u00a31100 of that money. Lord Bathurst held this to be a legacy of quantity, and that the receiving was no ademption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\"><em>Roberts </em>v. Pococh, 4 Ves. 150, is a case in which a testator gave several pecuniary legacies, and directed the same should be paid out of the moneys that were due to him from a person in the East Indies, upon bond for five thousand pounds. Some time after the death of the testator, the obligor in the bond died insolvent, and it appeared that he was probably insolvent at the death of the testator, and the bond could not be collected. The amount of the bond was somewhat in excess of the legacies; the Lord Chancellor decided that the legacies were to be paid out of the residue, and his opinion contains a very interesting discussion of the questions which arise in this case, and in all similar cases, as to what a testator would have done in an event that was not foreseen by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\"><em>Mann </em>v. Copland, 2 Madd. 223, was a case in which a legacy was decreed to be paid, though the funds out of which it was directed to be paid failed. The testator had given an annuity of ten pounds a year, and had directed that the sum of two hundred pounds, navy five per cents, should be set apart to secure the same. The testator had no navy five per cents, but the Vice Chancellor said that \u201c there must be considered a positive intent to give this legacy; and though the mode by which the payment was to be secured fails, he is yet entitled to have it made good out of the personal estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\"><em>Fowler </em>v. Willoughby, 2 Sim. &amp; Stu. 354, 358, was a case where a pecuniary legacy was directed to be paid by the sale of an estate which the testator had contracted to purchase, but which he never purchased. The Vice Chancellor decreed the legacy to be paid out of the testator\u2019s general estate, \u201cstating that this was neither a <em>legatum </em>nominis, nor a <em>legatum </em>debiti, but a pecuniary legacy with a particular security, which in the civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>law was termed a demonstrative legacy, and that our law followed the civil law in giving effect to such a legacy, where the particular security intended by the testator happened to fail.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">In <em>Willcox </em>v. Rhodes, 2 Russ. 452, a testator gave a number of legacies, adding, \u201c I guarantee my estates at G. for the payment of the above legacies; \u201d and he, in the subsequent part of his will, gave many other legacies. It was held that the first class of legacies were not specific, and, failing the estates at C., were to be borne by the general personal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\"><em>Le Grice </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>3 Meriv. 50, was a case in which A. by will, reciting that it was the wish of her mother and herself that five hundred pounds they had then out upon mortgage should be given to B. and her family, bequeathed the said five hundred pounds, with interest, accordingly. The testatrix at the time of making her will had the sum of five hundred pounds out on mortgage, which she afterwards called in and applied to different purposes. The mother being dead, upon the death of the testatrix without having altered or revoked her will, the question was whether this legacy was due or not. The Master of the Rolls said: \u201c The thing given is not the mortgage, but the money. It is the said sum of \u00a3500 that she gives to her executors. What is the said sum ? That sum of \u00a3500 which belonged to her and her mother, and which at a given time was out upon mortgage. Whether it remained out upon mortgage at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death, appears to me to be a matter of indifference. That circumstance is no ingredient in the gift, either by way of condition, or of inherent description. I am therefore of opinion that the legacy is due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\"><em>Dream </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>20 Beav. 624, reported on appeal in a note to <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>L. R. 4 Eq. 145, was a case in which the testator directed certain legacies to be paid out of proceeds of his real estate to be sold. He proceeded on the assumption that there would be a surplus of the proceeds of sale. , It turned out that there was no surplus, but a deficiency. Sir G. J. Turner, L. J., in delivering the opinion of the Lords Justices, said: \u201c Was it, then, his intention that, in the case of a deficiency, the legatees should lose their legacies ? I think not; for in the clause defining what the residuary legatees are to take, he describes it as 1 the rest, residue, and remainder of the produce of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>his said real and personal estate.\u2019 I think that if legacies had been given out of personal estate, and then a residuary clause in terms similar to these had followed, the legacies would have been held to be charged on the real estate in aid of the personal estate.

The estate was not sufficient to pay the legacies in full. It was held, upon the death of one of the .tenants for life, that the surviving tenants for life were entitled to have the deficiencies in their annuities satisfied out of the released fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">In a similar case, <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>4 Russ. 86, the testator had stated, in a codicil, that upon reflection he considered that there might not be property enough to pay the annuities given by the will, and in that event he directed that an equal deduction be made from each annuity ratably. It was held, upon the strength of the codicil, that at the death of one of the annuitants the sum released fell into the residue. Sir J. Leach, M. R., before whom the case was argued, said that, had it rested upon the will, \u201c the residuary legatees could have taken no benefit, until the annuities were fully provided for.\u201d This remark is quoted with approval by Sir C.

The decision was put upon the ground, that, as the residue was given to the residuary legatee, he was not entitled to receive anything until the annuitants and legatees had been paid in full. And James, L. J., says : \u201c To say that what is included in the residue is something else than residue, is contradicting the plain terms of the will.

Gr.

Fisher and Gardner P. Fisher, that although, by the will of the testatrix, a fund of $20,000 was to be created, the income of which was to be devoted to the mother of the testatrix, who was also their own mother, during her life, and the sums of $10,000 bequeathed to each respectively are coincident in amount with the fund as originally created, and although they were not payable until the death of their mother, yet they are absolute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>unconditional legacies, to be paid out of any funds of the estate. The question arises by reason that the 120,000 fund has been depleted, and two legacies of $10,000 each cannot now be paid in full therefrom. They further contend, that although, by the ninth clause of the will, the residue of the estate was bequeathed to be held in trust for the benefit of the daughters of the testatrix, and such trust estate has been actually formed and dealt with as such during the lifetime of the mother, yet properly there can be no residue, or accurate determination of the amount thereof, until these legacies have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The fund for the benefit of the mother during life was formed, as the will provided, from the proceeds of certain insurance policies held by the testatrix on the life of her deceased husband, with the addition of a sufficient amount from the general funds of the estate to make $20,000. The executors were duly appointed, and they qualified by giving bond as trustees of this estate, as held for the use and benefit of the mother during life, and thereafter for other purposes. The executors never petitioned to be, and never were, appointed trustees of the rest and residue of the estate, but they did transfer and set apart to themselves, as trustees under the ninth clause, the remaining portion of the estate of the testatrix, and have kept the same distinct. They made return, in their second account as executors, of these funds as paid to themselves as trustees, and have subsequently rendered'accounts thereof to the Probate Court, in which the disposition of the funds of this residuary estate and of the income thereof has been separately accounted for by them as such. In regard to this latter fund, the trustees have never given bond as such; but whatever might be the effect of this, if we were considering whether they were still liable upon their bond as executors, this fact does not appear to have the importance which the defendants Fisher attach to it. Nor indeed could the action or failure of action of the executors or trustees control the construction of the will. The question in the case at bar is rather what, by the will, the executors or trustees should have done in regard to the residue after the debts had been paid and after the $20,000 fund was formed, as that may bear upon the construction of the clause by which the two legacies of $10,000 were bequeathed upon the decease of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The portion of the seventh clause by which the gift is made to the two brothers, omitting the contingency of the death of one before the mother, which did not occur, would read as follows : \u201c I give, devise, and bequeath out of my estate, after my said mother\u2019s decease, to the use of my two brothers, said Emery B. Fisher and Gardner P. Fisher, out of my estate, the sum of ten thousand dollars each.\u201d The sixth clause of the will had directed that the fund of $20,000 should be formed, and from what sources it should be formed. As it was provided that the mother should receive the income during life, and as the legacies were not payable until the decease of the mother, there is no difficulty in holding that they were payable primarily from this fund, and that the seventh clause to this extent refers to the fund directed to be formed by the sixth. Even if this is so, it is urged that, while this fund is indicated as that from which they are to be paid, if for any reason there is a failure thereof, the words \u201c'out of my estate \u201d show that they are to be paid from any other property of the testatrix\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Where, even if a legacy is charged upon a particular fund, it appears by the will that it is not to fail by reason of any failure of the fund, or its inadequacy for the purpose, the legacy is held to be demonstrative. That a legacy which is thus charged should be demonstrative, there should appear a fixed separate intent to give the money or legacy independently of the fund. The cases in which the distinction between specific and demonstrative legacies has been pointed out, and in which it has been discussed whether that in dispute was of the one or of the other character, are very numerous, both in England and in this country. Many of them have been well and carefully considered in the argument on behalf of the brothers. We do not think it would be profitable or desirable here to examine or analyze them individually. The circumstances under which all these cases arise, the language and expressions used in the wills to be construed, so differ that we could not expect to find exact similarity with the case at bar, or with any other which might be under discussion. Each must, therefore, be decided with reference to its own circumstances and the peculiar phraseology used. Whether all the cases can be reconciled\" or not, they all proceed upon the principle that whether a legacy is demonstrative or specific must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>be decided by the intent of the testator as it appears from the will; and that, where a legacy is held to be demonstrative, a general intent is shown to have it paid without reference to the fund on which it is primarily charged. <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Creed, 11 </em>Cl. &amp; Fin. 491. <em>White </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>6 Pick. 48. <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>American Bible Society, </em>2 .Allen, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">While the words \u201c out of my estate,\u201d upon which much reliance is placed, would indicate, if they stood alone, that the legacies were to be paid from the general funds of the estate, they are controlled by the other parts of the will, and by its whole general scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The sums bequeathed correspond exactly with that intended to provide the mother\u2019s income, and were only to be paid at her decease. The testatrix had made it certain that this full sum would be put in trust, as her whole property was liable to make it up. The contingency that the sum might increase during her mother\u2019s life had occurred to her, and the terms in which she provides for any excess over $20,000 show that she considers that she has bequeathed the original principal to her brothers. By the latter portion of the seventh clause, she disposes of the \u201c said principal sum or insurance, and its increase thereon over the sum of twenty thousand dollars,\u201d to the uses contemplated by other parts of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It does not seem probable, that, when the whole estate was subjected to the charge of constituting the $20,000 fund from which the brothers were to be paid, the residue, which was to be the basis of a trust for the benefit of the daughters of the testatrix, was again to be subjected to a liability to make it good, should it be afterwards diminished. This is made quite clear by examining the provisions as to the trust contemplated by the ninth clause. From the income of the residue the daughters are to receive their education and maintenance during their minority, to such extent as the trustees deem reasonable, are to receive the income of their respective shares on reaching their majority, and, on attaining twenty-one years or in case of marriage, if they desire, to have marriage portions to the amount of $5000 from the principal. A fund is indicated which must have been intended to come into existence at once, or as soon as in the course of administration it could be formed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and of which during the life of their grandmother the children were to have the benefit. If this fund is subjected to losses which may occur by reason of its liability to' make good the deficiency in another fund, the whole scheme of its administration is impracticable. Mo trustee could determine what expenditure he could make, for the education of the daughters which would be needed during the life of their grandmother, nor pay them the sums bequeathed on their majority or marriage, nor the income at their majority, all which events might occur during the life of their grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the brothers must depend upon the $20,000 fund for the payment of their legacies. A loss to this fund of $13,581.33 was caused by theft, but the fund itself had been increased during the life of the mother, by a rise in the value of the securities in which it had been invested, to $23,737.50. It is contended on behalf of the daughters, that all to which the brothers are now entitled is the difference between $13,581.33 and $20,000, and that the increase over $20,000 is to be transferred, by operation of the last portion of the seventh clause, to the other uses of the will. We cannot concur in this view. \u201c The remainder of said principal sum or insurance, and its increase thereon,\u201d which would pass by this, is only that which is \u201cover the sum of twenty thousand\u201d dollars. When the $20,000 fund was released by the death of the mother from her' charge for income, the first use to which it was devoted was the payment of these legacies. While the brothers must suffer by its diminution by theft, they are entitled to any increase that may have been made, this increase not causing their legacies to exceed $20,000. <em>Instructions accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
