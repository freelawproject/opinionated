The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that the defendant had given only one receipt for the stock in question to the plaintiff, or to any of his family; and that this paper acknowledged, the receipt of the shares from A., and not from the plaintiff. There was also evidence that this receipt was shown by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the defendant\u2019s counsel as one of the papers relating to the action, and that it stated that the shares were received from A. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant\u2019s evidence as to the contents of the receipt was properly admitted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">Contract, upon an account annexed, for money had and received.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvM\">At the trial, there was evidence on the part of the plaintiff tending to show that he deposited with the defendant fifty shares of stock of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad Company; and that the defendant sold them, and applied the proceeds to the benefit of R. J. Dwyer, a brother of the plaintiff. One of the controverted questions of fact was whether the plaintiff had ratified this appropriation of his stock. The bill of exceptions sets out the whole charge of the judge on the subject of ratification, and then says that to \u201c these instructions and rulings the plaintiff excepted.\u201d There were no requests for rulings, and no specifications of any objections to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Such exceptions are irregular and improper, and cannot be entertained by this court. The reasons for this rule are stated in <em>Curry </em>v. Porter, 125 Mass. 94, and are equally applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The plaintiff excepted to the admission in evidence of the contents of a receipt purporting to be signed by the defendant\u2019s agent, which the plaintiff\u2019s mother exhibited to the defendant, in which fifty shares of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad Company were acknowledged to be received of R. J. Dwyer. There was evidence tending to show that the defendant had given only one receipt for Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad stock to the plaintiff, or to 'any of his family; and the plaintiff testified that he took from Ellis, the clerk of the defendant, a receipt running to him, which he had lost. The testimony objected to tended to contradict him, and to support the ground taken by the defendant, that he dealt in regard to the stock with R. J. Dwyer, and not with the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the receipt, because \u201c no connection between the plaintiff and the party producing the receipt was shown.\u201d But beside the close relations, business as well as social, which were shown to exist between the plaintiff and his mother and brother, there was evidence that this same receipt was after-wards shown by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the counsel of the defendant as one of the papers relating to this action. This connected the plaintiff with the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
