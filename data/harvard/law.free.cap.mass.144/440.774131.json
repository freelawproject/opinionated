Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Brigham, C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-10\">It was agreed that, on April 8, 1886, the defendant landed upon the plaintiff\u2019s flats, having come thereto by water, and landing from his boat. Thereupon, the tide being out, the defendant walked along the narrow strip of land or soil between high-water mark and low-water mark, in part consisting of shingle and gravel, and also in part covered with sedge grass, for the purpose of fishing; and he did, while so standing or walking, fish; that he was forbidden by the plaintiff, but continued so to stand, walk, and fish, claiming the right to do so ; that the waters facing said shore are the open, navigable, tidal waters of Buzzard\u2019s Bay; that the damage done to the plaintiff\u2019s close was small; and that the defendant walked, at times, in fishing as aforesaid, within one hundred rods of high-water mark, but he at no time went above high-water mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>On these facts the judge found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-4\"><em>Q.

But the right to take shell-fish is asserted on the single ground that the general right of fishing extends to and includes it. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>and <em>Lakeman </em>v. <em>Burnham, ubi supra. </em>The cases cited show too plainly for further discussion, that, if .there is a right to go upon flats and to disturb the soil for clams, <em>a fortiori </em>there is a right to pass over them for fishing, in the stricter sense of the word. The defendant did not set nets, or create any permanent obstruction, as in <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>24 Maine, 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
