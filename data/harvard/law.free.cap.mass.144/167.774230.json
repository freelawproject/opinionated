It is plain that, on such a finding, the will must be allowed, unless the law requires that a will be read by or to the person executing it. Such is not the law; it is sufficient if the court is satisfied, by competent evidence, that the contents of the will were known to and approved by the person executing it at the time it was executed as a will. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Day, </em>2 Green Ch. 549. <em>Pettes </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>10 N.
