The defendant offered the deposition of a witness to prove it was-a forgery.' It appeared from the face of the paper, that he was examined on interrogatories, and they were not attached. In answer to the second interrogatory, he said, \u201c the <em>\u2018 </em>3\u2019 hundred dollar note, a copy of which is appended to this deposition, dated Aug. 5, 1845, payable to the bearer, was not signed by Daniel Weidner. Both the body of the note, and <em>the </em>signature, is <em>a </em>forgery, I know that fact. Joseph F;.. of.....got the note from me.\u201d A copy was annexed of a note corresponding in date, amount, and time, with the one in suit, and concluding thus, \u201cpurporting to be signed by Daniel Weidner whether it corresponded in other particulars, the paper-book did not show.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">The rejection of this, and the answers to similar interrogatories, was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-10\"><em>Jordan, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAX\">cited 3 Barr, 419 ; 7 W. &amp; S. 392.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Azh\"><em>MiLLer, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"As6\">4 S.
