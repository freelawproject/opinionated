However, contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s determination, the plaintiff\u2019s opposition was sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether he had sustained a serious injury. In addition to evidence of disc herniations and bulges causally related to the accident, the plaintiffs treating physician stated that he had found that the plaintiffs cervical and lumbar ranges of motion were significantly restricted as quantified in his affirmation <em>(see Paz v Wydrzynski, </em>41 AD3d 453 [2007]). In addition, the plaintiffs physician adequately explained the gap in the plaintiffs treatment <em>(see Pommells v Perez, </em>4 NY3d 566, 577 [2005]).
