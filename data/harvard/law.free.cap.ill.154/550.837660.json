Harbord was the owner in fee of the tract on both sides of defendant\u2019s right, of way, including this strip and defendant\u2019s right of way, and on that day conveyed to defendant, \u2018for\" the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating thereon a single or double-track railroad, with all its necessary appurtenances, and for all the uses and purposes connected with the construction, repair, maintenance and complete operation of said railroad, the right of way-over and through said tract, said right of way to comprise land of the width of two hundred feet, to have and to hold the same to said company and its successors and assigns forever, for all lawful uses and purposes incident to a full and indefeasible title in fee simple, or in any way connected with the construction, preservation, occupation and sole enjoyment of the said railroad and lands, of the width aforesaid: Provided, however, that said railroad company shall erect and maintain such lawful fences as will divide the land occupied by said company from the adjoining lands on each side, and as far as possible prevent intrusion upon or passage across said lands and railroad occupied by the company;\u2019 that defendant, shortly after the execution of this deed, erected a substantial post-and-board fence fifty feet from the center of its main track, on each side, so that said fence enclosed land of the width of one hundred feet, or fifty feet on either side, leaving the strip of land in controversy outside its fences, and that Harbord joined his farm fences with these fences, and occupied and used this strip of land as he did the residue of his farm, continuing in possession, raising crops and pasturing until June 4,1860, when he conveyed the entire tract to John Duncan, excepting and reserving as follows : \u2018Excepting and reserving the right of way for the Illinois Central Railroad Company. * * * Por a more full description of such reservation, reference is made to a deed on record from said parties of the first part to said Illinois Central Railroad Company, in recorder\u2019s office;\u2019 that Duncan went into immediate possession and used the land the same as Harbord had done, occupying and using the same up to the company\u2019s fences, until.August 18, 1861, when he conveyed it to Richard O\u2019Connor, excepting and reserving the right of way heretofore deeded by Harbord to the railroad company. O\u2019Connor took immediate possession of the premises under said deed and occupied it, , using all of it up to the fences, renting it at different times, cultivating and pasturing the strip in question the same as the residue of the tract, to the time of his death, February 1, 1873, when, by the terms of his will, duly probated,, the land conveyed by said deed became the property of his widow, Margaret O\u2019Connor, who held, occupied and used the same, including the strip in controversy, just as her husband had done in his lifetime. Some time in 1886 the company took down the fence and erected a new one fifty feet farther from the track, thus entering into and taking possession of the land in controversy. June 18, 1892, Margaret O\u2019Connor died, devising the land to plaintiff. The charter of defendant shall be considered in evidence, and it is admitted that defendant is in possession of its right of way through the said lands conveyed to it by Harbord, and has been in such possession since the date of the Harbord deed, except that the said strip in controversy has been used as aforesaid, and. has operated its line of railroad. It is further admitted that defendant has promptly paid the per cent of its earnings required by the laws of Illinois under the provisions of said charter.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-3\" pgmap=\"552\">The circuit court gave judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appeals.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-4\" pgmap=\"552\">Williams &amp; Capen, for appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-5\" pgmap=\"552(115) 553(20)\">The owner of the fee who grants an easement has a right to the use of the land in any way that does not impair the nse of the easement, and no act of the owner of the fee, by such use, can be construed into a claim adverse to the easement.

J.:</author> <p id=\"AM9\" pgmap=\"554(159) 555(203)\">That the plaintiff below has a perfect title to the fee of the premises in controversy is admitted by the stipulation of facts. All that the defendant claims is, that he held that title subject to an easement in it for right of way for its railroad. The first question suggested upon a consideration of the facts agreed upon by the parties is, has the defendant shown any title whatever to such an easement over this land? Its deed from Harbord did not, by its description, state out of what part of the tract the two hundred feet for right of way should be taken, nor did it convey, as is sometimes done, a certain number of feet on either side of the center of the track. Therefore, until the grantee, by some act on its part, other than the mere location of its track, designated the land claimed by it under the deed, no easement was acquired over any particular land. But when the company came to assert its rights under its deed it took no possession of this piece of land, nor, so far as the agreed facts show, did it in any way indicate that it claimed an easement over it. The deed itself did not specifically convey this fifty feet, nor did the grantee, in exercising its rights under it, assert any title whatever thereto, but, on the contrary, in taking possession under its deed excluded it, \u2014 fenced it out of its right of way. There is nothing in the facts of the case tending to show that it, by act or declaration, construed its deed to include this land for more than thirty years after its date and taking possession under it. \u201cWhere a deed conveying land is of doubtful construction as to the boundaries, the construction given by the parties themselves, as shown by their acts and admissions, is deemed to be the true one, unless the contrary be clearly shown.\u201d (Leonard v. Clark, 1 Metc. 378.) We are at a loss to perceive how it can be maintained that an easement over the land in suit was acquired by the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b555-3\" pgmap=\"555\">But waiving this view of the case, the judgment below is right. Assuming that a right of way was acquired by the defendant to the premises in controversy under its deed from Harbord of April 29, 1852, the controlling question in the case is, had the plaintiff below acquired a good title, as against such right of way, under the twenty years\u2019 statute of limitations, at the time the defendant took possession, in 1886. If he had, his right to use that title, in this form of action, to regain possession is clear, and the case, in all its material facts, is like Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Houghton et al. 126 Ill. 233, and must be controlled by the decision in that case.</p> <p id=\"b555-4\" pgmap=\"555(53) 556(317)\">It is said the Houghton case \u201cdiffers from this, in that there, at the time the railroad company built its fence, Walker claimed, when he joined his fence to it, that he , owned up to the fence, and that by a compromise with the railroad company the line was established at the fence; also, that Park\u2019s administrator had the land surveyed up to the fence, and sold it by the acre according to that measurement, and the court, from these facts, held that the possession was adverse.\u201d There is nothing in the Houghton case to show that Walker claimed to own to the railroad fence except by his acts, and certainly nothing to indicate that by compromise between him-and the company the line was established at the fence. As shown by the opinion in that case, no such fact entered into its consideration and decision. While it did appear there that the land was sold by the administrator of Park to Houghton to the fence, that sale was not made until June, 1873, \u2014 less than fourteen years prior to the bringing of that suit. Hence that fact was not, as also appears from the opinion, the basis of the decision. It was insisted in that case, as it is here, that the Statute of Limitations did not run against appellant, because, its right of way being but an easement and the fee remaining in its grantor and his subsequent grantees, who had a lawful right to any possession and use of the land consistent with the company\u2019s exercise of its right to the easement, there was no hostile or adverse occupancy,\u2014 and that, in the most favorable view of the case to appellant, is the controlling- question here. We did not then, nor do we now, ignore the general rule that where an easement exists over land, the owner of the servient estate may occupy and use the premises as he pleases, so long as he does not interfere with the use of the ease-' ment, and therefore such occupancy and use are never adverse. The exercise of the. one right in such a case is consistent with the existence and exercise of the other.</p> <p id=\"b556-3\" pgmap=\"556(64) 557(345)\">But we held in the Houghton case, upon the authorities cited and for the reasons given in the opinion, that, in view of the peculiar character of the easement which this appellant acquired in the land covered by its right of way, the case was not within that rule, and we said : \u201cWhile we are not disposed to hold that the deed from Walker to the plaintiff conveyed to the plaintiff an estate in fee in the right of way, it is clear that it conveyed an estate which, so far as the right of possession for railroad purposes is concerned, had most of the qualities of the fee. The right of possession thereby conveyed was exclusive, and was wholly inconsistent with the subsequent possession of the land, or any part of it, by the grantor or his assigns for purposes of grazing or agriculture, or as a part of the farm to which it originally belonged.\u201d After a careful re consideration of the question we can discover no sufficient reason for departing from the conclusion there announced. To say that to enclose the right of way of a railroad with farm lands, cultivate and pasture the same, and use it in all respects as the lands with which it is enclosed, for agricultural purposes, does not impair its use by the railroad for right of way, is, to our minds, absurd. While the argument of counsel proceeds upon the assumption that the two uses are not incompatible with each other, the facts clearly prove that the railroad company had a very different understanding. For more than thirty years it abandoned all use of the land, fenced it out of its right of way, and allowed it to remain in the exclusive possession and use of the owner of the fee. When it desired to use it, it attempted to exclude the owner of the servient estate from the same. It is not denied that if the controversy between these parties had been as to the ownership of the fee simple title to the premises, plaintiff\u2019s possession would have been a complete bar, under the Statute of Limitations, to any right in the defendant, and we are at a loss to perceive how, under the facts of the case, it is less so as against the claim to a mere easement. See Peake v. Nace, 2 Whart. 123; Galveston v. Williams, 69 Tex. 449.</p> <p id=\"b557-5\" pgmap=\"557\">In any view which can be taken of the case the judgment of the circuit court is right, and should be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"Anj\" pgmap=\"557\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
