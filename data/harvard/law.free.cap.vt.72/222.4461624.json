All of the defendants answered and incorporated a demurrer into their respective answers. Before any orders were made in the case the defendants moved for a trial by jury upon the issues of fact. The cause was heard on said demurrers and on the motion for a trial by jury at the June Term, 1899, before <em>Thompson, </em>Chancellor, who denied said motion, overruled the demurrers and adjudged the bill of complaint sufficient. Thereupon the defendants moved to have the benefit of their demurrers reserved to them till final hearing, and to have their answers brought forward for hearing. This motion was denied and the bill taken as confessed as to all of the defendants. It was further adjudged and decreed that the common nuisance, set forth in the complaint, had been kept and maintained as charged in the bill and that the defendants and each of their servants, agents, lessees, tenants and assigns be perpetually enjoined from keeping and maintaining such nuisance and from suffering it to be maintained, and that the defendants pay costs. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-10\">The bill of complaint was filed May 25, 1899, and charged that certain rooms in a building in St. Johnsbury, owned by the defendant Bank and Trust Company, were kept and maintained as a liquor nuisance by its occupants, the defendants F. A. Allison and Campbell Davie. The bill of complaint in this case did not allege a conviction at law of the occupants, or of either of them prior to the bringing of the bill. It contained no allegation of knowledge on the part of the Citizen\u2019s Bank and Trust Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The bill prayed for the injunction granted by the Chancellor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-5\"><em>Leighton P.
