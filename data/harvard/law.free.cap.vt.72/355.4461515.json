The defendant then lived in North Troy, but some months after, moved onto a farm six miles away, and has lived there ever since. At one time while living there, he let a man in North Troy have two running cords of stove wood for cutting ice for him. At another time, he gave a tenant in one of his houses in North Troy, eight cords, instead of fixing up the house and making it warmer, and to keep the tenant from going out. These are the claimed breaches. But they are no breaches. The word \u201c business \u201d is not used in the contract to denote an isolated act or two of disposing of wood for the special convenience and interest of the defendant, but an aggregation of acts that may fairly constitute the carrying on of the <em>\u201c </em>wood business \u201d as defined in the contract. This is the meaning given to the word in the construction of contracts of insurance, and in determining whether the testimony shows a violation of agreements of the character of the one in suit. Thus, in <em>Hoagland </em>v. <em>Segur, </em>38 N. J. L. 237, the defendant agreed to abandon and not engage in the business of banking; and it was held that the single act of taking deposits was no breach. So in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>2 El. &amp; Bl. 512, the defendant agreed not to carry on the business of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>wine merchant within certain limits. But he systematically solicited orders therein and filled them, though he had no place of business there; and it was held a breach, because he did it on system, the court saying that if he had done it only now and then, to oblige an old customer or the like, it would have been no breach, for it would not have been carrying on business. A solicitor does not \u201c carry. on business \u201d outside 'of the limits within which he is authorized to practice by his certificate, merely because of a single isolated transaction outside of those limits. <em>In Re </em>Horton, 45 L. T. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">The cases of <em>Clark </em>v. Crosby, 37 Vt. 188; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>49 Vt. 393; <em>Stevens </em>v. Pillsbury, 57 Vt. 205 and <em>Borley </em>v. <em>Mc</em>Donald, 69 Vt. 309 \u2014 relied upon by the plaintiff \u2014 are not opposed to this view. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Crosby </em>does not touch the' question. The others are properly distinguished hy the defendant\u2019s counsel when they say that \u201c in each, it is not the particular act that is held to constitute the breach, but the fact that the defendant had entered upon a business, a systematic course of action, of which the specific acts were the natural outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">There being no evidence to sustain the verdict,</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, verdict set aside, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
