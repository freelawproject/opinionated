Such examination was not permitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">The respondent\u2019s counsel also asked leave to examine the jurors as to their belief in the prohibitory liquor law, and as to whether they would require a different degree of faithfulness in the discharge of a duty under that law than they would in the execution of duty under any other law. Such examination was not permitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">The evidence on the part of the State tended to show that on July <em>i, </em>1899, one M. M. Gordon, acting for the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>for Washington County, handed to the respondent two complaints signed by said state\u2019s attorney, one of which, on due allegations, prayed for a warrant to issue from the City Court of Montpelier directing search for intoxicating liquor to be made on the premises of the said Bianchi in Montpelier, and the other of which charged the said Bianchi with owning, keeping and possessing intoxicating liquor with intent to dispose of the same in violation of law. The evidence of the State further tended to show that unsigned warrants, such as the complaints respectively called for, were attached to these complaints, and that, in so delivering the complaints to the respondent, the said Cordon asked the respondent to have the warrants signed by the judge of the City Court of Montpelier, and to search the said premises of the said Bianchi. The evidence on the part of the State further tended to show that on the same 1th day of Jilly the respondent went to the house of the said Bianchi and told her that he had with him a search warrant for the search of her house, to see if he could find any liquor, that he had a paper all ready to search the house, and that upon being asked to show his warrant he produced as such war rant a paper having the name of the said Bianchi upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">The respondent claimed that the warrants referred to were never signed, and introduced in evidence complaints with unsigned warrants attached, which he claimed to be the papers delivered to him by said Cordon as aforesaid. The substance of the testimony of Mr. Cordon as to the identity of these papers is set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">A narrative of what the evidence of the State tended to show as to the circumstances of the bribery found by the jury is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">When, as above stated, the respondent went to the house of Mrs. Bianchi on July 1th and told her that he had a search warrant to search her premises for intoxicating liquor and showed a paper which he claimed was such warrant, he told Mrs. Bianchi that if she would pay him one hundred dollars he would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>search the house. Mrs. Bianchi asked for what purpose she had to pay him that money, and he replied, in substance, that he had ten or fifteen witnesses who had been up to her house to drink, and that the best thing was for her to pay the money; that he had come to serve the warrant and take her away if she didn\u2019t pay it, and that, if she settled with him for the one hundred dollars, he could save her two hundred or three hundred dollars the next time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">Mrs. Bianchi did not then agree to pay, but told the respondent that she couldn\u2019t pay then and that he would have to wait a few days. On the 7th of the same month the respondent again went to the house of Mrs. Bianchi, and again referred to the matter of the payment of the money and was told by her that she had not the money ready, and that he would have to wait until the next day or the day after, whereupon the respondent went</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">In the meantime Mrs. Bianchi had consulted with William A. Lord, an attorney at law, and under his advice and by his direction, arrangements were made such that Mr. Lord and Charles C. Graves, sheriff of Washington County, went to the house of Mrs. Bianchi on the next day, the 8th of July, at about one o\u2019clock in the afternoon and remained there until about six o\u2019clock. The respondent not coming during that time, Mr. Lord and Sheriff Graves made arrangements for a son of Mrs. Bianchi to go to the respondent and tell him that if he wanted to see Mrs. Bianchi he had better come that evening, as she was going away the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABY\">The son acted accordingly, and the respondent, the same afternoon or evening, went to the house of Mrs. Bianchi and met her in the sitting room of said house. Mrs. Bianchi opened the conversation about the money by asking the respondent if she had got to pay him that hundred dollars, and he replied: <em>\u201c </em>Why, no, you haven\u2019t got to pay it to me, there is no way I can compel you to pay it to me, but you know, as I told you the other day, there are other matters pending \u2014 those witnesses, \u2014 and if you don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>pay me it will cost you a good deal more, and it will be a great deal better for yon if you pay it to me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">Mrs. Bianchi then said: \u201c Well, now if I pay you this hundred dollars, what do I get for it ?\u201d and the respondent replied: \u201cWell, this matter \u2014 these cases \u2014 this pending case\u2014 that ends that, and then you will get protection in the future. If there are any warrants out against you in any way, I am in a situation to know it, and you will be informed of it and you will get protection.\u201d At this point the respondent asked if there was any one in the back room, referring to an adjoining room over the door-way of which there was only a curtain. Mrs. Bianchi replied, \u201c no,\u201d and then spoke of her being poor, and asked the respondent if he couldn't take $75, if that wouldn\u2019t settle it. The respondent replied : \u201c Well, this is pretty \u2014 scaly business for me, but I guess I can fix it up with those other people. You understand that I am not .to have this money; I can fix it up with those other people. Yes, I will take $75.\u2019.\u2019 Thereupon Mrs. Bianchi counted out the sum of $75 in money, counting aloud, and put the money on a small centre table up to which the respondent was then sitting, putting the money close to the edge of the table, next to and directly in front of 'the respondent; the respondent said either \u201c I thank you,\u201d or <em>\u201c </em>I am much obliged,\u201d and added, \u201c That will settle the matter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">During this conversation and 'these proceedings, Sheriff Graves and Mr. Lord had been secreted in the adjoining room referred to by the respondent in his inquiry of Mrs. Bianchi, and they now came into the room where the respondent was and the sheriff demanded and took the money and arrested the respondent. Shortly after, the sheriff, Mr. Lord and the respondent were left alone in the room, and the respondent then said to Mr. Lord and the sheriff : <em>\u201c </em>Now we are all alone, there is nobody here, and can\u2019t we fix this up some way ?\u201d The sheriff replied, \u201c George, there has been too much fixing up, and I don\u2019t know of any wayand Mr. Lord said that he didn\u2019t know of any way to compromise the crime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>There was evidence tending to show that the course of conversation and conduct on the part of Mrs. Bianchi, at the time of her interview with the respondent last recited, was generally, but not particularly, in pursuance of a plan that had been formed by Mr. Lord and Sheriff Graves and communicated to Mrs. Bianchi, and that she was told by the sheriff that the respondent should not take the money from the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">When the State rested its case, the respondent moved the court to direct the State to elect upon which count in the indictment it would rely for conviction.

It was not error for the trial court not to permit the respondent to examine jurors as to whether they were clients of W. A. Lord who was to be improved as a witness. Whether they were his clients or not in no way affected their competency as jurors so far as disclosed by the record. It was clearly within the discretion of the court to permit or refuse the inquiry. Nor was it error for the court not to permit the respondent to examine the jurors \u201cas to their belief in the prohibi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tory law and as to whether they would require a different degree of faithfulness in the discharge of a duty under that law than they would in the execution of duty under any other law or process.\u201d Such inquiry could have no tendency to determine the question whether the jurors were legally qualified to try the respondent for the crime of bribery with which he was charged. The refusal of the inquiry was clearly within the discretion of the court and so far as the record shows such discretion was properly exercised. 1 Thomp. on Tr., secs. 73, 101; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Buzell, </em>16 Pick. 154; <em>State </em>v. Flint, 60 Vt. 314; Thomp. and Merriam on Juries, secs. 193 and 245, (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">II. It was a material question whether the respondent had in his possession a complaint and properly signed warrant against Mrs. Bianchi at the time he took the alleged bribe from her and during the negotiations leading up to it. When the complaint and warrant were delivered to him July 4, 1899, the warrant was not signed, and against his exception, the State was permitted to show by the witness,, Gordon, that at the time of such delivery, he requested the respondent to have the warrant signed by the clerk of the City Court of Montpelier. Gordon was the clerk of the state\u2019s attorney, and in what he did, acted for him. The subsequent declarations of the respondent put in evidence tended to show that he had such a warrant properly signed at the time in question. This testimony of Gordon tended to show how the respondent came to have the warrant and in connection with his declarations bore upon the probability of its being properly signed. Hence it was not error to admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">III. The bribe was taken by the respondent from Mrs. Bianchi July 8, 1899. Subject to the exception of the respondent, the State was' permitted to introduce evidence tending to prove that he went to the house of Mrs. Bianchi July 4, 1899, and then and there informed her that he had in his possession a search warrant to search her premises for the purpose of finding intoxicating liquor therein kept in violation of law, and that he then and there entered into negotiations with her to pay him $100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not to serve the warrant, and that when he left her house on that occasion the matter of such payment was left open for her consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The specific ground of this exception was that what transpired between Mrs. Bianchi and the respondent July 4, was not connected with the transaction of July 8. But this contention is contrary to the facts of the case. The evidence tended to show that the negotiations of the respondent with Mrs. Bianchi for the payment of the bribe were resumed July 7, and finally consummated in what occurred July 8, when a bribe of $75 was finally paid him by her and accepted by him. What occurred between them July 4, and from thence on until the money was paid July 8, was part of the transaction, and together constituted it. It is always permissible to show the various steps taken by the accused in committing the crime with which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">IY. The two counts in the indictment were for one and the same offence. The respondent excepted to the refusal of the trial court to compel the State to elect upon which count it would rely for conviction. It was clearly within the discretion of the court to grant or deny this motion. Its action was in accord with the established practice' of this State. 1 Bish. Cr. Proc. (1st ed.) secs. 205 and 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">YI. At the time in question, the respondent was a deputy sheriff, and in what he did in respect to the warrant against Mrs. Bianchi, he was acting as such deputy sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In charging the jury the court in speaking of bribery, among other things said : \u201c Bribery is the receiving or offering any undue reward, by or to any person whomsoever, whose ordinary business or profession relates to the administration of public justice, in order to influence his behavior in the office, and to incline him to act contrary to his duty and the known rules of honesty and integrity,\u201d to which the respondent excepted. Yermont Statutes, sec. 5086, under which the respondent was indicted, provides that \u201cAn executive, legislative or judicial officer,who corruptly accepts a gift or gratuity, or a promise to make a gift or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>do an act beneficial to such officer, with the understanding that he will be influenced thereby in any official act, shall forfeit his office, be forever disqualified to hold any public office, trust or appointment under the State, and be imprisoned in the state prison not more than ten years, or fined not more than one thousand dollars.\u201d The respondent contends that the definition of bribery given by the court was erroneous, because it does not state that the gift or gratuity must be accepted with a corrupt intent and with the understanding that the party accepting the same will be influenced thereby in an official act, and that these are essential elements of the offence under the statute. The definition used by the court is that given in Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary and is supported by authority. 1 Buss, on Crimes *154; 2 Bish. Or. Law (4th ed.) sec. 95. It includes corrupt intention, and the acceptance of the gift or gratuity with the understanding that the party accepting it shall thereby be influenced in his official acts. The court further instructed the jury in substance that, in order toponvict, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent received the money with the corrupt intent and with the understanding that he should be corruptly influenced thereby in his official acts as such deputy sheriff. The charge on this point was so explicit that the jury could not have been misled by it into finding the respondent guilty on less proof than required by Y. S., see. 5086. This exception is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"Asp\">YII. While instructing the jury, the court, referring to the testimony of Gordon in respect to a complaint and blank warrant produced by the respondent on trial, said, \u201c that he thinks the complaint and blank warrant shown him upon the stand was the one that he made out and handed to this respondent for that purpose. He says he is not positive of that.\u201d To this the respondent excepted and now contends that it was a misstatement of Gordon\u2019s testimony not cured by ,, the further instruction to the jury that they were to take the testimony as they remembered it and not as the court stated it, as it might be mistaken about it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>When interrogated as to the identity of the blank warrant, Gordon first said that he did not know whether or not it was the one he gave the respondent July\u00e9; upon further inquiry he said \u201c I think that is the one \u2014 I am satisfied now.\u201d <em>Q. </em>\u201c You are satisfied now?\u201d Ans. \u201cIt is my judgment that it is the one, but I wouldn\u2019t be positive.\u201d Again, a few questions later, he said, \u201c I think it is. I am satisfied that it is.\u201d Nowhere in the testimony was he more positive in regard to the identity of the paper in question. Taken as a whole, the court correctly stated to the jury the legal tendency of this evidence, and this exception cannot avail the respondent, as the weight of the testimony was left to the determination of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">VIII. The respondent excepted to the charge of the court as to what would constitute an acceptance by the respondent of the money claimed to have been paid him by Mrs. Bianchi as a bribe. The instruction was in substance that, if she paid him the money and passed it from her control to his, and he assumed control of it, understanding at the sam\u00e9 time that he accepted it, and that it thereby had passed from her control into his, it would constitute an acceptance by him. In this there was no error. The evidence tended to show that he accepted and assumed control of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">IX. The conduct of the respondent, when surprised by Sheriff Graves and W. A. Lord, with the money on the table before him, and the fact that he did not then deny having taken it, was in evidence, and the court properly charged the jury that it bore upon the question of the acceptance of the money by him. The exception to this part of the charge was general and the court had a right to understand that the exception was to the law involved in the instruction, and not to the language used in narrating tire occurrence to the jury. Hence this exception cannot avail the respondent, and it is not necessary to decide whether the court made an improper inference from the evidence in stating this phase of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>X. Shortly after the respondent was thus surprised by Graves and Lord, they were left alone in the room with him, and he then said to them, \u201cNow we are all alone, there is nobody here, and can\u2019t we fix this up some wayand Graves replied, \u2018 \u2022 George, there has been too much fixing up, and I don\u2019t know of any wayand Lord replied that he didn\u2019t know of any way to compromise crime. The court charged the jury that what the respondent thus said was evidence tending to prove his guilt, to which he excepted. The respondent now contends that this instruction was erroneous because it was for the jury to say whether this evidence tended to show guilt. It is for the court to instruct the jury as to the legal tendency of evidence and for the-jury to determine its weight in proving or disproving the issue on trial. The evidence in question clearly tended to prove the guilt of the accused, and the instruction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Had Lord and Graves taken money, or a gratuity or reward, or an engagement therefor, upon an agreement or understanding, express or implied, to compound or conceal the crime which the respondent had committed, they would have become guilty of the crime of compounding felony, as the respondent\u2019s ofience is a felony. Y. S. secs. 5165, 5166. It was not error for the court to say to the jury that if Lord, Graves and the respondent had, in fact, thus fixed up the crime, hushed it up by a division of the-money or in any other way, they would all of them have committed a crime by so doing. The court stated the law correctly, and it is not contended otherwise. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fournier and </em>Cox, 68 Vt. 271. The fact that the respondent thus proposed the commission of another felony to conceal the one already committed by him, bore upon the weight of this evidence and was proper for the jury to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">XII. After verdict and before judgment, the respondent moved in arrest of judgment, which was denied, and to this ruling he excepted. The only ground now urged in support of that motion is that the second count is insufficient. The evidence tended to support both counts of the indictment. No question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>is made but that the first count is good. The verdict was general. The verdict' being general, it is to be understood that the jury - found the respondent guilty on all the counts. In such case, the rule is that if any count is sufficient, judgment will not be arrested. <em>State </em>v. Downer, 8 Vt. 425; <em>State </em>v. Davidson, 12 Vt. 303; <em>State </em>v. Hooker, 17 Vt. 669; <em>State </em>v. Bean, 19 Vt. 530; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>22 Vt. 32; <em>State </em>v. Wheeler, 35 Vt. 265; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>61 Vt. 194; 2 Ency. Pl. and Pr. 801; <em>Com. </em>v. Holmes, 17 Mass. 335. The motion in arrest of judgment was, therefore, properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The above opinion was written by Thompson, J., but the Court were not agreed in reference to points Y and XI, as written by him, and since his death the following has been agreed to in respect thereto. Therefore,</p>\n<author id=\"b396-6\">Pee cueiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AC0\">Y. The respondent insists that the court should have sustained the motion for a verdict, for that \u201cthe evidence does not substantiate the first count in that it was not shown that the respondent had a warrant.\u201d There was testimony tending to show that fact, viz., that of M. M. Gordon, who testified that he gave him an unsigned one with directions to procure the signature of the proper authority to it, and testimony tending to show the respondent\u2019s declarations to Mrs. Bianchi, that he had a warrant to search her premises. This was testimony tending to show the existence of such a warrant in the possession of the respondent. The motion was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">XI. <em>(a) </em>The respondent presented ten requests for instructions. Numbers 1, 8 and 9 are not in the record and are therefore waived. The substance of the requests, numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10, is that the jury must be told that in order to convict they must find that at the time when, etc., the respondent'had a legal warrant, duly issued by competent authority, which it was his duty to serve and return as therein commanded; that he accepted and received from one Bianchi the $75 as a gift in consideration, and with the understanding between them, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>would be influenced thereby to neglect his official duty and not serve the warrant and that he was so influenced. In response to these requests, the jury were told that they must be satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the respondent had a warrant to search Mrs. Bianchi\u2019s premises, that he accepted the money, the $75, and that it passed into his control to influence his action as an officer in the matter of the service of the warrant, and that he accepted the money with the felonious intent to be corruptly influenced thereby in the discharge of his official duties in serving the warrant. This was a full compliance with the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>(b) </em>The testimony did not require a compliance with the sixth and seventh requests. There was no testimony in the case tending to show that the transaction was a decoy, nor that Bianchi, Lord, and Graves entered into a conspiracy to cause the respondent to commit the crime. He was not lured into a net or snare. He, himself, set the trap and it does not relieve him from the effect of his crime, that the audience that witnessed its springing was larger than he anticipated and had foreknowledge of the scene to be witnessed. The questions involved in these requests were abstract ones, and were therefore properly ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Judgment that there is no error in the proceedings of the County Court a/nd thaft the respondent take nothing by his exceptions.
