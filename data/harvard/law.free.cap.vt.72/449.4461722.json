Thereafter the building in question was erected on the demised premises by the lessee under his lease. On the 19th day of October, 1899, the plaintiff was in possession of the premises by virtue of a warranty deed from the lessor, and on that day the defendant, acting under the direction of the lessee, entered upon the premises for the purpose of moving the building therefrom and was attempting to do so when the plaintiff notified him to desist and this suit was brought. The suit was brought for the purpose of determining the ownership of the building and the plaintiff on trial claimed only nominal damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-6\"><em>Charles S.

The lease is for five years without reservation of rent, requires the erection of a specified building in one year on pain of forfeiture, and gives no right of removal. The building erected under this lease cannot be treated as a removable fixture. A tenant\u2019s right of removal rests upon the ground that the fixture is annexed for his own benefit, and not to enhance the value of the freehold. An intention to remove it is presumed to- exist at the time of annexation, and this intention is held to prevent its becoming inseparably connected with the realty. But there is no room for these considerations when the demise stands upon a condition which requires the annexation. The only intention which can then be recognized is that evidenced b}' the agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The facts from which a contrary intention would be deduced in the absence of such an agreement are made immaterial by its existence. In whatever manner the fixture may be annexed, the lessee will have no right to remove it, if the lease requires its annexation, and affords no indication that the connection was intended to be temporary. A building erected by a tenant on the demised premises pursuant to a covenant in his lease is not removable, unless the lease gives him a right to remove it. 13 A. &amp; E. Ency.
