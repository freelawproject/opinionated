The rule which prohibits the introduction of parol evidence to vary a written instrument has no application when the legal existence or binding force of the instrument is in question. This evidence was not offered to vary the defendant\u2019s writing, but to show that the note as presented was not his writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">A petition for a new trial in the above case, brought to the Supreme Court by the plaintiff therein, was heard with the case on the bill of exceptions. The opinion states the case on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\"><em>J. J. Lamson </em>for the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\"><em>S. G. Shurtleff </em>for the petitionee.</p>\n<author id=\"b29-9\">Munson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">The note in suit purports to have been witnessed by Allen Perry. Defendant told plaintiff\u2019s counsel before the trial that Perry\u2019s name was not in his handwriting; and the case was prepared upon the theory that the defense would accord with this statement. On trial, to the plaintiff\u2019s surprise, the defendant testified that Perry\u2019s signature was genuine, but that Perry\u2019s wife was the only one present when the note was executed, and that the subsequent affixing of Perry\u2019s name was without authority. The plaintiff thereupon moved for a continuance to enable him to procure the attendance of Mrs. Perry, which motion was overruled. Neither the plaintiff nor his counsel knew that Mrs. Perry was present at the execution of the note until the defendant so testified. The plaintiff now produces in support of his petition the testimony of Mrs. Perry that her husband was present when the note was executed, and affixed his name as a witness in defendant\u2019s presence. This presents a case which entitles the plaintiff to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
