Trial by jury, Windsor County, June Term, 1899, <em>Start, </em>J., presiding. Yerdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The action was brought to recover $246, claimed to have been received by Ormond W. Fletcher, as bailee, for the said Sarah in her life-time, and $183.88 claimed to have been received by him, in a like capacity, after her death for the executor of her estate. The verdict and judgment were for the amount of both sums with interest from October 1, 1898, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">The witness Herrick, referred to in the opinion, was town treasurer of the Town of Chester during a time in which it was claimed that said Ormond W. Fletcher was loaning money to that town. He was called by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">A petition for a new trial brought by the defendant, and based on the ground of newly discovered evidence, was heard with the case on the exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">The newly discovered evidence consisted of a series of checks and a memorandum making up the sum of $245, and tending to show the payment to the said Sarah A. Fletcher, in her life time, of the claim of $245, included in the entire claim sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">The plaintiff - conceded that the evidence in support of the defendant\u2019s petition indicated the payment of the $245, as claimed by the defendant, and proffered a remittitur of that sum.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-8\"><em>Hwnton &amp; Stiehney </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-9\"><em>Gilbert A. Davis </em>and <em>George A. Weston </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-10\">Taft, C. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AQG\">Two questions are raised under the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">I. The first item sought to be recovered was less than ten years old and the court were requested to charge that payment might be presumed from lapse of time. The court omitted to so charge. If a presumption of payment ever arises as matter of law from lapse of time, it never does in so short a period as ten years. It does not arise, as matter of law, short of a period of twenty years ; and even then it is but a presumption, subject to be removed by evidence. The request was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">II. Herrick testified that during the time it was claimed Ormond was holding Sarah\u2019s money, he loaned money to the town,thereby rendering it improbable that he kept her money. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>cross-examination made it certain that the transaction was a loan, by showing that a note was given for the money and was an aid, instead of harmful, to the defendant. There was no error in permitting the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The petitionee concedes that in respect to the item of $245.00 included in the judgment a new trial should be granted, and proffers a remittitur of that sum from the judgment. There is no testimony in support of the petition for a new trial in respect to the sum of $183.88. Therefore if a remittitur is entered, judgment may be affirmed with damages of $183.88 with interest since 1 Oct., 1898, and costs \u2014 and ordered certified to the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>The petition for a new trial dismissed, with costs to the petitioner.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
