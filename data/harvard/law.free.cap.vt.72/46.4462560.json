The case is so needlessly here that we do not consider the question on its merits, but reverse <em>pro forma, </em>sustain the demurrer, and remand, that the State\u2019s Attorney may ask leave to amend the information, which he ought to have done at once on the objection being made. It is not well that the course of justice should be obstructed by impediments that can be so easily removed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
