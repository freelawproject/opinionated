With the exception of the grasses (Exhibit 13), the Circuit Court affirmed the Board\u2019s conclusion that all the foregoing were properly classified under paragraph 425, tariff act of 1897 (Act July 24, 1897, e. 11, \u00a7 1,. Schedule N, 30 Stat. 191 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1675]), relating to ornamental leaves. Said grasses the Circuit Court held dutiable as \u201cmanufactures\u201d of grass under \u2019paragraph 449. The evidence was undisputed that some of them had been bleached and the remainder dyed. In these appeals it is contended toy the government that the assessment under paragraph 423 should have been affirmed, while the importers contend that the Circuit Court should have held the goods to be free of duty under paragraph 566, relating to \u201cgrasses * * * not dressed or manufactured,\u201d citing as authority for this proposition Bayersdorfer v. United States, 122 Fed. 968, and United States v. Richard, 99 Fed. 262. The testimony showed Exhibits 2, 3, and 11 (areca, cycas, and phenix leaves) to consist of palm leaves that had been subjected to a process for restoring or preserving their natural appearance and preventing decomposition. The importers contend that they, are dutiable under the provision in paragraph 251 \u201cfor palms preserved, * * * suitable for decorative purposes.\u201d The remaining exhibits (Nos. 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 14) consisted either of wreaths or crosses, which were arranged on wire frames. The frames were estimated by various witnesses to constitute from 5 to 20 per cent, of the cost of the completed articles. In accordance with the decision of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, in Kreshower v. United States, 152 Fed. 485, the Board and the Circuit Court held these articles to have been properly classified under paragraph 425 (ornamental leaves), as above stated, rather than as articles in part of metal (paragraph 193). The importers contend that they should have been given this latter classification\u2014\u2022 under paragraph 193\u2014on the authority of United States v. Berlinger, 167 Fed. 800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b972-7\">The general testimony was to the effect that the various goods in dispute were sold by florists and undertakers for decorative or ornamental purposes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b972-8\">D.

Both the importer and the government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">The conclusions reached in that opinion commend themselves to us, with the exception of the grasses, which the court below classified under paragraph 449, tariff act of 1897. As to them this court is of opinion that they are more appropriately classified under that clause of paragraph 425 which provides for\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-13\">\u201cartificial or ornamental feathers, fruits, grains, leaves, flowers, and stems or parts thereof, of whatever materials composed, not specially provided for in this act\u00bb fifty per centum ad valorem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>The decree of the court, therefore, so far as the appeal of the importer at No. 18 is concerned, is affirmed; and, so far as the appeal of the government at No. IT is concerned, the decree is reversed, with directions to enter the grasses in question under paragraph 423.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
