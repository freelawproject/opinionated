The only question raised is on a point of practice. The appellee imported certain ornaments made of leather and \u201cartificial silk,\u201d with other materials. The collector held that the goods were composed in chief value of silk, and assessed duty under paragraphs 390 and 391 of the silk schedule, tariff act of 1891, (Act July <em>M, </em>1897, c. 11, \u00a7 1,, Schedule L, 30 Stat. 187 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1670]). The importer protested, claiming that the importations should be assessed under one or other of certain paragraphs which he specifically enumerated by number\u2014\u201cboth directly and by similitude.\u201d Among the paragraphs thus enumerated was No. 322. The Board of General Appraisers found that as to three items leather was the component of chief value, and as to all other items sustained the collector\u2019s assessment and overruled all claims of the importer.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">.Appeal was taken by the importer to the Circuit Court, which re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>versed the Board and held that the merchandise was properly dutiable, by virtue of the \u201csimilitude\u201d section, under paragraph 322. The government, appellant in this court, contends that the importer \u201chad no right to a reversal of the Board of General Appraisers upon a ground not asserted by them in their statement of errors.\u201d The statute (Customs Administrative Act June 10, 1890, c. 407, \u00a7 15, 26 Stat. 138 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1933]) provides that the application for a review by the Circuit Court \u201cshall be made by filing in the office of the clerk of said Circuit Court a concise statement of the errors of law and fact complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The importers filed with the clerk a statement which contained eight separate assignments of error, separately numbered. Of these No. 4 assigned error \u201cin overruling the protests as to the said certain items,\u201d and No. 8 assigned error \u201cin not sustaining the protests as to the said items.\u201d We find no insufficiency in these assignments. They referred to the protest which enumerated the very paragraph (322) on which the importer relies, directly and by similitude, and asserted that the Board erred in not finding tiie protest well taken. The appellant here relies on the decision of Circuit Court of Appeals, First Circuit, in United States v. Brown, Durrell &amp; Co., 127 Fed. 793, 62 C. C. A. 473; but the assignments of error which were held to be insufficient in that'case were that \u201cthe Board erred in revering the decision of the collector,\u201d and erred \u201cin not sxxstaining the decision of the collector.\u201d Such assignments are very different from those in this case, which, by explicit reference to the protest, point out the <em>very </em>paragraph relied upon by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
