If the receiver'has the merchandise, it is difficult to understand upon what theory he can also demand the money that was paid for it. But, however this may be, we are clearly of the opinion that controversies such as this between the receiver and third parties should not be decided summarily on affidavits, but in a plenary suit. Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
