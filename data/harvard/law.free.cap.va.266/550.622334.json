Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">In response to the perceived threat to the infrastructure of Spotsylvania County posed by rapid growth, the Board scheduled hearings for February 6 and 12, 2002 to amend the County\u2019s zoning ordinances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The advertisements stated the time, date, and location of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>hearing. They also listed the zoning districts to be affected, the zoning ordinance section numbers and titles, and stated that the hearing would affect \u201cdevelopment standards.\u201d A reference to the location of the full text of the amendment proposals was also included. Of importance to the case before us, the published notices contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">Amendment(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">02-A Board of Supervisors: Amendments to Chapter 23, Zoning, Article 6, Zoning Districts, of the Code of the County of Spotsylvania, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">Section 23-6.2.4. Development standards. Amend development standards for the agricultural l(A-l) district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Chapter 23, Article 6, Division 2, subparagraph 4 (\u00a7 23-6.2.4 of the Code of the County of Spotsylvania) is entitled \u201cDevelopment standards\u201d and encompasses regulations addressing maximum density, road frontage, open space requirements, minimum lot requirements, and other characteristics. On February 12, 2002, the Board voted to amend these \u201cdevelopment standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Raynold C. Glazebrook and Realco-Route 3, L.L.C. (collectively, \u201cGlazebrook\u201d), along with a number of parties not before us at this time, brought suit against the Board on multiple grounds including a claim that the Board had failed to publish adequate notice of its proposed amendments as required by Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A). The Board demurred and the trial court sustained the Board\u2019s demurrer on all but two counts, which did not apply to Glazebrook. On appeal, Glazebrook\u2019s two assignments of error challenge the sustaining of the demurrer and encompass only one issue. Glazebrook maintains that the publication in the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star provided insufficient notice in violation of Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A). Glazebrook asserts that the Board\u2019s notice that it would \u201c[a]mend development standards\u201d for the named zoning districts was not specific enough to satisfy the requirement that the Board publish a \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d of the action it planned to consider at its hearing. Because of the defect in notice, Glazebrook argues that the ordinance is void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of facts alleged in pleadings, not the strength of proof. We accept as true all facts properly pleaded in the bill of complaint and all reasonable and fair inferences that may be drawn from those facts. <em>W.S. Carnes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>252 Va. 377, 384, 478 S.E.2d 295, 300 (1996); <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>218 Va. 625, 627, 238 S.E.2d 823, 824-25 (1977); <em>Chippenham Manor, Inc. v. Dervishian, </em>214 Va. 448, 450, 201 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1974). Because appellate review of the sustaining of a demurrer involves a matter of law, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The heart of this controversy is the meaning of the phrase \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d in Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">Plans or ordinances, or amendments thereof, recommended or adopted under the powers conferred by this chapter need not be advertised in full, but may be advertised by reference. Every such advertisement shall contain a <em>descriptive summary </em>of the proposed action and a reference to the place or places within the locality where copies of the proposed plans, ordinances or amendments may be examined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">(emphasis added). If the notice published by the Board did not meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 15.2-2204, the Board acted outside the authority granted by the General Assembly and the amendments are void <em>ab initio. See City Council of the City of Alexandria v. Potomac Greens Assoc., </em>245 Va. 371, 378, 429 S.E.2d 224, 228 (1993) (failure to give required notices rendered an ordinance \u201cvoid <em>ab initio\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">A. Definition of \u201cDescriptive Summary\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Parsing the phrase \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d into its component parts, the word \u201cdescriptive\u201d modifies the word \u201csummary.\u201d \u201cDescriptive\u201d means \u201cserving to describe.\u201d \u201cDescribe\u201d means \u201cto represent by words written or spoken for the knowledge or understanding of others.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>610 (1993). A summary \u201ccover[s] the main points concisely\u201d but \u201clack[s] detailed explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2289. Thus, a \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d is a statement that covers the main points concisely, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>without detailed explanation, in a manner that serves to describe an object for the knowledge and understanding of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">This literal definition of the phrase establishes the foundation for interpretation of what satisfies the requirements of Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A). If the notice does not cover the main points of the proposed amendment and does not accurately describe the proposed amendment, it does not satisfy Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A). However, the notice need not contain the full text of the proposed amendment, nor explain the proposed amendment in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Other language of Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A) requires that the notice published by a locality \u201cspecify the time and place of hearing at which persons affected may appear and present their views.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A). This language suggests that the intent of the statute is to generate informed public participation by providing citizens with information about the content of the proposed amendments and the forum for debate concerning those amendments. There is no indication that the General Assembly expected affected citizens to engage in legal research in order to decide whether to participate in the hearing or to decide what their interests may be in a proposed amendment. <em>See also Lawrence Transfer &amp; Storage Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals of Augusta, </em>229 Va. 568, 571, 331 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1985) (determining that the intent of subsection B of the statute replaced by Code \u00a7 15.2-2204 was \u201cto afford property owners who are closest to the land involved an opportunity to be heard by the Board.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In <em>City of Portsmouth </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>198 Va. 247, 251, 93 S.E.2d 296, 300-01 (1956), we held that former Code \u00a7 15.1-152.5, requiring publication of an \u201cinformative summary\u201d of proposed annexations, was designed to \u201csupply those who may be affected thereby, or interested therein, with certain information from which they may determine whether or not to act in support of or against the proposed annexation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although it involves a different portion of the Code, the opinion expresses the same concerns that drive the need for adequate public notice in the zoning context. We have previously stated that, as a whole, Virginia\u2019s zoning statutes are designed to prevent zoning changes from being made \u201csuddenly, arbitrarily, or capriciously.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors of Fairfax County </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Snell Construction Corp., </em>214 Va. 655, 658, 202 S.E.2d 889, 892 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The history of Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A) adds further illumination. Prior to 1992, the statute did not require the notice published by the locality to contain a \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d or a summary of any kind. In 1992, the General Assembly inserted the \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d requirement. Acts 1992 ch. 757. This change by the General Assembly suggests that it is not enough to provide information that will merely direct readers to the physical location of the actual text of the proposed amendments. The \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d requirement goes beyond referral to the primary document.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">B. The Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We must determine whether the notice published by the Board in the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star contained a \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d as required in Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A). The notice merely stated that the \u201cdevelopment standards\u201d for the specified zoning districts in question would be amended. \u201cDevelopment standards,\u201d as the phrase is used in the ordinance, is a heading within which are a number of subheadings describing specific regulations. In other words, \u201cdevelopment standards\u201d is the umbrella title for regulations including minimum road frontage, residential and non-residential densities, lot areas for various uses, minimum lot width, and maximum height of structures on the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">We hold that the notice published by the Board did not contain a sufficiently descriptive summary of the proposed amendments to the Spotsylvania County zoning ordinances. No citizen could reasonably determine, from the notice, whether he or she was affected by the proposed amendments except in the most general sense of being located in a particular type of zoning district. Nor could a citizen determine whether the proposed amendments affected zoning issues that were of interest or concern to the citizen. Given the number of issues subsumed under the heading \u201cdevelopment standards,\u201d using that heading as a descriptive summary fails to inform citizens of the universe of possible zoning ordinance amendments in any meaningful way. Both the evolution of the statute and the treatment of analogous statutes illustrate that such a notice is inadequate under Code \u00a7 15.2-2204(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">We do not, in this opinion, attempt to dictate the exact language of future notices, nor do we seek to establish a bright line rule. However, considering the intent and language of the statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>notice in this case was inadequate. Because the notice was inadequate in failing to provide a \u201cdescriptive summary,\u201d the Board acted outside the powers granted to it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.2-2204; <em>Potomac Greens Assoc., </em>245 Va. at 378, 429 S.E.2d at 228. Consequently, the zoning ordinances passed pursuant to the notices published on January 23, January 30, and February 6, 2002 and at issue in this case are void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-15\"> The Board published advertisements in the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star on January 23, 2002 and January 30, 2002 for the hearing on February 6, 2002. The Board published adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tisements in the same newspaper on January 30, 2002 and February 6, 2002 for the hearing on February 12, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\"> The General Assembly has since changed the language to require a \u201cdescriptive summary\u201d of the annexation ordinance. Code \u00a7 15.2-3204. The motivation for the change is not clear and the two phrases are not, on their faces, significantly different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
