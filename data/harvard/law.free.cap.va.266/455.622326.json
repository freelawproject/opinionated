At the time this case was heard in the circuit court, the Fraternity had over 158,000 alumni and about 215 undergraduate chapters located at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. The Fraternity is governed by a five-member \u201cSupreme Executive Committee\u201d (Fraternity Committee) and meets on a biennial basis at \u201cGrand Conclaves\u201d held every odd-numbered year.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In 1965, the Fraternity acquired a contract right to purchase certain real property in Albemarle County. The Fraternity planned to use the property, which was about 17 acres in size and contained various improvements, as the Fraternity\u2019s permanent headquarters and as a \u201cperpetual memorial\u201d to the Fraternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">In 1966, the Fraternity formed a nonstock corporation, Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Inc., a/k/a Kappa Sigma Memorial Foundation (the Foundation), to hold legal title to the property. The Fraternity assigned its contract to purchase the property to the Foundation, and the Foundation acquired legal title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">At the time of purchase, the property contained a \u201cmain house\u201d and a \u201ccarriage house.\u201d The Fraternity used these facilities to house its administrative offices and a museum dedicated to the history of the Fraternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The Foundation\u2019s original articles of incorporation stated that the purpose of the Foundation was \u201cto operate an international fraternity and to promote friendship and brotherly feeling among its members.\u201d The articles also defined the membership classes of the Foundation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(1) ACTIVE CHAPTERS shall be those chartered by the Board of Directors of the corporation and shall be composed of four or more male persons who are students at some one college or university.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">(2) ALUMNI CHAPTERS shall be those chartered by the Board of Directors of the corporation and shall be composed of ten or more alumni of the fraternity residing in or near the same locality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">(3) ALUMNI MEMBERS shall be those alumni of the fraternity who are not affiliated with an alumni chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The articles accorded each of these membership classes voting rights and provided that each alumni member present at the biennial meeting was entitled to cast one vote. The articles also provided for a five-member Board of Directors (the Board) \u201celected by the vote of the members of the corporation at the [biennial] meeting of the corporation to be held every odd numbered calendar year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The Foundation\u2019s biennial meeting was intended to coincide with the Fraternity\u2019s biennial \u201cGrand Conclave.\u201d The five-member Fraternity Committee served as the Foundation\u2019s original Board. However, after 1967, the members of the Fraternity Committee, which were elected by the Fraternity every two years, and the membership of the Foundation\u2019s Board began to diverge.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In 1967, the Board approved certain amendments to the Foundation\u2019s articles of incorporation (the 1967 amendments). These amendments attempted to transform the Board of Directors into a Board of Trustees and provided that the purpose of the Foundation was \u201cto hold property, both real and personal, for the benefit of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.\u201d The 1967 amendments further provided that the \u201cTrustees shall serve for life.\u201d The 1967 amendments were not ratified by the members of the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">In 1974, the Board again voted to amend the Foundation\u2019s articles of incorporation (the 1974 amendments) to qualify the corporation as a charitable organization exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 1974 amendments restated the purpose of the corporation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">The Corporation is organized for educational and charitable purposes. It shall have the power to hold title to property, both real and personal. It shall have the power to solicit funds, to grant scholarships, to conduct leadership training schools and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to cooperate with educational, medical and other charitable institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The 1974 amendments provided that the \u201c[c]orporation shall have no members,\u201d but these amendments were approved only by the Board. The members never ratified the 1974 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In the mid-1970s, the Foundation built a \u201ctraining center\u201d on the property to serve as a conference center. The training center contained a large meeting room and dormitory space to house visiting members of the Fraternity and other guests. The Foundation sponsored leadership conferences at the training center for the Fraternity\u2019s undergraduate chapters. The training center also was made available for the use of other charitable and educational institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">There were various \u201clease arrangements\u201d between the Fraternity and the Foundation. In one such arrangement, the Fraternity entered into a \u201ctriple net lease obligation\u201d with the Foundation to lease space on the premises for the Fraternity\u2019s headquarters. In exchange for its use of the property, the Fraternity paid all the property\u2019s maintenance costs, expenses, taxes, and insurance. In addition, the Fraternity provided all the Foundation\u2019s administrative services and supervised the training facility for the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In recent years, various disputes arose between the Fraternity and the Foundation concerning the lease arrangement, the solicitation of funds for the Foundation, and the Foundation\u2019s use of its charitable assets. In 1999, the Foundation decided to sell the real property for certain stated reasons, including to optimize use of the Foundation\u2019s assets and to comply with the Foundation\u2019s charitable purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">In a letter transmitted in November 1999, the Foundation informed the Fraternity of the Foundation\u2019s decision to sell its real property. In April 2001, the Foundation notified the Fraternity that the property had been listed for sale. The Foundation sought a price of $6,500,000 for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The property, which is the Foundation\u2019s primary asset, had an appraised value of $4,500,000 at the time it was listed for sale. The Foundation also holds cash and investments which primarily have been donated by members and alumni of the Fraternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">The Fraternity and three alumni, Thomas P. Bishop, Kevin S. Kaplan, and E.L. Betz, Jr. (the individual petitioners), filed a \u201cSecond Amended Bill of Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Injunctive Relief, and Petition\u201d against the Foundation and the individual members of its board of trustees (collectively, the Foundation). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Fraternity and the individual petitioners (collectively, the Fraternity) asked the chancellor, among other things, to declare that legal title to the property was held in an express trust by the Foundation for the benefit of the Fraternity, and to place the Foundation\u2019s funds in a constructive trust \u201cfor the furtherance of the charitable and educational goals of the Fraternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The Fraternity also asked the chancellor to declare that the original 1966 articles of incorporation \u201cremain in full force and effect and that all subsequent amendments or restatements of the Articles of Incorporation are null and void\u201d because those amendments and restatements were not ratified by the Foundation\u2019s members. The Fraternity asked the chancellor to order a meeting of the Foundation\u2019s members pursuant to Code \u00a7 13.1-840 for the purpose of electing new directors to the Foundation\u2019s board. In response, the Foundation raised various affirmative defenses, including that certain statutes of limitation barred the Fraternity\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In briefs submitted to the chancellor, the Fraternity argued that its bill of complaint was not barred by any statute of limitations because \u201c[t]he Fraternity responded promptly when its property rights . . . were threatened by sale and it discovered, (through due diligence that it previously had no reason to undertake), that its members had voting rights in [the Foundation].\u201d The Fraternity asserted that the Foundation \u201cdid not breach its trust until November 8, 1999, at the earliest,\u201d when the Foundation announced its intention to sell the property. The Fraternity also contended that the 1967 and 1974 amendments were void, rather than \u201cmerely voidable,\u201d because they were not ratified by the Foundation\u2019s members.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Former Code \u00a7 13.1-236, in effect when the Board approved the 1967 and 1974 amendments, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">Amendments to the articles of incorporation shall be made in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">(a) Where there are members having voting rights, the board of directors shall adopt a resolution setting forth the proposed amendment, finding that it is in the best interests of the corporation and directing that it be submitted to a vote at a meeting of members having voting rights, which may be either an annual or a special meeting. Notice shall be given to each member entitled to vote at such meeting within the time and in the manner provided in this Act for the giving of notice of such meetings of members. The proposed amendment shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>adopted upon receiving more than two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by members present or represented by proxy at such meeting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The chancellor heard the evidence <em>ore terms. </em>In a letter opinion, the chancellor concluded that under the articles of incorporation, the first two classes of membership, the \u201cActive Chapters\u201d and the \u201cAlumni Chapters,\u201d did not exist because they had not been \u201cchartered\u201d by the Board. However, the chancellor determined that the third class of membership, \u201cAlumni Members,\u201d did exist because that class required no other action by the Board to take effect. The chancellor thus concluded that the Foundation was a \u201cmembership corporation whose members consisted of individual alumni members not affiliated with any chartered alumni chapter,\u201d and found that the individual petitioners belonged to this third class.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The chancellor determined that the 1967 and 1974 amendments were invalid because after they were approved by the Board, they were not submitted to a vote by the Foundation\u2019s members. The chancellor concluded that the Foundation held the property in an express trust for the benefit of the Fraternity, and imposed a constructive trust on the Foundation\u2019s assets for the Fraternity\u2019s benefit. The chancellor further determined that the statute of limitations and other affirmative defenses raised by the Foundation did not bar the Fraternity\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In July 2002, after the chancellor issued his letter opinion, Code \u00a7 2.2-507.1 became effective. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">The assets of a charitable corporation incorporated in or doing any business in Virginia shall be deemed to be held in trust for the public for such purposes as are established by the donor\u2019s intent as expressed in governing documents or by other applicable law. The Attorney General shall have the same authority to act on behalf of the public with respect to such assets as he has with respect to assets held by unincorporated charitable trusts and other charitable entities, including the authority to seek such judicial relief as may be necessary to protect the public interest in such assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Thereafter, the Foundation argued that based on Code \u00a7 2.2-507.1, the chancellor lacked jurisdiction to proceed further in the case because the Attorney General had not been joined as a necessary party.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>On July 22, 2002, the chancellor entered a final order incorporating his letter opinion and restating his ruling that the 1967 and 1974 amendments were \u201cinvalid and of no force and effect.\u201d In the order, the chancellor also enjoined the trustees \u201cfrom taking any actions with respect to the business and operations\u201d of the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In addition, the chancellor vacated the positions of all existing directors and officers of the Foundation. The chancellor referred the case to a commissioner in chancery to conduct a meeting of the Foundation\u2019s membership pursuant to Code \u00a7 13.1-840 for the purpose of electing new Board members. The chancellor ordered the commissioner \u201cto supervise the business and operations\u201d of the Foundation until the election of the new Board. The chancellor also rejected the Foundation\u2019s argument that the Attorney General was a necessary party pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-507.1. The Foundation appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Initially, the Foundation contests the chancellor\u2019s jurisdiction to enter the final decree of July 22, 2002, asserting that once Code \u00a7 2.2-507.1 became effective on July 1, 2002, the Attorney General became a necessary party to the suit. We disagree with the Foundation\u2019s contention because the statute did not exist when this suit was filed. In reaching this conclusion, we express no opinion whether the Attorney General is a necessary party in suits of this nature filed after July 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Addressing the merits of the appeal, the Foundation concedes that it did not comply with all requirements in amending its articles of incorporation in 1974. The Foundation argues that, nevertheless, the Fraternity\u2019s challenge to the amendments was barred by the statute of limitations because the Board\u2019s action approving the amendments was merely voidable, rather than void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the Foundation contends that the statute of limitations for challenging the Board\u2019s action began to run in 1974, when the amendments were adopted without approval by the Foundation\u2019s members, and that the limitation periods applicable to the Fraternity\u2019s claims were, at most, five years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The Foundation therefore maintains that any claims by the Fraternity expired in 1979, and that the 1974 amendments remain in full force and effect because they were not timely challenged by the Fraternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In response, the Fraternity argues that its challenge to the 1974 amendments is not barred by the statute of limitations. The Fraternity asserts that under this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Princess Anne Hills Civic League, Inc. v. Susan Constant Real Estate Trust, </em>243 Va. 53, 413 S.E.2d 599 (1992), a voidable corporate act becomes null and void unless it is properly ratified. Thus, the Fraternity contends that the 1974 amendments are null and void because they were never ratified by a vote of the Foundation\u2019s members. We disagree with the Fraternity\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We first note that the form of the present litigation, which is a declaratory judgment suit, does not affect our analysis of the statute of limitations. The applicability of the statute of limitations is governed by the object of the litigation and the substance of the complaint, not the form in which the litigation is filed. <em>See Board of Supervisors v. Thompson Assocs., </em>240 Va. 133, 139, 393 S.E.2d 201, 204 (1990); <em>Friedman v. Peoples Serv. Drug Stores, Inc., </em>208 Va. 700, 703, 160 S.E.2d 563, 565 (1968); <em>see also Johnson </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>582 F.2d 1316, 1318 (4th Cir. 1978). \u201cIf the law were otherwise, the statute of limitations could be rendered meaningless merely by the filing of a declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>Thompson Assocs., </em>240 Va. at 139, 393 S.E.2d at 204. Therefore, we will not permit a complainant to use the declaratory judgment statute as a vehicle to circumvent the statute of limitations applicable to the substance of a complaint. <em>See id. </em>at 139, 393 S.E.2d at 204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Next, we observe that the Fraternity\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Princess Anne Hills Civic League </em>is misplaced. There, the statute of limitations was not asserted as a defense to the challenged corporate act. We were asked to decide whether a deed purportedly executed by a nonstock corporation was void because it had been executed by the corporation\u2019s president without the required approval of the board of directors and the vote of the corporation\u2019s members. 243 Va. at 55-57, 413 S.E.2d at 601-02. We held that because execution of the deed was within the powers conferred upon the corporation by the General Assembly, but the corporation failed to do properly that which it had the power to do, the corporate action executing the deed was voidable, rather than void. <em>Id. </em>at 61, 413 S.E.2d at 604. In the absence of a statute of limitations defense, we further held that the corporate act was subject to challenge and that the deed was null and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>void because the corporation had not complied with all statutory requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 413 S.E.2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Here, because the Foundation has asserted a defense of the statute of limitations, we must determine whether that defense bars consideration of the Fraternity\u2019s challenge to the Foundation\u2019s corporate action adopting the 1974 amendments. We begin by reviewing the relevant powers of a nonstock corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Under Code \u00a7 13.1-884(A), a nonstock corporation is empowered to \u201camend its articles of incorporation at any time to add or change a provision that is required or permitted in the articles.\u201d A similar provision appeared in former Code \u00a7 13.1-235, which was in effect in 1974 when the Board adopted the challenged amendments. Under that section, a corporation was authorized to \u201camend its articles of incorporation ... in any and as many respects as may be desired, so long as its articles of incorporation as amended contain only such provisions as are lawful under this Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The 1974 amendments to the Foundation\u2019s articles of incorporation reflected changes in the Foundation\u2019s statement of purpose and the provisions regarding its membership. Because these provisions plainly were permitted subjects for amendment under former Code \u00a7 13.1-235, the Foundation had the power to make such changes to its articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The Foundation did not comply with the statutory requirements necessary for approval of the 1974 amendments. Under former Code \u00a7 13.1-236(a), amendment of the Foundation\u2019s articles of incorporation required approval of more than two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast by the members present at an annual or special meeting held in conformance with the other statutory requirements. However, because adoption of the 1974 amendments was within the Foundation\u2019s power conferred by statute, the Board\u2019s approval of those amendments was a voidable, rather than a void, act of the corporation. <em>See Princess Anne Hills Civic </em>League, 243 Va. at 61; 413 S.E.2d at 604; <em>Winston v. Gordon, </em>115 Va. 899, 905-06, 80 S.E. 756, 759 (1914); <em>see also Michelson </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>407 A.2d 211, 218-19 (Del. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">We hold that a challenge to a voidable corporate act is subject to a defense of the statute of limitations. A contrary conclusion is untenable because it would require us to assume, in the absence of any authority, that the General Assembly intended to render innumerable corporate transactions, imperfectly executed but within a corporation\u2019s power to act, subject to attack in perpetuity. In addition, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>a conclusion would blur the bright line presently existing between an <em>ultra vires </em>act, in which a corporation lacks power to act, and a voidable act, which is within the lawful scope of a corporation\u2019s power. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 13.1-828; <em>see also Norton Grocery Co. v. Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank of Abingdon, </em>151 Va. 195, 202-03, 144 S.E. 501, 502-03 (1928). Thus, we conclude that the Fraternity\u2019s challenge is subject to the statute of limitations, and we will consider the substance of the claim asserted to determine whether it is time-barred. <em>See Thompson Assocs., </em>240 Va. at 139, 393 S.E.2d at 204; <em>Friedman, </em>208 Va. at 703, 160 S.E.2d at 565; <em>see also Johnson, </em>582 F.2d at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">If we consider the Fraternity\u2019s claim challenging the 1974 amendments as alleging breach of a contract between the Fraternity and the Foundation, or breach of a contract between the Foundation and the individual petitioners, either claim is barred by the five-year limitation period of former Code \u00a7 8-13, because the alleged injury occurred in 1974 and the present suit was filed in 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is a well-established principle uniformly acted upon by courts of equity, that in respect to the statute of limitations equity follows the law; and if a legal demand be asserted in equity which at law is barred by statute, it is equally barred in equity.\u201d <em>Belcher v. Kirkwood, </em>238 Va. 430, 433, 383 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1989) (quoting <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>192 Va. 644, 649, 66 S.E.2d 495, 498 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Alternatively, if we view the Fraternity\u2019s challenge to the 1974 amendments as alleging that the Foundation\u2019s directors breached a fiduciary duty owed to Kappa Sigma Fraternity and to the individual petitioners as corporate members, both those claims likewise are time-barred by the five-year \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision of former Code \u00a7 8-24.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Singer v. Dungan, </em>45 F.3d 823, 827 (4th Cir. 1995); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Cocke, 1 </em>F.3d 396, 401-02 (4th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, we hold that the Fraternity\u2019s claims attacking the validity of the 1974 amendments are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the chancellor erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We next consider the Foundation\u2019s argument that the Fraternity\u2019s assertion of an express trust, and its accompanying request that a constructive trust be imposed on the Foundation\u2019s funds, also are time-barred. The Foundation contends that the limitation period for a claim involving an express trust is five years, whether the claim is based on an injury to property or on the breach of a written contract. The Foundation thus argues that the limitation period on the express trust claim began to run in 1974 because the 1974 amendments were an open and express repudiation of the alleged trust. The Foundation further contends that the Fraternity\u2019s request that a constructive trust be imposed on the Foundation\u2019s funds likewise is barred by the five-year statute of limitations, because any claim to the Foundation\u2019s funds accrued when the Foundation transferred its assets to a charitable corporation exempt from federal taxation for the benefit of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In response, the Fraternity argues that it timely asserted its claim of an express trust and request for a constructive trust. The Fraternity asserts that it was the beneficial owner of the property before and after the 1974 amendments went into effect and that those amendments, which merely changed the Foundation\u2019s tax status, did not constitute a repudiation of the express trust. The Fraternity contends that the Foundation\u2019s \u201cfraud\u201d in attempting to enact the 1974 amendments precludes the Foundation from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense. The Fraternity further contends that its request for a constructive trust was not time-barred because the Foundation\u2019s failure to use the donated funds for their intended purpose represented a continuing violation of the Foundation\u2019s obligation to its donors. We disagree with the Fraternity\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The 1974 amendments, which remain in full force and effect, committed the Foundation\u2019s assets for the benefit of the public. J. Robert Mahoney, who then was Secretary-Treasurer of the Foundation and Executive Director of the Fraternity, acknowledged the effect of this change in the Foundation\u2019s status and purpose in a written statement he made in 1974 to the Director of the United States Internal Revenue Service. Mahoney stated that the new charitable foundation \u201cwill not serve any private benefit of or for Kappa Sigma Fraternity. ... All alumni contributions to [the Foundation] will be used only for public charitable purposes and not for the private use of Kappa Sigma Fraternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We hold that this declaration of fundamental change in the Foundation\u2019s status and purpose constituted a repudiation of any express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>trust maintained by the Foundation for the benefit of the Fraternity. The statute of limitations begins to run on a claim of express trust when the trustee denies or repudiates the trust and the trust beneficiary has actual or constructive notice of this denial or repudiation. <em>Russell v. Passmore, </em>127 Va. 475, 511, 103 S.E. 652, 664 (1920); <em>see Wiglesworth v. Taylor, </em>239 Va. 603, 608, 391 S.E.2d 299, 303 (1990); <em>Broaddus </em>v. <em>Gresham, </em>181 Va. 725, 734, 26 S.E.2d 33, 36 (1943). Because such action by the trustee is an abandonment of the existing fiduciary character of the trustee\u2019s relationship to the trust property, the statute begins to run based on the trustee\u2019s action and notice, unless the trustee has committed a fraud with regard to the giving of notice. <em>Russell, </em>127 Va. at 511; 103 S.E. at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">In the present case, the chancellor did not find that the Foundation was guilty of any fraudulent conduct regarding notice to the Fraternity of the Foundation\u2019s change in purpose and repudiation of its former status holding property for the benefit of the Fraternity. As Mahoney\u2019s statement indicates, the Fraternity had notice of the proposed change in the Foundation\u2019s status and the Foundation\u2019s effective repudiation of any alleged trust relationship for the benefit of the Fraternity. Therefore, any claim of express trust against the Foundation began to run in 1974, when the repudiation occurred. Accordingly, whether the express trust claim brought by the Fraternity is construed as being based on breach of contract, on injury to property, or on breach of fiduciary duty, the Fraternity\u2019s claim was time-barred when this suit was filed in 2001. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-13 and -24.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We also hold that the chancellor erred in imposing a constructive trust on the Foundation\u2019s assets. Because the Fraternity\u2019s challenge to the 1974 amendments and its claim of an express trust were time-barred, the 1974 amendments remain in full force and effect and the chancellor lacked any basis for imposing a constructive trust on these assets.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Foundation next argues that the chancellor did not have authority to vacate the positions of its directors and corporate officers. The Foundation also asserts that the chancellor erred in appointing a commissioner in chancery to manage the Foundation\u2019s assets and operations because Code \u00a7 13.1-910, which sets forth a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>court\u2019s authority to place a corporation in receivership, applies only in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In response, the Fraternity asserts that the chancellor\u2019s actions were proper under Code \u00a7 13.1-840(B), which authorizes a court to enter \u201corders necessary to accomplish the purpose or purposes of the [court-ordered] meeting.\u201d According to the Fraternity, this provision empowered the chancellor to vacate the positions of the Foundation\u2019s officers and directors and to appoint a commissioner in chancery to conduct the meeting and to supervise the Foundation\u2019s affairs. We disagree with the Fraternity\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The language of Code \u00a7 13.1-840 specifies the authority of a circuit court to order an annual or special meeting of a nonstock corporation. This authority includes calling the meeting, fixing its time and place, prescribing the form and content of the meeting notice, and specifying a record date for determining which members are entitled to notice of the meeting and to vote. <em>Id. </em>Because the additional statutory language, authorizing the court to \u201center other orders necessary to accomplish the purpose or purposes of the meeting,\u201d is general in its terms, we consider that language pursuant to the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Under this doctrine, when items with a specific meaning are listed together in a statute, and are followed by words of general import, the general words will not be construed to include matters within their broadest scope but only those matters of the same import as that of the specific items listed. <em>Turner v. Reed, </em>258 Va. 406, 410, 518 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1999); <em>Wood v. Henry County Pub. Schs., </em>255 Va. 85, 94, 495 S.E.2d 255, 260 (1998). Therefore, we hold that the general language quoted above refers to matters of procedure related to organizing and conducting a court-ordered meeting and did not empower the chancellor to assume the role of the corporate members and take action removing the Foundation\u2019s officers and directors from their official positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">We further observe that under Code \u00a7 13.1-857(E), a director continues to serve \u201cuntil his successor is elected and qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of directors.\u201d Because neither of these events had occurred when the chancellor entered the challenged order, his decision vacating the terms of the Board members was erroneous for this additional reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">We also conclude that the chancellor erred in appointing a commissioner in chancery to take control of the Foundation\u2019s operations and assets. Under Code \u00a7 13.1-910(A), a court\u2019s authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>appoint a receiver to conduct the business of a corporation is limited to a \u201cjudicial proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation.\u201d <em>See Commonwealth v. JOCO Found., </em>263 Va. 151, 162, 558 S.E.2d 280, 285 (2002). Because the Fraternity did not seek a dissolution of the Foundation in these proceedings, the appointment of a commissioner to serve the function of a receiver, as well as the commissioner\u2019s actions pursuant to that appointment, must be vacated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">For these reasons, we will reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment, vacate the court\u2019s appointment of a commissioner in chancery to serve the function of a receiver and the commissioner\u2019s actions taken pursuant to that appointment, and enter final judgment in favor of the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\n<em>Reversed, vacated in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\"> On August 31, 2002, a meeting was held pursuant to the chancellor\u2019s ruling at which 186 alumni members were present and elected a new board of directors. However, the chancellor invalidated this election because of the lack of a necessary quorum of about 15,800 members, which number represents ten percent of the over 158,000 alumni members of the Foundation\u2019s third voting class. The Fraternity has since filed a petition to dissolve the Foundation, which is presently pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> Based on our holdings below, we address only the adoption of the 1974 amendments and need not consider the adoption of the 1967 amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-5\"> We do not express an opinion concerning the legal sufficiency of such a contract claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-6\"> We express no opinion regarding the legal sufficiency of such a claim of breach of fiduciary duty.

Members of a nonstock corporation do not have vested property rights based on any provision in the corporation\u2019s articles.
