(VFA), and defendant, ITT Hartford Group, Inc. (Hartford). These litigants were previously before this Court in <em>ITT Hartford Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia Financial Associates, Inc., </em>258 Va. 193, 520 S.E.2d 355 (1999). In that appeal, we set aside a jury verdict in favor of VEA. We held that the circuit court erred because an expert witness was allowed to give speculative opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 201-03, 520 S.E.2d at 359-60. We also concluded that the evidence did not support plaintiff\u2019s claims of actual and constructive fraud. We set aside the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages and its award of punitive damages, which was based upon the claim of actual fraud, and entered final judgment in favor of Hartford on that claim. We reversed the judgment of the circuit court, and we remanded the case for a new trial limited to the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>damages on VFA\u2019s quantum meruit claim against Hartford. <em>Id. </em>at 206, 520 S.E.2d at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">During the trial upon remand, VFA, a Virginia corporation, presented evidence that it acted as a \u201cmarriage broker\u201d for two insurers, Hartford and the Medical Protective Company (MedPro). William Montgomery Dise, an insurance agent and \u201cpart-owner\u201d of VFA, was instrumental in bringing Hartford and MedPro together.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Dise approached Hartford in 1994 with a proposal that Hartford provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage and business owners\u2019 insurance policies for dentists to complement an insurance package that MedPro offered. MedPro had approximately 20,000 dentist clients to whom Hartford could potentially sell its workers\u2019 compensation insurance and other insurance products. These insurers entered into a joint venture to create an insurance product called \u201cThe Package,\u201d which was sold through a technique known as commercial mass marketing or affinity marketing. Commercial mass marketing involves the sale of insurance products to groups whose members have similar interests or associations, in this instance, dentists. \u201cThe Package\u201d was subsequently sold to dentists throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">VFA, acting principally through Dise, expended significant expense and substantial time to bring the joint venture to fruition. VFA presented evidence that Sandra L. Shearer, Hartford\u2019s employee, assured VFA that Hartford would compensate VFA for its work. James D. Sinay, another Hartford employee, assured Dise that Hartford would compensate VFA fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">VFA presented the testimony of two expert witnesses, Thomas A. Flynn and Robert Leonhart, to establish the value of the reasonable compensation that Hartford should pay to VFA for its services rendered to Hartford. Flynn, who qualified as an expert witness on the subject of retail insurance, testified that he was knowledgeable of the methods of compensation for commercial mass marketing programs. When asked whether he had an opinion about the range of commissions that are paid to insurance agents or agencies who bring an affinity program to an insurer, such as Hartford, he responded \u201cyes\u201d and stated that \u201c[his] opinion is that [the] range would be between 2.5 percent and 5 percent.\u201d This type of commission is referred to as a commission override. Flynn also discussed the various factors that he relied upon to form his opinion. He stated that, generally, the rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of compensation would be a commission of 3.75%, but in this instance, he discounted the commission that VFA should receive because VFA did not provide any continuing service to Hartford once Hartford and MedPro decided to market \u201cThe Package.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABI\">During Hartford\u2019s cross-examination of Flynn, he admitted that he had \u201cnever been paid a commission override for setting up an affinity program without providing any service\u201d and that he was \u201cnot aware of anyone else\u201d who had been paid a commission override without providing an ongoing service. Flynn also testified that in the instances when he had been paid a commission override in his capacity as an insurance agent, he continued to provide services to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">During his <em>voir dire, </em>outside the presence of the jury, Flynn testified that Hartford had issued an insurance contract that required the payment of a commission to an insurance agent \u201cindefinitely as long as the business is on the books. There [was] no ongoing service from the agent. So I do recollect a contract like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Leonhart, who also qualified as an expert witness, testified that the standard range of compensation in the insurance industry for an agent who has performed the services that VFA performed for Hartford \u201cis anywhere from two to five percent.\u201d The range of compensation is based upon many factors, including profitability and the type of insurance product. Leonhart testified that the value of VFA\u2019s services rendered to Hartford would be 3.5% of the premium income generated by the sale of \u201cThe Package\u201d in 1994 and 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">During his cross-examination by Hartford, Leonhart testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201cQ: You\u2019re not aware of any compensation being paid to an agent by an insurance company in the form of a commission override where there hasn\u2019t been a negotiated agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201cA: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">\u201cQ: And that negotiated agreement would deal with a number of terms, including the level of compensation; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">\u201cA: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">\u201cQ: And the services to be provided by the agent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">\u201cA: Yes, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u201cQ: Are you aware that at the time in August of 1995, when VFA\u2019s services for Hartford ceased, there was no agreement in place between MedPro and Hartford? Yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cQ: Now, you would agree, in your experience, Mr. Leon-hart, that. . . you\u2019re not aware of any situation where an agent like yourself, a consultant has received a commission override for providing no service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cA: I think if you\u2019ll recall back to my original two depositions, that I did recall a couple of situations where there were some consultants that received compensation and literally were doing nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201cQ: But those agents had contracts with the carriers in each instance, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">\u201cA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u201cQ: Those contracts provided for some level of service by the agent, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">\u201cA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">\u201cQ: So that was a situation where the carrier, for whatever reason, just chose not to call on the agent to provide any service but the contract said that the agent was to do something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">\u201cA: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Upon the conclusion of its deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of VFA in the amount of $1,230,000. Both litigants have appealed the circuit court\u2019s judgment confirming the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">Hartford argues that the circuit court erred in permitting Flynn and Leonhart to testify that the customary method of payment for VFA was a commission override because neither witness could cite an example in the insurance industry of an agent who was compensated on a commission override basis when that agent failed to provide ongoing services in support of an insurance program. We disagree with Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>We have repeatedly held that expert testimony must be based upon an adequate foundation. <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>239 Va. 477, 482-83, 391 S.E.2d 333, 336 (1990); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>238 Va. 655, 664-65, 385 S.E.2d 885, 891 (1989). Expert testimony is inadmissible if such testimony is speculative or founded upon assumptions that have no basis in fact. <em>Countryside Corp. v. Taylor, </em>263 Va. 549, 553, 561 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002); <em>John v. Im, </em>263 Va. 315, 320, 559 S.E.2d 694, 696 (2002); <em>Keesee v. Donigan, </em>259 Va. 157, 161, 524 S.E.2d 645, 648 (2000); <em>ITT Hartford, </em>258 Va. at 201, 520 S.E.2d at 359; <em>Tittsworth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>252 Va. 151, 154, 475 S.E.2d 261, 263 (1996); <em>Tarmac Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Smiley Block Co., </em>250 Va. 161, 166, 458 S.E.2d 462, 466 (1995); <em>Gilbert v. Summers, </em>240 Va. 155, 159-60, 393 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1990). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-401.1 and -401.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">We hold that the trial court did not err by admitting the testimony of Flynn and Leonhart. As Leonhart\u2019s testimony demonstrates, he was aware of insurance agents who performed services similar to those provided by VFA, and that those agents received commissions even though they did not provide ongoing services. The fact that these agents had written contracts with the insurers does not render the challenged testimony inadmissible. The relevant inquiry is not whether an insurance agent received a commission override for services rendered to an insurance company based upon a provision in a written contract. Rather, the appropriate inquiry in this proceeding based upon a claim of quantum meruit is what is the reasonable value of the services VFA rendered to Hartford? <em>See Marine Dev. Corp. v. Rodak, </em>225 Va. 137, 140-41, 300 S.E.2d 763, 765 (1983). <em>See also Po River Water &amp; Sewer Co. v. Indian Acres Club, </em>255 Va. 108, 114, 495 S.E.2d 478, 482 (1998); <em>Ricks </em>v. <em>Sumler, </em>179 Va. 571, 577, 19 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1942); <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>161 Va. 193, 200, 170 S.E. 602, 605 (1933). Relevant to this inquiry is the standard of compensation in the insurance industry for agents who render substantially similar services to insurance companies. We conclude that the challenged expert testimony was based upon an adequate foundation and, therefore, was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">VFA sought to recover as damages commissions based on premiums that sales of \u201cThe Package\u201d would potentially generate during the ten-year period covering 2001 through 2010. Prior to trial, Hartford filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to prohibit the admission of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>evidence of damages based upon the loss of future commissions. Hartford also filed a pretrial motion for partial summary judgment against VFA\u2019s claims for damages based upon the loss of future commissions. The circuit court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">During the trial, Thomas R. Fauerbach, an actuary who qualified as an expert witness, was permitted to opine that even though Hartford and MedPro had discontinued jointly marketing \u201cThe Package,\u201d MedPro could create a \u201cnew package\u201d of insurance products for dentists and market that product in the future with another insurer. Nonetheless, Fauerbach opined that over the ten-year period, Hartford could realize over $250,000,000 in future premiums from the potential future sale of business policies to dentists throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Fauerbach made his projections of future premiums based upon numerous assumptions. He assumed that MedPro and Hartford would continue to jointly market \u201cThe Package,\u201d even though at the time of trial that assumption was factually incorrect. Fauerbach\u2019s projections were also based upon MedPro\u2019s ability to obtain another national partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">At the conclusion of VFA\u2019s case-in-chief, Hartford renewed its motion for partial summary judgment. Hartford asserted, for several reasons, that VFA was not entitled to recover as damages the reasonable value of services associated with the future sales of \u201cThe Package.\u201d The circuit court granted the motion, holding that to the extent VFA could recover damages in quantum meruit for the future premiums, VFA would have to file subsequent lawsuits to recover those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Hartford argues that Fauerbach\u2019s testimony was based upon speculative projections and, therefore, his testimony regarding future premium income was not admissible. Continuing, Hartford contends that even though the circuit court concluded at the end of VFA\u2019s case-in-chief that VFA could not recover damages based upon the future premiums, Hartford nonetheless is entitled to a new trial because that testimony may have improperly influenced the jury. In its appeal, VFA argues that Fauerbach\u2019s testimony was admissible and that VFA was entitled to recover the reasonable value of future premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">As we have already stated, expert testimony is inadmissible if it is speculative or founded on assumptions that have an insufficient factual basis. <em>Countryside, </em>263 Va. at 553, 561 S.E.2d at 682; <em>John, </em>263 Va. at 320, 559 S.E.2d at 696; <em>Keesee, </em>259 Va. at 161, 524 S.E.2d at 648; <em>ITT Hartford, </em>258 Va. at 201, 520 S.E.2d at 359; <em>Titt</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>sworth, 252 </em>Va. at 154, 475 S.E.2d at 263; <em>Tarmac, </em>250 Va. at 166, 458 S.E.2d at 466; <em>Gilbert, </em>240 Va. at 159-60, 393 S.E.2d at 215. Clearly, Fauerbach\u2019s projection of more than $250 million in future premiums from Hartford\u2019s sale of insurance policies to dentists during the next 10 years was speculative because it was subject to the significant unknown variable whether MedPro would enter into a future bargain with another national insurance carrier. Therefore, we hold that VFA failed to produce sufficient evidence that would have permitted the jury to award it damages, based upon quantum meruit, for future premium income that \u201cThe Package\u201d potentially might generate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Additionally, as we have already stated, the circuit court granted Hartford\u2019s renewed motion for partial summary judgment on this claim. As Hartford concedes, the circuit court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe Court has determined as a matter of law that in arriving at the reasonable value of the services performed by VFA for Hartford, you shall consider only actual premiums received by the plaintiff and you shall not consider any projections of future premiums.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The jury was properly instructed that it could not consider the evidence of future premium projections. And, as we have consistently held, when the jury is properly instructed, we must conclude that the jury followed the instructions of the court. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Young, </em>264 Va. 604, 611, 571 S.E.2d 135, 139 (2002); <em>Emmett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 364, 371, 569 S.E.2d 39, 44 (2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S._, 123 S.Ct. 1586 (2003); <em>Beavers v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 268, 280, 427 S.E.2d 411, 420 (1993); <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 369, 375 n.*, 355 S.E.2d 591, 595 n.* (1987); <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983). Therefore, we hold that Hartford\u2019s arguments regarding the purportedly prejudicial impact of this testimony are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded VFA $1,230,000. The jury returned the following verdict: \u201cOn plaintiff\u2019s claim for implied contract <em>(quantum </em>meruit): For plaintiff and against defendant ITT Hartford Group, Inc. in an amount equal to a 3% commission on premiums of $41,000,000.\u201d Hartford argues that the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict or grant remittitur because there was no credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Hartford actually received $41,000,000 in premiums as of the date of trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">VFA presented sufficient evidence to the jury, including the actual written amount of premium income for each year that \u201cThe Package\u201d was marketed, that would have permitted the jury to find that Hartford had received $41,000,000 in premiums as of the date of trial. The jury was properly instructed that VFA was not required to prove the exact amount of its damages, but that VFA was required to produce sufficient facts and circumstances to permit the jury to make a reasonable estimate. And, we note, Hartford did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We find no merit in Hartford\u2019s argument that Flynn and Leon-hart should not have been permitted to testify as expert witnesses because their testimony was purportedly cumulative. As Hartford correctly states in its brief, the circuit court has broad discretion to impose limits on the number of expert witnesses. We conclude that the circuit court did not abuse that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The circuit court entered a scheduling order dated January 28, 2002. Paragraph 3 of the scheduling order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">\u201cExperts. The parties have previously designated experts. Neither party may designate additional or substitute experts except by leave of Court for good cause shown. Plaintiff may amend or supplement its expert designations no later than April 15, 2002, if occasioned by information discovered since July 5, 2001. Defendant may amend or supplement its expert designations no later than May 15, 2002, if occasioned by information discovered since July 5, 2001.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Hartford filed a motion for leave of court to designate an additional expert witness. Hartford asserted in its motion that VFA had amended its expert designations and presented a \u201cnew damage theory.\u201d VFA opposed Hartford\u2019s motion for leave of court to designate an additional expert witness and asserted that its theory of damages had not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The circuit court denied Hartford\u2019s motion by order. The circuit court\u2019s decision to deny Hartford\u2019s motion to designate an additional expert witness was a matter within the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion and, based upon the record before this Court, we hold that Hartford failed to demonstrate that the circuit court abused its discretion. Accordingly, Hartford\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Hartford\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit. And, in view of our holding that Fauerbach\u2019s opinions regarding Hartford\u2019s future premium income were speculative, we need not consider VFA\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Record No. 022659 - <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Record No. 022663 - <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-10\"> In view of this holding, we need not consider VFA\u2019s argument that the circuit court erred by ruling that VFA would be required to file separate additional lawsuits to recover damages for its purported loss of future premium income.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
