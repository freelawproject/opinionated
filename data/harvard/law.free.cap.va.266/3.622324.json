Trust, Inc., a Florida corporation, and Atlantic Funding Corporation, a Nevada corporation, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and sought a declaration that First Flight Limited Partnership, a Virginia limited partnership, is the alter ego of Barrie M. Peterson, who had endorsed and guaranteed certain promissory notes. C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding obtained judgments against Peterson for the principal and interest on the notes and sought to satisfy their judgments against Peterson with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>assets held by First Flight. The federal district court concluded that this Court would permit reverse veil piercing and that court entered a judgment requiring First Flight to use its assets to satisfy the judgments of C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The United States Court of Appeals\u2019 certification order contained the following facts which are relevant to our disposition of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u201cC.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding each hold commercial promissory notes endorsed and guaranteed by Peterson. As the district court noted, this case constitutes just one chapter in a prolonged tale involving C.F. Trust\u2019s and Atlantic Funding\u2019s efforts to collect a combined total of more than $8 million on their notes, and Peterson\u2019s equally determined efforts to avoid paying anything to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u201cC.F. Trust . . . holds two notes, dated November 1, 1993, in the total principal amount of $6,064,903.57. Not only Barrie Peterson, individually and as trustee, but also his wife, Nancy Peterson, endorsed and guaranteed both notes. C.F. Trust formally notified the Petersons of their default on the notes on August 31, 1995. ... On February 1, 1996, a [circuit court in Virginia] entered judgment in favor of C.F. Trust and against the Petersons, jointly and severally, for the amount of the notes, plus interest. ... In September 1998, when the Petersons still had not paid on the judgment, C.F. Trust sought and obtained a charging order from the [circuit] court that charged the Peterson[s\u2019] interests in various partnerships, including First Flight, with paying the judgment on the notes. Then, on March 18, 1999, the [federal] district court issued garnishment orders against various Peterson corporations, including Birchwood Holdings Group, Inc., to C.F. Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u201cAtlantic Funding . . . holds a single note, endorsed and guaranteed by Peterson, individually and as trustee, in the principal amount of $1,000,000. Atlantic Funding purchased its note along with the right to enforce a corresponding and preexisting judgment, entered on November 15, 1991, against Peterson for the principal amount of that note, plus interest. On March 1, 1996, a Virginia [circuit] court granted Atlantic Funding a charging order charging Peterson\u2019s interest in First Flight with paying the judgment on the Atlantic Funding note, and, on March 15, 1996, issued a second charging order charging another Peterson entity with paying the same judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201cOn November 18, 1999, having still received no payment on the judgments, C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding initiated this diversity action against Peterson, Mrs. Peterson, and Peterson\u2019s son, Scott Peterson, as well as against various Peterson entities, including First Flight. . . . C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding alleged that Peterson still owed on the judgments and sought a declaration that each of the other defendants was Peterson\u2019s alter ego and, therefore, liable on the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u201cA four-day bench trial began on August 28, 2000. The evidence presented at trial showed that Peterson had engaged in two different practices in order to avoid paying C.F. Trust\u2019s and Atlantic Funding\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u201cFirst, Peterson directed transfers from various Peterson entities to Birchwood Holdings Group, Inc. (BHG), a corporation wholly owned by Peterson. BHG provided managerial and administrative support to other Peterson entities for a fee, which was calculated according to a cost allocation method. During the relevant period, however, Peterson directed transfers of approximately $1.9 million in overpayments to BHG - excess payments beyond those to which BHG was entitled based on the applicable cost allocation - and then directed BHG to pay more than $2 million of Peterson\u2019s personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u201cThrough this method, Peterson maintained a lifestyle that, he estimated, cost \u2018between 10 and 15 thousand dollars a month.\u2019 The expenses paid by BHG included: mortgage and repair payments on a Peterson residence in Fairfax, Virginia; mortgage payments on a Peterson residence in Nantucket, Massachusetts; Peterson\u2019s country club membership fees; car payments for Peterson\u2019s Mercedes [Benz]; the Petersons\u2019 credit card bills; Peterson\u2019s ATM fees; college tuition for Peterson\u2019s younger son, Christopher Peterson; and payments to Mrs. Peterson. BHG even paid the substantial legal fees incurred by Peterson and Mrs. Peterson, as well as by various Peterson entities, to defend the suits brought by C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding to collect on their notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201cYet, Peterson contended that he derived no salary and had no income subject to the judgments entered in favor of C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding. Peterson instead testified that the BHG payments toward his personal expenses constituted repayments of prior loans that he had made to his corporations before the dates of the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ments. However, BHG\u2019s accountant testified - and the ledgers reflected - that many of BHG\u2019s payments toward Peterson\u2019s personal expenses were \u2018distributions,\u2019 not loan repayments. Moreover, no underlying documentation supported Peterson\u2019s explanation for the disbursements or the companies\u2019 asserted obligations to Peterson, other than the checks and distributions themselves. Only in 1999 did Peterson generate \u2018promissory notes,\u2019 purportedly representing monies owed to him by his companies as repayment for the asserted loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u201cFirst Flight provided the bulk of the transfers to BHG during this time period. First Flight, the primary source of outside revenue for the Peterson entities, owned and operated a large commercial and industrial rental property called Top Flight Airpark. Beginning in 1992 and continuing through March 15, 1996, Barrie Peterson held a 98% limited partnership interest in First Flight, including a 2% interest held by Top Flight Airpark, Incorporated, a corporation wholly owned by him. Upland Group, an entity wholly owned by Peterson\u2019s elder son, Scott Peterson, held the remaining 2% general partnership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u201cHowever, on March 15, 1996 - six weeks after C.F. Trust obtained a judgment against Peterson and two weeks after Atlantic Funding obtained its first charging order - Top Flight withdrew as 2% partner of First Flight, and Peterson transferred half of his resulting 98% partnership interest in First Flight to Scott Peterson. Upland Group, however, retained its 2% general partnership interest. Through this transfer, Peterson purportedly surrendered legal control of First Flight to Scott Peterson, although Peterson himself continued to manage First Flight\u2019s day-to-day affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u201cThis transfer provided Peterson a second means of siphoning money from First Flight, other than through intercompany transfers to BHG, to pay his personal expenses. Peterson directed Scott Peterson to distribute First Flight\u2019s funds to himself, and then pay those distributions to Mrs. Peterson or to BHG, or use the distributions to pay the personal expenses of Peterson and Mrs. Peterson. Thus, between March 15, 1996, and December 31, 1999, although First Flight did not directly distribute funds to Barrie Peterson, [First Flight] distributed more than $4.3 million to Scott Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201cTo justify these distributions, Peterson and Scott Peterson amended First Flight\u2019s partnership agreement to allow Scott Peterson, as the general partner, \u2018to approve any distributions to the limited partners\u2019 and \u2018to determine whether any part of the profits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Partnership should be distributed to the limited partners.\u2019 At trial, Peterson and Scott Peterson contended that this amendment to the partnership agreement extinguished the agreement\u2019s requirement of <em>pro rata </em>distributions to partners, although the amendment did not expressly alter its <em>pro rata </em>payout requirement. Peterson also argued that money used by his son to pay Peterson\u2019s own personal expenses were repayments of loans Peterson had made to his respective companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The federal district court held that C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding had \u201cconclusively established the grounds necessary to support piercing the corporate veil in reverse.\u201d <em>C.F. Trust, Inc. v. First Flight Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>140 F.Supp.2d 628, 645 (E.D. Va. 2001). The federal district court applied this Court\u2019s precedent for traditional veil piercing and required that C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding prove (i) a \u201cunity of interest and ownership\u201d between Peterson and First Flight, and (ii) that Peterson \u201cused the corporation to evade a personal obligation, to perpetrate fraud or a crime, to commit an injustice, or to gain an unfair advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643 (quoting <em>O\u2019Hazza v. Executive Credit Corp., </em>246 Va. 111, 115, 431 S.E.2d 318, 320 (1993)). The federal district court concluded that First Flight was the alter ego of Barrie Peterson and \u201cthat the \u2018separate personalities of [First Flight and Barrie Peterson] no longer exist[ed].\u2019 \u201d <em>C.F. Trust, </em>140 F.Supp.2d at 644 (quoting <em>O\u2019Hazza, </em>246 Va. at 115, 431 S.E.2d at 321).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">First Flight argues that this Court should not permit outsider reverse piercing of a limited partnership by a creditor of a limited partner. Responding, C.F. Trust and Atlantic Funding assert that this Court has permitted traditional veil piercing and that the same principles this Court applied in those instances would also permit reverse veil piercing in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">We have stated that \u201c[t]he proposition is elementary that a corporation is a legal entity entirely separate and distinct from the shareholders or members who compose it. This immunity of stockholders is a basic provision of statutory and common law and supports a vital economic policy underlying the whole corporate concept.\u201d <em>Cheatle v. Rudd\u2019s Swimming Pool Supply Co., Inc., </em>234 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>207, 212, 360 S.E.2d 828, 831 (1987); <em>accord Beale v. Kappa Alpha Order, </em>192 Va. 382, 397, 64 S.E.2d 789, 797 (1951). The decision to ignore the separate existence of a corporate entity and impose personal liability upon shareholders for debts of the corporation is an extraordinary act to be taken only when necessary to promote justice. <em>O\u2019Hazza, </em>246 Va. at 115, 431 S.E.2d at 320; <em>Cheatle, </em>234 Va. at 212, 360 S.E.2d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">We have stated that \u201cno single rule or criterion . . . can be applied to determine whether piercing the corporate veil is justified,\u201d <em>O\u2019Hazza, </em>246 Va. at 115, 431 S.E.2d at 320, and that the corporate entity will be disregarded and the veil pierced only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">\u201c[T]he shareholder sought to be held personally liable has controlled or used the corporation to evade a personal obligation, to perpetrate fraud or a crime, to commit an injustice, or to gain an unfair advantage. . . . Piercing the corporate veil is justified when the unity of interest and ownership is such that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist and to adhere to that separateness would work an injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\"><em>Greenberg v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 594, 604, 499 S.E.2d 266, 272 (1998) (quoting <em>O\u2019Hazza, </em>246 Va. at 115, 431 S.E.2d at 320-21); <em>accord Lewis Trucking Corp. v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 23, 31, 147 S.E.2d 747, 753 (1966). The decision to disregard a corporate structure to impose personal liability is a fact-specific determination, and the factual circumstances surrounding the corporation and the questioned act must be closely scrutinized in each case. <em>Greenberg, </em>255 Va. at 604, 499 S.E.2d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">This Court has been very reluctant to permit veil piercing. We have consistently held, and we do not depart from our precedent, that only \u201can extraordinary exception\u201d justifies disregarding the corporate entity and piercing the veil. <em>Id.; Cheatle, </em>234 Va. at 212, 360 S.E.2d at 831; <em>Beale, </em>192 Va. at 397, 64 S.E.2d at 797-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Traditionally, a litigant who seeks to pierce a veil requests that a court disregard the existence of a corporate entity so that the litigant can reach the assets of a corporate insider, usually a majority shareholder. In a reverse piercing action, however, the claimant seeks to reach the assets of a corporation or some other business entity, as in this instance the assets of a limited partnership, to satisfy claims or a judgment obtained against a corporate insider. This proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>often referred to as \u201coutsider reverse piercing,\u201d is designed to achieve goals similar to those served by traditional corporate piercing proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We conclude that there is no logical basis upon which to distinguish between a traditional veil piercing action and an outsider reverse piercing action. In both instances, a claimant requests that a court disregard the normal protections accorded a corporate structure to prevent abuses of that structure. Therefore, we hold that Virginia does recognize the concept of outsider reverse piercing and that this concept can be applied to a Virginia limited partnership. Indeed, limited partnerships, like corporations, have a legal existence separate from the partners in the limited partnership, and the structure of the statutorily-created limited partnership limits the potential liability of each limited partner. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 50-73.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We note that the following jurisdictions also have approved the concept of reverse veil piercing. <em>See, e.g., In re Blatstein, </em>192 F.3d 88, 100 (3d Cir. 1999); <em>American Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Utah Energy Dev. Co., Inc., </em>122 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 1997); <em>Stoebner v.

Phelps, </em>546 N.W.2d 176, 181 (Wis. Ct. App. 1996). <em>But see Floyd </em>v. <em>IRS, </em>151 F.3d 1295, 1298-99 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>Scholes v. Lehmann, </em>56 F.3d 750, 758 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1028 (1995); <em>Sturtevant v. Town of Winthrop, </em>732 A.2d 264, 270 (Me. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Virginia has adopted the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, Code \u00a7 50-73.1, <em>et seq. </em>First Flight argues that the Act \u201cspecifies whether and when a limited partner may be held liable for the debts of the partnership, and thereby provides a statutory remedy analogous to the judicially-created remedy of piercing the corporate veil. . . . More importantly, the Act <em>also </em>provides a remedy for creditors of a limited partner by specifying the manner in which the assets of a limited partnership may be subjected to a creditor\u2019s claims.\u201d Continuing, First Flight claims that the Virginia Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act prescribes the only methods that creditors may utilize to reach assets of a limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We agree with First Flight that the Virginia Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act prescribes certain statutory remedies for creditors of a limited partnership. For example, Code \u00a7 50-73.46, which is a part of the Act, permits a court to charge the partnership interest of a limited partner against whom a judgment has been entered. However, there is simply no language in the Act that prohibits a court from piercing the veil of a limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">When determining whether <em>reverse </em>piercing of a limited partnership is appropriate, a court must consider the same factors summarized in Part III.A. of this opinion that this Court considers when determining whether <em>traditional </em>veil piercing should be permitted. Also, as we have stated in Part III.A. of this opinion, even though no single rule or criterion is dispositive, the litigant who seeks to disregard a limited partnership entity must show that the limited partnership sought to be pierced has been controlled or used by the debtor to evade a personal obligation, to perpetrate a fraud or a crime, to commit an injustice, or to gain an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">In Virginia, unlike in some states, the standards for veil piercing are very stringent, and piercing is an extraordinary measure that is permitted only in the most egregious circumstances, such as under the facts before this Court. The piercing of a veil is justified when the unity of interest and ownership is such that the separate personalities of the corporation and/or limited partnership and the individual no longer exist, and adherence to that separateness would create an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Additionally, a court considering reverse veil piercing must weigh the impact of such action upon innocent investors, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>instance, innocent limited partners or innocent general partners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A court considering reverse veil piercing must also consider the impact of such an act upon innocent secured and unsecured creditors. The court must also consider the availability of other remedies the creditor may pursue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, a litigant who seeks reverse veil piercing must prove the necessary standards by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In view of the foregoing, we answer the first certified question in the affirmative, and we answer the second certified question by referring the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to Parts III.A. and IV. of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\n<em>Certified question answered in the affirmative.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> <em>See </em>Gregory S.
