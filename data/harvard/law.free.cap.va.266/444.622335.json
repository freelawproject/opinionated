We primarily consider whether Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) requires the Commissioner to find, before holding that a distributor has violated the statute, that the distributor failed to ship to a Virginia dealer a quantity of new vehicles that meets the statute\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We will state the facts relevant to this appeal. Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen), a New Jersey corporation, is the distributor of Volkswagen motor vehicles in the United States and Canada and is a subsidiary of the German automobile manufacturer, Volkswagen AG. Volkswagen imports a fixed supply of vehicles from its corporate parent and distributes these vehicles to about 600 dealers nationwide, including 17 dealers in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Miller Auto Sales, Inc., d/b/a Miller Volkswagen (Miller), is a retail dealer of Volkswagen motor vehicles in Winchester, Virginia. Miller is the smallest dealer by volume of Volkswagen sales in its assigned sales district.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In late 1997, Volkswagen adopted a national program for allocating and distributing to its dealers vehicle models often in short supply, such as the Beetle, the Passat, and the Jetta. This allocation program was designed to take shipments of vehicles that Volkswagen imported from its corporate parent and to divide those vehicles among Volkswagen\u2019s six national sales regions in proportion to each region\u2019s share of Volkswagen\u2019s national \u201cplanning volume,\u201d which reflected anticipated annual unit sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Each region\u2019s allotment of vehicles was subdivided further among the region\u2019s sales districts, with each district receiving a number of vehicles in proportion to its share of the region\u2019s annual planning volume. At the district level, an \u201carea executive\u201d was responsible for allocating vehicles to individual dealers based on Volkswagen\u2019s national allocation methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Although Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology underwent several changes through October 1998, the core of that methodology consistently had been a \u201cmathematical algorithm\u201d contained in a computer-generated spreadsheet that Volkswagen distributed electronically to its area executives. Volkswagen\u2019s allocation formula was based on several factors, including the reported inventories of all dealers within a district, anticipated unit sales, and actual unit sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>for that year. Each area executive had discretion to adjust the results of the formula in response to local market conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The results computed from the mathematical algorithm were further modified by Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cCreate an Apostle Program\u201d (CAAP). Under CAAP, Volkswagen used an independent organization to conduct telephone surveys of recent purchasers of Volkswagen vehicles to evaluate customer satisfaction. From these surveys, a customer satisfaction index was created that measured each individual dealer\u2019s performance in sales, service, and customer relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Volkswagen then used each dealer\u2019s CAAP score to adjust the allocation formula\u2019s results for that particular dealer. Volkswagen also imposed a \u201cminimum stocking requirement,\u201d which functioned as a \u201csafety valve\u201d authorizing the area executive to override the allocation formula to ensure that each dealer would have in its inventory at least one vehicle of every Volkswagen model.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In February 1998, Miller sent a letter to Volkswagen, with a copy to the Commissioner, alleging, among other things, that Volkswagen\u2019s use of a customer satisfaction index in its allocation of vehicles violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). That statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, it shall be unlawful for any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, or any field representative, officer, agent, or their representatives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">7. To fail to ship monthly to any dealer, if ordered by the dealer, the number of new vehicles of each make, series, and model needed by the dealer to receive a percentage of total new vehicle sales of each make, series, and model equitably related to the total new vehicle production or importation currently being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model covered under the franchise. Upon the written request of any dealer holding its sales or sales and service franchise, the manufacturer or distributor shall disclose to the dealer in writing the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered to the dealers of the same line-make. In the event that allocation is at issue in a request for a hearing, the dealer may demand the Commissioner to direct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the manufacturer or distributor provide to the dealer, within thirty days of such demand, all records of sales and all records of distribution of all motor vehicles to the same line-make dealers who compete with the dealer requesting the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In the letter, Miller requested that Volkswagen disclose \u201cin writing the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered to the dealers of the same line-make.\u201d In April 1998, Miller\u2019s counsel sent the Commissioner another letter requesting a hearing under the statute. The Commissioner referred the case to a hearing officer to conduct the hearing and to make recommended findings and rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Before the hearing, Volkswagen moved to dismiss the proceedings on the grounds that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) was unconstitutionally vague and violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The hearing officer denied Volkswagen\u2019s motion. At the hearing, much of the factual evidence and expert testimony received by the hearing officer focused on Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology rather than on the actual number of vehicles that Volkswagen had shipped to Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">After the hearing, the hearing officer issued a proposed decision in which he found that Volkswagen\u2019s allocation methodology was \u201cflawed in its design and deficient in its operation.\u201d The hearing officer recommended that the Commissioner declare that Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology was unlawful and in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The hearing officer found that there were two mathematical calculations in Volkswagen\u2019s allocation formula that worked to Miller\u2019s detriment. First, the hearing officer observed that the \u201calgorithm truncated fractional allocations in certain circumstances due to peculiarities of the computerized spreadsheet program.\u201d Second, he noted that \u201cthe algorithm did not accumulate \u2018fractional vehicles\u2019 so that a small volume dealer, like Miller . . . was effectively frozen out on a repeated basis from acquiring vehicles in short supply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The hearing officer further found that the results of Volkswagen\u2019s allocation program were monitored solely on an \u201cad hoc\u201d basis and that \u201c[o]nly when a dealer, such as Miller, complained, was there any apparent effort to verify whether or not allocations were fair.\u201d The hearing officer stated that statistical measurements were not used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>in such circumstances and that \u201cthe notion of fairness would seem to rest strictly on achieving quietude from the dealerships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The hearing officer also found that the flaws in Volkswagen\u2019s allocation formula were exacerbated by Volkswagen\u2019s use of the CAAP program to modify the algorithm results, thus making the allocation of new vehicles \u201chostage to CAAP performance.\u201d In explaining this conclusion, the hearing officer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">[O]ne could reasonably conclude from some of the statistical evidence presented, both by fact witnesses and by expert witnesses, that the restriction of allocations itself created a vicious cycle of lower CAAP scores, as customers who were delayed in receiving ordered vehicles, or who could not get vehicles precisely as specified, might well be less satisfied with Miller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The hearing officer further found that while Volkswagen presented some testimony that its minimum stocking requirement was a \u201challowed and longstanding \u2018unwritten rule\u2019 for allocation,\u201d it appeared that this requirement was not applied in allocating vehicles to Miller until after Miller had requested a hearing. The hearing officer concluded that the evidence failed to show that the minimum stocking requirement functioned as an adequate \u201csafety valve\u201d to remedy the deficiencies of Volkswagen\u2019s allocation formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The Commissioner issued a \u201cHearing Decision\u201d in which he adopted the findings of the hearing officer. The Commissioner determined, in relevant part, that Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology was unlawful and in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Volkswagen appealed from the Commissioner\u2019s ruling to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. Volkswagen argued that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and was unconstitutionally vague. Volkswagen also asserted that the Commissioner misinterpreted Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) because that statute merely \u201cregulates the number of vehicles that a motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor must ship to each of its Virginia dealers, not the mechanisms that a manufacturer or distributor must use to calculate or determine that number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The circuit court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), and held that the Commissioner did not exceed his authority in reaching this conclusion. The court stated that the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>statute is to \u201censure that Virginia dealers get a fair percentage of vehicles\u201d in comparison to national distributions. The court concluded that, therefore, \u201cthe administrative body charged with the statute\u2019s enforcement would necessarily have to examine the allocation methodology to determine whether a Virginia dealer is getting its fair share.\u201d In addition, the circuit court rejected Volkswagen\u2019s constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Volkswagen appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. <em>Volkswagen of Amer., Inc. v. Quillian, </em>39 Va. App. 35, 42, 69, 569 S.E.2d 744, 748, 761 (2002). After rejecting Volkswagen\u2019s constitutional arguments, the Court of Appeals concluded, in relevant part, that the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) \u201creflects the intention of the legislature to give the [Cjommissioner the flexibility necessary to accurately determine whether a dealer has received its fair share of vehicles from a distributor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 569 S.E.2d at 758. The Court further held that \u201cin determining whether a distributor is in compliance with Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), the [Cjommissioner may consider and base his determination on that distributor\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology\u201d and that \u201cthe [Cjommissioner is not confined to examining only the actual number of vehicles allocated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 569 S.E.2d at 759. We awarded Volkswagen an appeal pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-410(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Volkswagen argues that the Commissioner exceeded his authority under the plain language of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). Volkswagen contends that the Commissioner improperly determined that Volkswagen violated the statute without considering whether Volkswagen failed to comply with the statute\u2019s requirement that Miller receive from its distributor new vehicles in a number \u201cequitably related\u201d to national importation figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In response, Miller contends that Volkswagen has waived this argument by failing to object to the hearing officer\u2019s statement in a pre-hearing telephone conference that \u201cthe issue is this case appearfs] to be whether or not the allocation methodology adopted by [Volkswagen) was equitable in accord with the Statute.\u201d In addressing the merits of Volkswagen\u2019s argument, Miller argues that the statute contemplates regulation of a distributor\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology because the only way to determine whether an equitable number of vehicles has been allocated to a dealer is to evaluate the method by which that number was determined. Miller also asserts that the Commissioner\u2019s task was compounded by Volkswagen\u2019s failure to maintain adequate records concerning the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>of vehicles it allocated to Miller before Miller\u2019s complaint. We disagree with Miller\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Initially, we find no merit in Miller\u2019s contention that Volkswagen\u2019s failure to object to the hearing officer\u2019s pre-hearing characterization of the controversy results in a waiver of the argument that Volkswagen advances in this appeal. The hearing officer\u2019s statement indicated that he would consider whether Volkswagen\u2019s allocation methodology complied with the terms of the statute. In view of the statute\u2019s requirements, such a determination could not be made without considering national importation figures and their relationship to the number of new vehicles being shipped to Miller. Thus, Volkswagen has not waived the argument that it advances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We resolve the substance of Volkswagen\u2019s argument by examining the language of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). Under basic rules of statutory construction, we determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words contained in the statute. <em>Woods v. Mendez, </em>265 Va. 68, 74, 574 S.E.2d 263, 266 (2003); <em>Vaughn, Inc. v. Beck, </em>262 Va. 673, 677, 554 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2001); <em>Cummings v. Fulghum, 261 </em>Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001). When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language. <em>Woods, </em>265 Va. at 74-75, 574 S.E.2d at 266; <em>Industrial Dev. Auth. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>263 Va. 349, 353, 559 S.E.2d 621, 623 (2002); <em>Cummings, </em>261 Va. at 77, 540 S.E.2d at 496. Thus, when a statute\u2019s language is unambiguous, courts cannot give that language a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated. <em>Mozley v. Prestwould Bd. of Dirs., </em>264 Va. 549, 554, 570 S.E.2d 817, 820 (2002); <em>Lee County v. Town of St. Charles, </em>264 Va. 344, 348, 568 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002); <em>Vaughn, Inc., 262 </em>Va. at 677, 554 S.E.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We conclude that the language of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) is plain and unambiguous. This language required the Commissioner to consider the actual monthly shipments that Volkswagen made to Miller in relation to the number of new vehicles imported by Volkswagen on a national level in the particular vehicle categories covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement. The statute further required that the Commissioner, in conducting this examination, determine whether Miller obtained the number of such vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u201cequitably related\u201d to the number of these types of vehicles imported by Volkswagen nationally.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The Commissioner did not undertake this required analysis. Instead of addressing the actual number of vehicles Miller received from Volkswagen in relation to national importation numbers, the Commissioner merely examined the component parts of Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology, and adjustments made to that process, to determine whether they were \u201cfair\u201d in their application to small dealers such as Miller. Thus, in basing his determination on Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology, the Commissioner wholly failed to consider the national importation numbers for the types of vehicles covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement. This omission was followed by the Commissioner\u2019s failure to address whether Miller received the number of vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u201cequitably related\u201d to the quantity of these types of vehicles imported on a national level.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u201cAn erroneous interpretation of a statute by those charged with its enforcement cannot be permitted to override [the statute\u2019s] clear meaning. Amendments of statutes can only be made by the legislature and not by the courts or administrative officers charged with their enforcement.\u201d <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>City of Chesapeake, </em>218 Va. 696, 702, 240 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1978); <em>see also Hurt </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>222 Va. 91, 97, 279 S.E.2d 138, 142 (1981); <em>City of Richmond v. County of Henrico, </em>185 Va. 176, 189, 37 S.E.2d 873, 879-80 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s erroneous statutory interpretation resulted in Volkswagen improperly being found in violation of the statute absent any analysis of the actual shipments received by Miller in relation to the relevant national importation numbers achieved by Volkswagen. Thus, because the administrative agency charged with enforcement of the statute failed to undertake the analysis and make the predicate finding required by the statute, the agency\u2019s resulting determination must be set aside. <em>See Browning-Ferris Indus. of S. Atl., Inc. </em>v. <em>Residents Involved in Saving the Env\u2019t, Inc., </em>254 Va. 278, 284-85, 492 S.E.2d 431, 435 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>We also observe that the Court of Appeals, in its analysis of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, incorrectly held that the Commissioner may base his determination whether a distributor violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) on the distributor\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology. This holding was incorrect because it improperly focused on the business judgment of Volkswagen, rather than on the actual shipments to Miller, the relevant national importation figures, and whether there was an \u201cequitable\u201d relationship between those numbers as mandated by the statute. Accordingly, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming that portion of the circuit court judgment upholding the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Because our conclusion regarding the Commissioner\u2019s erroneous application of the statute decides the merits of this appeal, we do not reach the constitutional issues raised by Volkswagen. Our decision in this regard reflects the established principle of constitutional law that a court will not rule upon the constitutionality of a statute unless such a determination is absolutely necessary to decide the merits of the case. <em>Klarfeld v. Salsbury, </em>233 Va. 277, 286, 355 S.E.2d 319, 324 (1987); <em>Keller v. Denny, </em>232 Va. 512, 516, 352 S.E.2d 327, 329 (1987); <em>see also Tran v. Gwinn, </em>262 Va. 572, 583, 554 S.E.2d 63, 69 (2001). The fact that the present case will be remanded and that the constitutional issues may arise again does not affect our obligation to adhere strictly to this principle. <em>Klarfeld, </em>233 Va. at 286, 355 S.E.2d at 324. Therefore, we will vacate that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment holding that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">For these reasons, we will reverse in part, and vacate in part, the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for ultimate remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\n<em>Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> We find no merit in Miller\u2019s contention that the Commissioner was limited to examining Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology because Volkswagen\u2019s records were inadequate to undertake an actual shipment analysis and Miller received an artificially high number of vehicles after filing its complaint. If the information available to the Commissioner was inadequate to make the required statutory determination, he was required to obtain the necessary information, rather than undertake an analysis that did not comport with the terms of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> Based on our resolution of the merits of this appeal, we need not consider the various procedural issues raised by Volkswagen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
