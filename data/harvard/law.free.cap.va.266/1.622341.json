Fletcher, </em>38 Va. App. 107, 562 S.E.2d 327 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded that the termination of parental rights includes \u201cthe termination of parental responsibilities as well as any correlative rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 562 S.E.2d at 329. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that a parent whose parental rights have been terminated no longer has a legal duty to support his or her child because the parent has become a \u201clegal stranger\u201d to that child. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, we will affirm that Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
