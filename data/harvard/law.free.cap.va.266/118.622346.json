Concluding that, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 26-15, an account of sale is required only for \u201ca sale made,\u201d we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Bradley G. Pollack, acting in the capacity of a substitute trustee, advertised foreclosure sales of timeshare units under 172 deeds of trust in three separate advertisements. The advertisements apparently prompted payment from some of the debtors. Accordingly, Pollack did not proceed with the foreclosure sales under 104 of the deeds of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">On March 8, 2002, more than six months after the advertised foreclosure sale dates, William B. Allen, III, Commissioner of Accounts for the Circuit Court of Shenandoah County, issued 172 summonses to Pollack requiring him to file \u201cFORECLOSURE TRUSTEE\u2019S REPORT OF SALE, as required by [Code] \u00a7 26-15\u201d within 30 days after service of the summonses and advising Pollack that failure to file accounts of the sales would be reported to the circuit court for further proceedings under Code \u00a7\u00a7 26-13 and -15. Within 30 days after the summonses were served on Pollack, he filed accounts with regard to the 68 foreclosure sales that were actually made.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The commissioner of accounts then reported to the circuit court that Pollack had failed to file accounts of sale for the remaining 104 advertised foreclosure sales. The commissioner requested the court to issue summonses to Pollack requiring him to file the accounts and to fine Pollack for contempt of court for failing to comply with the summonses previously issued by the commissioner of accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The circuit court subsequently granted leave to Pollack permitting him to submit affidavits from the holders of the 104 deed of trust notes verifying that no foreclosure sales were made under those particular deeds of trust. After Pollack filed the affidavits, the court held that no further response to the summonses issued by the commissioner was required. Nevertheless, the court assessed fees against Pollack personally in the amount of $750.00 for the summonses and reports issued by the commissioner of accounts regarding the 104 advertised foreclosures for which no sales occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Pollack objected to the order on the grounds that he had \u201cpresented good cause to the [cjourt for failing to make reports as none were due.\u201d The court stayed its prior order while considering Pollack\u2019s objections but subsequently entered an order removing the stay for the reasons stated in a letter opinion. The court explained that, although \u201cno accountings were due on 104 of the 172 cases,\u201d it was awarding fees to the commissioner of accounts \u201cto compensate him for [the] time and effort\u201d expended as a result of Pollack\u2019s failure to make \u201c[a] formal response ... to each summons\u201d issued by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">On appeal, Pollack contends that the circuit court erred by ordering him to \u201cfile reports under Virginia Code \u00a7 26-15 for sales that were never held\u201d and by assessing fees against him personally \u201cfor the issuance of summonses and reports issued by the [c]ommissioner of [a]ccounts on sales that never occurred.\u201d He argues that any action authorized by the provisions of Code \u00a7 26-15 \u201cpresupposes a sale.\u201d There being no sales under the 104 deeds of trust at issue, Pollack contends that he was not required to file any reports and that the assessment of fees against him was, therefore, improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The commissioner of accounts, however, asserts on brief that Pollack \u201cforeclosed on deeds of trust securing 172 timeshare units by advertising sales\u201d to be conducted on three dates. Claiming that Pollack failed in his duties to report on 104 of the advertised sales, the commissioner asserts that he had no choice but to proceed against Pollack as directed by the relevant statutes and that the court did not abuse its discretion in assessing fees against Pollack. We do not agree with the commissioner\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">To determine whether the circuit court erred, we must examine the language utilized by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 26-15. Our interpretation of this statute is guided by familiar rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201cWhile in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>Halifax Corp. </em>v. <em>First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>262 Va. 91, 99-100, 546 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2001) (quoting <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)); <em>accord Haislip v.

Promptly after recording any trustee\u2019s deed, the trustee shall deliver to the commissioner of accounts a copy of the deed. The date of sale is the date specified in the notice of sale, or any postponement thereof ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">If the commissioner of accounts of the court wherein an instrument was first recorded becomes aware that an account as required by this section has not been filed, the commissioner and the court shall proceed against the trustee in like manner and impose like penalties as set forth in \u00a7 26-13, unless such trustee is excused for sufficient reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Under the plain terms of Code \u00a7 26-15, an account of sale must be returned to the commissioner of accounts \u201c[w]ithin six months after the date of a sale made under any recorded deed of trust.\u201d The phrase \u201csale made\u201d clearly contemplates an actual sale. That occurrence, not the advertisement of a foreclosure sale, triggers a trustee\u2019s statutory duty to file an account of sale with the commissioner. The six-month period during which the account of sale must be filed for a \u201csale made\u201d commences to run on the \u201cdate specified in the notice of sale, or any postponement thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 26-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">If we adopted the interpretation of Code \u00a7 26-15 urged by the commissioner of accounts, we would be altering the statutory language. Nothing in Code \u00a7 26-15 requires a trustee to file any type of report regarding an advertised foreclosure sale that does not take place, i.e., when a sale is <em>not </em>made. Thus, the only accounts of sale that Pollack was required to return to the commissioner were for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201csales made.\u201d Neither the commissioner of accounts nor the circuit court had authority under Code \u00a7 26-15 to proceed against Pollack by issuing summonses or assessing a fine or fees for the 104 advertised sales that were <em>not </em>made. Only when \u201can account as required by this section [Code \u00a7 26-15] has not been filed\u201d is the commissioner or the court authorized to proceed against a trustee by utilizing the procedures and penalties allowed under Code \u00a7 26-13.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 26-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">For this reason, we conclude that the circuit court erred by requiring Pollack to file reports for advertised foreclosure sales that were not made and by assessing fees against Pollack personally. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter final judgment here in favor of Pollack.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> When a fiduciary fails to make a required return, the provisions of Code \u00a7 26-13 authorize a commissioner of accounts to issue a summons calling for the fiduciary to make the return. If the fiduciary fails to do so within 30 days after service of the summons, the commissioner is required to report that fact to the court. Then, the court is authorized to issue a summons for the fiduciary\u2019s appearance and to impose a fine unless the fiduciary is \u201cexcused for sufficient reason.\u201d Code \u00a7 26-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Similarly, under Code \u00a7 26-23, the assessment of costs against a fiduciary personally is permitted only when the fiduciary \u201cfail[s], without good cause, to make the returns . . . required.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
