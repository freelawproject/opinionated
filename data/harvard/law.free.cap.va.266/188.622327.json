Hugen, was seriously injured in an automobile accident on August 28, 2000. The accident occurred around 7:00 a.m. on State Route 32 in the City of Suffolk. Route 32 is a two lane highway that extends in northern and southern directions. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Michael T. Ross was driving a car in the northern lane of travel. Plaintiff was driving his car in the same direction behind Ross\u2019 vehicle. Ross observed a white van approaching from the opposite direction. Defendant, Velocity Express Mid-Atlantic, owned the white van which was operated by its employee, Alvin J. Winston. The van \u201cdrift[ed] over\u201d into Ross\u2019 lane of travel. Trying to avoid a collision, Ross steered his car \u201call the way to the shoulder of the road,\u201d and defendant\u2019s van \u201csideswipe[d]\u201d Ross\u2019 car. Defendant\u2019s van then collided with plaintiff\u2019s car in plaintiff\u2019s lane of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">After the accident occurred, Winston told defendant\u2019s safety director: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. Besides me, there were two other vehicles. The next thing I remember was when we got side to side of each other, I heard a mirror go off the van. Then when I went swerving, when I swerved in the wrong lane and hit another car and I tried to hit the brakes and tried to get over, somehow the van wouldn\u2019t get over. And then the van hit on the other car driving straight down the lane, other car going the other way.\u201d Winston told a police officer at the scene of the accident that Winston \u201cnever saw the first vehicle that he collided with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">As a result of the accident, plaintiff sustained catastrophic injuries, and he suffered permanent physical and mental disabilities. Plaintiff was in a coma for 62 days following the accident. He suffered a compression fracture of the thoracic vertebrae, a broken femur, a fractured hip, multiple fractures to his right ankle, collapsed lungs, and severe brain injuries. He experienced multi-system organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, multiple incidents of deep venous thromboses, and pneumonia. He has developed a rare condition known as heterotopic ossification, which causes abnormal new bone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>formations and ultimately will cause his joints to fuse together, thereby preventing him from moving his body. The severe stiffness in the joints caused by the heterotopic ossification has almost completely restricted plaintiff\u2019s use of his arms, hips, legs, and knees. Eventually, plaintiff will have a total ankylosis or \u201cfrozen jaw\u201d that will prohibit him from opening his mouth, and his jaw will become \u201cpermanently locked.\u201d Plaintiff will lose all his teeth, and he will have to be fed through the insertion of a surgically-implanted tube into his stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s brain injuries have impaired his memory, attention span, and abilities to concentrate, understand, and follow instructions. He ranks in the bottom five percent of the population in terms of his mental functions. As a result of his brain injuries, plaintiff eats excessive quantities of food because he is unable to discern when he is full. Consequently, plaintiff, who weighed approximately 175 pounds before the accident, now weighs 282 pounds. His weight impairs his ability to breathe, adversely affects his heart, and increases the risk of further blood clots.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">During a jury trial, plaintiff and defendant relied upon expert witness testimony to establish life care plans that plaintiff will require because of his dire medical condition. Plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses testified that plaintiff will need the services of a licensed practical nurse 24 hours each day for the remainder of his life. Robert D. Voogt, one of plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses, testified that plaintiff needs the assistance of a licensed practical nurse because this type of nurse can provide the appropriate nursing care that plaintiff currently requires and will require in the future. Defendant\u2019s expert witness, Robert H. Taylor, testified that a certified nursing aide, who has less training and is less expensive than a licensed practical nurse, can provide the 24-hour daily care that plaintiff needs. Taylor testified that a certified nursing aide would cost approximately $96,360 per year, which, when added to the other costs, resulted in a life care plan that will cost $4,123,193.50. Plaintiff presented evidence, however, that a licensed practical nurse would cost $425,955 per year, which, when added to other costs, resulted in a life care plan that cost $17,091,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $60,000,000. The circuit court entered a judgment confirming the verdict and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of sudden emergency. Defendant claims that the van operated by its employee, Winston, was forced into plaintiff\u2019s lane of travel when Ross\u2019 car collided with defendant\u2019s van. We disagree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The sudden emergency doctrine relieves a person of liability if, without prior negligence on his part, that person is confronted with a sudden emergency and acts as an ordinarily prudent person would act under the circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Ford Motor Co., </em>263 Va. 237, 262, 559 S.E.2d 592, 605 (2002); <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>Felts, </em>248 Va. 117, 120, 445 S.E.2d 131, 133 (1994); <em>Carolina Coach Co. </em>v. <em>Starchia, </em>219 Va. 135, 141, 244 S.E.2d 788, 792 (1978); <em>Pickett v. Cooper, </em>202 Va. 60, 63, 116 S.E.2d 48, 51 (1960); <em>Southern Passenger Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burks, </em>187 Va. 53, 60, 46 S.E.2d 26, 30 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">Additionally, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cOrdinarily the question of application of the sudden emergency doctrine is for the triers of fact. When evidence is conflicting or different inferences may be drawn from the evidence, it is for the jury to say (1) whether [the operator of the automobile] was confronted with an emergency; (2) whether the emergency, if one existed, was created by [the operator\u2019s] own negligence; and (3) whether [the operator of the vehicle] conducted himself as an ordinarily prudent person might have done under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Zahn, </em>206 Va. 743, 746-47, 146 S.E.2d 200, 203 (1966); <em>accord Ford Motor Co., </em>263 Va. at 262, 559 S.E.2d at 605; <em>Starchia, </em>219 Va. at 141, 244 S.E.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In the present case, the circuit court correctly concluded that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the sudden emergency doctrine. The accident was caused by the negligence of defendant\u2019s own employee. For example, Ross, the driver of the car that collided with defendant\u2019s van before that van collided with plaintiff\u2019s car, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">\u201cQ: Okay. Now, in your own words tell the members of the jury what happened from the time you observed the van.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">\u201cA: Well, from the time I observed the van I noticed that [Velocity\u2019s van] was kind of drifting over to my lane. And I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>went over to the shoulder to try to avoid a collision, and it never worked. You know, he got far enough over where he hit me, and I went off the road, lost control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u201cQ: How much of the van came into your lane, from your observation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cA: From my observation I would say over half.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">And, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the evidence of record clearly demonstrates that the accident occurred in the lane of travel occupied by Ross and plaintiff. Simply stated, a sudden emergency did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the following remarks during his closing argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">\u201cThe physical pain and mental anguish [plaintiff] suffered in the past and any that he may reasonably be expected to suffer in the future. We men are a proud lot at times probably to our detriment on occasion and sometimes our pride gets in our way. It is inconceivable to me that a man who cared for himself, who cared for his family, who on his wedding day to help his wife took her to Williamsburg in lieu of a trip to the islands so that she could be near her mother who was seriously and mentally ill at that point in time, a man who has taken care of himself and his family all of his life, a man who is basically now reduced to a role reversal. That is what has happened here, a complete, unequivocal role reversal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">\u201cHe can\u2019t perform sexually. Can\u2019t imagine what that is like. He can\u2019t basically do anything for himself. <em>If you sit there by yourself with your arms still seated in a chair and just don\u2019t move </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, I am going to object to that argument as being in violation of the golden rule, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: I will rephrase it to avoid any problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: You can\u2019t put the jury in that position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: [Velocity Express] can\u2019t find a doctor. But they don\u2019t want a doctor. They want a miracle. Just like the happening of this accident. No amount of witnesses would satisfy Velocity Express. You could have four bishops on the side of the road watching what is going on and they still could claim somehow it wasn\u2019t their fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it is all well and good that Corporate America balances the books and tries to make a profit. That is the American way, isn\u2019t it? But you cannot balance the books on the backs of the injured. You can\u2019t take a little man like this, injure him horribly, and then try to save money by a cheap life care plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cThis guy Taylor they bring down here even - he can\u2019t fuss with the fact that Brian [Hugen] needs somebody 24 hours a day. Yet, what he wants to do is he doesn\u2019t want to give him a nurse. He wants to give him an aide. But he has to concede that the aide, which costs about [$] 100,000 - the numbers are here somewhere - a year, if they gave him the nurse, the nurse would cost 394-, So what have you got? $500,000 a year. That would be the two combined. So that would save $400,000 a year that Velocity itself says would have to be spent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>\u201cWell, let me ask you all something. Suppose money were no object in this case and we didn\u2019t have Brian Hugen here. Let\u2019s say we have a man \u2014 a wealthy man, a man of means who could afford whatever he wants to. Suppose this had happened to them, Howard Hughes, Bill Gates, somebody like that. Suppose they were laying up in the condition Brian [Hugen] was. Do you think they would have one little aide? You don\u2019t think they wouldn\u2019t have an aide, a nurse, and whatever else it took to make their life as good as it possibly could?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: <em>Your Honor, I am going to object to this argument, as well. It is improper. The plaintiff in the case is Brian Hugen. It is not Bill Gates. It is not anyone else. It is improper argument. There has been no evidence about what those individuals would expect, not even a reasonable inference.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Overruled.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: So we get the discount plan. We are going to balance the books. So who is the economic well spring here? Who is providing Velocity Express with this big savings? I don\u2019t see her here in the courtroom. Her name is Florence Hugen. So you forgive me if I am a bit sarcastic, but Mr. Taylor\u2019s plan, I don\u2019t call that the Taylor plan[,] I call that the Flo plan because they are going to have Flo do everything that the nurse is supposed to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cNow, they give an aide in there. And I don\u2019t know a lot about aides but let me ask you something. Suppose something goes south for Brian? Who would you want in the house? And I am not talking about giving pills. Because Mr. Train wants you to believe that the only thing the nurse would do is give pills. Let me ask you. <em>Suppose your husband were choking to death and he couldn\u2019t open his mouth? Do you want an aide trying to get your husband\u2019s throat clear or would you like to have a nurse \u2014</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: Again, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: - while you\u2019re at work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think it is not appropriate to ask the jurors to put themselves in the place of the party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: And I apologize. If you can imagine you\u2019re responsible for a person. Don\u2019t imagine your family members. That was an improper question. And I perhaps in my enthusiasm or whatever you want to call it I misspoke. I do apologize to you. And Mr. Train\u2019s objection is well taken. I apologize, Mr. Train, and Velocity. But if you were responsible for someone, who would you want there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: Same objection, Your Honor. It is the same - I mean, you can\u2019t appeal to the jury. You can\u2019t place the jury -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: The idea of responsibility, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I hate to interrupt the party when they are making their closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: I do, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: The jurors shouldn\u2019t be asked to be put in the place of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF]: You know, [Dr.] Kreutzer\u2019s plan that he did for Brian, that is no Cadillac plan. I mean, you are not talking about a registered nurse. You are just talking about a licensed practical nurse. He doesn\u2019t have any money folded in for contingencies. I mean, there is not a nickel in there for any of that. I mean, it is not - it is not some fluffed-up plan like the defense would have you believe. It is just basically what is needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cIf, for example, if - suppose an individual were charged with the care of someone\u2019s, let\u2019s say, child or something like, this an eight-year-old child. And you had to pick an attendant for that child at the home while you were away. If the attendant was not qualified - and I am - I am talking about a child who can go to the kitchen to make a sandwich, go [to] the bathroom, run out of the house if there is a fire, things Brian can\u2019t do. If something happened to that child and you were responsible for selecting the attendant, social services would be coming all out the woodwork on top of you. And that is a big -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, I object. I try not to interrupt, as well. But he keeps arguing if you are talking to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think in that case it was not [inappropriate. I will overrule it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s argument to the jury, counsel for the defendant made a motion for a mistrial based upon plaintiff\u2019s cumulative improper and prejudicial arguments to the jury. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Defendant argues that the circuit court erred in denying the motion for a mistrial. Defendant contends that the circuit court erroneously overruled defendant\u2019s objections to plaintiff\u2019s references in closing argument to Howard Hughes and Bill Gates. Defendant also contends that plaintiff improperly and repeatedly requested that the jury place itself in plaintiff\u2019s position, thus wrongly invoking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cGolden Rule\u201d despite the court\u2019s repeated instructions to counsel not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Responding, plaintiff asserts that the circuit court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Plaintiff alleges that his references to Howard Hughes and Bill Gates were permissible to illustrate that \u201cdefendant\u2019s life care plan focused on cutting costs and not the plaintiff\u2019s medical needs.\u201d Plaintiff claims that his closing argument regarding the need for a licensed practical nurse did not improperly invoke the \u201cGolden Rule.\u201d We disagree with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The principles we apply when considering whether a circuit court erred in denying a mistrial based on statements made by counsel in closing argument are well established. Generally, a new trial is not required if the circuit court sustains an objection to improper argument and instructs the jury to disregard the improper argument. However, if <em>\u201ccounsel persists in such argument after the admonition of the court, </em>or if it appears that the [prejudicial] influence of the argument was probably not wholly removed by the court\u2019s action\u201d a new trial may be appropriate. <em>Maxey </em>v. <em>Hubble, </em>238 Va. 607, 614-15, 385 S.E.2d 593, 596 (1989) (quoting <em>Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. Brown, </em>137 Va. 670, 676, 120 S.E. 269, 271 (1923)); <em>Kitze v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 283, 288, 435 S.E.2d 583, 585 (1993); <em>Norfolk Southern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>190 Va. 966, 975, 59 S.E.2d 110, 114 (1950). If the objection to the alleged improper argument is not sustained by the circuit court, a new trial is appropriate if that court erred in overruling the objection and that error resulted in prejudice to the complaining party. <em>Reid v. Baumgardner, </em>217 Va. 769, 775, 232 S.E.2d 778, 781 (1977); <em>McLane v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 197, 205, 116 S.E.2d 274, 280-81 (1960). The closing argument in this case includes argument to which objections were sustained and argument to which an objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We will first consider whether the circuit court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to plaintiff\u2019s closing argument that, in effect, suggested to the jury that it award plaintiff damages that would permit him to procure the services of a licensed practical nurse because wealthy persons such as Howard Hughes or Bill Gates would procure the services of a licensed practical nurse if they had incurred plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In <em>Atlantic Coast Realty Co. v. Robertson\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>135 Va. 247, 263, 116 S.E. 476, 481 (1923), we discussed the wide latitude accorded lawyers during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201c[An attorney] must be just to opposing litigants and witnesses and always respect their rights. His liberties in argument are large but they are not unlimited. He has no right to testify in argument nor to assume that there is evidence which has no existence, nor to urge a decision which is favorable to his client by arousing sympathy, exciting prejudice, or upon any ground which is illegal. Sometimes the impropriety is so serious in character that its evil effect cannot be corrected by the trial judge. If this ethical rule ... is not sufficient to control those who fail to observe it, the courts, however reluctant they may be to limit the freedom of discussion, or to penalize a litigant for the transgression of his attorney, will be forced to curb this growing evil.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">We stated, almost 100 years ago, that counsel in closing argument must not appeal to the economic fears and passions of a jury and that such argument constitutes reversible error. <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Simmons, </em>105 Va. 651, 666-67, 55 S.E. 459, 464 (1906). In <em>Simmons, </em>counsel for the defendant, in closing argument,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\u201cexpressed the fear that the railroad employees who had testified against the company would lose their places, although there was no evidence on this point; that counsel for the railroad company rode in private and palace cars when they came to court, although there was no evidence on this point; that the mind could not grasp the extent of the resources and possessions of the Southern Railway Company, while [the plaintiff] was a poor man with nobody but his wife and child, and with no one to help him but his wife; that the treasury of the railway company was so exhaustless that it would hardly feel the loss of $50,000, the amount claimed in the declaration; and that in estimating damages [the jury] should take into consideration the fact that exceptions had been taken by the defendant, and that it had been stated that if the verdict was against it, it would appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 665-66, 55 S.E. at 464. We concluded that \u201c[s]uch a line of argument, if proper objection be made to it at the proper time and the trial court fails to take proper steps to correct its ill tendencies, will constitute a sufficient ground for reversing a judgment rendered upon a verdict thus obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666-67, 55 S.E. at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>In <em>Baumgardner, </em>counsel for the defendant objected to the plaintiff\u2019s improper jury argument that asked a jury to award a verdict that included as damages $1,000 for each of the plaintiff\u2019s 28.7 years of life expectancy as established by an annuity table. The circuit court overruled the objection. Reversing the judgment of the circuit court, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\u201cThe decision of the trial court as to the method by which to remove the prejudicial effect of improper argument is within its sound discretion, and an admonition to the jury to disregard such argument is generally deemed to have been sufficient and not to have been an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. . . . However, if the trial court refuses to take any corrective action to eliminate the adverse effect on the jury of improper argument, the probability of prejudice is increased by the apparent approval given by the court to the argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">217 Va. at 774, 232 S.E.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Applying our well-established precedent, we hold that the circuit court erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. As we have already stated, plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the following argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201cSuppose money were no object in this case and we didn\u2019t have Brian Hugen here. Let\u2019s say we have a man - a wealthy man, a man of means who could afford whatever he wants to. Suppose this had happened to them, Howard Hughes, Bill Gates, somebody like that. Suppose they were laying up in the condition Brian was. Do you think they would have one little aide? You don\u2019t think they wouldn\u2019t have an aide, a nurse, and whatever else it took to make their life as good as it possibly could?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Defendant timely objected to this argument, and the circuit court overruled the objection. This argument was improper because plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the jury to award damages based upon irrelevant economic considerations that are not part of the record in this case. The above-referenced portion of plaintiff\u2019s closing argument asked the jury to award damages to the plaintiff so that he could afford the same quality of medical care and treatment that the world\u2019s richest individuals might purchase for themselves. The law of this Commonwealth, however, only requires that a jury award plaintiff compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tory damages that will fairly compensate him for his injuries proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The probable prejudicial impact of this argument is significant because the improper argument focused on the central dispute regarding damages in this case. As we have already stated, the defendant presented evidence that the plaintiff only required the services of a certified nursing aide who would cost approximately $96,360 per year, which, when added to other related costs, resulted in a life care plan that totaled $4,123,193.50. In direct conflict, however, plaintiff presented evidence that he required the services of a licensed practical nurse who would cost $425,955 per year, which, when added to the rest of his medical plan, represented a total cost of $17,091,000. Plaintiff\u2019s improper jury argument was designed to influence the jury\u2019s decision regarding this choice. The circuit court refused to take any corrective action to eliminate the adverse prejudicial effect on the jury of plaintiff\u2019s improper argument. Based upon the record before this Court, we conclude that the probability of prejudice upon the jury was great and such prejudice was increased by the apparent approval given by the circuit court because of that court\u2019s refusal to take corrective action.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We also consider whether the circuit court erred by refusing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial because plaintiff improperly and repeatedly requested that the jury place itself in plaintiff\u2019s position, thus, invoking the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d despite the court\u2019s repeated instructions to plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We have repeatedly held that counsel may not, in closing argument, invoke the so-called \u201cGolden Rule.\u201d \u201cThe function of the jury is to decide according to the evidence, not according to how its members might wish to be treated.\u201d <em>Seymour v. </em>Richardson, 194 Va. 709, 715, 75 S.E.2d 77, 81 (1953); <em>accord P.

Brown, </em>137 Va. 670, 676, 120 S.E. 269, 271 (1923) (citing <em>Washington &amp; Old Dominion Ry. v. Ward, </em>119 Va. 334, 339, 89 S.E. 140, 142 (1916)), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cGenerally a new trial will be denied [when] improper argument has been checked by the court and the jury has been instructed to disregard the improper statements. If, however, counsel persists in such argument after the admonition of the court, or if it appears that the unfavorable influence of the argument was probably not wholly removed by the court\u2019s action, a new trial may be allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Jayne, </em>151 Va. 694, 144 S.E. 638 (1928), we reversed a judgment in favor of a plaintiff because his counsel continued to make improper argument in spite of the circuit court\u2019s admonitions. Counsel in <em>Jayne </em>stated to the jury: \u201cHow long will the defendant company shed its tears after this trial is over? Do you suppose its tear duct has been hurt any?\u201d The circuit court directed the jury to disregard these remarks and, subsequently, counsel stated to the jury: \u201cThat is just a figure of speech. You know corporations haven\u2019t any tear ducts.\u201d The circuit court instructed the jury to disregard this remark as well. <em>Id. </em>at 703, 144 S.E. at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We concluded that these remarks were improper and prejudicial, and we reversed the judgment that confirmed the jury\u2019s verdict. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201cLitigants can have no just grounds for complaint if verdicts obtained under such circumstances are set aside. To require counsel to confine their discussions before the jury to the law and the evidence is no hardship, but is in furtherance of justice, and of the prompt disposition of controversies based upon the law and the evidence, subjected of course to any fair analysis or criticism, which the ingenuity of counsel may devise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 704, 144 S.E. at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Applying the aforementioned principles, we must conclude that plaintiff\u2019s repeated requests to the jury that it apply the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d were prejudicial and constitute reversible error. As we have previously stated, plaintiff argued to the jury: \u201cSuppose your husband were choking to death and he couldn\u2019t open his mouth? Do you want an aide trying to get your husband\u2019s throat clear or would you like to have a nurse . . . while you\u2019re at work?\u201d The defendant objected, and the circuit court stated: \u201cI think it is not appropriate to ask the jurors to put themselves in the place of the party.\u201d Plaintiff apologized, but immediately he argued to the jury: \u201cBut if you were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>responsible for someone, who would you want there?\u201d The defendant objected, and the circuit court again responded: \u201cThe jurors shouldn\u2019t be asked to be put in the place of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Even though the circuit court properly sustained most of the objections, plaintiff\u2019s counsel continued to invoke the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d during closing argument. This argument was highly prejudicial because plaintiff repeatedly asked the jury, despite the circuit court\u2019s admonitions, to assess his damages in relation to how the jurors would want to be compensated personally had they been injured and sustained the same injuries that plaintiff had sustained. And, even though plaintiff\u2019s counsel acknowledged to the circuit court that his use of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d was improper, he continued to engage in this prejudicial argument. Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s repeated use of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d was also highly prejudicial because this argument was designed to influence the jury\u2019s decision whether to base its verdict upon plaintiff\u2019s proposed life care plan that cost $17,091,000 instead of defendant\u2019s life care plan for plaintiff that cost $4,123,193.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Generally, when a litigant makes a prejudicial closing argument to a jury in a non-bifurcated trial, the appropriate remedy is to award a new trial on all issues. In this case, however, the evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding of liability. Thus, we hold that the prejudice caused by the improper jury argument, which involved the conflicting evidence about plaintiff\u2019s future medical care, could not have affected the jury\u2019s findings of negligence. Therefore, a new trial on all issues is not appropriate. Because this case will be remanded for a new trial on damages, we must consider certain issues that probably will arise upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Defendant argues that the circuit court erred by refusing to permit defendant to introduce evidence of plaintiff\u2019s history of crack cocaine use, depression, and short-term memory loss one year before the accident. Continuing, defendant contends that the circuit court erred by refusing to permit defendant to cross-examine plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses regarding plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpre-accident use of crack cocaine and its effect on his post-accident condition\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpreaccident bouts of depression and [their] relationship to his post-accident claims for depression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>During the trial, plaintiff sought damages for cognitive and emotional injuries he sustained as a result of the accident, including memory loss and depression. Dr. William M. Bethea described plaintiff\u2019s emotional instability and depressive condition. Dr. Bethea also testified that plaintiff suffered from short-term memory loss. Dr. Jeffrey S. Kreutzer, a neuropsychologist, described plaintiff\u2019s range of post-accident cognitive defects, including his loss of memory and ability to concentrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Dr. Bethea testified, outside the presence of the jury, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cQ: Doctor, can ... the habitual use of crack cocaine cause memory loss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u201cA: [Counselor,] I would like to make it very clear that when I answer this question, I think it has absolutely nothing to do with this situation based upon the circumstances in which I have cared for him over the last year - Mr. Hugen over the past year. The answer would be yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cQ: Dr. Bethea, if I insinuated that it was my position that [plaintiff] had been using drugs since the accident, I apologize. That is certainly not what I am trying to say or insinuate in any way, shape, or form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201cA: I just want to make it very clear that all of those things that I have testified to in terms of my assessment of the [plaintiff\u2019s] present set of circumstances would have absolutely nothing to do with prior . . . drug use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">\u201cQ: And [plaintiff] has short-term memory loss, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">\u201cA: Brian Hugen was deficient in a brain-injury pattern not a drug-injury pattern.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">This Court has consistently stated that \u201ccross-examination on a matter relevant to the litigation and put in issue by an adversary\u2019s witness during a [trial] is not a privilege but an absolute right.\u201d <em>Basham </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>199 Va. 817, 824, 102 S.E.2d 285, 290 (1958); <em>accord Food Lion, Inc. v. Cox, </em>257 Va. 449, 450, 513 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1999); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>153 Va. 890, 895-96, 149 S.E. 459, 460 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>However, evidence sought to be elicited during cross-examination must be relevant. \u201cEvidence is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove, or is pertinent to, matters in issue.\u201d <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 257, 546 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001); <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 478, 486, 100 S.E.2d 766, 772 (1957). We have stated that \u201c[e]very fact, however remote or insignificant, that tends to establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue is relevant.\u201d <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Dungee, </em>258 Va. 235, 260, 520 S.E.2d 164, 179 (1999); <em>Ravenwood Towers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodyard, </em>244 Va. 51, 56, 419 S.E.2d 627, 630 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Based upon the record before this Court, we conclude that the circuit court properly refused defendant\u2019s attempt to cross-examine plaintiff\u2019s expert witness on plaintiff\u2019s prior drug use because that evidence was not relevant. There is no evidence that plaintiff\u2019s brain injury or depression was caused by or related to drug use. Therefore, evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s prior use of cocaine or his depression could not \u201cprove or disprove\u201d matters in issue. For example, Dr. Bethea\u2019s testimony, proffered by defendant, established that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not caused by drug use. Moreover, Dr. Kreutzer testified, outside the presence of the jury, that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no indication in [plaintiff\u2019s medical] record that this man suffered medically, neurologically, as a consequence of drug or alcohol use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Even though Dr. Bethea agreed, outside the presence of the jury, that crack cocaine could cause short-term memory loss, Dr. Bethea testified without equivocation that plaintiff\u2019s condition was not related in any way to drug use. Dr. Bethea also testified, outside the presence of the jury, that plaintiff\u2019s condition was so devastating that any emotional instability that occurred in past years would have had no effect on his current condition. Additionally, we note that the circuit court permitted defendant to cross-examine Dr. Bethea and elicit testimony of complaints that plaintiff made about depression one year before the accident. Simply stated, defendant does not have an absolute right to cross-examine a witness about evidence that is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Defendant argues that the circuit court improperly limited its cross-examination of Dr. Kreutzer regarding plaintiff\u2019s pre-injury depression. Defendant contends that Dr. Kreutzer\u2019s records show that plaintiff had told him of \u201ca two-year history of untreated depressive episodes.\u201d Defendant states that Dr. Kreutzer testified that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201chad been treated successfully for depression and that his depression had resolved several years before this accident.\u201d However, defendant says that medical records indicate that plaintiff experienced symptoms of depression as recently as one year before the accident and that Dr. Kreutzer\u2019s testimony was apparently false.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We hold that the circuit court did not err in limiting the scope of the cross-examination. As plaintiff correctly points out, plaintiff objected to defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Kreutzer on the basis that it was beyond the scope of direct examination. Plaintiff stated, in his objection, that \u201c[t]here was not a single question and/or answer elicited from this witness with regard to any diagnosis of depression.\u201d Dr. Kreutzer did not testify on direct examination about a diagnosis or subjective complaint of depression made by the plaintiff either before or after the accident and, therefore, the circuit court properly sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In view of our holdings, we do not consider defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error. We will remand this case for a new trial solely on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
