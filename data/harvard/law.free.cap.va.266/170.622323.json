Tanner, James C. Perry, and Brian W. Kreider violated certain sections of the Virginia Securities Act, Code \u00a7 13.1-501 <em>et seq. </em>(the Act). We affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, the Commission\u2019s judgments and remanded the case to the Commission for further consideration of penalties. <em>Tanner v. State Corporation Commission, 265 </em>Va. 148, 574 S.E.2d 525 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Thereafter, the Commission, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-675.2 and Rule 5:39, petitioned this Court for a rehearing to reconsider and withdraw the portions of the opinion that reversed its judgments. By order entered February 28, 2003, we granted the petition as it relates to Parts V and VI of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In Part V of the opinion in <em>Tanner, </em>we considered whether certain instruments entitled \u201cAccounts Receivable Purchase and Sales Agreement\u201d (the Agreements) issued by Kennsington Holding Corporation (Kennsington) and sold by Tanner, Perry, and Kreider are investment contracts as defined in <em>Securities and Exchange Com\u2019n </em>v. <em>W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293 (1946), and, therefore, securities subject to the registration requirements of the Act. The Commission contends that, in deciding that the Agreements are not securities, we based our decision on a mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Act defines a \u201csecurity\u201d to include an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-501. In <em>W.J. Howey Co., </em>the Supreme Court ruled that \u201can investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act [of 1933] means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or third party.\u201d 328 U.S. at 298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In Tanner, we rejected the Commission\u2019s contention that the purchasers of the Agreements were led to expect profits solely from the efforts of others. 265 Va. at 155, 574 S.E.2d at 529. We noted that, under the terms of the Agreements, Kennsington \u201csells, sets over and assigns\u201d to the purchasers certain accounts receivable; that the purchasers \u201cshall be the absolute owner[s] of the accounts;\u201d that Kennsington agreed to deliver to the purchasers \u201ca detailed listing of all of the accounts [and] the work folder for each account, as available, containing all supporting documents;\u201d and that the purchasers have \u201cthe right to assign the collection of the Accounts Receivable . . . to the Collection Company of their choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 574 S.E.2d at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">With respect to the operation of the Agreements, we said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">The sole evidence relating to the operation of the Agreements was the testimony of Harold J. Bailey, who had purchased accounts receivable owed to an entity called \u201cThe Legal Society.\u201d Bailey received a UCC-1 financing statement related to his purchase that showed the legal name of the debtor. He was furnished an information packet, including an explanation of \u201chow the entire system [of accounts receivable financing] works.\u201d Although Bailey, by a separate agreement, engaged Summit Financial Services to be his collection agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>nothing in the record suggests that Bailey was not free to proceed directly against The Legal Society to collect the accounts receivable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 155, 574 S.E.2d at 528-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Upon rehearing, the Commission contends that we mistakenly \u201crelied on the fact that . . . Bailey had received a UCC-1 financing statement related to his investment.\u201d The Commission so contends notwithstanding that Bailey testified that he \u201cgot a financing statement.\u201d Further, the record contains the information packet furnished to Bailey informing him that, \u201c[o]nce the receivables have been verified, Kennsington then files a UCC-1 on them <em>in the name of the </em>client.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Nonetheless, the Commission, in an attempt to vitiate this evidence in the record, attached to its petition for rehearing a copy of an alleged letter from Kennsington to Bailey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This document is not a part of the record, and we will not consider it. Upon rehearing, as with original appeals, we consider and make decisions based upon the record that has been brought to us. Accordingly, we reaffirm our decision in Part Y of the opinion in <em>Tanner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In Part VI of the opinion in <em>Tanner, </em>we considered whether certain promissory notes, which were issued pursuant to Rule 504 Regulation D, are exempt from registration under the Act. The Commission contends that our ruling that the notes are exempt from registration was based upon a mistake of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">We erred in concluding that Rule 504 Regulation D was issued under the authority of \u00a7 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77d(2) (2000). Based upon this erroneous conclusion, we held that the notes were exempt from the Act\u2019s registration requirements pursuant to \u00a7 18(b)(4) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">We are persuaded now that Rule 504 Regulation D was issued under the authority of \u00a7 3(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u00a7 77c(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the Rule itself references \u00a7 3(b), and the adopting release for Regulation D states that Rule 504 \u201cprovides an exemption under section 3(b) of the Securities Act.\u201d Securities Act Release No. 33-6389, 47 Fed. Reg. 11251 (March 16, 1982). Further, we are persuaded that \u00a7 18(b)(4) of the Securities Act does not preempt state law with respect to transactions exempt from registration pursuant to rules issued under \u00a7 3(b). In other words, securities issued under \u00a7 3(b) are <em>not </em>\u201ccovered securities\u201d and, therefore, must be registered under Code \u00a7 13.1-507.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">For the reasons stated above, Part VI of the opinion in <em>Tanner </em>will be modified. The remainder of the opinion will be reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>Reaffirmed, as modified.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\"> In this letter, Kennsington purportedly informed Bailey that \u201ca UCC-1 has been filed in the name of Kennsington.\u201d Therefore, according to the Commission, \u201cthe investors had to depend entirely upon Kennsington\u201d to collect on their investments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\"> Although the Commission made the argument, in <em>Tanner, </em>that securities issued under Rule 504 are not \u201ccovered securities,\u201d it did not cite \u00a7 3(b) of the Securities Act as authority to support its argument until it filed its petition for rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\"> The appellants contend that, even if the notes should have been registered, they should not be held accountable due to the complexity of the issue. While we agree that the issue is complex, especially to a lay person, our function is limited to correctly construing the applicable statutes, rules, and regulations. It well may be, however, that, when the Commission reconsiders penalties on remand, it will take into account the appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
