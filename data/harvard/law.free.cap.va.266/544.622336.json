Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On June 9, 1999, Kristy L. Chase (\u201cChase\u201d) purchased a new Chrysler Cirrus. The car had a number of mechanical problems. On August 16, 2001, Chase filed a motion for judgment against Daimler-Chrysler Corporation (\u201cDaimlerChrysler\u201d), the car\u2019s manufacturer, for breach of warranty, violation of the Virginia Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), and violation of the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. She sought total damages of $40,951.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Chase and DaimlerChrysler eventually reached a settlement agreement that was memorialized in a \u201cRepurchase Release Agreement.\u201d In the agreement, Chase received $13,242.04 from Daimler-Chrysler. DaimlerChrysler also agreed to assume loan payments remaining on the car. In return, Chase released DaimlerChrysler from all further claims except attorney\u2019s fees and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">With respect to attorney\u2019s fees and court costs, the agreement provided that if the parties failed to make a suitable compromise at a June 25th settlement conference, attorney\u2019s fees and court costs would be litigated. The parties failed to reach an agreement on attorney\u2019s fees and costs. At trial, DaimlerChrysler argued that Chase had not prevailed in her action by receiving a favorable judgment in court and was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the Virginia statute because she was not a \u201csuccessful\u201d party as the term was used in Code \u00a7 59.1-207.14. The trial court entered judgment in favor of DaimlerChrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Chase appeals the judgment of the trial court that she is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. She maintains that in achieving a repurchase agreement with DaimlerChrysler, she accomplished the remedies provided in the Act and was a \u201csuccessful\u201d party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The issue before us concerns only the attorney\u2019s fees and costs provisions of Code \u00a7 59.1-207.14<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">Any consumer who suffers loss by reason of a violation of any provision of this chapter may bring a civil action to enforce such provision. Any consumer who is successful in such an action or any defendant in any frivolous action brought by a consumer shall recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, expert witness fees and court costs incurred by bringing such actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The so-called \u201cVirginia Lemon Law\u201d provides for a consumer to receive a replacement motor vehicle or a full refund for a purchase of a motor vehicle that cannot be brought into conformity with the manufacturer\u2019s express warranty. Code \u00a7 59.1-207.13. Although the terms of the settlement agreement clearly compromised the amount of damages claimed, Chase maintains that her settlement with DaimlerChrysler included return and refund. Accordingly, Chase argues that she is a \u201csuccessful\u201d claimant under the Act and that the trial court erred in denying her fees and costs. Daimler-Chrysler argues that it denied liability but compromised the claim in a settlement agreement; consequently, neither party can claim to be a \u201csuccessful\u201d party under the statute. Further, DaimlerChrysler emphasizes that the final order in this civil action awards judgment to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The question before us is simply stated: what is \u201csuccessful\u201d for the purposes of an award of fees and costs under the Virginia Lemon Law? Our analysis begins, as it should, with the text of the statute itself. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">While in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Signal Corp. v. Keane Federal Systems, </em>265 Va. 38, 46-47, 574 S.E.2d 253, 257 (2003); <em>Halifax Corp. </em>v. <em>First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>262 Va. 91, 99-100, 546 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2001); <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Code \u00a7 59.1-207.14 refers to a \u201ccivil action to enforce\u201d the provisions of the Act. Furthermore, the award of fees and costs is expressly reserved to any \u201cconsumer who is successful in such an action.\u201d As the Code of Virginia provides, \u201c \u2018Action\u2019 and \u2018suit\u2019 may be used interchangeably and shall include all civil proceedings whether at law, in equity, or statutory in nature and whether in circuit courts or district courts.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-2(1). Consequently, being \u201csuccessful\u201d in this statutory \u201ccivil action,\u201d by definition, means that the action terminates in favor of the claimant. Under the terms of the Act, we look to the order terminating the action to determine whether the plaintiff was \u201csuccessful.\u201d The final judgment order in this case expressly states that judgment is awarded to the defendant, DaimlerChrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Chase maintains that the repurchase of the automobile in question defines a \u201csuccessful\u201d outcome for the purpose of an award of fees and costs. At oral argument, when presented with the hypothetical case of a claim for $50,000, compromised by repurchase for $1, Chase insisted that the claimant would, nonetheless, be \u201csuccessful\u201d for the purpose of an award of fees and costs. The statutory scheme does not suggest such a radical interpretation. Neither does it suggest that courts should engage in evaluation of the relative success of either party in their compromise. The language of the statute requires that the civil action itself be resolved in favor of the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Such an interpretation of the statute is consistent with the reasoning of the Court in the recent case of <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Castle, </em>263 Va. 407, 559 S.E.2d 616 (2002). In <em>Sheets, </em>we considered the interpretation of a contractual attorney\u2019s fee provision in favor of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in litigation that concluded with a nonsuit. In reaching an interpretation of the term, \u201cprevailing party,\u201d we stated: \u201cWe need not go farther than <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>for its common meaning: \u2018A party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded.\u2019 <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1145 (7th ed. 1999).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 559 S.E.2d at 620. While unnecessary to the opinion in <em>Sheets, </em>for the purposes of this case it is important to note that the definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d upon which we relied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Sheets </em>includes its synonym, \u201csuccessful party.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1145 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Finally, Chase argues that requiring the consumer to obtain an order terminating the civil action in their favor would discourage settlements. We are not persuaded by this concern. Lawyers and litigants will factor this requirement into their settlement negotiations and govern themselves accordingly. Presumably, the risk of trial and an award of fees and costs will not change with the application of this standard in assessing whether a party has been \u201csuccessful.\u201d What will most certainly change is the manner in which settlement agreements are memorialized. A consent order reciting that the consumer was the prevailing party and reserving the amount of fees and costs for judicial determination would sufficiently demonstrate which party was \u201csuccessful\u201d in the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The civil action in this case did not conclude with an order or judgment in favor of the consumer. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Chase an award of fees and costs pursuant to Code \u00a7 59.1-207.14. We will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> We did not award a writ of error to consider the trial court\u2019s denial of fees and costs under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 et seq. Additionally, we note that Chase did not present to the trial court a claim based upon breach of the settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
