Buchanan (Wife) to maintain an action for fraudulent conveyance under Code \u00a7 55-80, directing a special commissioner to hold the proceeds of those conveyances and others pending disposition of a divorce proceeding, and awarding Wife attorneys\u2019 fees. Because, for the reasons stated below, we find that Wife was an \u201cother person\u201d who \u201cmay be\u201d entitled to payment from Husband under the fraudulent conveyance statute, that the directive to the special commissioner to hold certain funds did not create constructive trusts, and that the issue regarding attorneys\u2019 fees is moot, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">\n<em>MATERIAL FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Husband and Wife were married in September 1973 and separated in February 2000. On January 5, 2001, eleven months after the couple\u2019s separation, Husband sold construction equipment to his father Harold B. Buchanan (Father), for $30,500. Father paid Husband $8,000 in cash and signed a promissory note in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>$22,500. A month later, on February 26, 2001, Husband gave his mother, Bessie B. Buchanan (Mother), and Father $12,250 and $5,750, respectively, in repayment of loans they had allegedly made to Husband in the past. The funds given to Husband\u2019s parents were proceeds from a $40,000 line of credit and an additional $40,000 loan Husband obtained in January 2001. The line of credit and loan were secured by deeds of trust against the Buchanan home. The home was built during the marriage on property owned by Husband prior to the marriage and titled in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">On March 9, 2001, Husband filed a bill of complaint seeking a divorce on the grounds of separation in excess of one year. Wife filed an answer and cross-bill alleging cruelty and constructive desertion. On July 2, 2001, Wife filed a bill of complaint against Husband and his parents asserting that Husband\u2019s conveyances to his parents were fraudulent in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-80 and -81.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">At the request of the parties, the trial court consolidated the fraudulent conveyance and the divorce proceedings. The parties agreed that the claims would be heard sequentially, with evidence on the fraudulent conveyance claims presented first.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In the proceedings relating to the fraudulent conveyance claims, the trial court sustained Husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding Wife\u2019s claim pursuant to Code \u00a7 55-81, but denied Husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment in which he asserted Wife could not maintain an action pursuant to Code \u00a7 55-80. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court held that Husband\u2019s transfers of $5,750 and $12,250 to Father and Mother, respectively, were void because each was done with the intent to \u201cdelay, hinder, or defraud\u201d Wife\u2019s ability to recover property she may be entitled to from Husband in violation of Code \u00a7 55-80. The court did not void Father\u2019s title to the construction equipment, finding that the sale was for valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The trial court appointed a Special Commissioner to take possession of the $22,500 promissory note and hold in \u201cconstructive trust\u201d payments due to Husband by Father pursuant to that note, the $12,250 paid to Mother, and the $5,750 paid to Father pending the evidentiary hearing on the divorce and equitable distribution determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Following the hearing in the divorce action, the trial court entered an order requiring Husband to pay Wife $105,000 based upon its determination of equitable distribution. The court also awarded Wife $27,000 for her attorneys\u2019 fees and costs \u201cincurred in this matter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the fraudulent conveyance action.\u201d Wife received partial satisfaction of these monetary awards when, pursuant to the trial court\u2019s order, the Special Commissioner paid Wife, from the funds held in \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d the $12,250 that Husband originally paid to Mother and an $11,250 payment made by Father on the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In this appeal, Husband challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to sustain his motion for summary judgment regarding Wife\u2019s ability to maintain an action pursuant to Code \u00a7 55-80, the imposition of a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d on the promissory note and various cash payments, and the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for the fraudulent conveyance action. We consider these issues in order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>CODE \u00a7 55-80</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Husband\u2019s first assignment of error involves the application of the fraudulent conveyance statute, Code \u00a7 55-80, to the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband does not challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that he fraudulently conveyed funds to Mother; rather, Husband asserts that Wife could not maintain an action under Code \u00a7 55-80 because her claim against him had not accrued at the time of the conveyance. Husband argues that Wife\u2019s claim accrued only upon an equitable distribution determination in the context of their divorce proceeding and that the divorce proceeding was not filed until after the conveyance at issue. Thus, Husband asserts that, at the time of the conveyance, Wife was not an \u201cother person\u201d who \u201cmay be lawfully entitled\u201d to payment from Husband for purposes of Code \u00a7 55-80. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Code \u00a7 55-80 embodies the common law principle that transfers of real or personal property made \u201cwith intent to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors, purchasers, or other persons of or from what they are or may be lawfully entitled to\u201d are void. The \u201cessence of fraudulent conveyance ... is the diminution of the debtor\u2019s estate to the detriment of the creditor\u2019s right of realization.\u201d 1 Garrard Glenn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences \u00a7 319, at 556 (rev. ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">To maintain an action under this statute, the entitlement of one alleging a fraudulent conveyance need not be judicially established or reduced to judgment at the time of the challenged conveyance. For example, in <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Crowder, </em>125 Va. 80, 99 S.E. 746 (1919), a wife prevailed in an action under a predecessor to Code \u00a7 55-80 even though the fraudulent conveyance occurred prior to any determination of the wife\u2019s right to a divorce or alimony. Moreover, in <em>Davis v. Davis, 239 </em>Va. 657, 391 S.E.2d 255 (1990), we said that although the spousal support award was not made until after the fraudulent conveyance, the wife could pursue an action under Code \u00a7 55-80 because that section applies to both what one is entitled to, and what one \u201cmay be entitled to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661 n.3, 391 S.E.2d at 257 n.3. And, in another context, we have held that a \u201cdeed made with intent to defraud a recovery by a third person of damages in an action of tort, even before trial and judgment ... is fraudulent and void to the same extent as a conveyance to hinder, delay and defraud existing creditors.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Dean, </em>149 Va. 39, 46, 140 S.E. 277, 280 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Wife\u2019s claim here is based on that portion of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 that gives a spouse a marital interest in property acquired during marriage and in the improved value of the property occurring during marriage. Wife\u2019s entitlement to that marital interest was enforced in the divorce proceeding through the application of the statutory principles of equitable distribution. Like the claimants in <em>Crowder, Davis, </em>and <em>Bruce, </em>Husband\u2019s liability to Wife in this case was not established or quantified until after the conveyance at issue. Nevertheless, like those claimants, at the time of the conveyance in question, Wife was an \u201cother person\u201d who \u201cmay be\u201d entitled to payment from Husband. Code \u00a7 55-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Husband, noting that independent actions for divorce, alimony, and support were available to the spouses in <em>Crowder </em>and <em>Davis </em>at the time of the fraudulent conveyances, asserts that the fraudulent conveyance statute requires that the spouse\u2019s claim be enforceable by an independent action at the time of the conveyance. Husband contends that Wife had no cognizable claim for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance statute because at the time of the conveyance at issue no divorce action had been filed and Wife could not file an independent action for equitable distribution. We again disagree with Husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Neither <em>Crowder </em>nor <em>Davis </em>held that the present availability of an enforcement action was a prerequisite to maintaining a fraudulent conveyance action under Code \u00a7 55-80. In this case, the enforcement mechanism for the claim giving rise to Husband\u2019s liability to Wife was the divorce proceeding. The grounds for divorce in this case, separation in excess of one year, prevented the filing of the divorce at the time of the conveyance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To hold that such limitations period for instituting procedures to enforce a claim defeats Wife\u2019s fraudulent conveyance action is inconsistent with the longstanding public policy against fraudulent conveyances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A transferor could circumvent the policy by transferring assets just prior to the expiration of the limitations period even though the transferor knew of the impending liability and made the transfer precisely to shield the assets from the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In this case, the parties had been separated for eleven months prior to the transfers in issue. Husband did not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that Husband conveyed the property with the intent of defrauding or otherwise deterring Wife from recovering amounts from him. It is inherent in this finding that Husband believed that at the time he conveyed the funds, eleven months after the separation and one month before he filed a petition for divorce, a divorce proceeding would ensue and that a judgment would or could be entered making him liable to Wife. He was aware of Wife\u2019s rights or claims under the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 and took action to defeat or hinder the realization of these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Accordingly, under the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in holding that Wife was an \u201cother person\u201d who \u201cmay be\u201d entitled to payment from Husband and therefore could maintain an action under Code \u00a7 55-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\n<em>CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In the fraudulent conveyance proceedings, the trial court ordered that a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d be imposed on the $22,500 owed Husband under the promissory note executed for the construction equipment and instructed the Special Commissioner to \u201ctake possession of the promissory note and any payments due thereunder pending further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>order of this court in the divorce action.\u201d The trial court also imposed a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d on the $12,250 Husband paid to Mother and ordered Mother to deposit that sum with the Special Commissioner pending the divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In his second and third assignments of error, Husband asserts that these \u201cconstructive trusts\u201d were improperly imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A constructive trust is a mechanism by which the person holding title to property is subjected to an equitable duty to convey the property to another because allowing the title holder to retain the property would be unjust. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Counts, </em>221 Va. 582, 590, 272 S.E.2d 190, 195-96 (1980). The constructive trust arises by operation of law and is independent of the intention of the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 588-89, 272 S.E.2d at 195. In an action in which a constructive trust is imposed, the original transfer is not declared void; rather the title holder is ordered to transfer title of the property to or for the benefit of another. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 272 S.E.2d at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The remedy for a fraudulent conveyance is generally to declare the transfer void, or, under certain circumstances, to enter a personal judgment against the transferee. <em>See Price </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>247 Va. 32, 35-36, 439 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1994). Voiding the conveyance was the remedy adopted by the trial court with regard to the funds Husband fraudulently transferred to Mother, but, rather than returning the funds to the Husband, the trial court placed the funds with the Special Commissioner pending a final decree in the divorce action. Although labeled a \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d placing the funds with the Special Commissioner did not create the type of trust contemplated by the jurisprudence of constructive trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Accordingly, regardless of the terminology used, the trial court did not impose a constructive trust on the funds fraudulently conveyed to Mother.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-103, the trial court had the authority to transfer those funds to the Commissioner pending further proceedings in the divorce actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Husband also complains that the trial court erred in imposing a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d on the promissory note executed by Father in favor of Husband and on the cash payments made under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>note.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once again, however, the \u201cconstructive trust\u201d imposed was not a true constructive trust. The legal title holder of the note, the Husband, was not required to transfer the note to, or hold the note for the benefit of, another party. The trial court\u2019s order that the note and its proceeds be placed in the custody of the Special Commissioner pending divorce was no more than a mechanism to preserve the Husband\u2019s estate authorized by Code \u00a7 20-103. Because no true constructive trusts were placed on the note or its proceeds, we reject Husband\u2019s second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>ATTORNEYS\u2019FEES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In his final assignment of error, Husband asserts that the trial court erred in awarding Wife attorneys\u2019 fees in the fraudulent conveyance action. We will not address the merits of this assignment of error, however, because the issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The decree entered in the divorce action on August 6, 2002, awarded Wife $27,000 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs \u201cincurred in this matter and the fraudulent conveyance action consolidated with this matter which sum . . . shall be docketed as a judgment against Husband.\u201d The Husband did not appeal the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded in this decree, either to this Court or the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $27,000 is, therefore, a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">For the above stated reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\"> We do not consider the $5,750 payment to Father here because for reasons not relevant to this appeal, those funds were returned to Father, rendering that issue moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\"> Code \u00a7 55-80 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">Every gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer of . . . any estate, real or personal, . . . given with intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors, purchasers or other persons of or from what they are or may be lawfully entitled to shall, as to such creditors, purchasers or other persons, their representatives or assigns, be void. This section shall not affect the title of a purchaser for valuable consideration, unless it appear that he had notice of the fraudulent intent of his immediate grantor or of the fraud rendering void the title of such grantor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> Whether Wife could have prevailed in a divorce proceeding filed on other grounds at the time of the conveyances is not clear from this record. Nevertheless, the ultimate result of the divorce action is not determinative of the fraudulent conveyance action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\"> <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 55-82 (allowing a creditor to file an action under Code \u00a7 55-80 before default by the transferor/debtor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> In light of our conclusion that no constructive trust arose, we need not address Husband\u2019s assertion that an <em>in personam </em>judgment against Mother was the appropriate remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> Although Husband asserts that the trial court imposed a constructive trust on the promissory note itself, the order only imposed the \u201cconstructive trust\u201d on the amounts owed to Husband under the note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\"> Husband brought a separate appeal to the Court of Appeals regarding the trial court\u2019s holdings on constructive desertion, equitable distribution, payment requirements, interest, disposition of separate property, and future spousal support. Resolution of those issues does not affect the matters before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
