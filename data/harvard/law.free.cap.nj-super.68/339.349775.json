A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AF3\">In April 1959 Esslinger\u2019s Inc., a brewer of beer, sued Michael Alachnowicz, one of its former distributors, for $4,509.84 on a book account. Alachnowicz filed a counterclaim for damages for termination of his distributorship, but in it he made no claim of the lifetime contract hereafter mentioned. On July 10, 1959 Esslinger\u2019s was granted summary judgment for the $4,509.84 plus interest, which Alachnowicz paid. It was not until September 1959 that Alachnowicz moved to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>counterclaim to set up said lifetime contract. After the amendment was a] lowed the case proceeded to a pretrial order, unfortunately almost completely devoid of the factual contentions of the parties, and then to a trial in the Superior Court, Law Division, which resulted in a judgment in Alachnowicz\u2019s favor of $48,000. Esslinger\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Esslingor\u2019s contends that its motions to dismiss the counterclaim at the end of the counterclaimant\u2019s case and at the end of the whole case should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Whether there was a lifetime contract depends entirely upon the evidence of what was said ia a single conversation which allegedly took place in March 1049 between Michael Alachnowicz, his son Stanley, and J. P. Brown, an officer of Esslinger\u2019s. Michael did not testify, allegedly because he was <em>72 </em>years old and ill. Stanley was the only one who gave evidence on the subject on behalf of the cou^terclaimant. He testified (emphasis ours) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201cQ.

Yes. <em>We said, \u2018We come to see you about the Laurel Beverage again.\u2019 Seeing whether we could possibly service them, </em>because they are very annoyed that they were told to buy off of South Jersey. I mentioned, \u201cWhat is the reason you cut off Laurel Beverage\u2019s supply?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">He said, \u2018Xjaurel Beverage is just interested in selling other brands.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">I said, \u2018AVe are not.

I had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>alternative but to make the move, because they are pushing other brands.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Can we service them?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">He said, \u2018Yes. Go out and straighten out the trouble.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">I said, \u2018Yes. <em>What kind of agreement are yon going to give us in writingV</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>And he said, \u2018I am not going to give you no written agreement.\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKf\">I said, \u2018Mr. Brown, you remember it\u2019s only about six or seven months ago that you took away the Eornataro accounts, and you told us after we straightened out the trouble they would be our accounts. You went back on your word once. What assurance do we have that you won\u2019t go back on your word again two or three years from now after we straighten out the trouble?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">He says, \u2018I want you to go in and straighten out this trouble.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\n<em>I said, \u2018We want some written agreement.\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\"><em>He said, \u2018I am not giving you a written agreement, it\u2019s against the policy of the company. </em>I promise you I will never cut you off.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5S\">Then my Dad says, \u2018How about my son?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">He says, \u2018Say, my son is active in the business.

As long as you go out and do a good job, I promise you I will never cut you off, <em>and the same thing for your son.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\"><em>j </em>said, \u2018We are willing to take <em>them, </em>but we are going to have to put on new equipment and new men. Under those conditions you will never take them away from us, as long as we do a good job?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">On cross-examination he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">\u201cQ. Then will you quote again what was said back in 1949 in March that you previously referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">A. Well, in March, \u201949, Esslinger took the beer away from the Laurel Beverage Supply, and we heard about it, and the circumstances led up to that most of the customers didn\u2019t want to buy the beer off of South Jersey Beverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\">So we went in to see Mr. Brown, he is the vice president of the brewery, and we said, \u2018We understand that you took the beer * <em>i- </em>*&gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-18\">Q. Who said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-19\">A. I said, I am sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-20\">I said, T understand that you took the beer away from Laurel Beverage.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-21\">And I said, \u2018There is quite a few accounts that are very annoyed of the fact that you told them that they had to buy from South J ersey.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-22\">And he said, \u2018Well, I had to discontinue them because they were interested in selling Ortliebs.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>I says, \u2018Well, Mr. Brown, we are not interested in selling Ortliebs. We have Esslinger\u2019s to sell. Gould we possibly take care of all these accounts because they are not too pleased in buying off of South Jersey?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">So he says, \u2018Yes, you can have the accounts.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">He said, more or less, T realize I made a mistake in trying to get the persons to buy off of one distributor. The only thing 1 am interested in is straightening the matter out.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">So I said, \u2018Gould we have <em>any hind </em>of an agreement in writing that you won\u2019t take <em>these accounts </em>away from us later on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">And he says, \u2018No,\u2019 he said, T won\u2019t give you anything in writing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">I said, \u2018Mr. Brown,\u2019 I said, \u2018we don\u2019t want them because you remember that you took the Fornataro accounts last year off of us after you telling us that we could have them; after we went to the trouble and expense, you took those away.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">And I says, \u2018Under those conditions if we can\u2019t get a written agreement, we do not want them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">And he says, \u2018Well, just go out and take care of these customers and get them,\u2019 and he says, T promise you I will never cut you off.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">And my father says, \u2018Well, that is fine.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">He says, \u2018Well, how about my son?\u2019 He said, \u2018Just So you go out and do a good job and you take on these customers,\u2019 he said, \u2018you both have nothing to worry about.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">Q. Mr. Alachnowicz, this conversation that you referred to too*, place about It years ago; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-15\">A. 1949.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-16\">Q. Approximately 11 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-18\">Q. And how old were you at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-19\">A. I was 23 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-20\">Q. And you have attempted to tell us as best you can word for word what you said; isn\u2019t that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-21\">A. Yes * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">The counterclaimant presented his case and recovered judgment not on the basis of the loss of only the Laurel accounts, but upon the basis of the loss of all of the profits of the beer sales that would have been made to all Alaclinowicz\u2019s customers for the period of Michael\u2019s life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">In <em>Broad St. National Bank of Trenton v. </em>Collier, 112 <em>N. J. L. </em>41, 44 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933), affirmed o. b. 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>303 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>declaration of intention to act in a certain way, wliieli does not show that the party who makes such declaration promises to act in such way, or intends to incur a legal liability obliging him to act in such way, is not an offer which can be accepted so as to make a contract. If it is sought to make an offer which, on acceptance, can become a contract, the words or acts by which it is made must show intention to assume liability. I <em>Supp. Page on Contracts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 77, 79.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">The offer and acceptance must have the characteristics of a binding bargain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Esslinger\u2019s argues that what Brown is alleged to have said, if he said it, was no more than such a declaration of intention, and that it must have been obvious to Michael and Stanley that he was not offering, on behalf of Esslinger\u2019s, to incur any legal liability, much less one which was to bind the corporation for the lives of Michael and Stanley. Furthermore, argues Esslinger\u2019s, there was no proof of Brown\u2019s authority to enter into such a contract\u2014certainly not the clear and explicit proof that is required to establish pathority to bind a corporation to such an unusual agreement. Finalty, says Esslinger\u2019s, in any event the alleged conversation does not spell out the contract alleged by the counterclaimant, but on the contrary is so vague and indefinite as to be unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Of course, whether there was such an offer by Brown on behalf of the corporation (assuming he had the authority to make it) depends not upon what Brown intended to say or upon what Michael and Stanley believed he meant, but rather upon what meaning the words should have conveyed to a reasonable person cognizant of the relationship between the parties and all of the antecedent and surrounding facts and circumstances. <em>Broad St. National Bank v. Collier, supra; </em>1 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 21 <em>(3d ed. </em>1957); <em>Ashley, </em>\u201cMutual Assent In Contract,\u201d 3 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>71 (1903). <em>Cf. Savarese v. Pyrene Mfg. Co., </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>595 (1952); <em>Bird v. J. L. Prescott Co., </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>591 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1916). But, as Dean Ashley said (3 <em>Colum. L. Rev., </em>at <em>p. </em>72) \u201cIf, then, we are to find the equivalent of mutual assent in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>action of the parties, although contrary to the intent of one of them, this action must be of such a character as not only to justify the party relying thereon, in the reasonable belief that they indicate assent on the part of the actor, but the situation must involve a further element, namely, that the actor himself ought, as a reasonable man, to know that his actions or words will fairly indicate assent on his part.\u201d And, as Williston said in <em>section </em>21, supra, at <em>p. </em>44:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201c* * * even though one requests certain action or services by another, no contract is created if the latter should reasonably understand from the circumstances that the party making the request has no intention to contract and is justified in assuming that no legally enforceable obligations are involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">And, if the words were words of contract, whether they were too indefinite to create a legally enforceable lifetime contract depends also on the same factors, namely, the meaning of the words when construed in the light of the relationship of the parties and of all of the antecedent and surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">What, then, were those circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Michael had been in the business of selling Esslinger\u2019s beer (and, prior to repeal, near beer), and other beverages including non-alcoholic drinks which he bottled himself, in the \u201cGloucester-Camden area and part of Burlington County\u201d since 1927. There is no evidence that he had any contract, written or oral, with Esslinger\u2019s prior to the alleged conversation with Brown in 1949. In the counterclaim it was asserted that in 1933 Esslinger\u2019s had \u201crepresented\u201d to Michael \u201cit would make him its distributor of Esslinger\u2019s beer in Camden and Gloucester counties,\u201d but no such claim was made in the pretrial order or at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Stanley testified that in 1948 Esslinger\u2019s had stopped selling its beer to a distributor named Eornataro because the latter was \u201cpushing\u201d a competitor\u2019s beer. When he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and his father heard of it, they went to Brown and asked \u201cif we can possibly take care of his accounts because we\" are servicing the area now * * Pornataro had had 16 or 17 Esslinger\u2019s \u201caccounts.\u201d Stanley testified that Brown had answered \u201cWell, go ahead and take care of them, because the only thing I am interested in is seeing that they are served,\u201d and that \u201cwe said, Thank you.\u2019 We left and went to work.\u201d His testimony continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">\u201cQ. The accounts of Fornataro, generally speaking, were located where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">A. They were located in the Camden area, and the upper part of Gloucester County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">Q. All right. Now, what was the next thing that happened with regard to these accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">A. About six months later, J. R. called us and he said he would like to see us in the brewery. So we went to the brewery, my father and I, and he said, T want you to discontinue selling these accounts that you took from Ed Fornataro.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">I said, \u2018We just were in here six months ago, and you said it would be all right.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">He said, T just want you right up in the Camden area here, and the trouble will be more or less straightened out a bit. I just want to take them away from you and give them to South Jersey, and you can concentrate more in the middle part of Camden County, and the lower part.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">We argued with him, and he said that is what he wants to do and that is what he is going to do. So we had no alternative but to agree to it, and we left.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">In March 1949 Michael and Stanley heard that Esslinger\u2019s had stopped selling its beer to Laurel Beverage Company, another distributor, which had 29 accounts. It was then that they went to Philadelphia, solicited Laurel\u2019s business, and had the alleged conversation on which the counterclaim rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">We pause here to point out that the counter claimant does not deny (a) Esslinger\u2019s right, if that right was not affected by the alleged 1949 conversation, to allocate territory and customers, and (b) that Stanley and his father came uninvited to Philadelphia to ask Esslinger\u2019s to give them the Pornataro and Laurel Beverage customers. Brown did not on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>either occasion solicit them to take the customers, or even invite them to come to Philadelphia to talk about Eornataro or Laurel. In short, it was not to accommodate Esslinger\u2019s that they took over these accounts. Michael and Stanley wanted to add these customers to their existing business, obviously because they deemed it would fit in with their operation and be profitable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">If Michael and Stanley are correct in their contentions, the alleged conversation with Brown in 1949 gave each of them a lifetime non-cancellable distributorship, not limited to the Laurel Beverage accounts they took over but extending to all of the customers they had accumulated since 1927 in Gloucester, Camden and Burlington counties; and no part of those customers could be taken from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Let us analyze the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Stanley admits that he asked Brown only for <em>\u201cany kind </em>of an agreement in writing that you won\u2019t take <em>these </em>[the Laurel Beverage] accounts away from us later on.\u201d (Emphasis added) This was a request for far less than the lifetime all inclusive contract now claimed, yet Brown flatly and brusquely refused, saying \u201cI am not going to give you no written agreement.\u201d When Stanley persisted in arguing for a written contract, Brown said none would be given because \u201cit\u2019s against the policy of the company.\u201d Did that mean it was against the policy to give a written contract, or to give any contract? It seems to us that the reasonable interpretation is the latter, for, as we have said, Michael and Stanley never had a contract although they had distributed Esslinger\u2019s beer since 1927; and there is no evidence that any other distributor had obtained one, through Brown or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">When Brown refused to enter even the limited written agreement, did it not indicate to Michael and Stanley that he intended not to bind Esslinger\u2019s legally at all? Michael and Stanley could not reasonably have believed that Brown, after refusing the little that they asked be given them in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>writing, then orally bound the company to the all-inclusive lifetime contract now claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">When it is asserted that a lifetime contract was made, the law requires proof clear enough to overcome the fact that men rarely enter into lifetime contracts; and when, as here, the contract is between businessmen, is as all-inclusive as claimed, and binds Esslinger\u2019s for the period of Michael\u2019s and Stanley\u2019s lives but is terminable by them at will, the proof must be clear indeed. <em>Cf. Savarese v. Pyrene Mfg Co., supra. </em>As Williston said of distributor ship contracts (4 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1027A, <em>p. </em>2858, <em>(Rev. ed. </em>1936)) \u201cThe business purpose served is one best adapted to the bilateral rather than to the unilateral type of contract since it presupposes extensive and long-continued future performance on both sides; the bargain is usually embodied in an elaborate, printed document signed by both parties * * In <em>Krueger v. Schoenling Brewing Co., </em>82 <em>Ohio App. </em>57, 79 <em>N. E. 2d </em>366, 368 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1948), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cThe terms of the agreement could not have been understood by either party as constituting a life time obligation on the company * * * \u2018where a contract is equally subject to several interpretations, one of which presupposes rational action upon the part of all parties thereto and the other irrational action upon the part of one of the parties thereto, courts in seeking to determine the intention of the parties will assume that the parties entering into the contract were each exercising reason, and give to the contract such reasonable construction as it will bear.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Although the <em>Savarese </em>case, <em>supra, </em>involved an employment contract, the rationale of that opinion is pertinent here. The Supreme Court said (9 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pp. </em>601, 603) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201cDeeming them to be at variance with general usage and sound policy, the court\u2019s have shown a marked reluctance to enforce contracts for life employment. In large part this stems from the realization that such contracts frequently are, in practical effect, unilateral undertakings by the employer to provide a job for so long as the employee wishes to continue in it but impose no corresponding obligation upon the latter. In this respect, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of performance is unequal as the employer is bound to the terms of the contract whereas the employee is free to terminate it at will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">Agreements of this nature have not been upheld exeejit where it most convincingly appears it was the intent of the parties to enter into such long-range commitments and they must be clearly, specifically and definitely expressed. Only then is it grudgingly conceded that not all such contracts are \u2018so vague and indefinite as to time as to be void and unenforceable because of uncertainty or indefiniteness.\u2019 56 <em>C. J. S., Master and Servant, </em>\u00a7 6, <em>p. </em>70; I <em>Williston on Contracts, Sec. </em>39, <em>p. </em>110; 135 <em>A. L. R. </em>646, <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">Because of the unusual nature of the agreement, the length and permanence of the obligation undertaken, the various unforeseeable events and conditions which may be encountered in such a journey <em>in futuro </em>and the unpredictable effects upon the parties, special precautions have been decreed essential both as to considerations and the terms of employment in construing and enforcing the compact. The responsibilities assumed and the obligations imposed will be neither created nor spelled out by mere inference when they are not clearly and unequivocally expressed in the contract itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">It is to be noted that nowhere in the conversation was lifetime mentioned, or any other expression of duration. The claim of a lifetime contract is drawn as a deduction from Brown\u2019s alleged assurance \u201cI promise yon I will never cut yon off * * * do a good job * * * yon both have nothing to worry abont.\u201d This alleged conversation took place eleven 3rears before Stanley testified, and it is significant that no action was started on the alleged contract until Esslinger\u2019s sued Michael on the book account. Even then the alleged lifetime contract was not mentioned in the original lengthy counterclaim. It was first mentioned in the amended counterclaim, filed more than a year after the alleged wrongful termination. However, laying this aside as merety going to the weight of the evidence, in context the words <em>\u201cI </em>promise you <em>I </em>will never cut you off\u201d (emphasis added) are not indicative of an offer to bind Esslinger\u2019s to legal liability for the promisees\u2019 lives, but rather words of Brown\u2019s friendly assurances and good intentions toward Michael and Stanley.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number> In any event, in the absence of express words of duration for life or for a fixed period the law presumes (absent evidence in the language or the surrounding circumstances leading to a different result) that a contract such as this is terminable at will or within a reasonable time. <em>Bushwick v. Decatur Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>116 <em>F. </em>2d 675 (2 <em>Cir., </em>1940); <em>Dover Copper Mining Co. v. Doenges, </em>40 <em>Ariz. </em>349, 12 <em>P. 2d </em>288, 292 <em>(Sup.

Williston said (1 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 38, <em>p. </em>113 (3d <em>ed. </em>1957)) : \u201cIt is not often that a promise will properly be interpreted as calling for perpetual performance.\u201d The counterclaim was not presented on the theory that Brown\u2019s words constituted a contract not to terminate the distributorship until after a reasonable time had elapsed, or that the notice of termination was too abrupt <em>(Cf. </em>4 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1027A, <em>pp. </em>2857\u20142864 <em>(Rev. ed. </em>1936)) but on the sole basis that it was a non-cancellable lifetime contract. Applying the foregoing principles, we find that the evidence here was not sufficient to establish such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Finally, we find that even, in respects other than time the contract alleged was too indefinite to be enforceable. Obviously, territory is an important factor in the beer business. The parties demonstrated that in their dealings prior to 1949 and since. The counterclaimant asserted that he was doing business in parts of three counties. It was to be expected that the counties would grow. Was Esslinger\u2019s to lose all rights to reshuffle its dealers in the three counties during the lives of Michael and Stanley? Or was Esslinger\u2019s permitted to switch geographical territory but forbidden to take away customers from the counterclaimant in those areas ? In that case, which customers ? Only those who bought from Alachnowicz in 1949 (including Laurel\u2019s accounts) or those who became customers later as well? It would seem inefficient and impractical to have more than one dealer serve Esslinger\u2019s customers in a given, geographical area, unless it were heavily populated. Or, does a distributor\u2019s doing \u201ca good job\u201d include cooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u25a0with Esslinger\u2019s and its other distributors in. arranging the redistribution of territory and customers?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">There is nothing in the alleged contract as to the effort to be expended by Michael and Stanley in holding on to old customers and in obtaining new ones in this highly competitive business; as to the minimum amount of business that Alaehnowicz must do; how many men and how much equipment they should have for servicing beer customers; how much of Alaehnowicz\u2019s operation could be devoted to the soft drink and other non-Esslinger\u2019s parts of the business, etc. In short, as Williston said, <em>supra, </em>none of the details of the \u201cextensive and long-continued future performance on both sides\u201d is spelled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Eor the foregoing reasons, we hold that Esslinger\u2019s motion for judgment at the end of the entire case should have been granted. It is therefore unnecessary to demonstrate why we deem the evidence was insufficient to prove Brown\u2019s authority to bind Esslinger\u2019s to the lifetime contract asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The judgment is reversed, and judgment is entered in favor of Esslinger\u2019s on the counterclaim. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
