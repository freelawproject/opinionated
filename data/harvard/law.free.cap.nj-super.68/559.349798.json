J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-E\">Appellant property owners seek the reversal of judgments entered in the Superior Court, Law Division, in condemnation actions instituted by the Port of New York Authority. The Authority elected, pursuant to the option accorded to it by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>32:1-132, to proceed under the Airport Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>32 \u00a11-35.15. The challenged judgments were entered after an extensive trial without a jury. By order of this court the appeals from the respective judgments were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">Two properties, both located in the Borough of Port Lee, were the subject of the condemnation proceedings here under review\u2014one known as the Howell property, the other as the property of M and D Bealty Co., Inc. The properties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>with, many others, were the subject of acquisition by the Port of New York Authority for the construction of approaches to George Washington Bridge in connection with the addition of a second deck to that structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The Howell property had a frontage of 180 feet on South Marginal Eoad (facing an area known as Bridge Plaza, west of the approach to the George Washington Bridge) and 50 feet on an arc on Center Avenue. The property had an average depth of 53 feet and contained 9,800 square feet. At the time of the taking, September 5, 1958, a two and one-half story dwelling house and garage were located on the lot. The trial court entered judgment for the \u201ctaking\u201d of the Howell property in the sum of $39,134. <em>Port of N. Y. Authority v. </em>Howell, 59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>343, 352 <em>(Law Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The property of M and D Eealty Co., Inc. was located on the southeast corner of South Marginal Eoad and Lemoine Avenue. It contained 7,215 square feet. With the exception of a small shanty the land at the time of the \u201ctaking,\u201d October 17, 1958, was vacant. It was operated as a used car lot. Judgment in the condemnation action was awarded by the trial court in favor of the property owneT in the sum of $54,990.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The propriety of the aforesaid judgments is challenged on several grounds, some of which apply to both appeals. Where the subject matter discussed is applicable to one property and not to the other we shall so indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Initially appellants attack <em>N. J. S. A. </em>32:1-132 on constitutional grounds. The precise challenge here made was rejected in <em>In Port of N. Y. Authority v. Heming and </em>Cervieri, 34 <em>N. J. </em>144 (1961), appeal dismissed, <em>Cervieri, et al. v. Port of New York </em>Authority, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1676 (1961), decided since the appeals in the instant cases were taken. That decision is controlling in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Appellants next assert that the trial court erroneously compelled them to produce their proofs first instead of requiring the Port Authority to do so. Appellants state in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>their brief that they feel \u201cconstrained to raise this point although our courts have stated that this determination is a matter of discretion of the trial court * * *. <em>Ring-wood Co. v. North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>165 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1928).\u201d Appellants urge that the <em>Ringwood </em>decision is inequitable and that there is \u201cno cogent reason why the old rule * * * should continue to be followed.\u201d We perceive no reason why it should not be followed. The trial court in the case at bar adhered to the practice which has existed in this State for many years. Appellants advance the further contention that in a <em>non-jury </em>condemnation case (emphasis supplied), such as the one at bar, the \u201ccondemning authority should be compelled * * * to proceed first.\u201d No persuasive reason is advanced why any different rule should prevail in a non-jury case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Appellants next contend that in the presentation of appellant Howell\u2019s case the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to admit proffered evidence of a month to month rental of $500 paid to the Port Authority as lessor of the aforesaid M and D Eealty Co., Inc. property, following the Authority\u2019s acquisition of it. The suggested relevancy of the proposed proof was that the M and D property was a tract comparable with Howell and that implicit in the rental arrangement was an expression of the Authority\u2019s own view of the valuation of the M and D property, thus making the suggested proof evidential in the Howell case. However, it was in evidence that the tenant had paid rent of $500 per month prior to the acquisition as well. With the same general approach appellants sought, unsuccessfully, through the medium of testimony of their real estate expert, to introduce evidence of a sale on January 15, 1959 of allegedly comparable property. Hnder the particular facts of the instant case we determine that the court\u2019s ruling was within its \u201cwide discretion,\u201d <em>(In re Port of New York Authority, </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>575, 581 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); <em>State, by State Highway Com\u2019r v. Williams, </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>518, 528 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961)), and that no abuse of that discretion is revealed by the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Appellants next urge that, \"in weighing the lack of commercial development in the area, the trial court should have considered the fact that the owners therein were unwilling to sell their land.\u201d This argument is projected against the conceded fact that the area properties are located in the C-3 zone by the prevailing ordinance of the borough. As set forth in its opinion in the instant case, <em>Port of N. Y. Authority v. Howell, supra, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>350, the permissible uses under the ordinance provisions as of September 5, 1958 were substantially commercial in nature and included a wide variety of business and professional establishments. Dwellings, except \"apartment buildings of six stories or less in height,\u201d were excluded. The use of the Howell property on which the forty-year-old dwelling was erected was therefore non-conforming.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellants\u2019 offer of proof envisioned testimony by a real estate broker for appellants that he had been \u201cgiven an assignment in 1952 to acquire Bridge Plaza property\u201d but had been unsuccessful in that endeavor. Appellants\u2019 counsel offered to develop individual instances of such unsuccessful efforts, which he said would demonstrate that respective owners desired to retain the properties as residences and that would explain the alleged inactivity in the real estate market in the area between 1955 and 1958. Based on that theory appellants urged that the area properties were unique and that the trial court should have \u201clooked beyond the usual guides when items are not offered on the market,\u201d should have considered the reasons therefor, determined that \"the value was there\u201d and that appellants \u201cshould be entitled to it, regardless of the use to which the land was devoted at the time of taking.\u201d However, the trial judge did take \u201cinto account that the property is presently zoned for limited business and commercial uses * * <em>Port of N. Y. Authority v. Howell, supra, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>352.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>In support of their aforesaid offer of proof appellants cite the case of State, <em>by State Highway Com\u2019r v. </em>Burnett, 24 <em>N. J. </em>280 (1957). The trial court held that the principles enunciated in <em>Burnett </em>furnished no support for appellants\u2019 instant argument. We are of the same opinion. In <em>Burnett </em>the property involved was unique in character, customary methods of determining its market value were unavailing and therefore \u201cthe trial judge did not abuse his discretion\u201d in adopting another formula for valuation involving reproduction cost less depreciation. <em>(Burnett, </em>at <em>p. </em>293.) The trial court held that the Howell property was not unique and no reason existed for departing from the normal methods of testing its market value. The record furnishes adequate support for the court\u2019s holding. Appellants cite <em>City of Trenton v. Lenzner, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>465 (1954) as authority for the proposition (as stated in their brief) that the \u201cvery essence of fair market value is the price agreed upon between a willing seller and a willing buyer.\u201d Erom that premise they apparently conclude that, as the owners of property in the area refused to sell because (as counsel urged at trial and as their brief reiterates) \u201cthey chose to stay there and pass their benefits on to their children,\u201d some other and different method of valuation should be determined. The <em>Lenzner </em>opinion affords no support for the contention that the actual owner\u2019s desire not to sell can be a factor in determining market value. In the opinion the court (at <em>p. </em>479) said: \u201cIts fair market value, measured by the price which would voluntarily be agreed upon between the hypothetical owner willing to sell and the hypothetical buyer willing to buy, would be fixed after the due weighing of a.ll the factors which customarily enter into their purchase and sale negotiations.\u201d In short the state of mind of the actual owner of the land is neither controlling nor of aid in determining what a hypothetical buyer and seller respectively would pay and receive. The court properly rejected the offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Appellants\u2019 next attack on the judgments is based on tbe trial court\u2019s refusal to permit tbeir real estate and land appraisal expert to testify concerning a \u201chypothetical office building\u201d which conceivably could be erected on the Howell property. The proposed testimony involved an analysis of the cost of such a building, the gross rental which might be received therefrom and the estimated cost of operation as a basis for estimating an annual net income, which would then be capitalized to give the approximate value of the combined product of building and land, to be followed by a determination by the expert as to the portion of such value to be allocated to the land in question. The proposal was rejected by the trial judge and rightly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The trial court characterized the suggested testimony and the conclusion to be derived therefrom as pure \u201cconjecture.\u201d A brief outline of the proposed proofs, as presented by appellants\u2019 counsel, demonstrates the correctness of the trial court\u2019s assessment of such testimony. The expert stated that, in considering the value of the property, he felt that the \u201chighest and best use was for commercial purposes,\u201d specifically \u201ca four-story office and basement building.\u201d He added: \u201cI proceeded to put a hypothetical office building on there bringing in the rents in that area.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel then recited his specific offer of proof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cI would like to submit my offer of proof * * * on tbe capitalization basis of what income a two-story or a four-story office and basement building would realize on this property, setting forth fully all of the parts therein which this witness ascertained from investigation would result in a valuation on a capitalization basis of $95,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">During the course of the ensuing interrogation of the witness and colloquy with appellants\u2019 counsel the court indicated that such proofs would have to show what \u201ctype of construction\u201d would be selected; what \u201cimprovements\u201d would be installed; whether the building was to be \u201cair-conditioned\u201d ; what kind of heating medium would be used; whether there would be a demand for the available rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>areas and whether there would be full or partial occupancy. All of these items appellants\u2019 counsel stated he \u201cwould intend to prove * * * insofar as it is obtained by this witness\u2019 participation in actual negotiations with the builder as to these costs.\u201d The court commented that if it honored appellants\u2019 offer it would be \u201ctrying an issue of what kind of building it is going to be and how much the building is going to cost\u201d and \u201close <em>* </em>* * sight of the fact that the question is what is just compensation\u201d for the taking of the property involved. We are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Thereupon appellants\u2019 counsel, through the medium of testimony of a mechanical engineer, attempted to introduce proof of the cost of an existing Port Lee office building (identified by a photograph thereof, and its construction detailed in plans and specifications also presented) accompanied by proof that the building would be suitable for the Howell location. Appellants\u2019 counsel states that the testimony was projected on the theory that a purchaser would contemplate the availability of the property for the erection of such a structure and that the real estate expert in \u201cfixing the value of this property * * * considered as one of the factors the return on the land if an office building were erected thereon.\u201d The offer of proof, encompassing cost items for a four-story building, as well as a two-story building, was to be followed by recalling the real estate expert who, based on the figures presented by the engineer, would then \u201carrive with respect to a two-story office building and basement at a capitalization of $95,000 for the land only, and with respect to the four-story office building, $126,600.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Appellants\u2019 counsel, insisting that the trial court\u2019s ruling was prejudicially erroneous, urges in his brief that it is \u201ccommon knowledge that real estate purchasers and investors determine land values by using what is commonly known as the Land Eesidual Process.\u201d Counsel stressed before the trial court, and reiterates before us, that he was not offering the evidence \u201cas proof of the intrinsic value itself\u201d but as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cproof of one of the factors\u201d which the real estate appraiser \u201chad a right to take into consideration as an expert in arriving at his value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s rejection of the proffered testimony is contrary to the rule expressed in <em>State, by State Highway Com\u2019r v. Burnett, </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>280 (1957) where the court at <em>p. </em>291, referring to <em>Ranck v. City of Cedar Rapids, </em>134 <em>Iowa </em>563, 111 <em>N. W. </em>1027, 1028 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1907) stated that the Iowa Supreme Court, dealing with \u201cthe reception of evidence according separate values to land and improvements, noted that The true rule seems to be to permit the proof of all the varied elements of value; that is, all the facts which the owner would properly and naturally press upon the attention of a buyer to whom he is negotiating a sale and all other facts which would naturally influence a person of ordinary prudence desiring to purchase.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The propriety in an appropriate case of receiving evidence according \u201cseparate values to land and improvements\u201d and in certain circumstances to find no \u201cabuse of discretion in admitting evidence of reproduction costs of the improvements which reflected physical depreciation, as well as the expert opinion assigning a value to the property as vacant land\u201d <em>(State, by State Highway Com\u2019r v. Burnett, supra, </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>280, at <em>p. </em>293), has nothing whatever to do with the admissibility of the evidence sought to be presented in the instant case involving the construction of a \u201chypothetical office building\u201d on the Howell tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Appellants suggest in their brief that our opinion in <em>State, by State Highway Com\u2019r v. Hudson Circle Service Center, Inc., </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>125 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), supports their position as recognizing \u201cthe probative value of capitalization.\u201d Not so. We were there considering the value of an existing lease with reference to an existing improvement on the property. The decision had nothing to do with the proposition advanced by appellants in the instant case involving the application of a hypothetical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>capitalization rate to an estimated income flowing from the operation of an office building which theoretically might be erected on the land. The trial court\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 proposed proofs based on a calculation of profits and costs arising from such a theoretical undertaking was fully justified. <em>In re Morris &amp; Cummings Dredging Co., </em>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>248, 251-252 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1921). See also: <em>In re Housing Authority of City of Newark, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>60, 65 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941); <em>Ringwood Co. v. North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, supra, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>165, 169 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1928); <em>Manda v. City of Orange, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>686, 689 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellants next contend that the trial court erroneously prohibited defendant \u201cfrom showing through plaintifPs own witness, the reasonable probability of an assemblage of the Howell land and that of a neighbor.\u201d Reference to the record shows that the specific questions barred were whether in the opinion of the witness there was \u201cany reason from a real estate viewpoint why Howell and his next door neighbor, Lyons, could not assemble and join together their two pieces.\u201d Again of the same witness: \u201cAs of September 5, 1958 * * * from a real estate viewpoint, did not Howell\u2019s and Lyons\u2019 property have a reasonable anticipation of an assemblage value?\u201d And finally of the same witness: \u201cAs a real estate expert, do you consider the fact that if there is a reasonable probability of an assemblage, that relates to one or two parcels to be assembled?\u201d The questions were presented with reference to the Howell property. The trial court sustained objections thereto, observing that there was no proof of any such planned combination. Appellants\u2019 counsel cites <em>N. J. Turnpike Authority v. Bowley, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>549, 555, <em>certiorari </em>denied 358 <em>U. S. </em>927, 79 <em>S. Ct. </em>312, 3 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>301 (1958). We note, however, that the aforesaid questions were addressed on cross-examination to plaintiff\u2019s expert and that the property owner had presented no testimony tending to prove reasonable probability of assemblage.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Purther claim of prejudicial error is asserted- by appellants to flow from the court\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 offer of proof relating to the financial restraint imposed on the Borough of Port Lee. Appellants\u2019 brief states that the offer of proof in substance was to the effect that \u201cthe Borough of Port Lee for a period of years was under a financial restraint affecting all its property by reason of its filing a petition in the Pederal Court as a result of which a Board of Liquidation controlled some of its properties\u201d and that such situation had a deterrent effect on real estate sales in the borough. Appellants admitted that the financial restraint had been removed some time before the taking but sought the introduction of the evidence as allegedly explanatory of the prior realty market. The trial court, in rejecting the offer, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cPort Lee was under this restraint, so to speak, and then I suppose a willing buyer wouldn\u2019t pay as much as if it wasn\u2019t under a restraint, but, regardless, if they did come to an accord regardless of the restraint, wouldn\u2019t that represent the market value of the property?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The court was correct. The issue was the determination of just compensation for the acquisition of the subject properties. The trial court properly observed that such proposed evidence would introduce collateral issues into the case. Compare State <em>by State Highway Com\u2019r v. </em>Gorga, 54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>520, 527-528 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Appellants next emphasize that they had presented testimony of two real estate brokers who stated that they had received inquiries as to the possibility of purchasing property for \u201ccommercial usage\u201d in the Bridge Plaza area and that the trial court\u2019s opinion indicates that it had failed to \u201cconsider\u201d such proof of purchaser \u201cdemand\u201d for such use. (One of the brokers had testified that he \u201ctried to get space\u201d for such prospects but \u201cwe couldn\u2019t find any or nobody would sell.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Examination of the trial court\u2019s opinion does not support appellants\u2019 criticism. The trial court specifically noted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>fact that the zoning provisions applicable to the area were generally commercial in character and gave that factor due weight despite the fact that there had been no actual commercial development in the vicinity of the property under scrutiny. <em>Port of N. Y. Authority v. Howell, supra, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pp. </em>350\u2014351. However, mere inquiries (the testimony of the brokers reveals no actual offers) by prospective commercial investors who had as was testified ultimately selected locations in other municipalities, actuated in such selections by unidentified motives and for unspecified reasons, were not proof of actual market demand in the Bridge Plaza area. During the presentation of the testimony by one of the aforesaid real estate brokers the following appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the best I can get out of it is that these people of vhom Mr. Ettorc speaks would like to locate in the Bridge Plaza if they could find suitable property and if they could find a willing seller who would agree with them on the price of the property, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Nothing was built along there at all, was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">The Witness: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Moreover it is evident from the testimony, which as aforesaid appellants assert the court did not \u201cconsider,\u201d that it related to inquiries for available land of a size far in excess of the Howell property and, as above noted, there was no substantive proof of the reasonable probability of assemblage. Appellants are unjustified in their aforesaid criticism of the trial court\u2019s opinion in dealing with this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Specifically with reference to the appeal by M and D Bealty Co., Inc., it is contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error in excluding a partially completed deposition of one J oseph L. Busch, a real estate broker and appraiser appearing for appellant. That witness was so critically ill that the appellant, far in advance of the trial of the case, recognized that he could not attend court and arranged to take his deposition. The Authority consented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The witness\u2019 direct examination by the counsel for various property owners, including the Realty Company, took place on February 27, 1959, pursuant to an order of the court dated February 6, 1959, but the witness\u2019 physical condition became so grave during the course of the examination on that day that it was recognized by counsel for both parties that it was impossible for the witness to continue. His death occurred April 11, 1959 without any further testimonial examination. The trial of the ease commenced on December 2, 1959, at which time counsel for M and D Realty Co., Inc. offered the aforesaid deposition of Mr. Rusch to the extent it had been taken and in so far as it related to its property. Counsel for the Authority objected because the deposition was incomplete and he had not had the opportunity of cross-examination of the witness. The court excluded the deposition. Such ruling, as stated above, appellant company contends was erroneous. Appellant urges that the circumstances surrounding the taking of the examination, arrangements between counsel at its termination and the subsequent inaction of the Authority\u2019s attorney as to the resumption of the interrogation were sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the Authority had waived its \u201cright of cross-examination\u201d of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Reference to the record reveals that during the course of the taking of the deposition of Mr. Rusch (both counsel then recognizing his grave physical condition) certain written appraisals he had made, including that of appellant\u2019s property, as well as written statements with reference to allegedly comparable properties, were offered by appellant. They were received in evidence with the understanding that they accurately reflected the witness\u2019 opinion as if he had testified to their contents, and with the further understanding that they were \u201csubject to any objections\u201d Authority counsel might have and subject to that counsel\u2019s \u201cright of cross-examination.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel then specifically stated: \u201cSubject to cross-examination as we will agree * * * at the time and place that we will agree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>It is clear from the colloquy at trial between counsel and the court, at the time the deposition was offered in evidence, that both counsel on Eebruarjr 27, 1959 had recognized as above stated that Mr. Rusch was then too ill to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">When the abbreviated deposition was offered \u201cin evidence\u201d by appellant and its receipt as an exhibit resisted by respondent\u2019s counsel, the record reveals that the recollections of respective counsel as to the oral arrangements made at Mr. Rusch\u2019s home with reference to the cross-examination were at variance. Respondent\u2019s counsel insisted that he had not waived his right of cross-examination; that he merely postponed it \u201cout of regard for the witness\u2019 extreme disability\u201d and that, as he asserts in his brief, such examination was to be undertaken at a time \u201cto be agreed upon <em>mutually.\u201d </em>At trial he relied upon the aforesaid record. The recollection of appellant\u2019s counsel on the contrary was that it was orally arranged immediately after the taking of the deposition that respondent\u2019s counsel would advise appellant\u2019s counsel if he wanted to cross-examine. The latter\u2019s brief further states that the examination was \u201cexpressly * * * waived\u201d by respondent\u2019s counsel and \u201cif he did not waive\u201d it \u201che did not pursue his right\u201d to it. Neither counsel communicated with the other on the subject until after Mr. Rusch\u2019s death. Under the circumstances we find no justification for holding that the trial court committed prejudicial error in determining that the opportunity for cross-examination had originally been preserved, had subsequently been lost through no fault of respondent, and that as a consequence the deposition should be excluded. <em>Henderson v. Twin Falls </em>County, 59 <em>Idaho </em>97, 80 <em>P. 2d </em>801, 802 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Appellant, M and D Realty Co., Inc., next seeks to set aside the award of $54,990 as against the weight of the evidence. Apart from all collateral contentions, it is evident the basic fact to be stressed is that the trial judge resolved the issue of the amount to be awarded by assessing the sharply conflicting expert testimony, aided by his view of the premises. <em>State Highway Comm. v. </em>Lincoln, <em>&amp;c., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Corp., </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>190 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933). His ult\u00edmate determination finds support in the record. We refuse to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Einally, appellant M and D Realty Co., Inc. contends that error was committed because the trial court in its opinion in the Realty Company case incorporated by reference certain Cibasic principles of law set forth fully\u201d in the <em>Howell </em>opinion, among them one relating to consequential losses, specifically one relating to the exclusion of evidence of loss of good will in evaluating the property under condemnation. <em>Port of N. Y. Authority v. Howell, supra, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pp. </em>348-349. The complete answer to this contention is that in the M and D case no evidence referable to good will, or the value thereof, if any existed, was offered or any claimed loss thereof asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We have examined other points raised by appellants and find no merit in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judgments in both cases are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
