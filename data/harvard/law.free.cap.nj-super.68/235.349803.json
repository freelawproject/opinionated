A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aml\">This declaratory judgment proceeding was commenced by the plaintiff insurer, Merchants Indemnity Corp. (hereinafter \u201cMerchants\u201d), seeking a determination that it was not obligated to undertake the defense of a separate action against defendants Jean Eggleston and Jacob E. Tussel, Jr. and that it was entitled to rescind an automobile liability policy issued to defendants Jean and Edward L. Eggleston on the ground of fraudulent misrepresentation as to ownership of the subject vehicle. Merchants brings this appeal from a Chancery Division judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The policy in question\u2014a standard \u201cFamily Automobile Policy\u201d\u2014was first issued to the defendant Edward L. Eggleston on October 30, 1957, covering a 1954 Chrysler which he then owned. The instrument contains the usual omnibus clause, defining as \u201cpersons insured,\u201d with respect to the described vehicle owned by the named insured, \u201cthe named insured and any resident of the same household,\u201d and \u201cany other person using such automobile, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured.\u201d On February 4, 1958 the policy was endorsed to extend its coverage to a 1955 Lincoln and to include specifically, as \u201ca named insured,\u201d Edward\u2019s wife, defendant Jean Eggleston. At the instance of Edward Eggleston, the policy was again endorsed, on April 9, 1958, to eliminate coverage of the Lincoln and to cover instead a 1957 Ford Thunderbird. Except for a slight increase in the stated premium, the terms of the policy were not otherwise expressly altered by the substitution of the Ford for the Lincoln vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>On May 12, 1958 defendant Jacob E. Tussel, Jr., brother of Jean Eggleston, and then about 19^ years of age, was involved in a collision while driving the Thunderbird in Scotch Plains, F. J. Herbert Arthur Krebs, a passenger in the Thunderbird, was killed in this accident. Krebs\u2019 administratrix instituted a wrongful death action against Tussel and Jean Eggleston on October 14, 1958. The defendants turned the litigation papers over to Merchants, which continued a previously commenced investigation of the accident, and also engaged counsel to undertake the defense of the insureds. On January 5, 1959, the complaint in the instant action was filed; process was not effectuated on defendants until Eebruary 25, 1959. Merchants has continued, nonetheless, to conduct the defense of Tussel and his sister in the primary death action, trial of which, we are informed, is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The issues herein are whether the insureds falsely represented ownership of the vehicle and, if so, whether such a misrepresentation was material and entitled Merchants to disclaim liability on the policy; and, if it is determined that Merchants had a right to void the policy, whether that right was waived by the insurer\u2019s conduct in undertaking to defend Tussel and Jean Eggleston subsequent to acquiring knowlledge of the misstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The testimony concerning the purchase of the Thunderbird and the consequent execution of the policy endorsement is somewhat in conflict, but may be summarized essentially as follows. Jacob E. Tussel, Jr., his parents, and the Egglestons all lived on a single tract of land in Clark Township, F. J., though not in one household. Jacob and his mother and father resided in the main house, while his sister and Edward lived in an adjoining trailer. Jacob worked for his father in the contracting business; Jean was employed as an office nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">At the time the Egglestons acquired the 1955 Lincoln, they instructed their insurer to prepare the aforementioned endorsement and also informed him that Tussel would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>an occasional user of the vehicle. On or about March 29, 1958, Jacob, his sister and brother-in-law visited a used car lot and placed a deposit on the 1957 Thunderbird. About a week later, the three returned to the lot and Jacob paid the balance of the $2,700 purchase price. The parties concede that Edward and Jean Eggleston did not furnish any of the consideration for the vehicle. The money was paid entirely by Jacob, and represented, to the extent of $700, his own funds, the remainder having been furnished him by his parents. While the receipts for the payments were issued in Jacob\u2019s name, the title certificate to the automobile was placed in the name of Jean Eggleston. The Egglestons paid the registration fee and, later, the insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Within a day or two after the purchase, Edward L. Eggleston telephoned his insurance agent, Henry S. Gilbert, for the purpose of substituting the Thunderbird for the Lincoln on the policy. According to Eggleston, he informed Gilbert \u201cthat Jacob was interested in a Thunderbird and that we would like to have this car covered by insurance, that Jacob would drive it, and that my wife would use this car instead of the 1955 Lincoln for work.\u201d Eggleston admitted under oath that he did not specifically toll Gilbert that Jacob was the \u201cowner\u201d of the car. Gilbert, who was the vice-president of the Braunsdorf Associates Insurance Agency, an authorized agent of Merchants, testified that he was told by Eggleston that the Thunderbird \u201cwas owned, as was the Lincoln, by Mrs. Eggleston\u201d; and upon inquiring as to its use by Tussel, he was told it was \u201cthe same as for the Lincoln.\u201d Gilbert categorically denied having been told that Jacob was interested in purchasing the Thunderbird or that he had put up the money for the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Following the collision of May 12, 1958, further endorsements were issued by plaintiff on the Egglestons\u2019 policy, one of which had the effect of expressly excluding Tussel from its coverage, as of May 33, 1958, and the other of removing the Thunderbird from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Almost immediately after the occurrence of the accident, one of Merchants\u2019 investigators elicited a statement from Tussel, in which he described the accident and stated that he drove \u201ca 1957 Pord Thunderbird owned by my sister and brother-in-law Jean Eggleston\u201d; he added, \u201cI was driving this ear with my sister\u2019s permission.\u201d About two weeks later, a statement was taken from Jean Eggleston, in which she said: \u201cI have a 1957 Pord Thunderbird registered in my name that is actually owned and was purchased by my brother, Jacob Tussel.\u201d The statement further recites that one of the reasons for registering the vehicle in Jean\u2019s name was that she was to drive it back and forth to work and that Jacob would operate it only when she was not using it. The other reason was \u201cto get the insurance as cheap as possible.\u201d She concluded that \u201cthere was no question that he owned the car but we registered it in my name legally for the above stated reasons * *</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On September 19, 1958, approximately a month before the institution of the death action, plaintiff\u2019s investigator obtained additional statements, one from Tussel, and one from the Egglestons. Tussel, while referring to his sister as the \u201cowner\u201d of the Thunderbird, freely admits in his statement that the car was purchased by him. He adds: \u201cI purchased this car in my sister Jean\u2019s name because of my age and some other personal reasons.\u201d The Egglestons\u2019 statement likewise refers to the vehicle as \u201cowned\u201d by Jean, \u201cpurchased\u201d by Jacob, and placed in Jean\u2019s name because of Jacob\u2019s age and for other personal reasons. The testimony of the defendants was uncontradicted to the effect that Jean Eggleston did in fact use the Thunderbird to drive to and from her daily employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The trial judge determined that the Egglestons had misrepresented to or concealed from Merchants\u2019 agent the true interest of Tussel in the Thunderbird, and that such misstatement or omission was material and, even though perhaps innocently made, would support rescission of the insurance contract. However, the judge concluded that Merchants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>unconditional direction of the defense of its insureds in the death action after having obtained knowledge of the misstatement, with no attempt to reserve its rights or to obtain a non-waiver agreement, amounted to a waiver of the defense of material misrepresentation and estopped it from setting up the policy violation as a bar to its obligation to the insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Merchants contends on appeal that its activities in defense of the death action, prior to commencement of the instant suit, do not constitute a voluntary waiver of its defenses under the policy. It maintains that notice to an insured of an assorted policy violation is timely made if it is given a reasonable time before trial of the action against the insured; here, it says, such notice was communicated within several months of the institution of the primary action, in the form of the filing of the complaint and service of process in the instant declaratory proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Defendants assert that Merchants\u2019 exclusive control over the defense of the death action, knowing all the while of the nature of the alleged misrepresentation, comprised a voluntary decision to relinquish any policy defenses along these lines; further, that the defense activities\u2014both before and after the commencement of the declaratory action\u2014put the insurer in the conflicting role of both protecting and oppressing the insureds, the latter having been placed in the intolerable position of having to cooperate with the insurer under the terms of the policy and thus having the defense tailored to the insurer\u2019s wishes, while at the same time anticipating the possible loss of coverage under the policy. The prejudicial effect of the insurer\u2019s \u201csqueeze play,\u201d according to defendants, is so obvious as to require that Merchants be equitably estopped from rescinding the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">We deal initially with the issue of whether the Egglestons wore in fact guilty of a material misrepresentation entitling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Merchants to avoid liability on the policy. Defendants here question the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s ruling in this respect. They assert that legal title to the Thunderbird resided in defendant Jean Eggleston and that they were not requested to detail in the instrument the fact that Tussel had provided the purchase moneys. Additionally, they reemphasize Edward L. Eggleston\u2019s testimony that he did in fact inform Merchants\u2019 agent that the car had been purchased by Tussel. Finally, they conclude that the question of what is meant by \u201cownership\u201d in the context of an insurance contract is certainly a debatable one, and urge that the rule of contract construction favoring the insured should here operate to resolve this issue in favor of an equation of \u201cowner\u201d with' the legal titleholder, in accordance with what was allegedly their understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We first consider whether a statement as to ownership in an automobile liability policy is material to the obligation of the insurer. If the statement is expressly embodied in the policy as a \u201cwarranty,\u201d there is no dispute, for warranties are by definition essential terms of the contract, breach of which permits the insurer to avoid liability. 2 <em>Richards, Insurance, </em>\u00a7 305, <em>pp. </em>1003-06 <em>(5th ed. </em>1952). \u201cRepresentations,\u201d on the other hand, whether contained in the policy itself or merely in the applicant\u2019s declarations preparatory to issuance of the policy, will only invoke forfeiture of the insured\u2019s rights if they are untruthful, material to the particular risk assumed by the insurer, and actually and reasonably relied upon by the insurer in executing the contract. <em>Ibid. </em>\u00a7 306, <em>pp. </em>1009-11. See 5A <em>Am. Jur., Automobile Insurance, </em>\u00a7 13, <em>p. </em>16.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">It has generally been held that representations as to the identity of the named insured and the precise nature of his interest relate to a subject material to the carrier\u2019s risk, thus entitling the latter to disclaim liability if the representation turns out to be false. 2 <em>Richards, Insurance, supra, </em>\u00a7 357, <em>pp. </em>1177-78; 4 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 2624, <em>p. </em>490 (1941); see Annotation, 33 <em>A. L. R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>2d </em>948 (1954). The theory upon which ownership is deemed material goes to the heart of the insurance operation: acceptance of a mathematically categorized risk in return for a computed premium consonant with that risk. In the instance of automobile liability insurance, moreover, there are situations in which the particular risk\u2014because of general age grouping, personal accident record, or otherwise\u2014is considered too high to justify coverage at any cost; in such a case, the insurer simply will not enter into a contract with the applicant in question. One of the established risk categories most susceptible to denial of coverage is that of the minor male driver. This known fact was substantiated by plaintiff\u2019s witness, Gilbert, who testified that if the Thunderbird in the instant case had been registered in Tussel\u2019s name or if he had been its principal operator, not only would the premium certainly have been higher but the policy could not have been issued without prior submission to the home office of the company for its investigation and approval or rejection. Approval of a policy covering Tussel as owner or principal operator would have been extremely conjectural in the light of his testimony that he had been involved in three accidents previous to the incident with the Thunderbird. In any event, the materiality of the true identity of the owner or principal operator is readily apparent. See 5A <em>Am. Jur., supra, </em>\u00a7 16, <em>p. </em>19.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Nor does the fact that Tussel, even as a minor male, was covered under the omnibus clause of the policy\u2014with the knowledge of the insurer\u2014detract from the relevancy of the alleged effort to disguise his status as owner or primary user. The use of a vehicle \u201cwith the permission of the named insured\u201d represents an entirely distinct risk\u2014from the insurer\u2019s view\u2014from the ownership or primary operation of the automobile. The former is considered, on the average (and risks are calculated, after all, on average performance), a casual and occasional risk; the company makes the reasonable assumption that ordinarily the major use of the vehicle will be by the named insured or specified principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>operator. Should it be revealed that the under-age male driver occupies a position which increases the likelihood and frequency of his use <em>(e. g., </em>a member of the same household as the named insured), the premium would increase accordingly by virtue of the change in rating class of the named insured. There is, finally, this major factor bearing on the materiality of full disclosure of the true owner and principal operator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201cWhere the application for the insurance is made by the true owner and he is to be designated in the policy as the named insured, the insurance company, before issuing the policy, may investigate the age and other facts with respect to such owner which it deems important in determining whether to issue the policy, but where the fact with respect to ownership is misrepresented, and the identity of the true owner is concealed with the purpose of obtaining coverage for the true owner under the omnibus clause, no such opportunity is present.\u201d <em>Didlake v. Standard Insurance Co., </em>195 <em>F. 2d </em>247, 250, 33 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>941, 947 (10 <em>Cir. </em>1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The trial judge, in accordance with these principles, found that the interest of Tussel in the Thundexbird was material, and, further, that it was \u201cnot fully disclosed to the agent for the plaintiff.\u201d He went on to say, however, that \u201cfraud may not have been intended,\u201d and applied the rule of law that, nonetheless, \u201can innocent material misrepresentation will, in equity, support rescission of an insurance contract.\u201d <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society of United States v. New Horizons, Inc., </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>307, 314 (1958); <em>Citizens Casualty Co. of New York v. Zambrano Trucking Co., Inc., </em>140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>378 <em>(Ch. </em>1947), affirmed 141 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>310 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). It is thus inferable that the judge\u2019s findings were predicated not upon the motives of the defendants as elicited from the conflicting testimony, but rather upon a perhaps unintended but factually inaccurate statement in the written policy declaration or endorsement thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Did the insureds misrepresent ownership of the Thunderbird within the terms of the contractual instrument!' We have examined both the original policy and the endorsement extending its coverage to the Thunderbird, and are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>necessarily convinced that its terminology reflects an affirmative misrepresentation, as distinguished from a concealment \u25a0\u2014either intended or innocent\u2014on the part of the assureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The only relevant statement contained in the original declaration and policy is that the named insured is the \u201cowner\u201d of the principal vehicle covered. The concept of \u201cownership\u201d is obviously fraught with analytical difficulties, see Cohen, \u201cDialogue on Private Property,\u201d 9 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>357 (1954), and it may well be that the Egglestons conceived that Jean \u201cowned\u201d the car. Indeed, their statements to Merchants\u2019 investigators bespeak their continuing confusion, their belief that while Jacob \u201cpurchased\u201d the automobile, Jean was the \u201cowner\u201d of it. Nor can we say, objectively, that the holder of legal title is not the \u201cowner\u201d in one proper sense of the term. Both common usage and our Motor Vehicle Eegistration Law, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-3 <em>et seq., </em>so recognize him. Moreover, our Supreme Court, in a number of cases in recent years, has held that the above statutes constitute the official reflector of ownership of a motor vehicle. See <em>National City Bank of New York v. Del Sordo, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>530 (1954), involving the recording of chattel mortgages on motor vehicles; <em>Eggerding v. Bick nell, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>106 (1955), holding that an automobile dealer which had yet to transfer title to one of its vehicles in accordance with the statutory procedure was still the \u201cowner\u201d thereof for purposes of insurance coverage under the terms of its policy; and <em>Norris v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>437 (1961), also holding that the named assured had acquired \u201cownership\u201d of a vehicle within the meaning of a liability clause when he acquired statutory title thereto, even if it were shown that the car was in fact used exclusively by his son and intended as a gift for the son. The important point concerning these cases, and distinguishing them from the instant matter, is that no assertion of fraud or misrepresentation with respect to ownership was involved. The decisions simply recognized the proposition, with which we are in full accord, that the holder of statutory title to a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>vehicle is in a real sense the \u201cowner\u201d thereof. They do not indicate that an insurer is prevented from disclaimer on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentations as to ownership, regardless of the information it requests from its insured on an application or by policy warranties or representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">While insurance carriers may, within the confines of public policy, write their contracts in any manner they desire, the language of their instruments will be construed strictly and will, in cases of ambiguity, be held to favor the insured. <em>Korfin v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>154, 158 (1950); <em>Reese Cadillac Corp. v. Glen Falls Ins. Co., </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>118, 126 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960). We cannot here say that the listing of the legal titleholder, in response to a mere request for a statement of \u201cownership\u201d by the insurer, will, in the absence of fraudulent intent, give rise to disclaimer of liability on the ground of material misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"> It is further urged, however, that the later endorsement of the policy contained an explicit statement with respect to the nature of the ownership of the Thunderbird, and that the insureds\u2019 acceptance and approval of this statement as made undeniably constituted a misrepresentation.

insureds to respond to this declaration constituted a representation, false in fact, that the Egglestons were the sole and unconditional owners of the vehicle, to the exclusion of any equitable interest in any other party. There is some doubt that the form of this declaration, directed as it is towards ordinary commercial encumbrances, <em>e. g., </em>chattel mortgage liens, conditional sales contracts, etc., is sufficiently definite or explicit to adequately inform the insured that the name of a relative who has furnished the consideration, in what amounts to a family purchase, must be listed. Indeed, such a disclosure by the insured could not feasibly be placed in any of the blanks provided in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">While comparable considerations of public policy may not here be involved, the clear import of our Supreme Court\u2019s discourse on standardized industry contracts in <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>358 (1960), is that the private individual must be fairly and adequately informed by the instrument, in terms capable of common understanding, of the precise nature of his obligations and rights. <em>Cf. Mahon v. American Casualty Co. of Reading, </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>148, 165 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 34 <em>N. J. </em>472 (1961). The small print query reproduced hereinabove does not, in our view, reasonably notify the applicant, in such a context as that here involved, that failure to insert the name of a relative under the heading \u201cencumbrances\u201d and \u201cinstallment payments\u201d may serve to relieve the insurer of liability on the policy. While the insured is duty-bound to deal freely and fairly with the carrier in the disclosure of material facts, <em>Atlantic Casualty Insurance Co. v. Interstate Insurance Co., </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>81, 85 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), this does not entail (absent fraudulent intent on the part of the insured) anticipating every possible facet of an ambiguous informational request.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Our observations with respect to the particular form of instrument here involved should not be considered disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tive of the broader question of whether \u201csole and unconditional\u201d ownership is misrepresented where the named insured holds legal title to the vehicle hut equitable ownership rests in another, the latter having furnished the purchase moneys other than as a gift. We express no opinion on this question, although we do take note of prior holdings in this State to the effect that where the insured states that he is the \u201csole and unconditional\u201d owner of the vehicle, he is held to have represented that no one else has any interest in the property as owner and that the title is not limited or affected by any condition. <em>Hudson Casualty Insurance Co. v. Garfinkel, </em>111 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>70, 73 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932); <em>Ambrose v. Indemnity Insurance Co. of North America, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>438, 441 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940); <em>United States Casualty Co. v. Timmerman, </em>118 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>563, 565 <em>(Ch. </em>1935). <em>Cf. Savarese v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>435, 437 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1924). However, in all of these cases, the impediment to sole and unconditional ownership was the usual commercial encumbrance, and not the equitable interest of a family member. See <em>Pabon v. Hackensack Auto Sales, Inc., </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>476, 487 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960). See, as bearing upon this question, <em>Kietlinski v. Interstate Transportation Lines, Inc., </em>3 <em>Wis. 2d </em>451, 88 <em>N. W. 2d </em>739, 743 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1958), where it was held that the party with legal title\u2014as against one with a mere equitable interest arising from the provision of purchase moneys\u2014was the \u201csole owner\u201d within the meaning of the policy clause, the court emphasizing that \u201cin common usage, 'owner\u2019 is often equated to title-ownership.\u201d Also see <em>Martin v. State Insurance Co., </em>44 <em>N. J. L. </em>485 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The remaining question is whether the insureds otherwise knowingly deceived Merchants by intentionally concealing the information with respect to Tussel\u2019s part in the purchase of the automobile. \u201cConcealment\u201d is the intentional withholding of a fact material to the risk which the assured in honesty and good faith ought to communicate to the underwriter. <em>Kozlowski v. Pavonia Fire Insurance Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>194, 197 <em>(B. &amp; A. </em>1936). If the concealment relates to a matter specifically inquired of, the state of mind of the insured may be immaterial; in such an instance, the concealment by the insured would in effect constitute a misrepresentation. But where, as we have here hold, there has been no specific inquiry, the concealment must be tainted with fraud in order to justify avoidance of the policy. <em>Brighton v. North River Insurance Co., </em>106 <em>N. J. L. </em>10 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Pour elements must be present before disclaimer of the insurance contract may be effectuated on the ground of concealment: (1) the insured must have knowledge of the fact; (2) he must know that the fact is or might be material to the risk; (3) it must in fact be material; and (4) the insurer must rely upon the statements\u2014disclosed and undisclosed\u2014concerning the subject matter to which this fact relates. 2 <em>Richards, Insurance, supra, </em>\u00a7 375, <em>p. </em>1241. As stated above, the trial judge\u2019s opinion does not contain a finding that the insureds were aware of the materiality of Tussel\u2019s interest to the risk. While the evidence demonstrates knowledge on their part that insurance could most easily and inexpensively be obtained by placing title in the name of Jean Eggleston, it is not at all conclusive of the question of their awareness of the materiality of their course of action to the risk. They may very well have considered the insurer\u2019s only interest to be in the identity of the legal titleholder and may have concluded that once title was placed in Jean Eggleston\u2019s name, she being\u2014in their eyes\u2014the primary operator, they had accomplished an entirely proper transaction. Certainly their candor in stating the terms and form of the arrangement to Merchants\u2019 investigators tends to disprove a fraudulent design to hide Tussel\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We consider it unnecessary, however, to resolve this issue, either under our original fact-finding power, <em>R. R. </em>1:5-4(b), or by remand to the trial court for additional findings. We have determined, as explained below, that the insurer\u2019s conduct following knowledge of Tussel\u2019s interest must bo deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>a waiver of any possible defenses based on claim of concealment of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">As previously detailed, the plaintiff was first made aware of the interest of Tussel in the Thunderbird at the time of his post-accident statement and that of his sister, which were related to Merchants' investigator. Elaborations of these statements were obtained on September 19, 1958 by another investigator of the insurer. Following service of the summons and complaint in Krebs' death action, which was commenced on October 14, 1958, the papers were forwarded to Gilbert, who in turn sent them to Merchants by registered mail on November 4, 1958. Merchants appointed Francis J. Tansey, Esq. to undertake the defense of Tussel and Jean Eggleston. On November 17, 1958, Tansey filed an answer on their behalf; two days later, he propounded interrogatories to the plaintiff in the death action. On December 19, 1958 he instituted a third-party action against the owner and operator of a vehicle which had allegedly been \u201cdrag racing\u201d with the Thunderbird at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">While the present declaratory suit was instituted on January 5, 1959, process was not served on defendants until February 25, and it was not until that time that they were made aware of their insurer\u2019s course of action. Meanwhile, Tansey continued to represent Tussel and Jean Eggleston. On February 4 he propounded supplemental interrogatories. On February 11 he wrote to the insureds informing them of receipt of a notice to take their depositions and requesting that they make an appointment to visit his office to answer interrogatories. On February 25 Tansey again wrote to them, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cDear Mrs. Eggleston and Mr. Tussel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">On February 11 I wrote asking you to phone me for an appointment to answer interrogatories served upon me. These must be answered by both of you at my office before depositions take place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Unless you immediately contact me, I will advise my client to withdraw from your defense, and the matter will be turned over to you for your action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Jean Eggleston and Tussel responded promptly to this letter and appeared to answer the interrogatories. On April 4 Tansey received further interrogatories from the death action plaintiff, and instructed and aided defendants in answering them. On November 23, 1959 be represented defendants at the pretrial conference of the death action, and on February 19, 1960, when the depositions of Joan Eggleston and Tussel were taken, Tansey, still employed by Merchants, was present on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Two basic issues are raised: (1) whether plaintiff\u2019s actions subsequent to the accident and prior to service of the complaint in the instant proceeding amounted to a waiver of its asserted defense under the policy; and (2), if not, whether the service of the pleadings in the declaratory action constitutes an implied notice to the insured of the insurer\u2019s reservation of all rights of disclaimer, thereby removing from consideration on the question of waiver any of Tansey\u2019s activities following February 25, 1959; or whether, as defendants claim, the institution of the declaratory proceeding along with the continued defense of the primary action\u2014without expressly offering the insureds the choice implicit in a notice of non-waiver\u2014should result in equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We find it unnecessary to pass on the second question, as we have determined that Merchants\u2019 conduct over the nine-month period following the collision and its almost immediate acquisition of the basic facts of ownership represents a solid foundation fox the trial -judge\u2019s holding of waiver of the alleged defense based on such ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, operative unilaterally and without regard to reliance by others. <em>West Jersey Tille, &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Industrial Trust Co., </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>144, 152-153 (1958); <em>Mattia v. Northern Insurance Co. of New York, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>35 N. J. Super. 503, 511 (App. Div. </em>1955). It may take the form of an agreement founded on a valuable consideration, or, as here, it may constitute a clear, unequivocal and decisive act showing such a purpose as to amount to estoppel <em>in pais. Aron v. Rialto Realty Co., </em>100 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>513, 518 <em>(Ch. </em>1927), affirmed 102 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>331 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1928). The intention to waive need not be stated expressly, but may be spelled out from a state of facts exhibiting full knowledge of circumstances producing a right and continuing indifference to the exercise of that right. Thus, where the insurer has complete knowledge of facts giving rise to a defense under the policy but nonetheless continues unequivocally to treat the policy as operative and to undertake the defense of the insured, it is held to have waived its right later to assert that defense. <em>Cook v. Preferred Accident Ins. Co., </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>141 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1935); <em>O\u2019Dowd v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>444 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1937); <em>Suydam v. Public Indemnity Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>868, 161 <em>A. </em>499 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932); <em>Caiola v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>845, 181 <em>A. </em>524 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), affirmed 116 <em>N. J. L. </em>381 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936). See 5A <em>Am. Jur., supra, </em>\u00a7 132, <em>p. </em>133.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The basic facts concerning Tussel\u2019s purchase of the Thunderbird were revealed to Merchants, through its agent, within several weeks of the May 12, 1958 accident date. Any doubt or confusion with respect thereto was certainly dispelled at the time of the second phase of the plaintiff\u2019s investigation, namely on September 19, 1958, when all parties concerned freely related the circumstances surrounding the purchase and the reasons for placing ownership in Jean Eggleston\u2019s name. Nevertheless, plaintiff waited until suit had been instituted and discovery proceedings were well under way before indicating in any fashion to the insureds an intention to disclaim liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Merchants urges that its legal duty was only to notify the insureds of an asserted policy violation within a reasonable time before trial of the liability action. It seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>justify its delay on the ground that it was attempting all the while to determine, through independent counsel, whether sufficient grounds existed to void the policy for misrepresentation. Pending this determination, it undertook its contractual obligation \u201cto defend any suit\u201d seeking \u201cdamages * * * payable under the terms of [the] policy.\u201d Additionally, the assertion is made that the insurer at no time had \u201cfull knowledge\u201d of the operative facts, as the investigation statements served merely \u201cto crystalize * * * [its] continued suspicions\u201d; it was \u201cprecisely the trial of the fraud claim and the discovery proceedings that would precede the trial that the insurer hoped would result in the disclosure of these facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">This argument reflects a fixed determination on the part of plaintiff to \u201cplay it safe\u201d at the expense of the insureds. Contrary to Merchants\u2019 view, the operative facts were fully and completely revealed at the time of the investigations. The only remaining question was the legal effect of these facts. The insurer was obviously not entitled to delay notice to the insured until such time as it had determined to its personal satisfaction the legal efficacy of its suspected defense; not, at least, where it was simultaneously charting the course of the defense of the death action and indeed insisting that the insureds adhere to their policy duties to cooperate in that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Assumption of complete control of the insured\u2019s defense, a contractual condition of the insurer\u2019s liability, is considered a substantial deprivation and should be timely relinquished when the asserted right of the insurer to avoid liability accrues. This relinquishment generally takes the form of either an express notice of disclaimer, or a reservation of rights by way of a notice of non-waiver of defenses, thereby affording the insured an opportunity to decide whether to engage new counsel or otherwise play a more active role in the defense of the primary action. No such notice or reservation was communicated by plaintiff to defendants\u2014 at least until the latter\u2019s acceptance of process on Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ary 25, 1959, simultaneously with Tansey\u2019s, letter warning that \u201cunless you immediately contact me, I will advise my client to withdraw from your defense.\u201d Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the declaratory judgment complaint constituted by implication a notice of non-waiver, we conclude that it was not timely made in the evolution of the primary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Altman, </em>21 <em>Misc. 2d </em>162, 191 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>270 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1959), illustrates the sound presumption of prejudice to the insured \u25a0 from unreasonable delay in communication of disclaimer, even though notice is received in advance of trial. There, the carrier had prior to the accident cancelled the policy for non-payment of premiums. However, following the accident, the insurer, without reservation, investigated same, prepared pleadings, and participated in pretrial proceedings. Two months after the accident, the insurer attempted to assert the cancellation. It was held that the cancellation had been waived, and the carrier was estopped from alleging non-coverage of the accident. The court concluded, 191 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2 <em>d, supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>279-280, that \u201cany other result would be inequitable to the defendant who must be presumed to have been prejudiced by plaintiff\u2019s conduct in undertaking the exclusive control of the investigation of the claim and later of the defense of the action in accordance with the terms of the policy, without any reservation of rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In <em>United States Casualty Co. v. Melee, </em>123 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>256 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938), the court, though disposing of the appeal on another basis, attributed substantial force to the insured\u2019s contention that the insurer, having knowledge\u2014through its investigation reports several days after the accident\u2014of the policy holder\u2019s misrepresentation as to sole and unconditional ownership, had waived its right to cancel the policy on that ground when it did not so assert the defense until shortly before the time of trial.

Co., </em>266 <em>Mo. App. </em>351, 41 <em>S. W. 2d </em>599 <em>(Ct. App. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>1931); <em>Miller v. Union Indemnity Co., </em>209 <em>App. Div. </em>455, 204 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>730 <em>(App. Div. </em>1924); <em>Reese v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>4 <em>Misc. 2d </em>947, 163 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>326 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1956); <em>Matthews v. Glens Falls Insurance Co., </em>21 <em>Misc. 2d </em>1079, 192 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>811 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1959). 3 <em>Richards, Insurance, supra, </em>\u00a7 461, <em>p. </em>1517. Compare <em>Reliable Newspaper Delivery v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>424 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1944), in which a claim of waiver was rejected where the insurer, though delaying a number of months in disclaiming, nevertheless notified the insured almost a year prior to the institution of the negligence suit against the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Thus, while many of the waiver and estoppel holdings, see Annotations, 81 <em>A. L. R. </em>1326 (1932), 38 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1148 (1954), involved delay in disclaimer until or even after the time of trial, it is clear that this is by no means the dividing line. Some of these cases are phrased in terms of equitable estoppel, under which doctrine actual prejudice to the insured must in many jurisdictions be shown. Prejudice enters into the instant analysis only insofar as it bears on the unreasonableness of the insurer\u2019s delay following awareness of the operative facts. We think it a sound principle, and so hold, that when the insurer has had full knowledge of all facts giving rise to possible rights of disclaimer before commencement of the primary action against the insured, but nevertheless assumes command of that action without reservation of rights and proceeds to file all necessary pleadings and to engage in discovery maneuvers, it has embarked on a firm commitment which must reasonably be construed as a waiver of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
