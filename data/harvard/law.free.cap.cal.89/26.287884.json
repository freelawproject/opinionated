If the injury be already committed, the writ can have no operation to correct it, and equity will not interfere for the purposes of punishment, or to compel persons to do right, but only to prevent them from doing wrong. (1 High on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Injunctions, ed. of 1880, pp. 3,5.) The act complained o\u00ed is <em>per se </em>a public nuisance, because it interferes with the free use of the road by the traveling public in general, and not merely some particular person; it is therefore an offense against the public which is remediable by the public only, and not actionable, except where an individual has suffered some special damage beyond what is common to himself with the rest of the public. <em>(Marini </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>67 Cal. 132; 1 High on Injunctions, ed. of 1880, sec. 762; <em>Yolo Co. </em>v. <em>Sacramento, </em>36 Cal. 196; <em>Lewiston T.

Such action may be brought by any person whose property is injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance; and by the judgment, the nuisance may be enjoined or abated, as well as damages recovered.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 731.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u201cA private person may maintain an action for a public nuisance, if it is specially injurious to himself, but not otherwise.\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 3493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In <em>Blanc </em>v. <em>Klumpke, </em>29 Cal. 156, it was held that if a nuisance in a highway only affect the plaintiff in common with the public at large in the use of the highway, he cannot have his private action; but if the free use of his private property is interfered with by such nuisance, he may have his private action to abate the same. And this seems to be the general rule, and well supported by the authorities. (See Wood on Nuisances, secs. 811, 830, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Here it was alleged in the complaint and found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the court that the plaintiff had a slaughter-house, where he was compelled, in order to carry on his business, to slaughter a number of animals each day, and that he had no other place for slaughtering the animals; that the obstruction was erected by the defendant for the purpose, and had the effect, to wholly prevent the plaintiff from reaching his slaughter-house, and if continued, would break up and destroy his business, to his damage in the sum of five thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">This, we think, clearly shows that the nuisance was specially injurious to the plaintiff, and that under the well-settled rules of law he had a right in his own name to commence and maintain an action to enjoin or abate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">It is further urged that the injunction ought not to have been granted, because it appeared that the obstruction sought to be enjoined actually existed at and before the time of filing the complaint (citing <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Stroever, </em>81 Cal. 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">This position cannot, in our opinion, be sustained. An obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with its comfortable enjoyment, is a nuisance, and the statute says it may be enjoined or abated. Such an obstruction must necessarily have an actual existence-before it can be a nuisance. The judgment here might have been in direct terms that the obstruction be removed and the nuisance abated; but the mandatory injunction granted was evidently intended to have, and did have, the same effect. It was therefore an authorized and appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In the case cited, the appeal was from an order refusing to dissolve a preliminary injunction granted on the complaint alone. The order was reversed on the ground that the obstruction complained of already existed. The court said that \u201cmandatory preliminary injunctions are seldom granted, and only in a peculiar class of cases, o\u00ed which this case is not one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We think the decision clearly right, but it in no way contravenes what has been said above. Obviously, alleged nuisances ought not, in ordinary cases, to be abated by preliminary injunctions, since it might appear on the trial that the alleged nuisance was not a nuisance, or that the plaintiff had no right to sue for its abatement in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">It results, in our opinion, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Vanclief, 0., and Fitzgerald, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Court. \u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
