H. 539; 20 Am. Rep. 160.) The demurrer admits that the services alleged were performed, and that the ward received the benefit, and that the services were worth the amount promised to be paid and prayed for. (Code Civ. Proc., sees. 1768, 1769, 1776.) Claims against a minor need not be presented in the form required in estates of deceased persons. <em>(Racouillat </em>v. <em>Requena, </em>36 Cal. 656, 657.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>James M.

The probate side of the superior court alone can deal with the estates of wards. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>63 Cal. 86; 49 Am.

The action is to recover an attorney\u2019s fee for services rendered to the guardian of a minor in pursuance of a written contract. The action is against the minor. If the guardian made a valid contract with the attorney, he may be held liable, and if he pays it, and the probate court shall deem the expenditure reasonable, and necessary to protect the interests of the ward, it may be allowed from the ward\u2019s-estate. But it is an expense incurred by the guardian in the performance of his duties, for which he is primarily liable. If an attorney\u2019s fee could ever be in the nature of a necessary for which the ward could contract, the complaint shows that the service here was not of that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We notice that the transcript \u25a0 fails to show that the ward appeared by guardian, as required by section 372 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Belcher, 0., and Vancliep, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The Court.\u2014For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
