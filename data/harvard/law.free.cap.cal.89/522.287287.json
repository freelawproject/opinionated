Chief Justice Searls, in drawing a distinction between that case and <em>People </em>v. <em>Henshaw, </em>76 Cal. 444, said: \u201cThe distinction attempted to be made by the statute under consideration in that case is not found here. It dealt with forty-eight classes of officers, and was to take effect as to all of them except three classes, upon the expiration of the terms of office of the incumbents. It was a general law, applying alike to all classes, but took effect at different times upon different classes. No such distinction is made by the law under consideration here. <em>The statute we are reviewing operates alike upon all the persons to whom it applies, and it applies equally to all persons in the same category.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">And again, the chief justice says: \u201cTo so classify them that general laws applicable to these separate classes (referring to the classification of municipal corporations) will meet the necessities of the case was a wise provision, and a law which applies to one or more, but not to all, of these cases is not for <em>that reason </em>special legislation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henshaw, </em>76 Cal. 444. See also <em>Longan </em>v. <em>County of Solano, </em>65 Cal. 125; <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Ashworth, </em>73 Cal. 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Justice Scott, in <em>Knickerbocker </em>v. <em>People, </em>102 Ill. 229, appears to state' the same rule when he says: \u201cGeneral laws are those which relate to or bind all within the jurisdiction \"of the law-making power, limited as that power may be in its territorial operation or by constitutional restraints. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>83 Ill. 585; Sedgwick on Statutory and Constitutional Law, 30.) A law applicable to all counties of a class as made or authorized by the constitution is neither a local nor special law. If it applies to all the counties of a class authorized by the constitution to be made, it is a general law; and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>there may be few or many counties to which its provisions will apply, is a matter of no consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">It follows that the act of March 14, 1891, was a general law, of uniform operation, and therefore not hostile to the provisions of the constitution heretofore quoted. It became a part of the County Government Act of 1883 as amended by subsequent acts of the legislature, and is in full force and effect, unless repealed by later legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Subsequent to the fourteenth day of March, 1891, the legislature passed \u201c An act to establish a uniform system of county and township governments.\u201d It was approved March 31, 1891, went into effect immediately, and repealed all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with its provisions. (Stats. 1891, p. 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Among other things, it reclassified the counties of the state, for the purpose of regulating the compensation of the county officers of the various counties, and fixed the salaries of all such officers. Section 234 of said act reads: \u201cThe provisions of this act, unless otherwise herein provided, so far as it relates to the fees and salaries of all officers named, except justices of the peace and constables, shall not affect the present incumbents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">There can be but one construction placed on 'this provision of the act, and that is, the legislature intended, except where it was otherwise provided in the act, that the compensation of all county officers holding office upon the thirty-first day of March, 1891, should not be affected by the act. There appears to be nothing in the act \u201c otherwise providing \u201d; and it necessarily follows that the compensation provided for county officers by the act of March 31, 1891, does not affect the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The act of March 14, 1891, went into effect April 1, 1891, unless repealed by the later act of March 31st; but we have already held, in consonance with the views of plaintiff, that the provisions of the act of March 31st, relative to salaries of county officers, does not affect present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>incumbents, and consequently does not repeal, until the expiration of the terms of the present officers, the provisions of the act of 1883, with its amendments relating to the compensation of county officers. Therefore the act of March 14, 1891; being an amendment of the act of 1883, and not being repealed, is in full force and effect, and the plaintiff is entitled to his salary thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Let the application for the peremptory writ be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Paterson, J., Harrison, J., McFarland, J., Sharp-stein, J., and Beatty, 0. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
