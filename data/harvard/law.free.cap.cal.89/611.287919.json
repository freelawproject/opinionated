Platshek, </em>and <em>M. S.

The failure to serve the statement in time is a waiver of the motion for a new trial, and it thereupon becomes the duty of the court to dismiss it for want of prosecution. <em>(Odd Fellows\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Deuprey, </em>66 Cal. 167; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Evoy, 58 </em>Cal. 348, 351; <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>66 Cal. 520; <em>Hegeler </em>v. <em>Henckell, </em>27 Cal. 491; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>27 Cal. 338; <em>Caney </em>v. <em>Silverthorne, </em>9 Cal. 67.)
