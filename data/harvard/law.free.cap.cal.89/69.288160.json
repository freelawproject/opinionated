And it would be unjust to dismiss an appeal merely because some part of the roll had been, inadvertently, perhaps, omitted from the transcript. If the omission be deemed material by respondent, he can easily remedy the supposed defect by suggestion of a diminution of the record. In the case at bar, the asserted defects in the copy of the judgment roll, which do not very clearly appear from the certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>cate of the clerk, are not important enough to authorize a dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Harrison, J., Paterson, J., Garoutte, J.3 and De Haven, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
