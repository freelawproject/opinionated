The appellants, as hotel-keepers, were not bound to fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>nish water of a particular spring, and the court should have so instructed the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-4\"><em>Ira C.

On the ninth day of June, 1888, he again requested entertainment as a guest. There was room for his accommodation; he was a fit and proper person, and had ample means of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The manager, one of the proprietors, being present, refused him entertainment, saying: \u201c I \u2019ll teach you how to get up a petition to have me removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">It is claimed here that the court erred in allowing plaintiff to testify that preventing him from using the water had a very injurious effect upon his health. Under the circumstances, however, this amounted to no more than the previous statement, that the water had benefited him; that he was an invalid, and had visited the springs hoping to be benefited again. The jury could not have been misled, for it could have had no other meaning. The complaint avers, and the evidence shows, that the water was the principal inducement to -visitors of the hotel, and was the sole inducement to plaintiff. Necessarily, to be deprived of it would be an injury, in his estimation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Error is also claimed in the refusal to give defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>fourth instruction, to the effect that defendants were not hound to furnish water of the spring. There was no evidence that they refused to allow plaintiff the use of it. His injury was in being refused entertainment at the hotel, and, in consequence, the use of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We think the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Belcher, 0., and Foote, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The Court. \u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
