(Pen. Code, sec. 1272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">In <em>Ex parte Smallman, </em>54 Cal. 36, this court outlined the general character of facts necessary to exist, upon \u25a0which to base an exercise of this discretion, and held that except where circumstances of an extraordinary character had intervened, a person convicted of a felony ought not to be admitted to bail pending an appeal; and to the same effect is <em>Ex parte Marks, </em>49 Cal. 681, and <em>Ex parte Brown, </em>68 Cal. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The petition in this case shows no such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">We cannot, in this proceeding, examine into the alleged errors of law committed by the lower court, and thus prejudge the case before it comes before us upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">The fact that the trial court has adopted an inflexi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ble rule not to admit any defendant to bail who has been convicted of a felony can have no weight with us, however inconsistent such rule may be when compared with section 1272 of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">This court passes upon the merits of the petition as presented to it, and regardless of any action or rule the trial court may have adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Application denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">De Haven, J., Harrison, J., McFarland, J., Paterson, J., and Beatty, C.
