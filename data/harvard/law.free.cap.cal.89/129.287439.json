If the services of plaintiff were rendered under an <em>express </em>contract, were the terms of such contract as alleged by plaintiff, or did the answer of defendant correctly state the contract? 2. If the evidence Was not sufficient to enable the jury to say that there was an express contract, and what were its terms, then the question would arise as to the reasonable worth of the services actually rendered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Upon the trial the court admitted the testimony of attorneys as to what would be a fair compensation to plaintiff for the services rendered by him, the witnesses testifying upon the hypothesis that he had contracted to perform them under an express contract for a retainer of five hundred dollars cash, \u201c and the remainder of his fee contingent upon success in case of compromise.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>This evidence was objected to by appellant as irrelevant and incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The first cause of action alleged in the complaint is upon an <em>implied </em>contract to pay the reasonable worth of the services rendered, and the evidence objected to was clearly irrelevant as to this, because the law never implies, from the rendition of service, a promise to pay what is known to the legal profession as a \u201c contingent fee.\u201d Such a promise, if it exist at all, is the creation of an express contract, and if <em>it </em>should be conceded that it is competent for parties to contract for such a fee, leaving the <em>amount </em>to be fixed by evidence as to what would be a \u201c reasonable contingent fee,\u201d no such contract is alleged in the first cause of action, and as to that there was no issue to which such evidence could apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">2. Was the testimony relevant to any issue made by the pleadings as to the express contract between the parties ? The answer to this will depend upon whether such evidence has any tendency to prove the contract alleged by plaintiff, or disprove the one set up by the defendant; and we cannot see how proof of this kind could afford the least aid in determining whether the contention of plaintiff or that of defendant is right, in regard to the terms of the contract made by them. If there had been a dispute as to the <em>amount </em>of a contingent fee to be paid, then such evidence would have been relevant as having a bearing upon the probabilities of the case. Testimony as to value or usual price has been frequently admitted in aid of proof of an express contract, where the only fact in dispute was as to the sum agreed to be paid for services rendered thereunder, or for property sold. The principle upon which the evidence is admitted in such a case is, that proof of reasonable value or usual price has some tendency to show the probable price actually agreed on, that being the fact in dispute. Thus in <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>41 N. H. 234, the court, in passing upon this point, says: \u201c That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>there was a contract was admitted, and it would seem that there was no controversy about the terms of it, except as to the agreed price for drawing the lumber between the top of the hill and the depot; and while the plaintiff testified positively, as it would seem, that this agreed price was one dollar and fifty cents per thousand, the defendant probably testified just as positively that the agreed price was but one dollar per thousand. Here, then, there was a single point in dispute for the jury to settle; and as the evidence was conflicting, the jury must find the fact to be either one way or the other, according to the preponderance of the evidence; and if the direct testimony was evenly balanced, then they must consider the probabilities of the case, and weigh them, and thus come to a conclusion. And it seems to us that the evidence offered tended to show what was the common price for conveying that precise kind of lumber over the same road and at the same time, which would, we think, be competent as tending to show whether it was more probable that the price agreed to be paid was one dollar or one dollar and fifty cents per thousand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">In the present case there was no controversy as to what would have been a reasonable contingent fee, but whether there was any agreement at all to pay such a fee, and it is manifest that proof of what would be a reasonable contingent fee can have no legitimate tendency to show that there was in fact an express contract for that kind of fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The opinion evidence should have been confined to the case stated in the first cause of action, or to the particular contract alleged by the defendant. Evidence tending to show that the fee claimed by the defendant as that agreed upon was not the usual or reasonable fee for such services would have been admissible as bearing upon the probability whether plaintiff would have made such a contract. But the evidence we have been considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>was entirely irrelevant to any issue involved in the case, and as the verdict is general, so that it is impossible to say that the jury disregarded it, and based their verdict upon the other evidence, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">This case was heretofore determined in Bank, and the same conclusion reached. For the reasons here given, the judgment and order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Paterson, J., Harrison, J., Sharpstein, J., and Garoutte, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">McFarland, J., concurring. \u2014 1 concur in the judgment; but, in my opinion, no evidence of the reasonableness of a <em>contingent </em>fee is admissible under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Beatty, C. J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
