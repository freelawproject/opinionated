(Pen. Code, see. 1207.) A certified copy of the minute entry of judgment is the only authority for detention. (Pen. Code, secs. 1213, 1216, 1455.) The court had no power to render the judgment rendered, therefore it is void, and the prisoner should he released on <em>habeas corpus.

It is thus seen that it appears upon the record of the case that the court did not exceed its jurisdiction in sentencing the prisoner to imprisonment in the state prison for the term of ten years. <em>(Ex parte Young Ah Gow, </em>73 Cal. 438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It was not necessary that the entry of the judgment in the minutes should repeat the entries that had already been made in previous proceedings in the case. These had already become a part of the record, and would obtain.no greater validity by being a second time recited in the minutes. \u201c From the mere fact that these several papers are taken into and made a part of the record, it is clear that each one -was intended merely to tell its own story, or rather to relate its particular branch of the whole history. Thus the indictment states the jurisdictional facts, the nature of the offense, and the facts and circumstances so far as they are material. The other papers give the history of the trial, including the verdict; and the judgment, which constitutes the last chapter, merely finishes the account by stating of what offense defendant was finally convicted, and the penalty imposed by the court. The judgment need not, and it was not intended that it should, repeat anything contained in the papers which precede it, for in view of the fact that they go into the record and make a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>it, such repetition would be idle and serve no useful purpose. The only material parts of a judgment are, the statement of the offense for which the defendant has been convicted, omitting therefrom all that is contained in the previous papers, and therefore not necessary to be repeated, and the sentence of the court.\u201d <em>(Matter of Ring, </em>28 Cal. 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It therefore appearing that the petitioner is detained in custody by virtue of process issued upon the <em>\u201c </em>final judgment of a competent court of criminal jurisdiction,\u201d the provisions of section 1486 of the Penal Code require that he be remanded, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Garoutte, J., and Paterson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
