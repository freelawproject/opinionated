Salerno, J.), entered September 14, 2006, which, to the extent appealed from, granted the motion of defendant Chase Manhattan Auto Finance for indemnification from defendant DeJesus to the extent of 30% of the total jury verdict, unanimously modified, on the law, without costs, to deny the motion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Chase is not entitled to indemnification from DeJesus. It is well settled that \u201cthe key element of a common-law cause of action for indemnification is not a duty running from the indemnitor to the injured party, but rather is <em>\u2018a </em>separate duty owed the indemnitee by the indemnitor\u2019 \u201d <em>(Raquet v Braun, </em>90 NY2d 177, 183 [1997], quoting <em>Mas v Two Bridges Assoc., </em>75 NY2d 680, 690 [1990]). No such duty existed between Chase and DeJesus before the accident, and none was created by Chase\u2019s pre-verdict settlement, to which DeJesus was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We note that Chase no longer argues that it is entitled to contribution from DeJesus.
