Carter, administrator of Thomas E. Johnson, deceased, filed two notices of motion for judgment against Robert I. Pickering, L. G. Mead, and Charles J. Mabrey. One action was for the death by wrongful act of plaintiff\u2019s decedent and the other was for damages to decedent\u2019s automobile arising out of the same accident. The two actions were tried together and verdicts returned against defendant, Charles J. Mabrey, in the respective sums of $15,000, and $775, but in favor of defendants, Robert I. Pickering and L. G. Mead. To judgments confirming the verdicts writs of error were awarded the administrator against defendants Pickering and Mead. The judgments are now final as to Charles J. Mabrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">The sole assignment of error applies alike to both recoveries and has to do with admission of evidence which plaintiff in error insists was improper and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">A clear understanding of the question presented requires a recital of the salient facts surrounding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Defendants, Robert I. Pickering and L. G. Mead, own and operate a tractor-trailer truck. On the night of the mishap, Pickering was driving this truck in a southerly direction along United States Route No. 2. As it ascended a hill it became disabled, the motor stopped, and it rolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>back and across to the left shoulder and east side of the eighteen-foot hard-surfaced highway. It there came to rest in a jack-knife position with the tractor in the ditch and on the east shoulder. The trailer was across the east side of the traveled portion of the highway and blocked about eight feet of the hard-surfaced north-bound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">This disabled vehicle was not equipped with the flares or torches required by section 46-260, Code, 1950 (sec. 2154 (133a) Code, 1942), and none was placed upon the highway. It remained upon the road blocking the greater portion of the north-bound lane for about two hours before the accident happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Shortly after the truck was disabled, decedent, a member of a local voluntary fire department, drove up in his Dodge automobile. This car was used by him in the fire department and was equipped with a blue flashing fight situated on the front bumper about opposite the driver\u2019s seat. It is described as a blinking or pulsating bright blue fight that regularly and at intervals of about a second increased and diminished in intensity, thus rendering it more noticeable than a stationary fight. This Dodge car with the fight operating was placed on the east or north-bound traffic lane slightly south of the disabled truck and facing in a southerly direction so as to be observable and serve as a warning to motorists approaching from that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Though Pickering had none of the approved flares or torches, he did have some red fight fusees and secured others from passing motorists. These were fit by him from time to time and some placed on the highway to warn approaching drivers. However, the evidence is conflicting as to whether any of these fusees were fit and upon the .road when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Shortly after decedent\u2019s car had been placed in the east traffic lane, south of the truck, other motorists arrived on the scene, some of them approached from the north and some from the south. Those who desired to pass were flagged through but several stopped. Two cars headed north stopped on the east lane. One was placed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>east half of the hard surface headed north and between Johnson\u2019s Dodge and the disabled truck. The other, which belonged to a Mr. Delos, stopped just south of decedent\u2019s car but slightly closer to the center of the road and it does not appear that it materially obstructed or interfered with an approaching motorist\u2019s view of the flashing blue light on the bumper of the Dodge car. Another car, driven by Gordon Taylor, approached from the north and stopped momentarily in the west or south-bound traffic lane about opposite decedent\u2019s car. It thus appears that at this time there was such an accumulation of vehicles on the highway as to block both traffic lanes. Though the blue pulsating light was operating and the lights on the front and rear of various vehicles were observable to approaching motorists, the congestion of cars created a distinct traffic hazard. Decedent, with a flashlight, and Pickering, with a red fusee, were standing or moving around the scene directing traffic. It was at this moment and under these circumstances that Charles J. Mabrey approached in his Ford car from the south. Driving quite rapidly, he crashed into the rear of the car owned by Mr. Delos which was the most southerly vehicle standing in the north-bound lane. The impact knocked that car to the left and into the automobile which had momentarily stopped in the south-bound lane. Mabrey\u2019s Ford continued on until it collided with the Johnson car. It then careened to the far edge of the east shoulder and there struck and killed decedent as he fled across the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Plaintiff elected to sue Pickering and Mead, owners and operators of the disabled truck, and Charles J. Mabrey, as joint tort feasors. The evidence established that Mabrey\u2019s negligence constituted a proximate cause of the accident. The other two defendants contended that their negligence, if any, was superseded by the intervening negligence of Mabrey and was, therefore, not a proximate cause of the mishap. However, the trial court concluded that the testimony warranted submission to the jury of the issue of whether or not their negligence constituted a proximate cause of the accident. That we think was correct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>fully justified. <em>Crist </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>189 Va. 109, 52 S. E. (2d) 145; <em>McGehee </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>188 Va. 116, 49 S. E. (2d) 304; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Virginia Transit Co., </em>188 Va. 493, 50 S. E. (2d) 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Trial of the criminal charges arising out of the collision was held some months before trial of these actions. Charles J. Mabrey did not personally appear at the trial of the damage actions, but was represented by counsel who defended the cases in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">On the night of and a few hours after the accident and also at the criminal trial Mabrey made certain admissions that tended to prove that he had failed to keep a proper lookout or take cognizance of the dangerous conditions existing on the highway and had thus been culpably negligent. During the trial of these damage actions the administrator called as a witness, E. R. Collis, a State highway trooper who had come to the scene of the accident and interviewed two of the defendants. An admission was made to him a few hours after the accident by Charles J. Mabrey, and at the instance of the plaintiff, was offered and admitted in evidence. The witness Collis was asked and answered the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">\u201cQ. I see. What statement was made to you by Mr. Mabrey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-8\">\u201cA. Mr. Mabrey said that he was going north on Route 2 and he didn\u2019t observe any flares and he didn\u2019t see Mr. Delos\u2019 automobile until just before the impact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">On cross-examination of the witness by counsel for Pickering and Mead he was asked, without objection by any party, the following questions and gave the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>With regard to what Mr. Mabrey told you, Mr. Collis, did Mr. Mabrey tell you that he did not see any lights of any nature, or any vehicle, until his headlights picked up the back of the Delos automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">\u201cA. Mr. Mabrey stated that he didn\u2019t see the automobile until just at the moment of the impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Didn\u2019t see any automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t see any automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">\u201cA. Didn\u2019t see anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">\u201cQ. In other words, he didn\u2019t see anything until he got right there at the moment of the impact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Later in the trial counsel for Pickering and Mead offered in evidence certain other statements against interest made by Charles J. Mabrey. They constitute answers to certain questions propounded Mabrey when he testified in the criminal trial. Their admission in evidence was objected to but they were allowed to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">As taken and preserved by the court reporter at the criminal trial and as offered and admitted in evidence at the trial of these actions, they follow: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-10\">\u201cQ. You heard the witness state about what happened at the accident. Just tell what happened as you saw it. A. Well, as far as passing this wrecker I didn\u2019t notice it was a wrecker or what it was. But when I went over this hill I wouldn\u2019t say how far it was to where the accident occurred, but I didn\u2019t see any lights until my lights picked up the tail lights of this Dodge: That is what I seen. When I seen them I tried to go to the ditch to miss him, and I didn\u2019t get to the ditch. I hit him on the back. As far as seeing this flagger I didn\u2019t see him. I didn\u2019t see anyone. ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-12\">\u201cQ. Was there any car approaching in the opposite lane from the one you were in? You were in the northbound lane? A. Well, I can\u2019t say whether it was or not. When I seen this car I didn\u2019t think of anything but trying to miss it. Q. This diagram here, the officer has submitted here, here is the wrecked truck that was there, and this he has testified was the position of the four passenger cars. This last one is your car, and this is the position they were in. Did you see this car (Indicating Taylor\u2019s.)? It was testified this car was in the opposite lane. Did you see him at any time? A. No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">The allowance in evidence of these questions and answers which tended to prove that Mabrey failed to keep a lookout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>and that his negligence in this respect constituted an efficient if not the sole proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death is the error assigned and complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Defendants in error contend that the evidence was admissible on two grounds. They insist that plaintiff in error first elicited from the witness, E. R. Collis, the admissions made by Mabrey on the night of the accident which were that he had not seen the flares, or the lights on the Delos car, until about the moment of impact. And when the witness Collis was cross-examined by them, no objection was made to his testimony which was that he (Mabrey) \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything.\u201d In view of these circumstances, they say that the administrator is now in no position to object to a full development and disclosure of all admissions made by defendant Mabrey relative to his failure to see the vehicles and the numerous lights there visible to an approaching motorist. It is argued that the evidence and admissions objected to are of the same character as those previously admitted, and, though given at a different time and in somewhat more detail, are in reality, no different from those previously voiced by Mabrey and admitted without objection, and that they were therefore properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Among decisions sustaining this contention are: <em>Douglas Land Co. </em>v. <em>Thayer Co., </em>107 Va. 292, 58 S. E. 1101; <em>Fortner </em>v. <em>Fortner, </em>133 Va. 251, 112 S. E. 762; <em>Whitten </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>137 Va. 726, 120 S. E. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">In <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Young, </em>151 Va. 985, at p. 999, 144 S. E. 624, 145 S. E. 731; Mr. Justice Holt quotes with approval the principle announced in <em>Whitten </em>v. <em>McClelland, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-8\">\u201cIt is well settled and obviously a sound general rule that objection to evidence cannot be availed of by a party who has, at some other time during the trial, voluntarily elicited the same evidence, or has permitted it to be brought out by his adversary without objection.\u201d 7 Michie\u2019s Juris, sec. 56, p. 404, 4 Michie\u2019s Digest, p. 271, and other decisions there cited are in accord with this quotation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The principle is broad and applies to admissions or state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ments against interest. 31 C. J. S., Evidence, sec. 190, pp. 917, 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"> It is our opinion that the evidence offered by plaintiff in error which tended to prove that Mabrey did not see the Delos car and thus failed to keep a proper lookout, and that elicited on his cross-examination, without objection, which showed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything\u201d was of the same character and to the same point as were his later admissions at the criminal trial. Such being true, all of his statements against interest on that particular point were admissible though the latter tended to more fully establish his failure to keep an efficient lookout and to conclusively prove culpable negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">As the administrator elected to sue the alleged joint tort feasors together, it is contended that the evidence in question was admissible against Mabrey even though no other statement of his of similar character had been received in evidence. Defendants in error assert that it was properly admissible at their instance to establish Mabrey\u2019s liability and thus exonerate them or lessen their burden. If not permitted, then they say they would be forever deprived of material testimony tending to prove Mabrey\u2019s negligence which in a suit for contribution by them against him, had a judgment been rendered against them in a separate action, would be clearly admissible to establish his liability. <em>Richmond Coca-Cola Bottling Works </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>173 Va. 240, 3 S. E. (2d) 419. If not admissible generally, they contend that it should be received for the specific and limited purpose of proving Mabrey\u2019s negligence, and as only a general objection to its admission was made, the court committed no error when it admitted the evidence without hmiting its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The specific objection made by counsel for plaintiff in error and the pertinent parts of the colloquy between the court and counsel for all parties follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\">By one of counsel for plaintiff: \u201cMy point is, as to this plaintiff it is not proper for anything that Mr. Mabrey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>said, where our client wasn\u2019t a party to those proceedings, wasn\u2019t represented, to come in. * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">By counsel for defendant, Charles J. Mabrey: \u201cI wanted to ask Mr. Browder for what purpose this testimony is being introduced?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">By counsel for Pickering and Mead: \u201cAdmission against interest. And also as a supplemental statement to prove what the officer said and opened the question up. I think we have a right to show everything that he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">\u201cIt certainly is admissible as an admission against interest as to Mr. Mabrey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\">By one of counsel for plaintiff: \u201cIf it please the Court, I would like to add my objection as representative of the plaintiff, on the grounds that there is nothing stated by Mr. Mabrey which in any way conflicts with what the officer testified that he did say, and it is not being used to impeach what the officer said, said officer being a witness for the plaintiff, but is merely being used to add evidence in the case which the defendant would not under ordinary circumstances be able to put in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-12\">By the Court: \u201cI will overrule the objections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWr\">It is our opinion that in these actions the questioned admissions' of Mabrey were not admissible for the purpose of exculpating Pickering and Mead but only to prove Mabrey\u2019s negligence. Yet, we think the objection made was general, and as there was no request to limit the effect of the evidence, either before or after the court indicated its ruling, it was before the jury for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">That evidence competent for one purpose is admissible when only a general objection is made to its reception has been held in innumerable decisions, among which are <em>Lynchburg Cotton Mills </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>112 Va. 137, 70 S. E. 542; <em>Schaubuch </em>v. <em>Dillemuth, </em>108 Va. 86, 60 S. E. 745; <em>Washington R. Co. </em>v. <em>Trimyer, </em>110 Va. 856, 67 S. E. 531; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Carson, 127 </em>Va. 306, 103 S. E. 665, 105 S. E. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">In <em>Meyers Sons </em>v. <em>Falk, </em>99 Va. 385, at p. 388, 38 S. E. 178, Judge Harrison, speaking for the court, said: \u201cIf the defendants had desired to have the consideration of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>dence limited to the particular purpose for which it was introduced, they should have asked the court to instruct the jury accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Of like effect are the following text and references: 1 Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., sec. 13, p. 301; 3 Am. Jur., sec. 351, p. 96; 4 C. J. S., sec. 290 (4), p. 576; and Michie\u2019s Juris., Vol. 7, Evidence, sec. 55, p. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Plaintiff in error relies upon <em>Leppard </em>v. <em>Southern Ry. Co., </em>174 S. C. 237, 177 S. E. 129; <em>Windham </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>78 S. C. 187, 59 S. E. 852, and <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U. S. 96, 54 S. Ct. 22, 78 L. ed. 196. He insists that the declarations against interest made by Mabrey as admitted in evidence are hearsay insofar as he is concerned and the circumstances are such that their prejudicial effect could not be limited to the declarant alone but that they would in any event inure to the benefit of Pickering and Mead and thus be to plaintiff in error\u2019s prejudice. With this we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Had request been made that the statements be admitted solely for the specific and limited purpose of establishing Mabrey\u2019s negligence but not against the plaintiff or as tending to' exonerate, release or affect the liability, if any, of defendants in error, Pickering and Mead, the court could readily and properly so have instructed. In our opinion, when alleged joint tort feasors are sued together, the admissions against interest by any defendant are admissible at the instance of the plaintiff or at the instance of any co-defendant. However, upon request of plaintiff or of a defendant, the jury should be told of the limited and specific purposes for which it is received.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">No request was made to limit the effect and applicability of the admissions and under the facts of these cases and the circumstances arising upon the trial, we are of opinion that no error was committed by the court in admitting the evidence complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The judgments are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
