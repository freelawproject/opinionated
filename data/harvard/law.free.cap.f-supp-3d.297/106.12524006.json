MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (\"Commonwealth\"), a title insurance company, seeks judgment against defendants KCI Technologies, Inc. (\"KCI\") and Wiles Mensch Corp. (\"WMC\"), both of which conducted surveys of a particular plot of land in Washington, D.C. under service contracts with land developer Infrastructure Capital Group, LLC or its affiliate ICG 16th Street Associates, LLC (collectively \"ICG\" or \"Insured\"). Commonwealth alleges that, because both surveyors were negligent in conducting the land surveys upon which it relied in issuing\n   title insurance policies to ICG, the Defendants are liable for the payout it made under ICG's title claim seeking reimbursement for additional costs incurred as a result of the inaccurate surveys. The Defendants have filed separate motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. As jurisdiction and venue is proper in this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, related legal memoranda in opposition and in support, and the entire record therein, I find that the statute of limitations has run on the Plaintiff's claims. Accordingly, the Defendants' motions will be granted, and the Complaint will be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At issue in this case are four different land surveys conducted on the same plot of land between 2006 and 2014; two of which were conducted by KCI and two of which were conducted by WMC. In 2006, ICG purchased the land lot at 900 16th Street NW, Washington, D.C. for the purpose of constructing a new commercial office building. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7. ICG hired KCI to conduct and produce a land title survey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (\"KCI Professional Services Agreement\" dated June 22, 2006).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   KCI's 2006 survey did not identify any encroachment on the land, and contained a \"Surveyor's Certification\" that stated the survey was made in accordance with the \"Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B (\"KCI 2006 Survey\" signed April 10, 2007). Commonwealth alleges that it relied upon this survey to issue a title insurance policy to ICG (\"2007 Title Policy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2012, ICG hired WMC to conduct a Boundary, Topographic and Utility Survey (\"WMC 2012 Survey\") which identified a party wall that encroached on the property by two to three inches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. In May 2013, WMC re-conducted the same survey (\"WMC 2013 Survey\") and stated to ICG that the encroachment was four inches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. ICG subsequently again commissioned KCI to conduct an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey, which was issued in February 2014 (\"KCI 2014 Survey\") and identified no encroachment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-79. The survey included a certification similar to the one made in the KCI 2006 survey.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. H.

In order to construct the building as intended, ICG decided to demolish the encroachment, incurring $2,666,379 in demolition costs and payment of a partial delay penalty to the building's main tenant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 36. On September 17, 2014 and November 17, 2014, ICG tendered claims on the 2007 and 2014 title policies, respectively, to Commonwealth, which accepted coverage and\n   made a loss payment to ICG under the 2007 policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33-35; Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Opp. to WMC's Mot. to Dismiss (\"Opp. to WMC Mot. to Dismiss\") 2 n.1, ECF No. 13. Commonwealth claims that it incurred $1,042,025.31 due to the loss payment made to ICG and expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 23, 2017, Commonwealth brought suit against KCI and WMC, alleging seven causes of action. Certified Copy of Transfer Order and Docket Sheet (\"Superior Court Docket Sheet\"), ECF No. 10. Of the seven counts, one count is against WMC and six counts are against KCI. Compl. 7-12. As against WMC, Commonwealth alleges that, as the assignee of ICG's rights and claims, it is subrogated to all claims that ICG had against WMC (Count One).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Commonwealth seeks to recover ICG's costs of $2,666,379 for WMC's breach of contract for failing to take notice of a 12 inch encroachment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As against KCI, Commonwealth alleges that KCI's 2006 survey, in failing to notice a 12 inch encroachment on the property, was conducted negligently (Count Two) and negligently represented the true state of the property (Count Three).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-55. Commonwealth seeks judgment against KCI for $1,042,025.31, the amount incurred by Commonwealth as a result of its insuring and paying out a title claim to ICG.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commonwealth also alleges these same claims as pertaining to KCI's 2014 survey (Counts Five and Six) and seeks the same judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-74. Last, Commonwealth alleges that it is subrogated to all claims that ICG has against KCI by virtue of ICG's assignment of its rights and claims to Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 76. It makes breach of contract claims against KCI with respect to the 2006 and 2014 surveys (Counts Four and Seven, respectively).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-59, 75-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   KCI timely removed this matter to this Court; Not. of Removal, ECF No. 1; and both KCI and WMC have filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Code Ann. \u00a7 12-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) - (8). Because I find that Commonwealth did not bring suit until after the statute of limitations had run, and that D.C.'s \"discovery rule\" is inapplicable to the circumstances as alleged, Commonwealth's claims are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Statute of Limitations Has Run\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The statute of limitations begins to run \"from the time the right to maintain the action accrues.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    D.C.

Here, all of Commonwealth's claims-both in contract and in tort-focus on the alleged deficient performance of four land surveys: the KCI 2006 Survey, the WMC 2012 Survey, the WMC 2013 Survey, and the KCI 2014 Survey. In each of these cases, the alleged injury occurred when the surveying entity tendered survey reports that failed to notice a 12 inch encroachment on the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 45, 70. The statute of limitations, then, began to run upon the tendering of the survey results. This means the statute of limitations started running for the KCI 2006 Survey on July 12, 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. For the WMC 2012 Survey, the statute of limitations began running on December 2, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. For the WMC 2013 Survey, the clock started to tick on May 2, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Last, the KCI 2014 Survey was delivered on February 20, 2014, marking the start of the period during which suit related to that survey should have been brought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The Plaintiff's complaint was not filed until March 23, 2017, which is beyond the three-year period triggered by each survey-and in all but the last case, well beyond the three-year period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superior Court Docket Sheet. Consequently, all claims pertaining to the negligent performance of these surveys are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Discovery Rule Does Not Apply In This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Plaintiff, however, urges application of the \"discovery rule,\" which the D.C. Court of Appeals has applied in certain instances where an injury \"was not readily apparent and indeed might not become apparent for several years after the incident causing injury had occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Ehrenhaft v.

Clearly, this was not a lay homeowner seeking to build or renovate his own residence; this was a seasoned real estate developer seeking to build and profit commercially. The same is true of Commonwealth: rather than being a private citizen who may occasionally, or rarely, engage in these types of transactions, Commonwealth is in the business of regularly providing title insurance in connection with real estate transactions. The Plaintiff has not cited any authoritative\n   case law in which the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations for a plaintiff engaged in professional practice rather than being a lay person, and the apparent and notable lack of case law on this point militates against extending the rule to the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The second factor, the latency of the deficiency, does not save the Plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodruff,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7879204\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/722/#p727\">\n    524 A.2d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consequently, the relevant survey for which damages can be awarded is the KCI 2006 Survey. Assuming that the deficiency-the allegedly negligent performance of the survey-was latent, the Plaintiff was put on notice of the defect when the later surveys indicated that the KCI 2006 Survey was erroneous. For the KCI 2006 Survey, this means that its defect was revealed when the WMC 2012 Survey identified that there was, in fact, an encroachment on the property. Thus, even assuming that the deficiency was latent, this would not bring the Plaintiff's complaint within the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The third factor, the balance of the Plaintiff's interests against the prejudice to the Defendants, also weighs in favor of the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodruff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7879204\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/722/#p727\">\n    524 A.2d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Commonwealth was on notice of the alleged negligence of the KCI 2006 Survey by the time the WMC 2012 Survey was delivered in December 2012 (identifying a two to three inch encroachment), and in any event certainly by the time the WMC 2013 Survey was delivered in May 2013 (identifying a four inch encroachment). This means that, under the discovery rule, Commonwealth had until May 2016 at the very latest to bring suit relating to the KCI 2006 Survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although Commonwealth argues that it was the specific revelation of a 12 inch encroachment in March and September 2014 that led to the damages in this case, Opp. to KCI Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 2, this argument is unpersuasive. The facts pled show that ICG knew, via the WMC 2012 and 2013 surveys, that there was indeed an encroachment on the property that the KCI 2006 survey failed to identify. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19. The WMC 2013 survey in particular, which increased the size of the encroachment from two or three inches to four inches, indicated that prior surveys were unreliable in identifying and measuring the magnitude of the encroachment.
