MIDDLEBROOKS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE is before the Court on two Motions to Compel Arbitration filed by Defendants Fluent, LLC and Reward Zone USA, LLC (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The original complaint in this matter was filed on November 20, 2017. (DE 1). It named two Plaintiffs and alleged a putative class action for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Defendants filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration on January 12, 2018 (DE 22), and Plaintiffs subsequently filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint adding three additional Plaintiffs (DE 27). Thereafter, on January 22, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Response to the Motion to Compel Arbitration (DE 22), to which Defendant's replied on January 26, 2018 (DE 36). On February 6, 2018, Defendants filed a second Motion to Compel Arbitration, primarily addressing the new Plaintiffs named in the amended complaint. (DE 44). Plaintiffs filed their Response on February 20, 2018 (DE 52), to which Defendants replied on February 27, 2018 (DE 57). Upon full and careful consideration of the record, I find that Plaintiffs raise an issue of fact as to whether an arbitration agreement between the Parties exists, and therefore this matter will be set for further proceedings, as described more fully below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Reward Zone USA, LLC (\"Reward Zone\") and Fluent, LLC (\"Fluent\") work in concert with each other to acquire and sell phone numbers to their clients, who are online advertisers seeking to target prospective consumers with personalized ads. Reward Zone is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fluent, and both are run by the same manager. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9; DE 22-1 at 1). Reward Zone operates websites such as\n   <em>\n    www.consumerproductsusa.com\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    www.surveyvoicesreseach.com\n   </em>\n   , which offer prizes to consumers who enter information into the sites, including their phone numbers, and who consent to receiving texts and telemarketing calls to the phone numbers provided. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7; DE 22-1 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"send unsolicited text messages to consumers to drive them to their websites\" and then \"dupe consumers\" into providing information which Defendants sell as leads to telemarketing advertisers. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 6). Plaintiffs claim they received unsolicited text messages from Defendants directing them to lead generation websites operated by Reward Zone, or directing them to call a phone number operated by Fluent. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 58, 74, 88, 102-03). Plaintiffs state that they never provided Defendants with prior express written consent to be contacted. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 66, 79, 93, 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants move to compel arbitration, arguing that\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   receiving the alleged unsolicited texts, the Plaintiffs had each visited a Reward Zone lead generation website and opted to register and participate in Reward Zone's promotions. Participation in turn required Plaintiffs to consent and agree to various written Terms and Conditions, including a mandatory dispute resolution provision which required arbitration of \"any dispute\" involving Reward Zone or \"any aspect\" of the Terms and Conditions of the website and its promotions or incentives (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"). (DE 22 at 4-5; DE 44 at 4-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Arbitration Agreement also includes\n   a clause giving the arbitrator \"exclusive authority to resolve any dispute including any claim that all or any part of the Terms &amp; Conditions, including this provision, are unenforceable.\" (DE 22 at 13; DE 44 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of their motions, Defendants submit sworn statements from a Computer System Engineer at Fluent, and the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of Fluent and Reward Zone (DE nos. 22-1, 44-2, 36-1, 44-1). Defendants explain their registration process at length, and they attach documentation consisting of screenshots of each Reward Zone website where the Plaintiffs' phone numbers were purportedly entered, and where they checked a box online consenting to Terms and Conditions, including arbitration. (DE 22-1 at 5-6; DE 44 at 4-7, 9-10). Each screenshot also indicates that additional information was provided along with the Plaintiffs' phone numbers, such as birthdates, residential addresses, and email addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs respond with their own sworn declarations. (DE nos. 29-1, 29-2, 52-1, 52-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There appears to be no dispute that the phone numbers associated with the screenshots submitted by Defendants are numbers utilized by Plaintiffs. In the affidavits, however, Plaintiffs' contest the accuracy of the registration screenshots upon which Defendants rely. Plaintiffs state that they did not visit a Reward Zone website or fill out the registration form. In most instances, some or all of the additional information associated with Plaintiffs' phone numbers on these registration forms is not accurate, according to the Plaintiffs' declarations. Three of the Plaintiffs say the name on the registration form is not their name. All of them say the email addresses on the registration forms are not theirs. Various Plaintiffs point to inaccurate dates of birth, zip codes and home addresses as having been entered on the Defendants' screenshot registration forms. Plaintiffs further claim they never saw or agreed to Reward Zone's Terms and Conditions. They deny ever agreeing to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants assert that no bona fide user of a Reward Zone website would have any incentive to submit inaccurate personal information with their phone number, as this would defeat the purpose of opting into the promotions. Defendants suggest that misconduct is a more likely explanation for these discrepancies. (DE 44 at 18-19). Plaintiffs respond that Defendants' position and version of the facts is not credible, given that the original, unsolicited texts which Defendants sent to Plaintiffs contained hyperlinks back to the same lead generation websites where Defendants claim that Plaintiffs had\n   <em>\n    previously\n   </em>\n   registered their phone numbers. (DE 52 at 2). In this sense, Plaintiffs seem to argue that the discrepancies between the phone numbers and identifying information lend support to Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants violated the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In considering the instant Motion, the Court applies the federal substantive law of arbitrability, which applies to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawson v.

In determining whether to compel arbitration, the Court considers three factors: (1) whether a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists, (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists, and (3) whether the right to arbitrate was waived.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercury Telco Group, Inc. v.

Even in this age of internet commerce, traditional contract-based principles of offer and acceptance still guide the determination of whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bazemore v.

A Plaintiff can raise a genuine issue of fact regarding the validity of an arbitration agreement by (1) making an \"unequivocal denial that there was an agreement,\" and (2) producing evidence to \"substantiate the denial.\"\n   <em>\n    Schoendorf v.

Apr. 21, 2009) (citing\n   <em>\n    Chastain\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, once an agreement to arbitrate is put \"in issue,\" the Federal Arbitration Act provides that the court \"shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof\" and that \"[i]f no jury trial be demanded by the party alleged to be in default ... the court shall hear and determine such issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In reviewing a motion to compel arbitration, the Court applies \"a summary judgment-like standard,\" and \"may conclude as a matter of law that parties did or did not enter into an arbitration agreement only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact concerning the formation of such an agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Bazemore v.

Here, Plaintiffs submit signed and sworn declarations to meet their threshold burden. Plaintiffs' sworn denials are unequivocal in that they maintain that Plaintiffs did not visit Reward Zone lead generation websites on the occasions indicated in Defendants' screenshots; they did not complete the registration forms depicted in those screenshots (which would have opted them into participation in promotions); and they never agreed to the Terms and Conditions which Defendants assert bind them to arbitrate this dispute. Plaintiffs' denials place at issue\n   the existence of binding agreements to arbitrate, particularly when considered in conjunction with the curious circumstances under which their phone numbers came to be associated with other purportedly inaccurate personal data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Therefore, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this case will proceed summarily to trial on the question of whether each of the named Plaintiffs entered into Reward Zone's Arbitration Agreements.
