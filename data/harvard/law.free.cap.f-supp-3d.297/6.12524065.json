MOSS, United States District Judge\n   In this action, Plaintiffs Public Citizen, Inc., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (\"NRDC\"), and Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO (\"CWA\") challenge the lawfulness of Executive Order 13771, issued by President Trump on January 30, 2017, and two guidance documents issued by the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") implementing the Executive Order. Pending before the Court are the government's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 15, and Plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Executive Order imposes three new restrictions on the administrative process. It requires Executive Branch agencies to identify two existing regulations to be repealed for every new regulation, requires agencies to offset the private costs of compliance posed by new regulations by eliminating the costs associated with existing regulations, and imposes an annual regulatory cap (set at zero for 2017) on incremental regulatory costs that each agency may introduce. According to Plaintiffs, these requirements trammel on an array of federal statutes, all of which require federal agencies to consider statute-specific factors in deciding whether to promulgate or to repeal regulations, and none of which permits the implementing agencies-or the President-to premise those decisions on the adoption or repeal of other, unrelated regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before reaching the merits of Plaintiffs' challenge, however, the Court must first satisfy itself that it has Article III jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503308\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/83/#p94\">\n    523 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503308\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/83/#p94\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503308\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/83/#p94\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). As explained below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of plausibly alleging or proffering facts that, if accepted as true, would establish that they have standing to sue. Plaintiffs approach the standing requirement from multiple tacks. They seek to establish \"associational standing\" by identifying an array of regulatory actions that, they contend, the Executive Order will likely delay or preclude and by arguing that their members will suffer harm as a result. But, as to some of those regulatory actions, they fail to identify particular members who will be harmed. As to others, they fail to allege facts sufficient to show that the relevant agency would have issued the rule absent the Executive Order. And, as to yet others, they fail plausibly to allege or otherwise to show that any delay of the regulatory action attributable to the Executive Order will\n   <em>\n    substantially increase\n   </em>\n   the risk that any of their members will be harmed or that any of their members will face a\n   <em>\n    substantial probability\n   </em>\n   of harm once such an increase in risk is taken into account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485402,3563796\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1279/\">\n    489 F.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend that they have \"organizational standing\" to sue-that is, that they have standing to sue in their own right. They allege, in particular, that Executive Order 13771 has a chilling effect on their missions to encourage agencies to adopt regulations designed to protect public health and safety (Public Citizen), to protect the environment (NRDC), and to protect workers' rights (CWA). Plaintiffs assert that, as things now stand, if they contemplate proposing\n   a new rule, they must evaluate whether the cost of the new rule-the loss of two or more unknown existing rules-is worth the benefit of the new rule. The burden of merely considering the issue, however, is insufficient to establish organizational standing. And Plaintiffs do not assert that they have actually declined-or will actually decline-to pursue a new rule out of concern that the Executive Order will require the relevant agency to rescind two existing rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is not to say that a plaintiff-or, indeed, that the present Plaintiffs-will never be able to establish standing to challenge the Executive Order. On the present record, however, the Court must conclude that it lacks jurisdiction. The Court, accordingly, will grant the government's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 15, and will deny Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Executive Order 13771\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 30, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13771, entitled \" Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.\" Exec. Order No. 13771,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 9339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Executive Order imposes three new restrictions on the authority of agencies to adopt or to propose new regulations: the \"two for one\" requirement, an \"offset\" requirement, and an \"annual cap\" on the net costs of private compliance with covered regulations. Each of these requirements is discussed only briefly in the Executive Order, leaving it to the Director of OMB to flesh out the requirements-and exceptions-in guidance and in the course of implementing the Executive Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the \"two for one\" requirement, \"whenever an executive department or agency ... publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation,\" the agency must \"identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.\" Exec. Order No. 13771 \u00a7 2(a). This requirement works in tandem with the \"offset\" requirement, which requires agencies to offset \"any new incremental cost associated with new regulations\" by eliminating \"existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c). Finally, the \"annual cap\" provision works in the aggregate and prohibits agencies from adopting new regulations that exceed their \"total incremental cost allowance\" for the year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(d). This cap, or total incremental cost allowance, is based on the costs of any new regulations adopted in the relevant year, less any cost savings achieved through the repeal of existing regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The cap was set at zero for fiscal year 2017,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(b), and must be reset every year by the Director of OMB,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(d). The total cost allowance for the fiscal year may be zero, positive (i.e., permitting a net increase in total regulatory costs), or negative (i.e., requiring a net reduction in overall regulatory costs).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For 2018, the caps vary by agency from zero to negative $196 million in annualized costs.

Similar provisos appear\n   within particular provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(a) (two-for-one requirement applies \"[u]nless prohibited by law\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c) (offset requirement applies \"to the extent permitted by law\" and any elimination of costs must comport \"with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law\"). The Executive Order also exempts certain types of regulations and authorizes the OMB Director to exempt other \"categor[ies] of regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. OMB Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   OMB issued interim guidance on February 2, 2017, and followed up with final guidance on April 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget, Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017 (2017) [hereinafter Interim Guidance]; Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget, Guidance Implementing Executive Order 13771 (2017) [hereinafter Final Guidance]. Several important clarifications and refinements are set forth in these guidance documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, the Executive Order does not apply to all regulatory actions, but only to \"significant regulatory action[s]\" and \"significant guidance document[s].\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 2. A regulatory action or guidance document is \"significant\" if it is likely to \"[h]ave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more\" or to meet other criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exec. Order No. 12866 \u00a7 3(f), 3 C.F.R. 638 (1994). A \"deregulatory action,\" in contrast, is \"an action\" that \"has been finalized\" and the \"total costs\" of which are \"less than zero.\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 4. Deregulatory actions need not qualify as \"significant\" and thus take a \"wide[r] range\" of forms than regulatory actions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, unlike prior executive orders,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order No. 12866, Executive Order 13771 focuses only on compliance costs borne by regulated parties, without regard to the public benefit of the existing or proposed rule. Accordingly, a regulation that imposes $100 million in costs, but that saves $1 billion in losses, is not treated as generating a net savings of $900 million; rather, its adoption would be treated as a $100 million cost, and its repeal would count as $100 million in savings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 21, 32; Interim Guidance at 4. The guidance provides additional details on accounting. In calculating costs and savings for purposes of the Executive Order, agencies are required to determine the present value of the costs or savings of the regulatory action (or deregulatory action) \"over the full duration of the expected effects of the action.\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 25. An agency's \"total incremental cost\" for a fiscal year \"means the sum of all costs from\" significant regulatory actions and guidance documents \"minus the cost savings from ... deregulatory actions.\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, the Executive Order recognizes that certain federal statutes prohibit agencies\n   from considering costs in determining whether a significant regulatory action is warranted. With respect to those regulatory actions, the OMB guidance acknowledges that the Executive Order cannot-and does not-\"change the agency's obligations under [such a] statute.\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 18. But, even though agencies are not permitted to consider costs in deciding whether to promulgate these regulations, they are still \"generally ... required to offset the costs of such regulatory actions through other deregulatory actions taken pursuant to statutes that do not prohibit consideration of costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, if an agency faces an imminent statutory or judicial deadline for taking a regulatory action, the Executive Order \"does not prevent\" the agency from taking the regulatory action in a timely manner, even if it cannot first satisfy the requirements of the Executive Order. Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 33. The agency must, however, \"offset [the] regulatory action[ ] as soon as practicable thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth, agencies are permitted to \"bank\" cost savings and deregulatory actions \"for use in the same or a subsequent fiscal year\" to offset significant regulatory actions or guidance documents and to meet their \"total incremental cost allowance[s].\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 29. An agency that, for example, takes four deregulatory actions in fiscal year 1 may take two covered regulatory actions in year 1 or in future fiscal years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Similarly, if an agency issues two ... deregulatory actions with total cost savings of $200 million,\" and issues a \"regulatory action with a cost of $150 million\" in fiscal year 1, \"the agency may bank the surplus cost savings of $50 million to offset the costs of another ... regulatory action\" in a future fiscal year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"To the extent practicable,\" however, agencies must take any required offsetting \"deregulatory actions before or concurrently with the ... regulatory actions they are intended to offset.\" Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, as counsel for the government acknowledged at oral argument, neither the Executive Order nor the OMB guidance provides a clear mechanism for notifying members of the public whether and when a proposed (or possible) regulatory action might be delayed or abandoned due to the requirements of the Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 56 at 64 (Tr. Oral Arg. 64:7-22) (\"I suspect [that information on delayed or abandoned regulatory actions] will not be public.\"). With respect to deregulatory actions, the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions should \"include, to the extent practicable, ... deregulatory actions that ... are sufficient to offset [any] regulatory actions\" subject to the Executive Order. Final Guidance, Q &amp; A 37. And when a regulatory action is allowed under the Executive Order, the Federal Register notice must indicate that the action is subject to the Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But that Federal Register notice need not identify the required \"offsetting ... deregulatory actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, although the Executive Order requires that agencies identify offsetting deregulatory actions as a condition of taking new regulatory actions, the OMB guidance precludes agencies from relying on the Executive Order \"as the basis or rationale, in whole or in part, for\" taking the deregulatory action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%209339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, neither the Executive Order nor the OMB guidance provides a mechanism for notifying interested parties that an otherwise desirable regulation is being delayed or withheld in order to comply with the Executive Order or that a deregulatory action was initiated in order to comply with the Executive Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiffs, however, have not identified any proposed rule or other specific putative regulatory action that might address Winegrad's concerns. As a result, the Court cannot determine whether any identifiable regulatory action has been-or likely will be-delayed due to the Executive Order and, if so, how that delay might have affected Winegrad. Any injury allegedly stemming from the prospect that the Executive Order has delayed the issuance of unspecified regulations relating to a broadly defined area of concern is too abstract and speculative to support standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs rely on a citizen petition in which Public Citizen asked the FDA to \"withdraw approval of the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock and poultry.\" Dkt. 16-3 at 5-6 (R.

Public Citizen member Dr. Anthony So, a physician, attests that \"the use of antibiotics in animal feed increases [his] risk of infection and lowers the effectiveness of available treatments for infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\" Dkt. 16-8 at 2-3 (So Decl. \u00b6 7). Public Citizen member Terri Weissman shares that concern, averring that she and her children \"would benefit directly\" if the FDA granted Public Citizen's petition. Dkt. 16-10 at 2-3 (T. Weissman Decl. \u00b6 6). Plaintiffs, however, have not alleged or provided any evidence that the FDA ever intended to grant or seriously considered granting the petition. Plaintiffs jump over this antecedent question, arguing instead that delay is inevitable. Delay, however, is possible only if the FDA was otherwise inclined to withdraw its approval for the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock and poultry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs contend that OSHA \"is developing a standard to protect healthcare employees and employees in other high-risk environments from exposure to dangerous pathogens\" and that the Executive Order \"will necessarily delay issuance of [any such] new health or safety standards.\" Dkt. 47 at 21-22. Unlike the prior two examples, Plaintiffs' complaint and other submissions suggest that OSHA was poised to take this regulatory action prior to issuance of the Executive Order. Their complaint alleges that OSHA was in the process of developing the infectious disease standard and that the agency anticipated issuing a proposed rule in October\n   2017. Dkt. 14 at 23 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 78). Public records, moreover, support that allegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2010, OSHA issued a request for information \"on occupational exposure to infectious agents in settings where healthcare is provided ... and [in other] healthcare-related settings.\" Request for Information on Infectious Diseases,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C835\">\n    75 Fed. Reg. 24,835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24,835 (May 6, 2010). After reviewing the comments, meeting with stakeholders, and completing a Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act review, OSHA announced in the spring of 2016 that it was \"developing a standard to ensure that employers establish ... comprehensive infection control program[s] and control measures to protect employees from ... exposure[ ] to pathogens that can cause significant disease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Spring 2016 Agenda. At that time, OSHA anticipated that it would issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NPRM\") in March 2017,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C835\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , although the agency subsequently pushed this date back to October 2017, Fall 2016 Agenda. After Executive Order 13771 issued, however, the infectious disease standard was moved to the \"Long-Term Actions\" section of the Unified Agenda, Spring 2017 Agenda, where it remains, Fall 2017 Agenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It is not obvious what follows from these facts and allegations, and neither party has briefed the issue. On one hand, there is evidence that OSHA intended to issue an NPRM (and, presumably, eventually a final rule) before the Executive Order was issued. On the other hand, the rulemaking process is inherently inchoate until an agency issues an NPRM, which then serves as a benchmark for agency action and triggers the requirement that the agency offer a reasoned explanation if it ultimately decides not to go forward as proposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams Nat'l Gas Co. v.

Although undoubtedly costly, NHTSA's proposed rule on V2V communications technology illustrates the obstacle posed by the Executive Order. The proposed rule would \"require all new light vehicles to be capable of [V2V] communications, such that they [can] send and receive Basic Safety Messages to and from other vehicles.\" V2V Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. at 3854. When it proposed the rule, NHTSA asserted that V2V technology \"has the potential to revolutionize motor vehicle safety ... [and to] reduce the number and severity of motor vehicle crashes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3855. The agency estimated that the proposed rule would, on an annual basis, save $54.7 to $73.9 billion,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3996, while costing $2.2 to $5 billion,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3981. Under the Executive Order, however, only the costs are relevant. As noted above, the sum of the annual cost savings generated by\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   deregulatory actions across\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   agencies in the eight months from the end of January (when the Executive Order issued) through the end of September (when the fiscal year ended) tallied only $570 million.\n   <em>\n    See Two-for-One Report\n   </em>\n   at 1. At that rate, agencies would have achieved $855 million in cost savings had the Executive Order been in effect for a full year. Comparing the estimated costs of the V2V rule ($2.2 to $5 billion annually) with the estimated cost savings from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   deregulatory actions taken in one fiscal year ($855 million annually) suggests that it would take the Executive Branch as a whole\n   <em>\n    two or three years\n   </em>\n   to accumulate cost savings sufficient to offset even the most conservative estimated cost of the V2V rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The time needed to accumulate the necessary cost savings would grow by an order of magnitude, moreover, if the Department of Transportation were left to fend for itself: at its current rate of cutting costs, the Department would need almost seven decades to offset the costs of the V2V rule.\n   <em>\n    See Two-for-One Report\n   </em>\n   at 2 (noting that the Department generated $21.8 million in annual cost savings in the final eight months of fiscal year 2017, which equates to $32.7 million if the Executive Order had been in effect for a full fiscal year).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Although this may be an extreme example, it shows that the Executive Order meaningfully restricts agencies' latitude to issue rules and, absent waivers, is likely to delay \"significant regulatory actions.\" Nor is the Court convinced that the authority of the Director of OMB to grant waivers adequately answers this concern. To be sure, that authority does introduce some uncertainty, but, at least to date, there is no indication that the Director has exercised his waiver authority with respect to the six regulatory actions Plaintiffs have identified, none of which has moved forward since the Executive Order took effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   One might reasonably argue that Plaintiffs can only speculate that the delay in issuance of the identified rules has been caused by the Executive Order. It is conceivable, for example, that the delay stems from greater scrutiny of regulatory action or skepticism that the federal government should try to fix every problem. That, however, is not what the government has said. No one has said, for example, that the V2V rule is a bad idea or that it is too costly. Executive Order 13771, in contrast, speaks directly to the issue and says that agencies may not take new regulatory actions without first identifying deregulatory actions sufficient to offset the relevant cost. Exec. Order No. 13771 \u00a7 2(c).

Indeed, they say nothing about\n   whether the school bus that Fleming's son currently rides weighs 26,000 pounds or more (which would trigger application of the proposed speed-limiting device requirement), or whether there is any basis to believe that without the device, her son's bus driver is likely to drive at an excessive or dangerous speed.

Robert Weissman, the President of Public Citizen, attests that the Executive Order\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   forc[es] Public Citizen to choose between urging agencies to adopt new regulations, which would trigger the requirement to repeal existing regulatory safeguards, or refraining from advocating\n   for new public protections to avoid triggering the need to repeal existing ones.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Dkt. 16-3 at 4 (R.

Andrew Wetzler, NRDC's Deputy Chief Program Officer, attests that \"NRDC does not know what deregulatory actions an agency will take if NRDC's advocacy for a new rule is successful\" and that, as a result, it cannot determine \"whether its advocacy might end up doing more harm than good to health and the environment.\" Dkt. 16-4 at 6 (Wetzler Decl. \u00b6 11). This conundrum, Wetzler adds, transforms NRDC's \"constitutionally protected\" right to petition the government or to sue an agency to compel action \"into a game of regulatory Russian roulette.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Wetzler Decl. \u00b6 11).

According to Plaintiffs, a chill of that type is distinguishable from the chill in\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   . They assert that their underlying fear, unlike the fear of surveillance in\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   , is not \"speculative\" or subjective;\" rather, they assert, their concern about causing the repeal of beneficial regulations \"necessarily\" flows from the Executive Order.

The Court is not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The principal takeaway from\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   is that plaintiffs may not turn an unduly speculative or hypothetical injury into a concrete injury \"by inflicting harm\n   on themselves based on their fears of [the] hypothetical future harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   , allowing plaintiffs to do so would nullify the causation requirement. Yet, Plaintiffs' argument for causation tracks the theory that the Supreme Court rejected in\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   . Assuming that Plaintiffs encouraged an agency to take some regulatory action, one could only speculate about whether the relevant agency would agree to issue the rule, about which rules might be repealed in response, about whether those rules would not have otherwise been repealed, and about whether an identifiable member of one of the plaintiff-associations would suffer a cognizable injury-in-fact as a result. And because this theory of harm is too uncertain to support standing, Plaintiffs' self-inflicted injury-sustained in order to avoid that speculative harm-must also fail.\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   's teaching is clear: Plaintiffs cannot establish standing by chilling their own advocacy based on \"their fears of [a] hypothetical future harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that the chill at issue here is particularly troublesome because it implicates their First Amendment right to petition government.

Tatum\n   </em>\n   , both of which also involved First Amendment activities.
