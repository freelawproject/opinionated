The verified amended complaint includes wide-ranging allegations, and plaintiffs contend a variety of federal and state laws support their case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   All defendants filed motions to dismiss. Defendant Jared Eldridge (\"Judge Eldridge\"), a Utah state court judge, submitted a motion to dismiss based on Rules 12(b)(1), (4) &amp; (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Docket 39). Defendant American National Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. (\"ANPC\") moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). (Docket 41). Defendants Boardwalk Property Management Company, Kevin West, Austin Cales, David Park, Lehi Oassi LLC, Robert J. Poulsen and Poulsen &amp; Skousen (\"Boardwalk defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss based on Rules 12(b)(2) &amp; (6). (Docket 43). Defendant Larry Deiter, Director for the South Dakota Division of Insurance, (\"Director Deiter\"), moved to dismiss the claims against him via Rules 12(b)(1) &amp; (6). (Docket 72).
