Besser, and Donald Besser (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a complaint in this District along with an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   application for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"). In their complaint, Plaintiffs claimed that they had been misled in their purchase of securities in Echo Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Echo\"); they laid blame for that deception at the feet of three individuals associated with Echo-cousins Michael and Shepard Goldberg and Michael's son Alec (together with Echo, the \"Echo Defendants\")-as well as the hedge fund Platinum Management (NY) LLC (\"Platinum Management\"), its co-owners Mark Nordlicht and Bernard Fuchs (with Platinum Management, the \"Platinum Defendants\"), and a Chinese company, Medical Technologies Innovation Asia, Ltd. (\"MTIA\") (with the Echo and Platinum Defendants, \"Defendants\"). In their request for injunctive relief, Plaintiffs claimed that a contemplated transaction between Echo and MTIA that was scheduled to close imminently would result in the improper expropriation to China of Echo's intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court granted the application for a TRO and, after expedited discovery, convened a two-day-long hearing (the \"Hearing\") on Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on December 8 and 9, 2016. After concluding, on the concededly incomplete record before it, that Plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion. Ten days later, before Defendants responded to the complaint, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Echo Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' lawsuit was a precipitous-indeed, vexatious-action, whose ruinous consequences cannot be remedied merely by its dismissal. In consequence, the Echo Defendants seek sanctions under the mandatory review provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(c)(1), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Court's inherent power. The Court understands Echo's frustrations, but cannot find on this record that the lawsuit was either frivolous or vexatious. Accordingly, and as detailed in the remainder of this Opinion, the Court denies the Echo Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because this motion focuses on Plaintiffs' conduct in this litigation, the Court\n   will address only briefly the parties' interactions before November 29, 2016. Echo is a medical device company that focuses on non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring (\"CGM\") and associated technologies. (Compl. \u00b6 1). In or about December 2013, Echo entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (the \"Licensing Agreement\") with MTIA, pursuant to which Echo granted MTIA rights to develop, manufacture, market and distribute Echo's CGM system in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To a degree disputed vigorously by the parties, the Licensing Agreement permitted transfer of certain of Echo's intellectual property to MTIA, though Echo retained ownership over such property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in December 2013, Echo and several Platinum-related entities entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \"SPA\") for the purchase of more than 1.8 million shares of Echo stock. (Compl. \u00b6 21). Platinum obtained a seat on Echo's Board of Directors, and nominated Dr. Michael Goldberg, who later became Board Chairman in February 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24 n.7). Michael's cousin Shepard Goldberg was elected to the Board in June 2014 after a contentious proxy fight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In September and December of 2014, various Platinum-related entities infused cash into Echo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2016, NASDAQ initiated procedures to delist Echo; stated reasons included the failure to meet stockholders' equity requirements and the failure to hold an annual stockholders' meeting. (Compl. \u00b6 43). In that month, and then again in May 2016, Plaintiffs purchased a total of $800,000 of Echo's 10% senior secured convertible notes (the \"Notes\") through a Confidential Private Placement Memorandum (the \"PPM\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11-13). As a result of their purchases, Plaintiffs obtained \"a security interest in the assets of Echo, including, but not limited to, Echo's intellectual property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs observe that various Platinum-related entities were subject to civil and criminal investigations and/or litigation in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-10, 45-46). This turmoil, it is alleged, then spread to Echo: \"Since in or about July 2016 to date, Echo has been in a state of constant and acute financial distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). Echo's\n   alleged reactions to this distress resulted in Plaintiffs' lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Complaint and the TRO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on November 29, 2016. The key factual assertions were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As set forth herein, the Platinum Defendants, Echo, Michael Goldberg (\"M. Goldberg\") and Shepard Goldberg (''S. Goldberg\") made material misrepresentations and/or omissions in connection with Echo's offer and sale of $6,000,000 of 10% senior secured convertible notes (the \"Notes\"), of which Plaintiffs purchased $800,000. These misrepresentations and/or omissions occurred through the means of a Confidential Private Placement Memorandum (\"PPM\"). In the PPM, Defendants intentionally and carefully concealed that Echo's business and board of directors were under the direct and absolute control of the Platinum Defendants in violation of Federal Securities Laws. Through the Platinum Defendants' undisclosed dominion over Echo, the Defendants have and continue to plunder Echo's trade secrets, including its state-of-the-art CGM technology in violation of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (as amended by the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Goldberg Defendants, in their positions of control over Echo's board of directors, have ensured that the Platinum Defendants' instructions to plunder the assets of Echo were carried out. To this day, the Platinum Defendants, both directly and through the Goldberg Defendants, are proceeding to plunder Echo's trade secrets by providing them to Defendant Medical Technologies Innovation Asia, Ltd. (\"MTIA\"), which has substantial ties to the Platinum Defendants and the Goldberg Defendants, the full extent of which is not yet known.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5). The Complaint alleged ten causes of action, including, as relevant here, claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 116-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Concurrent with the Complaint, Plaintiffs filed an application for a temporary restraining order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TRO application focused in particular on the possibility that Echo CGM technology-in which Plaintiffs, by dint of their investment, had an interest-was being improperly transferred out of Echo's control and into MTIA's for little or no consideration. In support of the application, Plaintiffs included a sworn statement from Thomas Bishop, who had only a few days earlier left Echo as its Vice President of Operations and Product Development. (Bishop PI Decl.). Bishop began his affidavit with a primer on Echo and its CGM technology, including his estimate that \"[s]ince 2007, ... Echo has invested, at least, one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in CGM technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). He then recounted a lengthy history of his interactions with representatives of both Platinum-related entities and MTIA; Bishop contended that Echo had striven\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to provide certain source code and algorithms to MTIA, reasoning that such material was outside\n   of the scope of the Licensing Agreement, but that certain individuals had provided such information, and contemplated providing additional information, to MTIA for no additional compensation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 12-21, 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at \u00b6 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is my belief that the Licensing Agreement is a mechanism by which Platinum Partners, the Goldberg Defendants and MTIA are attempting to transfer, for little to no cost to MTIA, Echo's intellectual property that was developed at a cost of over $100,000,000. The Licensing Agreement did not provide MTIA with the right to take full access to Echo's intellectual property[.]\") ). Bishop coupled his IP concerns (which, he claims, were shared throughout Echo's R &amp; D team) with concerns that \"Platinum Partners, through M. Goldberg's long association with the company, may have controlled Echo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at \u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that severance package for outgoing Echo CEO Scott Hollander \"upset everyone in Echo's R &amp; D team ... because it appeared that Hollander agreed to transfer [Echo intellectual property] to MTIA for consideration of the Goldbergs agreeing to pay Hollander $420,000 in severance\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff James Besser built on these twin concerns in his own supporting affidavit. (Besser PI Decl.). After recounting Plaintiffs' investments in Echo, Besser catalogued several putative misstatements and material omissions that, he claimed, made clear that \"Platinum had and exercised complete control and domination over Echo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at \u00b6 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiff[s] would never have purchased the Notes and agreed to Platinum being the Collateral Agent had Plaintiffs known that Platinum (and its officers) were the undisclosed principals of Echo or had Plaintiffs known the material and ongoing connections between M. Goldberg and Platinum, none of which were disclosed in the PPM\") ). Besser also described financing offers that Plaintiffs had made to Echo that, as Besser explained, were \"far superior to that offered by MTIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at \u00b6 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"no legitimate business purpose\" in threat to \"shutter\" Echo rather than accept financing from Plaintiffs) ). These dealings caused Besser to conclude that \"purloining Echo's intellectual property rights out from under Echo and to MTIA is the goal behind Platinum, M. Goldberg, S. Goldberg, and MTIA's conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24) ). Finally, Besser explained the need for emergent relief: After appearing to settle its disputes with Plaintiffs in October 2016, Echo unexpectedly changed course without giving the contractually-required notice and entered into an amendment with MTIA to the Licensing Agreement-one that Plaintiffs believed violated the terms of the Notes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court issued a TRO that same day, and set a hearing on Plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion for December 8, 2016. (Dkt. # 3). The Court also ordered limited discovery on an expedited basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thereafter, Plaintiffs moved for alternate service on MTIA; the Court denied the first application without prejudice, and granted the second application on December 6, 2016, two days before the scheduled hearing. (Dkt. # 4-7, 13-15, 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also on December 6, the Court received opposition papers from the Echo Defendants. (Dkt. # 21-22). At the end of the day, the Court held a telephonic conference with counsel for Plaintiffs and counsel for certain of the Platinum Defendants. (Dkt. # 30). Counsel for Mark Nordlicht protested the late deposition notice received by his client, citing questions of fairness and undue burden. Counsel suggested\n   that the burden was particularly acute for Nordlicht because, in the Court's parlance, he \"ha[d] no horse in the TRO race,\" and that indifference evidenced \"the degree of control or interest he ha[d] in these matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Plaintiffs' counsel responded, however, that Plaintiffs had an interest in Nordlicht's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [W]e believe Mr. Nordlicht has information and evidence that would help us establish that burden [of proving entitlement to continued injunctive relief], because frankly we believe there is a relationship, a strong relationship of him being an undisclosed principal and Platinum being an undisclosed principal, of Mr. Fuchs being an undisclosed principal, and the information we want from Mr. Nordlicht goes directly to that issue, and we think we can establish that on a preliminary injunction basis, which would support the entirety of the preliminary injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). After hearing from the parties, the Court permitted Plaintiffs two hours of deposition testimony from Nordlicht. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Preliminary Injunction Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The hearing on Plaintiffs' application for a preliminary injunction began on December 8, 2016. In attendance were counsel for, and representatives of, Plaintiffs and the Echo Defendants, and counsel for Mark Nordlicht. No representative of MTIA was present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court heard brief introductory statements from the parties. (Tr. 6-9). Plaintiffs then called six witnesses, beginning with Thomas Bishop, the former Echo VP of Operations and Product Development. Bishop hewed largely to the factual assertions he had made in his affidavit, and offered interpretations of the Licensing Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"So I believe that the [Licensing Agreement] gave MTIA the ability to manufacture the product and distribute the product, to use it and to further its development, but it did not include the specific intellectual property that was owned by Echo; in particular, the algorithms that were developed by Echo that allowed the signal to be effectively processed.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at 77-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing bases for concern that Echo would lose control over its intellectual property to MTIA) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On cross-examination, Bishop was provided with a copy of the Licensing Agreement, and was directed to the definition of Echo \"know-how\"-which, in contrast to Bishop's earlier testimony, included Echo algorithms. (Tr. 51-57).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bishop was also asked, among other topics, about his understanding of the royalty rates for MTIA's use of Echo intellectual property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-65). And defense counsel sought Bishop's acknowledgment that the Licensing Agreement only restricted Echo's ability to develop its intellectual property in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The next witness was former Echo CEO Scott Hollander. Hollander discussed his interactions with various Platinum representatives, including Bernard Fuchs and Alice Chen, and with Bai Ge of MTIA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 90-98). Hollander also discussed various efforts, most of which were unsuccessful, to obtain financing for Echo in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103-12). Current CEO Alan Schoenbart then testified about the Licensing Agreement (in particular, its viability\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   in late 2016), and his dealings with MTIA and Platinum. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at 125-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Schoenbart also pushed back on Plaintiffs' argument that their offer was superior to MTIA's, and opined that a principal stumbling block to Echo's ability to obtain necessary financing was Plaintiff James Besser:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   There [were] just a lot of complex issues, and the investors weren't-the investors, the main investor that wasn't agreeing to this was Mr. Besser, and we couldn't move forward with our financing. So we did the bridge in September and tried to, you know, work through the complexities until it became that the complexities weren't going to get worked out, and Mr. Besser sent a letter, like cease and desist letter, and here is my terms or something like that, or he had sent terms, and he was upset we didn't accept his terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141). On cross-examination, Schoenbart related that he had no concerns that MTIA would act beyond its authority under the Licensing Agreement, or that the Platinum Defendants would misappropriate Echo's technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 165-66).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs called both Mr. Shepard Goldberg and Dr. Michael Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg discussed, among other things, conversations with James Besser concerning the latter's \"wish to participate, his wish to stop the Chinese partnership from investing.\" (Tr. 187). Mr. Goldberg was also shown numerous emails, including emails from Platinum representatives such as Mark Nordlicht. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at 197-202, 204-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). For his part, Dr. Goldberg was questioned about the PPM, including restrictions on Echo's participation in future financing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 215-19). He was also questioned about his prior affiliation with, and interactions with representatives of, Platinum-related entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219-22). Plaintiffs' counsel and Echo's counsel pressed Dr. Goldberg about the ostensible failure of MTIA to comply with its obligations under the SPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223-30, 244-45). And Dr. Goldberg testified about the competing finance proposals presented to Echo in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231-34, 236-41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at 251-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The final witness was Plaintiff James Besser. Early in his testimony, Besser discussed the due diligence he undertook preliminary to Plaintiffs' investment in Echo. Commenting on snippets of information concerning Echo that had come out in the testimony of other witnesses, Besser testified that he would not have invested in Echo had he known the information. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 264 (\"If, based on the descriptions that I have heard here today, if the meetings [involving Fuchs, Chen, Echo, and MTIA personnel] were related to the developmental milestones and the intimate details of the product, that's far beyond any kind of involvement that I have ever had with a company.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"What I'm objecting to is a pattern of heavy investment in the day-to-day operation and research activities of the company by affiliates of a significant investor who appeared to only own 9.9 percent of the voting stock of the company.\") ).

On cross-examination, among other things, Besser acknowledged that he had not read,\n   or had not read with care, certain Echo documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 284-89, 297-98, 300-01).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The next day, December 9, 2016, the Court conducted oral argument on Plaintiffs' motion. During the Court's questioning, Plaintiffs' counsel commented on the absence of evidence regarding the Platinum Defendants and MTIA, and went so far as to request an adverse inference from the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Your Honor, that would have been very helpful with respect to presenting evidence on that issue had Mr. Fuchs shown up for his deposition, produced documents pursuant to the order. Had he shown up at yesterday's hearing, it would have been helpful and if MTIA showed up or actually contacted me at all with respect to producing documents or making themselves available even if it was telephonically for a deposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   He never contacted me with respect to asking for an extension [at] any point in time. We know MTIA has access to a significant amount of funds, just to the investments they made. We know [MTIA] and Mr. Bai Ge came to the United States on multiple occasions and we know he has some proficiency in English. They never made any attempt to contact us, MTIA or Mr. Fuchs. I can assure you that would have been a central focus of this discovery and certainly my questions yesterday on that issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to Mr. Fuchs and MTIA's failure to show, I think that would have provided significant additional evidence with respect to the relationship with Platinum. That failure to show and that failure to produce documents, I believe an adverse inference can be made with respect to how Platinum controlled Echo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Tr. 338-39, 341).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court heard brief closing arguments from the parties, and adjourned for several hours before rendering an oral decision denying the motion. The Court began, appropriately, by complimenting the parties for their efforts in such a compressed time frame and by explaining its decision to credit the testimony of the various witnesses. (Tr. 380-81). It then addressed, and denied, Plaintiffs' request for an adverse inference, though it recognized the reasons why Plaintiffs' evidentiary record was incomplete. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 381-82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court then proceeded to consider the standard for preliminary injunctive relief and found that Plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden, beginning with the requirement of irreparable harm. The Court found that, at the time they sought the TRO, Plaintiffs had misperceived that \"a consummation of Amendment No. 2 would\n   result in the expropriation of Echo's intellectual property to China with the attendant loss of control over that property and the possible shutting down of Echo's U.S. operations.\" (Tr. 384). The Court found, to the contrary, that witnesses on both sides were keen to preserve the long-term viability of Echo, and that \"this dispute really does boil down to a very stark difference of opinion about the best way to keep Echo afloat and to get this concededly beneficial technology to market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 384-85). It also found that Plaintiffs' arguments on irreparable harm proceeded from a \"misunderstanding of Echo's and MTIA's financing and licensing obligations,\" which it then proceeded to review with the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 386).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court also found that Plaintiffs had failed to prove a likelihood of success on the merits, although it clarified the scope of its holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   There were 10 claims for relief in the complaint, but through today's conversation, I understand that three bases in particular are being proffered for injunctive relief: The misappropriation claim; the securities fraud claim; and the breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Let me be clear. The fact I am finding ultimately the plaintiffs have not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant the injunctive relief they seek is not tantamount to a ruling that their complaint lacks merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Tr. 387-88). With particular respect to Plaintiffs' securities fraud claims, the Court found that \"[P]laintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success of their argument that the business decisions of which plaintiffs now complain are the product of anything other than the business judgment of the officers and directors of Echo, faced with some rather trying financial circumstances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Reviewing the other factors, the Court found that the balance of hardships favored Defendants, citing Echo's precarious financial condition. (Tr. 396-97). Finally, the Court found that the public interest factor played \"the least prominent role in my calculus.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 397). For all of these reasons, the Court dissolved the temporary restraining order, and left for another day the scheduling of defense responses to the Complaint. After staying enforcement of its decision to permit Plaintiffs to consider an emergency appeal to the Second Circuit, the Court entered an order in line with its oral decision on December 12, 2016. (Dkt. # 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Dismissal and the Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On December 15, 2016, the Echo Defendants submitted a letter requesting a pre-motion conference on their contemplated motion to dismiss. (Dkt. # 32). Counsel for Bernard Fuchs submitted a similar letter four days later. (Dkt. # 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On December 19, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i). (Dkt. # 36-38). Three days later, on December 22, 2016, counsel for the Echo Defendants sought a pre-motion conference with the Court to address their belief that a mandatory sanctions inquiry was warranted under the PSLRA and Rule 11. (Dkt. # 39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 40 (Plaintiffs' response) ). A conference on the matter was held on January 10, 2017. (Dkt. # 50 (transcript) ). At that time, counsel for the Echo Defendants previewed the bases for their motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   I would not be making an application under Rule 11. I would be making an application under the inherent authority of the Court to review whether actions brought before it are brought in bad faith or vexatious or brought with a proper purpose; and, if not, I think the Court does have that inherent power. I\n   also believe that the Court has the power to award sanctions under Section 1927 where an action that lacks a colorable position is asserted again for vexatious or improper purposes. So, basically, there are three prongs to the request for sanctions: the inherent power, Section 1927, and the PSLRA requirement to consider whether an action that asserts a securities law violation, whether that action was brought in accordance with the proper standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Echo Defendants filed their motion papers and supporting declarations on March 6, 2017. (Dkt. # 56-59). Plaintiffs filed their opposition submissions on April 5, 2017. (Dkt. # 60-62). The Echo Defendants filed a reply brief on April 19, 2017 (Dkt. # 63), and a supplemental letter brief on October 11, 2017 (Dkt. # 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

What keeps Section 78u-4(c) from being a strict liability standard is the inclusion of a final adjudication requirement. However defined, that term means something other than a voluntary dismissal of a complaint without prejudice a mere twenty days after its filing, even coupled with a request for injunctive relief. And this case makes plain why Judge Cote's reasoning is correct: Plaintiffs filed a ten-count complaint, of which three involved claims of securities fraud, along with a request for emergent relief; the Court granted the request, ordered expedited discovery, and then held a two-day hearing on the propriety of continuing the injunctive relief. The Court's decision to dissolve the injunction was, as the parties are well aware, based on the stringent standards for injunctive relief. (Tr. 383-84). These standards, as the parties are also well aware, require the Court to consider not the adequacy of a plaintiff's pleadings, but rather the\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs presented in support of their requested relief. The Court found simply that that evidence was insufficient. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 388 (\"Let me be clear. The fact I am finding ultimately the plaintiffs have not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant the injunctive relief they seek is not tantamount to a ruling that their complaint lacks merit.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 393 (\"What I mean is I'm finding insufficient evidence from the plaintiffs of materiality and scienter.\") ). It was not\n   asked, and did not opine, on the adequacy of Plaintiffs' pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiffs' Complaint Was Not Objectively Unreasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Even if mandatory review were applicable, the Court does not find the \"substantial violation\" of Rule 11(b) that is a prerequisite for sanctions. In part, the Court's implementation of this standard is hampered by issues raised in the preceding section-in particular, the absence of any challenge to the adequacy of the Complaint before its voluntary dismissal. Only now do the Echo Defendants seek this analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Br. 5-6, Def. Reply 1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs' securities fraud claims were subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v.

With respect to the Licensing Agreement, Plaintiffs could have amended the complaint to allege its termination based on MTIA's failure to pay the balance due under the SPA. Similarly, with respect to the undisclosed principal argument, Plaintiffs could have amended the complaint to argue, as they did at the Hearing, \"that [but for] these material omissions [regarding Platinum], Manchester would never have entered into the security agreement that defined the collateral relationship at issue in this litigation and pursuant to which Manchester's rights were subordinated to those of MTIA and Platinum.\" (Tr. 392).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Echo Defendants allege additional violations of Rule 11(b) that go beyond pleading deficiencies.

However, the Court has considered the account from Plaintiffs' counsel of the investigation that preceded the filing of the Complaint, and does not find a substantial violation in this regard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Whelan Sanctions Decl.; Pl. Opp. 2). Of note, Plaintiffs had interviewed Thomas Bishop, Echo's former VP of Operations and Product Development, who stated quite clearly in connection with the application for a TRO that \"the Licensing Agreement is a mechanism by which Platinum Partners, the Goldberg Defendants and MTIA are attempting to transfer, for little to no cost to MTIA, Echo's intellectual property that was developed at a cost of over $100,000,000.\" (Bishop PI Decl. \u00b6 37). Bishop also expressed concerns, which he claimed were shared by Echo's R &amp; D team, that Platinum Partners-the affiliates of which were by then roiled with allegations of bribery and other misconduct-\"may have controlled Echo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Bishop reiterated these concerns during his direct testimony (Tr. 9-48), and though cross-examination may have revealed certain deficiencies in Bishop's understanding of the relevant agreements, it did not cause him to recant his earlier testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54 (\"The decision not to provide the algorithms was made between myself and a discussion with Scott Hollander who was the CEO at the time who, we discussed and agreed that our interpretation, it was not included in the license agreement.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Further corroboration for the allegations in the Complaint was provided by Keith Krystyniak, Echo's former Director of Engineering. (Whalen Sanctions Decl. \u00b6 6). Krystyniak confirmed Bishop's statements that (i) MTIA representatives had repeatedly insisted on obtaining Echo intellectual property that went beyond the scope of the Licensing Agreement, and (ii) \"everyone in Echo's Littleton, Massachusetts office believed that MTIA sought to misappropriate the CGM technology, and that Platinum was enabling MTIA's misappropriation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs' own representative shared similar views based on firsthand observations. James Besser related that after Plaintiffs had purchased the Notes, they learned \"that Platinum directly controlled and still controls every aspect of Echo's business from financial decisions, appointing and terminating board members and executives, choice of business partners and vendors and even, whether Echo was permitted to pay its employees.\" (Besser PI Decl. \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 64). Besser also recounted various discussions with Echo management regarding financing proposals, opining that the ones offered by Plaintiffs were demonstrably superior to those offered by MTIA, and that Echo's decision to go with the latter evidenced collusion on the part of MTIA and Platinum. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-28, 33, 37-58). The Court agrees with the Echo Defendants that Besser should have read with greater care the relevant agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   (Def. Br. 12-14). However, this deficiency does not negate Besser's account of his dealings with Echo, including: (i) a conversation with Shepard Goldberg in which the latter indicated that \"he would shutter Echo and terminate all of Echo's employees\" rather than accept Plaintiffs' offer (Besser PI Decl. \u00b6 45); and (ii) Echo's entry into, and subsequent violation of, the standstill agreement with Plaintiffs in October and November 2016 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In its discussion of materiality and scienter, the Court explained the difficulties Plaintiffs confronted as a consequence of the expedited discovery schedule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   On [materiality], I don't really have a complete sense of what the meetings with Ms. Chen and Mr. Fuchs involved. The content, I have a very vague sense. I do not know about the existence or not of NDAs, non-disclos[ure] agreements. I do not have any indication of consequent actions by Mr. Fuchs or Ms. Chen, and I have difficulty on this record finding that this information is sufficiently material to support a securities fraud claim for which the appropriate relief is not damages, but reformation of the agreements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   There is as well a more elemental problem. Even taking Mr. Besser at his word that he would not have invested with full knowledge of Platinum's involvement, to state an actionable claim, I need evidence demonstrating that Echo and its representatives acted with scienter. I don't have it on this record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (Tr. 393-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This Court will not impose sanctions for Plaintiffs' supposed lack of diligence on so incomplete a record. As the Court observed, there are key witnesses from whom the Court did not hear at the Hearing, including representatives of Platinum Management and MTIA. Because of that, there remain a number of unanswered questions concerning (i) the interrelationship between and among various Platinum-related entities, Echo, and MTIA; (ii) the consequences, if any, of MTIA's failure to make the payments specified by the SPA; and (iii) the\n   <em>\n    bona fides\n   </em>\n   of MTIA's financing proposals. The Court declined Plaintiffs' request to draw an adverse inference from the absence of discovery from MTIA and Platinum (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 381-82); because this missing evidence would also be probative of the issue of Plaintiffs' diligence, the Court declines for the same reasons to impose sanctions on Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   That leaves the portion of Rule 11(b) that proscribes submissions that are \"being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1). The Echo Defendants claim that Plaintiffs commenced this litigation for the improper purpose of forcing Echo to accept their financing proposal, citing as evidence: (i) the Court's observations during the Hearing regarding Plaintiffs' apparent \"force-feed[ing]\"; (ii) Plaintiffs' decision to issue a press release that struck the Court as overly definitive two days prior to the December 8 hearing; and (iii) Plaintiffs' representations to the Court in obtaining the TRO. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Br. 8, 12, 15, 16; Def. Reply 5-7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   While Plaintiffs' conduct was at times more aggressive than the Court would have preferred, the Court cannot find that the Complaint was filed for an improper purpose. On the record presented to it, the\n   Court concluded that \"this dispute really does boil down to a very stark difference of opinion about the best way to keep Echo afloat and to get this concededly beneficial technology to market\" (Tr. 385), and its rejection of Plaintiffs' arguments of irreparable harm stemmed, in part, from its belief that these arguments \"rest[ ] on a misunderstanding of Echo's and MTIA's financing and licensing obligations\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 386). Plaintiffs' arguments did not carry the day, but neither did they strike the Court as vexatious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Echo Defendants argue otherwise, claiming first that the purpose of the lawsuit was \"to 'starve out' the Company so that Plaintiffs could take over control and force the Company to accept their financing\"; they further suggest that the Court held the same view. (Def. Br. 8-9 &amp; n.12). In its evaluation of irreparable harm, the Court did observe that Plaintiffs were \"content with a Pyrrhic victory, they're willing to starve Echo of funding presumably in the hope that Echo will turn to it for funding.\" (Tr. 387). However, that is a far cry from concluding that the lawsuit was brought for an improper purpose. After all, Plaintiffs believed-and had reason to believe-that Platinum Management was improperly directing Echo to transfer its valuable technology, for insufficient consideration, to MTIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Were that belief true, Plaintiffs would have been justified in seeking injunctive relief to prevent that transfer, even at the expense of depriving Echo of funding from MTIA. The fact remains that this Court will never know the degree to which Plaintiffs were correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Echo Defendants also cite Plaintiffs' decision to issue a press release on December 6, 2016. (Def. Br. 9). The Court has already chastised Plaintiffs for their decision to issue the release, which the Court found to be insufficiently precise in distinguishing the allegations of the Complaint from the Court's decision to grant the TRO. (Tr\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   382-83). However, the Court does not consider the release to be evidence of bad faith. Particularly in light of the fact that it was issued one week after the TRO application was granted, the Court accepts Plaintiffs' explanation that it was issued to counterbalance, however inartfully, the Form 8-K issued by Echo concerning the lawsuit. (Pl. Opp. 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Hindsight being 20/20, the parties and the Court can identify things that Plaintiffs could have done better when bringing this lawsuit. But the standard here is one of \"substantial violation,\" and the Court does not find that the conduct described in this section amounted to a substantial violation. At the risk of beating the proverbial dead horse, the Court observes that Plaintiffs' request for emergent relief failed because of a lack of evidence, and not because of the frivolity of the allegations in the Complaint. It will not impose sanctions under the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Court is no more willing to impose sanctions under either of these provisions. Plaintiffs' litigation failed in the short term-in part for reasons beyond their control-and it was promptly discontinued, but it was not indefensible, and it was not commenced for an improper purpose. The Court has addressed most of the Echo Defendants' sanctions arguments at pages 27 through 35 of this Opinion. It discusses here their contentions that Plaintiffs misled the Court to obtain the TRO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 10-12, 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Court does not consider itself to have been misled. On the issue of the reasons for proceeding\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   , the Court fully credits Plaintiffs' counsel's explanation that Echo's eventual counsel had, at that time, disclaimed representation of the\n   company on the matter. (Tr. 383). On the issue of the arguments for injunctive relief, the Court understands-and finds that Plaintiffs sincerely believed-in the arguments they made, even if they were unable to present evidence sufficient to continue the relief. While certain documents were admissible of multiple or contrary interpretations, Plaintiffs' discussions with percipient witnesses at Echo, plus James Besser's own interactions, gave them grounds to believe that something was amiss with their investments. The Court was concerned, and expressed concern, that counsel for Plaintiffs may have understated the hardship of injunctive relief to Echo. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 397 (\"I understood on November 29th that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, and what I've heard yesterday suggests or has caused me to change my views in that regard[.]\") ). However, the Court does not believe any understatement was deliberate, and it considered that fact in concluding that \"the balance of hardships favors defendants\" and promptly dissolving the injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, to the extent the Echo Defendants claim consequential damages, the Court cannot accept their arguments in full, and credits the evidence of alternate causes provided by Plaintiffs. (Whelan Sanctions Decl., Ex. E). In short, Plaintiffs had a good-faith basis, and proper motives, for bringing the instant lawsuit, and the Court will not impose sanctions on them or their counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Opinion, the Echo Defendants' motion for sanctions is DENIED.

Opp. 13).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gurary\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Nu-Tech Bio-Med, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432452\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/212/#p219\">\n     303 F.3d 212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 220-21 (2d Cir. 2002) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    A securities complaint may, however, present frivolous claims joined with nonfrivolous claims in a wide variety of ways, including the combination of frivolous claims with [i] valid, winning claims; [ii] claims lost before a jury but which are meritorious enough to survive summary dismissal; [iii] claims that, though properly dismissed at summary judgment because capable of resolution as a matter of law, presented novel legal issues that could well have gone in the plaintiff's favor; and [iv] summarily dismissed claims that, while not legally frivolous, lack any merit.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    The Echo Defendants' citation to this decision is somewhat misleading. (Def. Br. 20).

Echo violated that provision when it \"entered into a half a million dollar bridge loan with an MTIA related entity and then informed us about it three days\" later, on November 21, 2016, approximately one week before this lawsuit was filed.
