In 1999, Abdala Saieh, as settlor, created the JAMCE Trust in the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the terms of the trust deed, he selected First Union Bank and Trust Company (Cayman) Ltd. as trustee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First Union National Bank as the investment advisor, and First Union Brokerage Service, Inc., as the custodian of the trust assets in an account. The trust deed also provided that a wholly-owned investment company, JAMCE Investment Ltd. (JAMCE), would work with the investment advisor. Wells Fargo is the sole shareholder of JAMCE, a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Plaintiffs allege that they are the \"beneficial owners\" of the JAMCE Trust and JAMCE, as the beneficiaries of the JAMCE Trust upon the settlor's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Seven years later on November 28, 2006, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department (OFAC) designated JAMCE and Abdala Saieh as narcotics traffickers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20536.312\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 536.312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   then sought to enforce the judgment, and, in the process, sought the turnover of the blocked assets belonging to JAMCE as an agency or instrumentality of the terrorist party, FARC, pursuant to \u00a7 201 of TRIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell v.

In 2011, after this Court found that JAMCE was an agency or instrumentality \"of the FARC because...they assisted the financial or money laundering networks and thereby played a significant role in the FARC's cocaine manufacturing and international cocaine trafficking,\" a writ of garnishment issued to Wells Fargo as garnishee for the blocked JAMCE assets in the amount of $316,023,121.16.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 326, \u00b6 15 (order granting writ), and docket 362 (writ). In its answer, Wells Fargo stated that it held $836,167.75, plus accrued interest, in its general ledger account as part of a blocked transaction involving JAMCE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 435, \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After OFAC was petitioned in 2010 to reconsider the designation of Abdala Saieh and JAMCE as SDNTs, they were removed from the list in January 2012. In February 2012, as third-party claimants in the\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   case, Jaime Saieh, Moises Saieh, and others\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   through Mr. Klugh filed an emergency motion to set aside writs for the reason that the owners of properties subject to the writs were either never listed on the OFAC list or had been removed January 10, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 551.

The plaintiffs there acknowledged that although JAMCE was later removed from the list, the writ was served in September 2011 before the removal, and therefore at all relevant times was an SDNT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 650, \u00b6 13. The motion was unopposed. On April 25, 2013, this Court issued a judgment of turnover of the blocked assets and found that no other person or entity had ownership, beneficial interests, or rights in the blocked proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 725, \u00b6 11 (order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   case, JAMCE and the Plaintiffs here through Mr. Klugh quickly appealed and sought to stay the turnover judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 728 (notice of appeal) and docket 737 (motion to stay). Mr. Klugh appeared on behalf of the Plaintiffs here as \"beneficial owners\" as well as JAMCE. In denying the stay, this Court reasoned that, among other considerations, no objections were made before the TRIA turnover judgment was entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 747 (order). The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the order on appeal as to JAMCE and held that the de-listing of an SDNT after the service of the writ on the garnishee \"was ineffectual for determining whether the asset was blocked for TRIA \u00a7 201 purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , 8:09-cv-2308-T-26MAP, docket 885 (opinion);\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292108\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/713/#p723\">\n    771 F.3d at 733, 743-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    THEORIES OF LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege five different claims for relief or theories for recovery: breach of fiduciary duty (Count I); breach of third-party beneficiary contract (Count II); breach of duty to notify (Count III); breach of duty to defend or indemnify\n   (Count IV); and negligence (Count V). In the first count, Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo as trustee of the JAMCE Trust owed a fiduciary duty to them as beneficiaries of the trust, which it breached in many ways. Wells Fargo failed to notify them that the JAMCE Trust either terminated in 2007, or it was never formed and the assets were transferred directly to a brokerage account, and that JAMCE was either dissolved or ceased to exist by early 2008, at which time the assets should have been distributed to them. Plaintiffs allege that after the settlor's death, \"Wells Fargo liquidated the brokerage account and all other accounts [of JAMCE], and consolidated the resulting funds in an account in the Cayman Islands bank predecessor of Wells Fargo.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 52. In 2008, Plaintiffs believe that \"Wells Fargo conducted an electronic funds transfer (ETF)...of the beneficiaries' funds resulting from liquidation of [JAMCE] assets...to Wells Fargo's compliance branch in New York.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 53. They claim that the ETF caused the funds to be held in some type of OFAC blocking account, not a true bank account in any person's name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 54. The movement of the funds outside the Cayman Islands was in contravention to the terms of the Trust deed according to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Regarding the breach of fiduciary duties, Plaintiffs allege that not only did Wells Fargo fail to notify them of the service of the writ of garnishment in the\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   case, but Wells Fargo wrongfully \"gave private banking information to the\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   parties without notifying the Plaintiffs or obtaining their consent to release the private information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 34. Wells Fargo failed to indemnify and defend Plaintiffs against the writ of garnishment, and allegedly \"failed to seek a hearing as contemplated under [the garnishment statute] to counter erroneous or incomplete assertions regarding the [JAMCE Trust and JAMCE]....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 35. Plaintiffs claim a valid defense to the garnishment in that the assets were not in the jurisdiction of this Court because they remained outside the State of Florida at the time the writ was served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 63. To this end, Plaintiffs allege that \"any assets that may have once pertained to [JAMCE] were held by an independent subsidiary of Wells Fargo-the entity that succeeded First Union Bank and Trust Company (Cayman) Ltd. or First Union Brokerage Service, Inc.-at the time of their transfer to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 62. Plaintiffs further assert that Wells Fargo should have answered that the funds in the account were owed to Plaintiffs, not JAMCE, and JAMCE did not or may never have existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 84. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo should have amended its answer in 2012 to reflect that JAMCE was de-listed by the OFAC and acknowledged that it owed funds to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The remaining counts seek relief on essentially the same allegations. The second count seeks relief based on breaches of written third-party beneficiary contracts that Plaintiffs claim are in the sole possession of Wells Fargo. Plaintiffs allege the breaches as \"failing to properly establish or dissolve the Trust, failing to distribute the Trust assets to, or acknowledge ownership of the Trust assets by, the Plaintiffs upon termination of the Trust; failing to provide the Trustee or Trust Beneficiaries with notice of [the\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   litigation and the discovery demands]; and failing to offer any defense whatsoever to the discovery requests and the writ of garnishment, including failing to accurately inform the Plaintiffs and the court [of jurisdictional flaws].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 92. The third count seeks relief based on the breach of the duty to notify of the facts set forth above, arising from the duties owed by a\n   bank holding the assets subject to the Trust deed. Plaintiffs claim in the fourth count the breach of the duty to defend and indemnify against the garnishment and the seizures of the trust assets, specifically that \"Wells Fargo caused counsel retained by one of the beneficiaries to be conflicted from representation of [JAMCE], the [JAMCE Trust], or the beneficiaries when it wrongly notified the law firm Holland and Knight that it would deem representation of the beneficiaries' interests in the garnishment to conflict with the interests of Wells Fargo.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 102. In the last count, Plaintiffs claim Wells Fargo was negligent in failing to exercise reasonable care in the management of JAMCE Trust, JAMCE, and any accounts or assets belonging to either as well as responding to service of court papers relating to the accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, \u00b6 104. Plaintiffs include all of the other duties articulated in the second amended complaint as duties giving rise to their claim for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant seeks to dismiss the second amended complaint based on failure to state a claim for relief in contravention of the\n   <em>\n    Twombly - Iqbal\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so doing, this Court may consider the documents filed in the prior, related case of\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   , which is key to the premise of the claims that contest Wells Fargo's conduct in the garnishment proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Horne v.

Wells Fargo owed no duty to Plaintiffs to keep the JAMCE assets under the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands because the trust deed, which is attached to the second amended complaint, allows Wells Fargo to move the JAMCE assets to the United States and to open an account with a U.S. investment advisor to invest, hold, and transfer assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, trust deed \u00b6 3.2 and Schedule B, \u00b6\u00b6 A (First Union National Bank as Investment Advisor) and (B)(1) (full discretion vested in Trustee, Investment Company and Investment Advisor). The trust deed selects the U.S. broker, First Union Brokerage Service, Inc., to engage in transactions on behalf of the JAMCE Trust, and gives Wells Fargo investment discretion in equal degree with the settlor, Abdala Saieh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket 58, trust deed \u00b6\u00b6 2.3 and 2.4, and Schedule B.

The legal, proximate cause of Plaintiffs' damages was the OFAC's blocking JAMCE assets and this Court's turnover judgment. Wells Fargo could not foresee that OFAC would block the JAMCE assets and therefore should have kept the assets outside the United States.

The alleged breaches are the same breaches alleged for violation of the trust deed-failure to either establish or dissolve the JAMCE trust, failure to distribute its assets, failure to provide notice to Plaintiffs of the\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   litigation and discovery requests, and failure to offer a defense to the litigation and discovery requests. These allegations do not make sense because any alleged separate contracts would not impose the exact same, redundant obligations and duties as the trust deed. Under Florida law, the violation of a trust provision does not in and of itself give rise to a breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

Apart from such an omission, it cannot be overlooked that JAMCE's attorney now takes a contrary position that JAMCE may never have been formed and therefore may never have existed.
