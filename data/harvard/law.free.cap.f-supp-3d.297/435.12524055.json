The FBI initially refused to provide the Times any of its interview notes, or Form 302s (\"302s\"), which memorialize its debriefings with Abdulmutallab, but made a limited disclosure after this lawsuit was filed. The Times continued to seek additional material, relying in part on the fact that public documents, including some that were filed in connection with Abdulmuttalab's criminal sentencing, had been derived from the 302s. After the Court conducted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the 302s, ordered the FBI to conduct segregability analyses, and required it to provide a line-by-line justification for withholding any remaining material, the FBI released 188 of the 195 pages of the 302s with substantially fewer redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Left for the Court to decide is whether the material that remains redacted has been properly withheld under FOIA. After careful\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the Court is persuaded that the redacted material remaining is exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1, 7(A), and 7(C), and that all reasonably segregable information has now been disclosed, with one possible exception. Accordingly, the Court grants the FBI's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Through sworn declarations of three senior FBI officials, as well as testimony from senior FBI officials at\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearings before the Court, the FBI has also carried its burden of demonstrating that the production of these records \"could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.\" 5 U.S.C, \u00a7 552(b)(7). The FBI has identified many other \"pending and related national security investigations and prosecutions\" that are related to its investigation of Abdulmutallab. First Hardy Decl. \u00b6 45.

Exemption 1 provides that agencies need not disclose information that is: \"(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) [is] in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

In particular, the FBI has explained that the withheld 302s contain classified file numbers, which may together form a mosaic of the FBI's investigative activities and methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Hardy, who acted as \"an original classification authority,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50, explains that these file numbers \"contain a geographical prefix ... and case number, which includes the numerical characterization of the type of investigation followed by a chronological number assigned to a specific investigation/activity,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Thus, these file numbers, when pieced together, would provide any hostile party a window into the \"probable intelligence that the FBI has gathered, or can collect, concerning them,\" which would provide a powerful \"means of deflection\" to those who wish to harm the national security.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On the basis of these representations, as well as its own\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the 302s and its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   questioning of senior FBI officials, the Court finds that the FBI was reasonable to expect that the disclosure of these classified file numbers would result in damage to the national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition, the Court concludes that the names of individuals depicted in photographs shown to Abdulmutallab were properly withheld under Exemption 1. McPherson stated that these individuals are \"of investigative interest to the FBI and the Intelligence Community.\" McPherson Decl. \u00b6 9. Disclosure of these names would not only alert those who are named that they are under investigation, but would also inform other hostile parties of the progress of the FBIs terrorism investigations. The FBI reasonably expects that disclosure of this information would harm the national security by prompting these individuals to evade investigation or develop countermeasures. The Court is persuaded that these names, like the FBI's classified file numbers, were properly withheld as classified information under Exemption 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In reaching this conclusion, the Second Circuit explained that it did not understand \"the 'matching' aspect of the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test to require absolute identity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/#p120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/#p120\">\n    at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While affirming that\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   \"remains the law of this Circuit,\"\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   went on to question its \"provenance\" and note that \"a rigid application of it may not be warranted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/#p120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 120 n.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    New York Times,\n   </em>\n   the parties propose different standards for determining whether the government has officially disclosed requested information. The Times argues that \"the test for waiver is whether disclosure of the withheld information would enhance any risk above and beyond what has already been disclosed.\" Times Mem. at 24. The FBI, by contrast, argues the withheld information \"must still match, or 'virtually parallel,' the disclosed information in order to trigger the official acknowledgement doctrine.\" FBI Mem. at 20. As the FBI notes, \"a high degree of overlap between the information previously disclosed and the information the agency sought to protect\" is sufficient to constitute official disclosure. Def's Letter to Ct. at 2 (May 26, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In this case, the Court need not decide how rigidly to apply the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test or further articulate the standard for waiver because, under either standard proposed by the parties, the information that remains withheld from the 302s has not been officially disclosed. The Times is correct that the government has disclosed a substantial amount of information regarding Abdulmutallab's activities, including his association with Awlaki and his training with al-Queda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Times Mem. at 25-26.

In reaching this determination, the Court has carefully considered the factual information the FBI has withheld, alongside the information that has already been disclosed, The Court has also taken care to consider the context of any withheld information, as context itself may convey information that has not been disclosed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Prop.

In evaluating the Times's claim, the Court has carefully inspected hundreds of documents and conducted two\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearings with the FBI regarding its reasons for withholding the requested information. In the end, the FBI has made three productions of responsive material, substantially narrowing the pool of records it had initially withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court now concludes that all information responsive to the FOIA requests in this case that remains withheld is properly exempt from disclosure, particularly in light of the deference rightly due the government's intelligence agencies on matters of national security and terrorism.
