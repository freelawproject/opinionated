(\"Brenco\"), is a Virginia corporation that provides catering services. Defendant, Bitesquad.com, LLC (\"Bite Squad\"), is a Minnesota based food delivery services company that uses its website as a platform to allow customers to order food delivery online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brenco sold its catering services business to Bite Squad for $750,000 in the\n   form of a Promissory Note executed by Bite Squad and issued to Brenco. The sale was orchestrated pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), which set forth the terms of the sale and the parties' obligations. Under the Agreement, Brenco warranted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   There are no impending changes in the Seller's Business or in the relationships of Seller with its customers or suppliers ..., which if one or more should occur, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the prospects, financial condition or results of operation of the Seller's Business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ex. A at \u00a7 4.24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Article 7 of the Agreement allows Bite Squad to seek indemnification from Brenco resulting from breaches of the Agreement and interrelated agreements. Under \u00a7 7.1 of the Agreement, Brenco agreed to indemnify Bite Squad for \"any and all damages, ... which may be sustained or suffered by [Bite Squad] arising from ... a breach of any ... warranty ...made by [Brenco].\" Ex. A, at \u00a7 7.1. Further, \u00a7 3.5 of the Agreement gives Bites Squad the right \"to set off against the Promissory Note, any unpaid obligation of [Brenco] pursuant to Article 7 of this Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 8.15(b) of the Agreement detailed the parties' agreement to arbitrate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Without prejudice to each party's right to seek injunctive or mandatory relief from a court, the parties agree that all other disputes arising under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any alleged breach hereof or thereof, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 8.15(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Agreement goes on to define \"Agreement\" as \"this Asset Purchase Agreement and the schedules and exhibits hereto and the other agreements attached hereto or made a part of this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Art. 1. Among the \"exhibits\" attached to the Agreement was the Promissory Note for $750,000, executed on June 30, 2016, contemporaneously with the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Note provided that it was \"issued pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof [ ].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 1 at 1. Section 5 of the Note provides that \"[i]n accordance with the terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement, [Bite Squad] is entitled to set off against any amounts due under this Note, amounts, if any, which [Brenco] may be obligated to pay [Bite Squad] under the Purchase Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly after the parties executed the Agreement, several key Brenco personnel defected from the business to establish a competing operation. Bite Squad believed that these defections breached the warranty in the Agreement assuring Bite Squad that there were \"no impending changes in [Brenco's] Business ....\" Ex. A \u00a7 4.24. On January 31, 2017, Bite Squad requested indemnification from Brenco for the alleged breaches of the Agreement, and Bite Squad notified Brenco that it intended to offset its losses from the Note issued to Brenco under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After a year of negotiation, the parties were unable to reach a resolution and Brenco filed its complaint seeking: (i) damages for breach of the Promissory Note, (ii) specific performance on the Promissory Note, (iii) declaratory relief stating that the Agreement's set-off provisions do not allow Bite Squad to set-off from the Promissory Note, and (iv) declaratory relief stating that Bite Squad was not entitled to indemnification without an adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bite Squad, seeking to vindicate what it views as its right to arbitrate disputes arising under the Agreement, filed this motion to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This case presents two questions: (i) whether the parties' contractual dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration clause in the agreement,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that is whether the parties' dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) who decides the question of arbitrability, a court or the arbitrator. Analysis properly and logically begins with the second question-whether a court or the arbitrator should determine arbitrability. In general, arbitrability questions are \" 'an issue for judicial determination.' \"\n   <em>\n    Peabody Holding Co., LLC v.

This is so because, as the cases recognize, deciding whether a dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause is essentially a question of contract interpretation, which is quintessentially a question decided by a court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206747\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/643/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under certain circumstances, however, arbitrability can be a question for the arbitrator to decide. This occurs where an agreement \"clearly and unmistakably provide[s] that the arbitrator shall determine what disputes the parties agreed to arbitrate[,]\" the arbitrability decision is left to the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206747\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/643/#p649\">\n    475 U.S. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206747\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/643/#p649\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, the Fourth Circuit has noted that the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard is a high bar,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but has not addressed precisely whether incorporation of AAA rules would clear the high bar. Other circuits, however, have done so and those circuits uniformly concluded that the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard is met when, in addition to the expansive language, an arbitration clause incorporates a specific set of rules, such as the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules, that authorizes arbitrators to determine arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Petrofac, Inc. v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Ops. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491814\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/671/#p675\">\n    687 F.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (5th Cir. 2012) (\"the express adoption of [the AAA Commercial Rules] presents clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this instance, the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard is met because, as\n   Bite Squad correctly argues, the arbitration clause includes expansive language and incorporates a specific set of rules requiring that the arbitrator determine arbitrability. Specifically, the Agreement provides that \"disputes arising under\" the Agreement \"or any of the Ancillary Agreements\" are subject to arbitration \"in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association[.]\" Ex. A. Art. 1 \u00a7 8.15(b). The Agreement's \"disputes arising under\" language demonstrates an intent of the parties to submit all disputes related to the Agreement to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the arbitration clause at issue here also incorporates the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association which provide that \"[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\" AAA Commercial Rule 7(a). Given this \"clear and unmistakable\" language, there is no doubt that the Agreement's arbitration clause manifests the parties' clear intention to commit the arbitrability determination to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff, seeking to avoid this conclusion, argues unpersuasively that the arbitration clause in the Agreement is even narrower than clauses in other cases where courts have found the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard was not satisfied. In this respect, plaintiff relies chiefly on the Fourth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Peabody Holding Co., LLC v. United Mine Workers of America, Intern. Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3864363\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/96/#p102\">\n    665 F.3d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (4th Cir. 2012), which held that language submitting to arbitration \"[a]ny dispute alleging a breach\" was too narrow to meet the exacting \"clear and unmistakable\" standard. The arbitration clause in\n   <em>\n    Peabody\n   </em>\n   , however, did not include a provision incorporating the AAA Commercial Rules, which explicitly require submission of arbitrability issues to the arbitrator. The\n   <em>\n    Peabody\n   </em>\n   case is clearly inapposite and is therefore of no help to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In sum, where, as here, an arbitration clause incorporates the AAA Commercial Rules and includes broad language allowing for arbitration of disputes arising under an agreement, the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard is met and arbitrability should be determined in the first instance by an arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although the arbitrability question must be addressed in the first instance by the\n   arbitrator and need not be addressed here, it is worth noting that parties' dispute is very likely to be found arbitrable by the arbitrator. This is so because the Agreement and the Promissory Note are essentially two parts of the same contractual agreement between the parties. The Agreement includes the Promissory Note as an exhibit and both the Promissory Note and the Agreement refer to one another: the promissory note provides that \"[t]his Note is issued pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement[,]\" and the Agreement is defined as including both the Agreement itself and \"the schedules and exhibits thereto.\" The Promissory Note was attached to the Agreement as Exhibit E, and under those circumstances the Promissory Note is a part of the Agreement. Thus, the Agreement and the Promissory Note are essentially parts of the same contract and therefore any dispute over the Promissory Note arises under the Agreement and is subject to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff's argument that counts 3 and 4, which seek declaratory relief, fall within the arbitration clause's exception for \"injunctive or mandatory relief from a court\" is meritless. Ex. A at \u00a7 8.15(b). These counts seek a ruling on the interpretation of the contract and are essentially typical breach of contract claims dressed up and disguised as declaratory judgment actions. Artful pleading of claims as declaratory judgment actions should not allow a party to avoid a broad arbitration clause and any reading to the contrary would clearly undermine the intention of the parties to arbitrate disputes arising under the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clarus Medical, LLC v. Myelotec, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203272139\">\n    2005 WL 3272139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (D.
