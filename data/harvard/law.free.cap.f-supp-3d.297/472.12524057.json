PAULEY III, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants NewLink Genetics Corporation, Charles Link, and Nicholas Vahanian move to dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint (\"Complaint\"). For the reasons\n   that follow, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations of the Complaint are presumed true for purposes of this motion. This securities fraud action arises from a failed clinical trial designed to test the efficacy of a pancreatic cancerimmunotherapy. The central issue is whether NewLink Genetics Corporation's (\"NewLink\") clinical trial was built on faulty assumptions, outdated clinical studies, and a compromised patient pool for the purpose of misleading investors into believing that NewLink's immunotherapy product would be a commercial success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Importantly, NewLink and its officers and directors were blinded to the results of the clinical trial. At each clinical trial milestone, an independent monitoring committee analyzed data to determine whether the overall survival of trial participants receiving NewLink's immunotherapy exceeded that of a separate group of participants treated with standard chemotherapy. Although NewLink and its co-founders, Charles Link and Nicholas Vahanian, presented an optimistic outlook on the product's success, that assessment was belied by each interim report concluding that the immunotherapy had not yielded a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Ultimately, the clinical trial terminated on news that NewLink's product not only failed to increase overall survival rates, but underperformed the standard chemotherapy treatment, with patients in the latter group living three months longer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over the nearly three year trial period, NewLink's stock price vacillated between interim reports of the immunotherapy's middling performance and Defendants' continued assurances that the product would achieve the trial objectives. The trial's final report sounded the death knell for NewLink's plans to commercialize the product and sent its stock price tumbling. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs commenced this action against NewLink, Link, and Vahanian, for violations of Section 10(b), Section 20(a), and Section 20A of the 1934 Exchange Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    NewLink, HyperAcute Pancreas, and Phase 2 Clinical Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   NewLink is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing cellular immunotherapeutic products to treat cancer. (Complaint, ECF No. 38 (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6 1.) The product at issue in this action is algenpantucel-L, also known as HyperAcute Pancreas, a therapeutic vaccine intended to treat pancreatic cancer. (Compl. \u00b6 2.) As NewLink's most advanced treatment candidate, HyperAcute Pancreas is designed to stimulate the human immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. (Compl. \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2010, NewLink completed its 70-patient Phase 2 clinical trial for HyperAcute Pancreas in surgically-resected (surgically removed) pancreatic cancer patients. Phase 2 focused on earlier stage, resected pancreatic cancer patients with better prognoses than later stage patients. Phase 2 was designed as an open label, non-randomized trial in which two separate groups of patients were given HyperAcute Pancreas in doses of either 100 million or 300 million cells, respectively, twice a month for six months in combination with a standard chemotherapy-based treatment. (Compl. \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Phase 2 did not contain a control group-that is, every patient in the trial received HyperAcute Pancreas with dosage amount as the only variant. (Compl. \u00b6 32.) Out of the 70 patients, 26 were prescribed a high dose and 44 received a low dose. The trial resulted in a one-year survival rate of 96% for the high dose group\n   and 79% for the low dose group, though these results did not conclusively establish that HyperAcute Pancreas improved disease-free and overall survival of resected pancreatic cancer patients. (Compl. \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Initial Public Offering and Phase 3 Clinical Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2010, based on \"encouraging interim data\" from the Phase 2 trial, NewLink initiated Phase 3. (Compl. \u00b6 33.) Shortly thereafter, NewLink submitted a registration statement with the SEC, signaling its intent to become a public company. In November 2011, NewLink issued its prospectus, sold 6.2 million shares of stock at $7 per share, and raised $43.4 million in capital. (Compl. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Phase 3 was designed as an open-label, randomized, and controlled trial evaluating 722 patients with Stage I and Stage II surgically resected pancreatic cancer with no detectable disease by CT scan. (Compl. \u00b6 34.) Half the participants were enrolled into the control group and received only the standard chemotherapy based treatment (the \"Control Group\"). The other half received standard adjuvant therapy with 300 million cells of HyperAcute Pancreas (the \"Treatment Group\"). (Compl. \u00b6 34.) The trial's primary endpoint was to achieve overall survival with secondary goals of disease-free survival, safety, toxicity, and immunological responses. In other words, the trial would only be considered a success if the Treatment Group lived longer than the Control Group, the latter of which Defendants said had a life expectancy of \"18, 19 months to low 20s at best.\" (Compl. \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Phase 3 trial was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), which meant the trial's design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses were declared acceptable for FDA approval despite the fact that the trial had yet to be completed. (Compl. \u00b6 35.) Further, because HyperAcute Pancreas was designed to address an unmet medical need and counter a rare medical condition in pancreatic cancer, the FDA granted the Phase 3 trial a Fast Track designation for expedited review and an Orphan Drug designation, which carried exclusive marketing rights, clinical tax research incentives, and filing fee exemptions. (Compl. \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Patient Enrollment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Phase 3 had four major milestones. The first consisted of enrolling 722 qualified patients. The criteria for enrolling patients in the trial were very strict. (Compl. \u00b6 40.) During the enrollment period, a former NewLink clinical research associate employed from January 2012 through December 2014 (\"Confidential Witness\") said that Vahanian was concerned about getting enough patients for the trial, and pushed to complete patient enrollment within a narrow time frame. As a result of Vahanian's pressure to enroll patients quickly, the Confidential Witness explained that NewLink flouted eligibility rules by registering unqualified patients. (Compl. \u00b6 42.) By September 17, 2013, NewLink announced that it had reached the \"accrual goal of 722 subjects with surgically resected pancreatic cancer.\" (Compl. \u00b6 44.) According to the Complaint, Vahanian pushed for expedited enrollment because his and Link's 2013 year-end bonuses were tied to completing Phase 3 patient enrollment. (Compl. \u00b6 43.) In total, Vahanian and Link received bonuses of $189,000 and $297,440, respectively, and also obtained vested stock for their \"extraordinary performance in 2013.\" (Compl. \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Interim Analyses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second, third, and fourth milestones of the Phase 3 trial were periodic reviews-or interim analyses-of trial data\n   by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (the \"Data Committee\"). (Compl. \u00b6 36.) The first interim analysis occurred after 222 patient deaths were reported. If the data revealed that there was a 99.5% likelihood that the overall survival of the Treatment Group exceeded that of the Control Group, NewLink could stop the trial and apply for marketing approval. Achieving this benchmark meant that the Treatment Group had an approximately 45% improvement in overall survival over the Control Group. (Compl. \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   If the data in the first interim analysis did not show such an improvement, the study would continue until 333 patient deaths were reported. In the second interim analysis, if the data showed that there was a 98% likelihood that the overall survival of the Treatment Group eclipsed that of the Control Group, NewLink could proceed immediately to market its product. Passing this threshold meant that the Treatment Group had a 30% improvement in overall survival over the Control Group. (Compl. \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The third and final interim analysis occurred after 444 patient deaths were reported. At this point, if the data failed to show about a 95.5% likelihood that the Treatment Group patients were outliving the Control Group patients-or a 20% improvement in overall survival between the two groups-the study would be disbanded. (Compl. \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    First Interim Data Results\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From September 2013 to February 2014, NewLink's stock price tripled in value to $53.48 per share. During this six-month period, Link sold 181,000 shares and Vahanian sold 177,162 shares, making millions of dollars in profit. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) In March 2014, NewLink announced that the Data Committee had completed its first interim analysis following 222 patient deaths and recommended continuing the trial. (Compl. \u00b6 47.) In response to this deflating news, Defendants remarked that the first interim results were an \"anticipated outcome,\" and Vahanian added that they \"look[ed] forward to continuing the study and to gathering additional, more mature data in support of [NewLink's] mission to provide improved treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer.\" (Compl. \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Some investment analysts began questioning whether NewLink had made faulty assumptions about the Control Group's overall survival rate. Defendants assured them that their initial estimates were well-founded, and that the first interim results did not affect their expectations regarding Phase 3's success. (Compl. \u00b6 48.) For example, when asked whether it was his \"expectation [ ] that the [Control Group] is performing as [he] would have figured it in this statistical plan at this point in time based on when [he] know[s] patients were enrolled in the trial,\" Link answered that the \"statistical plan [ ] would easily tolerate a [Control Group] in the low 20[ ] [months],\" and that there was no \"fundamental change that has occurred in the United States that is suddenly going to jump the survival of pancreatic cancer patients in the [Control Group] by five or six months.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While news of the first interim results caused NewLink's stock price to drop, Defendants' statements comforted investors and analysts, and revived the stock to its pre-announcement price. (Compl. \u00b6 52-53.) Between March 2014 and May 2015, as the stock price rebounded, Link sold approximately 300,000 shares for a $10 million profit. Vahanian sold 100,000 shares for $5 million, including a conspicuously large transaction involving 60,000 shares in March 2015, which netted him $3 million. (Compl. \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Second Interim Data Results\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In May 2015, NewLink announced that the Data Committee had again concluded that the trial data did not warrant market approval. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) To offset the negative implications associated with this news, Defendants parroted statements signaling their expectation of HyperAcute Pancreas's clinical and commercial success. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) To that end, Defendants cited the trial's \"fast-track status, orphan drug designation,\" and previewed their steps to prepare for the product's regulatory approval and commercialization. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) According to Plaintiffs, however, Defendants \"continued to mislead investors to believe that the final results from the [Phase 3 trial] would be sufficiently positive to proceed to commercialization.\" (Compl. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After announcing the second interim results, the stock price plunged from $52.14 to $36.55 per share in one day. To repair this damage, Defendants again issued materially false and misleading statements to instill confidence in the product. (Compl. \u00b6 58.) For example, Defendants showcased their plans to \"expand [their] manufacturing capabilities,\" and promised \"additional details around [their] manufacturing progress and commercial supply\" for the product as they \"move[d] closer to the potential launch.\" (Compl. \u00b6 59.) Despite the persistent questions surrounding the accuracy of the Control Group's survival rate, Defendants maintained that the \"median months for overall survival from randomization in the [Control Group] is in the low 20s.\" (Compl. \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the release of second interim results, questions swirled around NewLink's compliance with certain clinical requirements pertinent to the trial. Specifically, in a March 2016 report, an investment analyst raised concerns about a note in NewLink's 10-K report that \"a clinical site involved in the [Phase 3 trial] was discovered to be non-compliant with certain Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements.\" (Compl. \u00b6 62.) Defendants responded that the problem was \"procedural in nature and only a minor issue,\" and because the \"site in question only has 'a few' patients enrolled ... exclu[ding] these patients should not have a material impact on the trial.\" (Compl. \u00b6 62.) But according to the Confidential Witness, non-compliance issues were not an isolated problem. The Confidential Witness observed pervasive violations of Good Clinical Practice standards regarding the \"handling of client data, clinical report forms, and acceptance of patients in the [Phase 3] trial that did not qualify.\" (Compl. \u00b6 63.) Other issues plagued the integrity of the trial: \"numerous regulatory documentation errors,\" no \"quality control documentation in place before the trials began,\" no employees with regulatory experience, and insecure storage of confidential patient information. (Compl. \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Despite Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions regarding the facts underlying the Phase 3 trial, the stock price recovered, allowing Link and Vahanian to make \"one final push to sell off their NewLink holdings.\" (Compl. \u00b6 64.) Between May 2015 and May 2016, Link sold 260,000 shares for $9 million. Vahanian sold 43,000 shares for over $2 million. (Compl. \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Third Interim Data Results\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In May 2016, NewLink reported that the Phase 3 study \"for patients with resected pancreatic cancer did not achieve its primary endpoint.\" (Compl. \u00b6 65.) NewLink's press release fleshed out the details: \"[o]verall survival from time of randomization was 29.3 months for both groups combined. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The median survival was 30.4 months and 27.3 months for the [Control Group] and [Treatment Group], respectively.\" (Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 65.) Plaintiffs theorize that this harrowing news supported the market's suspicion that the Control Group's estimated survival rate had been understated from the outset to create a false appearance that study participants were living longer because of HyperAcute Pancreas. In reality, however, with Treatment Group patients living three months less than those in the Control Group, the final results suggested that NewLink's product had \"harmed the patients and shortened their lives.\" (Compl. \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   These revelations precipitated a 30% drop in the stock's value, from $16.50 to $11.45 per share on May 9, 2016. Over the next few days, the share price continued to slide, closing at $9.71 per share on May 12, 2016. Before the stock's precipitous decline, however, Link and Vahanian had collectively managed to sell a little more than one million NewLink shares, representing 81% and 252% of their overall holdings, respectively, for insider trading profits of approximately $36.4 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Rule 12(b)(6) Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, a court must accept the facts alleged as true and construe all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust of Chi. v.

Specifically, Plaintiffs cite the testimony of the Confidential Witness, who explained that Vahanian was \"really pushy\" about enrolling patients and that NewLink had trouble enrolling qualified patients. With pressure mounting, the Confidential Witness said that NewLink disregarded certain guidelines to expedite patient enrollment. Moreover, in March 2016, when New Link was asked about a Phase 3 clinical site that had failed to comply with Good Clinical Practice standards, Defendants downplayed the problem, minimizing the non-compliant site's impact on Phase 3. Defendants represented that because the \"site in question only has 'a few' patients enrolled,\" it would not have a material impact on the trial. (Compl. \u00b6 62.) However, that statement, according to Plaintiffs, was materially false in view of the Confidential Witness's observations about \"pervasive GCP violations at New Link with regard to the handling of client data, clinical report forms, and acceptance of patients\" who did not qualify under Phase 3's rigorous guidelines. (Compl. \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants attack the patient enrollment allegations on two grounds. First, they claim that the Confidential Witness statements cannot be credited because the witness did not have access to trial screening or patient enrollment information. Second, even if this Court took the Confidential Witness statements at face value, Defendants contend that the inclusion of \"several\" ineligible patients would not have materially impacted the trial since only 680 patients were required to ensure the trial's statistical integrity. (Memo. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 52 (\"Mot.\"), at 10-11.) In\n   other words, the Phase 3 trial expressly built in a buffer that accounted for the possibility of ineligible patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Information presented through Confidential Witnesses in a complaint is allowed as long as the witnesses are described in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess [ ] the information alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornwell v.

The Confidential Witness was a NewLink Clinical Research Associate from January 2012 through December 2014-a period leading up to NewLink's announcement that it had completed patient enrollment. The Confidential Witness \"spoke personally with Defendant Vahanian about the design of [the Phase 3 trial],\" which necessarily included the criteria under which patients were enrolled. (Compl. \u00b6 42.) Plaintiffs further allege that the Confidential Witness observed \"pervasive [Good Clinical Practice] violations at New Link with regard to the handling of client data, clinical report forms, and\n   <em>\n    acceptance of patients in the [Phase 3 trial]\n   </em>\n   that did not qualify under the\" required terms. (Compl. \u00b6 63 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Confidential Witness noticed that Vahanian became \"pushy\" and recalls that he was only concerned about expediting trial enrollment. The urgency surrounding patient enrollment is not, by itself, unusual given the high stakes of a long awaited clinical trial. But when that is coupled with the Confidential Witness's recollection that \"NewLink had a difficult time finding eligible patients for the [Phase 3 study] within the required time frame,\" the Complaint establishes enough of a basis to conclude that the Confidential Witness probably possessed relevant information about this particular set of allegations. (Compl. \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants demand more details about the Confidential Witness's communications with Vahanian, how the Confidential Witness knew Vahanian's \"pushiness\" led to enrollment of ineligible patients, what rules were disregarded, and when and how many violations occurred. But on a motion to dismiss, all that is necessary is that the Confidential Witness, by virtue of his position at NewLink and interaction with Vahanian, probably possessed the information underlying Plaintiffs' allegations about patient enrollment. Of course, the Confidential Witness's knowledge and credibility regarding the relevant information can be tested in discovery. At the pleadings stage, \"Plaintiff[s] [are] only required to show that the source of the belief is someone\n   in a position to have had personal knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Levy v. Maggiore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3980267\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/48/428/#p443\">\n    48 F.Supp.3d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Further, Defendants' argument that enrollment of ineligible participants would not have affected the trial's statistical integrity is not persuasive at this stage. Defendants improperly presume that the number of ineligible participants consisted of less than the margin of error-42 patients-and would not have compromised the integrity of the trial. (Mot. at 11.) This Court cannot dismiss the possibility that a material cohort of ineligible patients were enrolled, especially since the eligibility criteria were \"exceptionally important\" and \"designed to correlate with prior pancreatic cancer studies, so that the overall survival estimate for the control group was estimable and based on prior data.\" (Compl. \u00b6 41.) Moreover, when analysts reported that one of the trial sites violated Good Clinical Practice standards, invoking a concern that unqualified patients had been enrolled, Defendants characterized the issue as an isolated incident affecting \"a few\" patients. (Compl. \u00b6 62.) While that assurance propped the stock price, it contradicted confidential testimony that Good Clinical Practice violations were \"pervasive.\" (Compl. \u00b6 63.) And if true, ineligible patient enrollment not only meant there was a tainted pool of participants but that NewLink's representations about achieving Phase 3's first milestone-in spite of the highly selective and stringent design of the study-were false. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39-40, 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Complaint therefore pleads enough at this juncture to show that NewLink's representations about patient enrollment were false and how they were false. The potential inclusion of ineligible patients in the Phase 3 trial is something that is not \"so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor\" that it should be disregarded on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    N.J.Carpenters Health Fund v.

This is important, Plaintiffs argue, because it created the impression that the extended patient survival in the Phase 3 trial was directly attributable to the efficacy of HyperAcute Pancreas. (Opp. at 6-7.) In reality, however, the Control Group had a median survival rate of 30.4 months while the Treatment Group lasted only 27.3 months. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants counter that Plaintiffs' allegations are essentially a criticism of Phase 3's methodology which, as a matter of law, does not make a statement misleading. Moreover, Defendants contend that NewLink based its Control Group survival rates on specific, well-publicized data from prior studies. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48 (RTOG-9704 trial was 18.6 months survival), 49 (\"referencing a recent study that was published by Johns Hopkins Group which demonstrated that for the last three decades going all the way back to the 1980s, 1990s and all the way up to 2011, the survival expectancy of pancreatic cancer was 19.2 months\"), 90 (\"The benefit of GEM/Abraxane combination in metastatic studying up front is 1.7 months\" which would \"move the needle from 18, 19 months to low 20s at best.\").) Thus, while Plaintiffs take issue with Link and Vahanian's insistence that their estimates were an accurate reflection of the Control Group's survival rate-even doubling down on those projections after receiving abysmal interim results-Defendants\n   argue that these statements were substantiated by credible studies documenting decades-long survival rates of pancreatic cancer patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Given the shocking revelation that the actual median survival rate of the Control Group hovered around 30 months-ten months more than what NewLink represented-it is easy to understand why Plaintiffs seek to characterize Defendants' statements as false and misleading. Even more telling, the market learned that the Control Group lived three months longer than the Treatment Group, and the Complaint suggests that HyperAcute Pancreas may have harmed Treatment Group patients and shortened their lives. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.) Understandably, one investment analyst remarked that \"NewLink deserves to be investigated for this disastrous pancreatic trial result.\" (Compl. \u00b6 68.) But disaster is not necessarily a product of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The most salient fact belying Plaintiffs' theory is that Defendants were blinded to the trial results. Plaintiffs concede this incontrovertible fact. (Compl. \u00b6 113;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117, 126-127.) Defendants did not have access to survival rates until May 2016, when they learned, together with the market, that the Phase 3 trial failed. That Defendants remained blind to Phase 3's results throughout the duration of the trial undermines the allegation that they misrepresented the Control Group's survival rates in the interim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   More plausibly, Defendants' statements about the Control Group's survival rates stem from their interpretation of previously published studies. \"[I]nterpretations of the results of various clinical studies ... are essentially no different than opinions,\" because \"[r]easonable persons may disagree over how to analyze data and interpret results, and neither lends itself to objective conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sanofi-Aventis Sec.

[They] don't\n   <em>\n    believe that\n   </em>\n   .\" (Compl. \u00b6 48 (emphasis added).) In a similar vein, Vahanian relied on a Johns Hopkins Group study \"which demonstrated that for the last three decades ... the survival expectancy of pancreatic cancer was 19.2 months,\" to formulate his opinion that the estimated survival rate of Control Group participants was \"in the low 20s.\" (Compl. \u00b6 49.) None of the statements referenced in the Complaint suggest\n   that either Link or Vahanian lacked a sincere opinion about the estimated survival rates; to the contrary, the studies they relied on provided a reasonable foundation from which they developed their estimates regarding the Control Group's overall survival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   But \"[l]ike objective statements of material fact, subjective statements of opinion can be actionable as fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178718\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/557/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Complaint fails to allege this. At best, Plaintiffs say that Defendants should have known better than to represent the Control Group's survival rate at such low figures because the interim updates suggested that \"patient deaths were occurring at a slower than expected rate.\" (Compl. \u00b6 51.) But this allegation does not undermine the well-founded basis for Defendants' belief that standard chemotherapy patients would survive at the rates they initially disclosed to the market.

First, they contend that Defendants' interpretation of Phase 2 data-namely, that only one patient in the high dose group had died-improperly concluded that Phase 2 achieved efficacy. (Compl. \u00b6 86.) Second, Defendants' statement that they initiated Phase 3 based on \"encouraging Phase 2 data that suggest[ed] improvement in both disease-free and overall survival\" is misleading, Plaintiffs argue, because Phase 2 data did not demonstrate such metrics. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 33, 53, 76, 94, 96; Opp. at 9.) At the heart of Plaintiffs' claim is that NewLink touted the efficacy of its drug based on the results of a previous trial that was not designed to test efficacy. Defendants counter that these statements about Phase 2's results amount to nothing more than expressions of optimism. They also argue that these statements reflected earnestly held opinions interpreting Phase 2 results. (Mot. at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants' statement that one-year patient survival was \"a very strong efficacy signal for the trial in the high-dose group\" was not misleading. The market knew that Phase 2 lacked a control group, so no reasonable investor could have credited the view that HyperAcute Pancreas, after Phase 2, had demonstrated actual efficacy. In a March 2014 call, for example, Link expressly noted that \"the Phase 2 data didn't have a no-treatment arm so the Phase 2 data was limited.\" (Compl. \u00b6 86.) Moreover, these Phase 2 statements are opinions. They are couched with phrases like \"suggests potential,\" and \"we felt,\" and are reasonable extrapolations of Phase 2 data.\n   <em>\n    In re Sanofi Sec.

In essence, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants put the cart before the horse by elaborating on NewLink's efforts to lay the groundwork for HyperAcute Pancreas's commercialization even though the drug had yet to clear Phase 3 or obtain FDA approval. Doing so, Plaintiffs argue, misleadingly signaled to the market that the drug was effective (i.e., that it would clear Phase 3) and commercially viable. (Compl. \u00b6 117.) But the present or historical facts underlying Defendants' statements are not false, and therefore do not render the accompanying forwardlooking statements false. Defendants may have been blinded to Phase 3's results, but Link and Vahanian modeled their statements on an earnestly held view that the \"HyperAcute immunotherapy program has the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   to improve treatment options.\" (Compl. \u00b6 116 (emphasis added).) Link and Vahanian had a good faith basis to express their \"confidence to extend [NewLink's] manufacturing capabilities.\" (Compl. \u00b6 116.)

Against the clear cautionary language outlining the risks attendant to a failed clinical trial, Defendants made it clear that they were \"making very large\n   <em>\n    strategic\n   </em>\n   investments in expanding [their] manufacturing capabilities ...\n   <em>\n    strategies\n   </em>\n   for commercialization and marketing.\" (Compl. \u00b6 112 (emphasis added).) These are merely investments NewLink made in anticipation of HyperAcute Pancreas's success.

Just a month before the first interim results were announced, Vahanian stopped trading altogether. (Compl. \u00b6 145.) After several months, in January 2015, Vahanian instituted a new plan once the stock price recovered and traded in the\n   $40 dollar range, and began selling shares erratically. (Compl. \u00b6 145.)

(Compl. \u00b6 148.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On balance, that Link and Vahanian adopted and amended their trading plans during the Class Period at conveniently opportune times supports an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    In re Gentiva Sec.

Non-discretionary trading plans designed to sell shares at pre-determined dates and quantities diminishes the likelihood that a defendant would exploit a felicitous period during a fraudulent scheme when the stock price is artificially inflated. But the Complaint suggests that Link and Vahanian exercised enough control to institute new plans on their terms. And because the Complaint alleges that Link and Vahanian were aware of the compromised patient enrollment figures at the time they adopted their trading plans, the \"fact that there might be an innocent explanation for the timing of [their] sale is not enough to defeat the inference of scienter that arises\" from the Complaint's allegations.\n   <em>\n    Freudenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021712\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/171/#p201\">\n    712 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   200-01 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re EVCI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791805\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/469/88/#p97\">\n    469 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   100 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   On that score, Defendants note that many of Link and Vahanian's trades were not suspiciously timed-that is, they were not made near dates on which allegedly false statements or negative news were released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Keyspan Corp.

Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that Link began trading two weeks after NewLink announced it had completed patient enrollment (Compl. \u00b6 147) during a period in which the stock price was rising and the market was optimistic about the trial's prospective success. Plaintiffs also note that Link stopped trading altogether after his April 7, 2016 trade (Compl. \u00b6 148), about a month before the disclosure of the final results tanked the stock price. These events are sufficiently close enough in time to shroud Link's actions in suspicion, especially in view of his decision to amend and then terminate his trading plan.\n   <em>\n    In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc., Sec.

(Compl. \u00b6 144.) Crediting the Complaint's allegations regarding patient enrollment as true, Vahanian's sale of nearly 30,000 within a month of touting the completion of Phase 3 enrollment is suspicious. Further, Vahanian \"abruptly\" stopped trading under one of his trading plans about a month before the first interim results were disclosed, avoiding a stock price drop of over 25%. (Compl. \u00b6 145.) And Vahanian did not start trading again until he was sufficiently assured that the stock price had rebounded to a level propped up by Defendants' misrepresentations in the weeks leading up to the second interim results. (Compl. \u00b6 145.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, the Complaint's allegations detailing the number of shares sold as a percentage of total holdings militates in favor of inferring scienter.

Plaintiffs rely principally on\n   <em>\n    In re Oxford\n   </em>\n   , which ignored vested options because the court could not \"evaluate the true value of the options exercised by the Individual Defendants.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823311\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/187/133/#p139\">\n    187 F.R.D. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the\n   <em>\n    In re Oxford\n   </em>\n   court also conceded that the defendants \"may have exercised options to buy at a very low price per share, in which case the shares would have been valuable to the defendants even after the stock plummeted.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Oxford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823311\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/187/133/#p139\">\n    187 F.R.D. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court's decision to exclude vested options was not based on a fundamental belief that vested options are not representative of a party's trading potential. And in\n   <em>\n    In re EVCI\n   </em>\n   , the court\n   expressed in dicta that it was inclined to follow\n   <em>\n    In re Oxford\n   </em>\n   , but found that \"regardless of which side of [the stock options] debate one comes down on,\" the defendant there \"sold far too much stock,\" with or without stock options, \"to wriggle out from a fair inference of motive and opportunity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791805\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/469/88/#p97\">\n    469 F.Supp.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (comparing 41% counting stock options and 80% without).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   When evaluating stock sales, the number of shares sold by an insider compared with the number he could have sold is more probative on the question of whether Class Period sales are unusual or suspicious.

To incentivize employees to share in the company's success, the strike price of a stock option is usually fixed at a lower figure, allowing the employee to profit on the difference between the strike price and current market price. Once a party exercises a vested stock option at the designated strike price, it becomes a share that may be sold immediately.\n   <em>\n    In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec.

In some instances, parties may exercise the option on a cashless basis-where transaction costs are covered by a concurrent sale of existing shares-making the transaction even more seamless and immediate. Thus, \"[a]ctual stock shares plus exercisable stock options represent the owner's trading potential more accurately than the stock shares alone,\" and \"a sale involving a significant portion of an insider's actual shares, but only a small portion of his\n   <em>\n    shares and options combined\n   </em>\n   , is less suspicious than were the insider to hold no options.\"\n   <em>\n    Silicon Graphics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549075\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/183/970/#p986\">\n    183 F.3d at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This Court, however, cannot entirely credit Defendants' contention that Link's total holdings only decreased by 22% if his exercisable options are included. (Mot. at 19.) The relevant SEC filings reveal that many of the stock options-though characterized as \"exercisable\"-did not vest immediately. For example, a proxy statement filed on April 6, 2016 for the period ending May 20, 2016 enumerates a dizzying array of stock options awarded to Link and Vahanian at various points during their employment. Some stock options were granted as early as June 2007 with a strike price of $0.80, and others were granted as late as January 2015 with a strike price of $43.65. (Lightdale Decl. Ex. X at 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) But a number of those grants are subject to varying conditions. Some \"vest over a five-year period, with 20% of the options vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 80% of the options vesting in equal monthly installments thereafter over the next four years.\" (Lightdale Decl. Ex. X at 39.) Others \"vest in equal monthly installments over 47 months.\" (Lightdale Decl. Ex. X at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Therefore, some stock options may not have been exercisable at the time Link and Vahanian chose to sell their stock because they had not yet vested. Further, while it appears that many of the options were granted at strike prices far less than the average market price during the Class Period,\n   a portion could have been characterized as \"out of the money\" because their strike price exceeded the market price at the time Link and Vahanian sold. Although the number of exercisable options is useful in evaluating stock sales, this Court cannot determine with certainty whether the options awarded to Link and Vahanian expanded their holdings so significantly that Link's sales only decreased his holdings by 22% (as opposed to the 81% alleged in the Complaint). In any event, this is an issue that can be calculated more precisely by the parties in discovery and re-assessed at summary judgment. At this stage, this Court cannot determine whether including options would negate an inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Executive Compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \"Motives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Kalnit v.

If the relationship between the loss and the information concealed or misstated by the defendant is \"sufficiently direct, loss causation is established, but if the connection is attenuated, or if the plaintiff fails to demonstrate a causal connection between the content of the alleged misstatements or omissions and the harm actually suffered, a fraud claim will not lie.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bristol Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5565854\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/586/148/#p163\">\n    586 F.Supp.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Complaint in its current form alleges that in May 2016, the market learned of the fraud through a press release announcing that Phase 3 \"did not achieve its primary endpoint,\" and that the overall survival rate of the Control Group exceeded that of the Treatment Group by three months. (Compl. \u00b6 128.) The Complaint's loss causation allegations are predicated on a corrective disclosure theory-that \"the available public information regarding the company's financial condition [was] corrected,\n   and [ ] the market reacted negatively to the corrective disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St. Louis v.

In advancing this theory, Plaintiffs broadly allege that upon \"revelation of these previously undisclosed facts,\" NewLink's stock \"plummeted 30.61% on heavy trading volume.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 129, 160.) More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants \"misrepresent[ed] the viability of [HyperAcute Pancreas] and its likelihood of success in the [ ] Phase 3 trial,\" and when their \"prior misrepresentations came to be revealed to investors, shares of NewLink declined precipitously.\" (Compl. \u00b6 159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   But without showing how NewLink's May 9, 2016 press release announcing the final results of the Phase 3 trial constituted a corrective disclosure-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , revealed that previous statements or omissions were false-the Complaint, at best, advances a narrative in which NewLink's stock price dropped on the disappointing news that a highly promising cancer therapy failed to clear its clinical trial.\n   <em>\n    In re Gentiva Securities Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885123\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/932/352/#p385\">\n    932 F.Supp.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (\"[L]oss causation is not adequately pled simply by allegations of a drop in stock price following an announcement of bad news if the news did not disclose the fraud.\");\n   <em>\n    Fort Worth Emp'r Ret.

Indeed, it is unclear which misrepresentations or omissions were corrected or exposed by the May 9, 2016 disclosure. Because the press release focuses on the actual survival rates of each patient group, one implication is that it corrected Defendants' misrepresentation about the Control Group's estimated survival rate. But this Court has already concluded that those allegations do not sufficiently allege falsity. And with the one category of representations that this Court found to be sufficiently alleged, the Complaint does not establish a nexus between Defendants' statements about patient enrollment and the drop in stock price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Nor have Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged loss causation under a materialization of risk theory. Loss causation alternatively may be alleged \"by showing that the loss was foreseeable and caused by the materialization of the risk concealed by the fraudulent statement.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Omnicom Grp., Inc.

Thus, \"[w]here the alleged misstatement conceals a condition or event which then occurs and causes the plaintiff's loss, a plaintiff may plead that it is the materialization of the undisclosed condition or event that causes the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Initial Pub.

Here, though news of Phase 3's failure caused the loss, Defendants repeatedly cautioned investors about a litany of risks-the inability to achieve the trial's primary endpoint, obtain FDA approval, or commercialize the drug-that could lead to a significant drop in stock value. In other words, the risk that materialized was disclosed by Defendants and known by investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Of course, allegations of loss causation \"are not subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.
