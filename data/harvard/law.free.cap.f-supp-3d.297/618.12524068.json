In the end, although respondents' arguments have some force, the text, structure, and intent of the INA compel the conclusion that petitioners are detained under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Beginning with the statutory text, \u00a7 1226(a) governs detention for an alien \"detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\" As an initial matter, this text governs petitioners' detention because until withholding-only proceedings are complete, a decision has not been made on whether petitioners will in fact be removed from the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Mem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [Dkt. No. 17] 6. As petitioners argue, \u00a7 1226(a) focuses not on a determination of removability (which has already been made) but instead on a more concrete determination of whether petitioners will actually be removed-a determination that has not yet been made in petitioners' cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, until the government determines that there is a country to which petitioners can legally be removed, the decision on whether they are \"to be removed\" remains \"pending,\" and \u00a7 1226(a) governs their detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This conclusion is reinforced by the statutory structure of the INA and evidence of Congress's intent. Section 1231 provides that the removal period will begin on the latest of three dates: the date the removal order becomes final, the date any judicial stay stopping removal is lifted, or the date the alien is released from non-immigration detention.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). As petitioners explain, each of these three preconditions simply relates to a different legal impediment to actual removal: either DHS has not completed its own removal process (the order is not final) or the judicial branch has deprived DHS of authority to execute the removal process (a judicial stay stopping removal is in place) or the criminal authorities, rather than ICE, have custody of the individual and ICE does not have jurisdiction to remove the noncitizen (the alien is in non-immigration detention). In each situation, DHS may have already determined that the noncitizen is, like petitioners here, removable, but ICE lacks the present and final legal authority to actually execute that order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, Congress clearly intended to have \u00a7 1231 govern only the final logistical period, in which the government has actual authority to remove the alien and need only schedule and execute the deportation. Congress has specifically limited the normal \"removal period\" to 90 days, a limitation that makes sense if the removal period is only meant to govern the final logistical steps of physically removing an alien. Based on the length of petitioners' detentions to date,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 25, it is obvious that withholding-only proceedings take substantially longer than 90 days. As such, it would be contrary to congressional intent to shoehorn a class of aliens whose proceedings will typically far exceed 90 days into the \"removal period\" for which Congress has specifically intended a 90-day limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Background legal principles of finality also support petitioners' view. The INA limits judicial review to a \"final order of removal,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and aliens may appeal adverse decisions in withholding-only proceedings only \"as part of the review of a final order of removal,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231 note (d). Addressing these statutes, many courts have held that a reinstated removal order is not final for purposes of judicial review until after the adjudication of any withholding applications, an interpretation the government has itself endorsed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Mem. 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would be nonsensical to adopt a \"bifurcated definition of finality\" with respect to removal orders in withholding-only proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Guerra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055268\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/59/\">\n    831 F.3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, the Court concludes that reinstated removal orders do not become \"administratively final\" for\n   purposes of \u00a7 1231 until they are final for purposes of appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moving beyond the INA context, principles of administrative law support the conclusion that a reinstated removal order is not final until after the conclusion of any withholding-only proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Mem. 7. In agency law, finality is generally achieved when an action both \"mark[s] the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process\" and also determines legal rights or obligations.\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Spear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    520 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177-78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, although some legal rights or obligations have already been determined (the petitioners are removable), the decisionmaking process is ongoing-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it has not been consummated-as the agency is still determining whether petitioners will be granted withholding of removal or will be removed. As such, under principles of administrative law, petitioners' removal orders are not \"final\"; therefore, petitioners are being detained under \u00a7 1226(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Respondents' arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, they argue that the text of \u00a7 1226(a) supports their position because petitioners' removal orders have already been reinstated; as such, the decision on whether petitioners are \"to be removed\" is no longer \"pending.\" Resp. Mem. 4. In addition, they argue that withholding-only proceedings only address the possibility of executing a removal order to a particular country but do not prohibit immediate removal of petitioners to a different country based on the reinstated orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. This reasoning is incomplete. Although DHS may eventually be able to remove petitioners to some third country even if their application for withholding of removal is granted, third-country removal would require additional proceedings. At the least, DHS would be required to give petitioners notice and the opportunity for a hearing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kossov v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11887220\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/405/#p408\">\n    132 F.3d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408-09 (7th Cir. 1998). Moreover, the provision allowing for the removal of detainees to additional countries,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), places sharp limitations on the countries that the government may designate for removal-and respondents have not shown that there are any countries that meet those limitations for petitioners. Finally, as a practical matter, the United States of America generally cannot simply\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   deport an alien to a country where he or she does not have citizenship; instead, the government must typically get permission to deport from the third country.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , 533 U.S. at 684,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the government could not deport the petitioner to Germany, Lithuania, or the Dominican Republic despite his ties to those countries because those countries would not accept him). As such, it is not clear at the present time that petitioners are in fact \"to be removed\" from the United States. All that is clear is that they are removable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Turning to the text of \u00a7 1231(a)(5), respondents argue that the provision makes clear that the removal period has begun for petitioners. Because a reinstated removal order \"is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,\" respondents argue that petitioners' removal orders are \"administratively final\" and petitioners are detained under \u00a7 1231. Resp. Mem. 15-17 (internal quotation marks omitted). This argument is unpersuasive. Although the INA indicates that reinstated removal orders are final in the ordinary case, other regulatory provisions that bear more closely on withholding-only proceedings emphasize that aliens in these proceedings are situated differently from the ordinary alien subject to a reinstated removal order. For example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.8\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) provides an \"[e]xception\" to the reinstatement-of-removal regulations when an alien applies\n   for withholding of removal. In addition, the text of \u00a7 1231(a)(5) does not squarely answer the question presented.
