Necessary caveat concerning suppression of evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nevertheless, the government's position in this case warrants additional comment. The Aboshady Warrant employs a multi-step process. First, Section II of Warrant Attachment B instructs Google to copy and provide to the government the entire contents of the specified email account. Second, Section I of Warrant Attachment B provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [l]aw enforcement personnel will then search the account duplicate for the records and data to be seized, which are described in Section III below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Section III specifies categories of \"records and data to be searched and seized by law enforcement personnel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that \"[o]n its face, the Aboshady Warrant resembles the forbidden general warrant\" because it authorizes the government to search,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [a]ll data files associated with ... [Dr. Aboshady's personal gmail account], [including the] contents of all email, whether draft, deleted, sent, or received, [the] content of all text or instant messages, [the] contents of all electronic data files, whether word-processing, spreadsheet, image, video, or any other content, [the] contents of all calendar data, [l]ists of friends, buddies, contacts, or any other subscribers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To the contrary, Section III specifies that the government may seize,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201347\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ... the identity of the person or persons who have owned or operated the email accounts ... the existence and identity of any co-conspirators ... the travel or whereabouts of the person or persons who have owned or operated the e-mail accounts ... [and] the identity, location and ownership of any computers used to access these email accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant submits that \"in contrast to the digital data to be searched by the government, [Section III] is particularized.\" The structure of the warrant, combined with the different categories listed in the separate sections of the warrant, implies that the set of data described in Section III of the warrant is more restricted than the universe of section II. The government maintains, however, that this is not the case. Every one of the 430,081 retrieved documents is purportedly responsive to the warrant. The government explains that some emails identify the defendant or co-conspirators as operators of the email account. Even emails that include no identifying information or substance whatsoever are responsive to the warrant, says the government, because the emails \"help to establish the location of the defendant and the computer operating the email account ... based on the header information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for the government stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We don't believe any documents are non-responsive because the defendant has indicated that he's going to present a defense that he didn't operate the\n   account, at least at certain periods of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The government also asserts that it did not catalogue the emails into \"responsive\" and \"non-responsive\" designations because it was not feasible. It explains that retention of all of the emails for more than three and a half years is \"reasonable\" because \"there's no feasible way\" for the government to sort the emails into responsive or non-responsive categories. Furthermore, the government maintains, \"it's not feasible for the government to go and delete non-responsive emails\" because 1) there is no reasonable culling process available and 2) it would take an inordinate number of FBI man hours to accomplish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The warrant process \"is primarily concerned with identifying what may be search or seized-not how,\"\n   <em>\n    U.S.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Upham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11640010\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/532/#p537\">\n    168 F.3d at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government's contention that it may therefore indefinitely hold electronic information for subsequent searches threatens, however, to breach the reasonableness requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This issue arises from the intersection of the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement and its prohibition of unreasonable seizures. A warrant must 1) limit the executing agent's \"judgment in selecting where to search and what to seize\" and 2) cannot be so broad as to include \"items that should not be seized.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kuc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732418\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/129/#p133\">\n    737 F.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Upham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11640010\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/532/#p537\">\n    168 F.3d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (1st Cir.1999) ). Some courts have suggested that, because of the \"nature of digital storage, it is not always feasible to extract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive data.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ulbricht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p99\">\n    858 F.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99-100 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nevertheless, reasonableness requires that searches and seizures by the government be \"conducted in a manner that minimizes unwarranted intrusions upon privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Andresen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179008\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/463/\">\n    427 U.S. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482 n. 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179008\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/463/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179008\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/463/\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). Although defendant's request for suppression in this particular case and under these particular circumstances will be denied, the government's continued responsibility to minimize the extent and duration of digital discovery is not abrogated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant avers that the indictment should be dismissed because the government presented inaccurate and misleading evidence to the grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   An indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, if valid on its face, is sufficient to require a trial on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032821\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/359/#p363\">\n    350 U.S. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032821\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/359/#p363\">\n    76 S.Ct. 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20L.%20Ed.%20397\">\n    100 L.Ed. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956).

A court may dismiss an indictment if there has been prosecutorial misconduct which actually biases a jury in performing its fact-finding function.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525286\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/873/1/#p3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dismissal may be warranted where the government conduct is \"so egregious as to deceive, overreach, or overbear the will of the grand jurors.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661697\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/13/#p17\">\n    738 F.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1st Cir. 1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant submits that the government, by implying that Dr. Mashali, defendant's uncle, had been indicted in this case, misled the grand jury into believing that another decisionmaker had already found probable cause to believe a crime had been committed. The government responds that it introduced ample specific information tying Dr. Aboshady to the crimes in the indictment. Finally, defendant maintains that the \"integrity of the grand jury process\" was not preserved because there is no evidence that the government\n   instructed the grand jury to exercise its own independent judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The government rejoins that it did, in fact, issue such a limiting instruction to the grand jury but that it is unwilling to produce in discovery the relevant excerpt of the grand jury transcript. At the hearing on this motion, the government presented that excerpt to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   review and, after such review, the Court is satisfied that the grand jury was properly instructed with respect to the exercise of its independent judgment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661697\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/13/#p17\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (affirming denial defendant's motion to dismiss where the government \"instructed the grand jury to disregard the testimony that was unrelated to the charges before it\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant's additional contentions are unavailing. He claims that the government failed to establish that the alleged false statement made with respect to Patients F, G, I and J were made \"in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services\" as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201035\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indictment notes, however, that health care benefit programs \"retained the right to audit health care providers after payment was made.\" The indictment also alleges that defendant falsely altered medical files to avoid detection by such an audit. Accordingly, the indictment sufficiently describes a connection between the defendant's charged acts and \u00a7 1035.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chhibber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896913\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/852/#p860\">\n    741 F.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (7th Cir. 2014) (finding sufficient connection under \u00a7 1035 where defendant added \"made-up medical symptoms and diagnoses in his patients' charts in order to backstop his claims for benefits from Blue Cross Blue Shield\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, defendant avers that the indictment is not only internally inconsistent but also inconsistent with the evidence presented to the jury.
