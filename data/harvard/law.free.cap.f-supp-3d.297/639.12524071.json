(Reporter's R., vol. 6, State's Ex. 1, doc. 14-10.) Petitioner was later charged with violating multiple requirements of his civil commitment, a third-degree felony, and was found guilty by a jury on eleven such counts.

(5th Cir. J. 3, doc. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To assist the reader, the Court reiterates the factual history of the case as summarized by the Second District Court of Appeals of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2008, Russell agreed to a final judgment identifying him as a sexually violent predator as defined in health and safety code section 841.003 and ordering him to be civilly committed for outpatient treatment and supervision in accordance with chapter 841 of the health and safety code. In addition to addressing Russell's treatment and supervision, the order of civil commitment required him to \"reside in supervised housing at a Texas residential facility under contract with the Council on Sex Offender Treatment (Council)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   or at another location or facility approved by the Council\"; to \"submit to tracking under a global positioning satellite (GPS) monitor or other monitoring system provided\"; to \"exactingly participate in and comply with the specific course of treatment provided by the Council\"; and to \"comply with all written requirements of the Council and case manager.\" The commitment order also contained the following notice: \"\n   <strong>\n    EDWARD RUSSELL shall strictly comply with the commitment requirements of\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 841.082\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    and this Order of Commitment, or will be charged with a felony of the third degree, which may be enhanced to a more severe punishment.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   At the outset of his commitment and treatment, Russell reviewed and agreed to abide by all of the rules and requirements contained in the following documents: \"Civil Commitment Requirements: Standard Requirements of the Treatment Program\"; \"Council on Sex Offender Treatment Supervision Requirements\"; \"Council on Sex Offender Treatment Additional Supervision Requirements\"; and \"Council on Sex Offender Treatment Global Positioning Tracking Service Requirements for MTD.\" In 2009 and 2010, Russell signed additional documents evidencing his agreement to abide by various requirements of his commitment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   During the course of his outpatient treatment and supervision, Russell failed to comply with numerous written treatment requirements. Consequently, in May 2010, he was unsuccessfully discharged early from the sex offender treatment program. Russell was later\n   indicted on eleven counts of violating a civil commitment requirement as a sexually violent predator.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   At trial, Russell's former case managers, Wesley Griffin and Lawrence Daniels, testified about Russell's violations of his treatment requirements. After convicting Russell on each count, and upon his plea of true to the repeat offender notice, the jury assessed Russell's punishment at twenty years' confinement and a $10,000 fine for each count. The trial court sentenced Russell accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Mem. Op. 2-4, doc. 14-4 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner asserts that the version of chapter 841 under which he was convicted is unconstitutional on its face and as applied \"for allowing private citizens, appointed by \u00a7 841, unfetterd power to deny a specific group of U.S. citizens their constitutionally protected rights by setting rules and regulations doing so, that are enforced by \u00a7 841 by threat of punishment.\" (Pet'r's Mem. 1, doc. 4.) According to Petitioner,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"section 841 of the Texas Health and Safty [sic] Code gives the Office, their case workers, and their treatment providers, all of whom are private citizens without any formal education in constitutional law, the authority to decide what is appropriate and necessary treatment, supervision, and standards of care (.007 and .141(b) ), without providing them with written guidelines or providing safeguards to prevent arbitrary, discriminate [sic], and oppressive rules that, upon violation of these rules, constitute a criminal offense (841.085).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Id. at 4.) Petitioner raised a vagueness and overbreadth claim in his state habeas application, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied the application without written order. (State Habeas R. 7-8 &amp; Action Taken, docs. 14-18 &amp; 14-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court will not be granted with respect\n   to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the petitioner shows that the prior adjudication: (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court, or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Therefore, under the first prong, applicable to this case, this Court may grant habeas relief only if the state court's adjudication of petitioner's claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, the law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hill, Grayned,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kolender\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Former \u00a7 841.085 of the Texas Health and Safety Code provides that \"[a] person commits an offense if, after having been adjudicated and civilly committed as a sexually violent predator under this chapter, the person violates a civil commitment requirement imposed under Section 841.082.\" Act of May 27, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 1219, \u00a7 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%204115\">\n    2007 Tex.

The phrase \"specific course of treatment\" is not defined in the statutory scheme and does not provide an ordinary person fair notice of what conduct it punishes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kolender,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p358\">\n    461 U.S. at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p358\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . How would an ordinary person go about deciding what a \"specific course of treatment\" involves or understand that failing to keep a \"thought journal,\" failing to complete a \"high risk plan\" or \"what if\" assignment, engaging in anonymous or casual sex, or masturbating to the thoughts of a male child is potentially unlawful? Clearly, the \"specific course of treatment\" for any person must be decided by professionals specifically trained in the area and may be subject to change over time. Thus, the problem is not what the provision is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty without notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that prior \u00a7 841.085 and \u00a7 841.082(4) of the Texas Health and Safety Code under which Petitioner was convicted are overly vague. Accordingly, the state court's denial of Petitioner's claim is contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Hill, Grayned, and Kolender .\n   </em>\n   This conclusion is further reinforced by the state legislature's subsequent revision of \u00a7 841.085 to decriminalize the failure to abide by a similar provision in the revised statute \"requiring the person's participation in and compliance with the sex offender treatment program provided by the office and compliance with all written requirements imposed by the office.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
