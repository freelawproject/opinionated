The United States Supreme Court found that the California approach amounted to a \"loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction\" and held that because the California approach had allowed for claims to proceed against Bristol-Myers despite the lack of a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue, the approach did not comport with \"settled principles of personal jurisdiction\" and exceeded the due process limits of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1781-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Launch, a Delaware limited-liability company, [Doc. 1 \u00b6 21], with a single office located at its headquarters in Illinois, [Doc. 16-1 (Declaration of Jean Rollo, Launch's Chief Operating Officer (\"Rollo Decl.\") ) \u00b6 7], contends that it lacks contacts with Georgia sufficient to establish general jurisdiction, [Doc. 16 at 2-3, 5-7], and that the Court would not have specific jurisdiction over individual claims asserted by the unnamed class plaintiffs because there is no connection between their individual claims and Launch's few activities within the state of Georgia, [Doc. 16-1 at 2, 7-10]. Plaintiff does not rebut the arguments, thus inherently conceding the issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kramer v. Gwinnett Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9265027\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/1219/#p1221\">\n    306 F.Supp.2d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1221 (N.D. Ga. 2004) (Evans, J.) (explaining that where a party fails to respond to any portion of a motion, that portion, claim, or defense is waived).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Launch does admit,\n   however, that Plaintiff \"appears to properly assert specific jurisdiction,\" as his claims \"arguably arose within this jurisdiction.\" [Doc. 34 at 9]. Thus, the question presented to the Court is whether, in light of the due-process concerns driving dismissal of the claims of the non-resident plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , personal jurisdiction may be had over Launch with regard to the claims of the non-resident class members on the strength of the Court's specific jurisdiction over the claims of the named plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After careful review, the Court concludes that due-process concerns do not foreclose its exercise of personal jurisdiction over Launch as to the claims of the resident named plaintiff both on his own behalf and on behalf of the unnamed non-resident plaintiffs. Launch's argument that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   is analogous to this case is not without logical appeal: California's \"sliding-scale\" approach to specific jurisdiction does bear some resemblance to a court's exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant as to the claims of unnamed non-resident members of the plaintiff class by allowing the unnamed non-resident plaintiff class members to ride the coattails of the named plaintiff's assertion of specific jurisdiction over the defendant as to the named plaintiff's claims. Acceptance of the analogy would require, however, that the Court, like Launch, disregard material differences between mass actions and class actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a mass tort action such as\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , each plaintiff is a real party in interest, meaning that each plaintiff is personally named and required to effect service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reviewing the claims of the non-resident plaintiffs on a motion to quash service of summons).

Launch fails to recognize, however, that Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also sets forth certification procedures that protect the defendant's due-process rights: in particular, the requirements that there be \"questions of law or fact common to the class\" and that \"the claims ... of the representative parties are typical of the claims ... of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, to assert a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) or 23(b)(3), as Plaintiff seeks to do here, the Federal Rules require that the plaintiff also show that \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), or prove to the presiding court that \"questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy,\" considering matters such as \"the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum\" and \"the likely difficulties in managing a class action,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Thus, in contrast to a mass action like\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , which may-and likely would-present significant variations in the plaintiffs' claims, the requirements of Rule 23 class certification ensure that the defendant is presented with a unitary, coherent claim to which it need respond only with a unitary, coherent defense. Because of the unitary nature of that class claim, the Court perceives no unfairness in haling the defendant into court to answer to it in a forum that has specific jurisdiction over the defendant based on the representative's claim.
