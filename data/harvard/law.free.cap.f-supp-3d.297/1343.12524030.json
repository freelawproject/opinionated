D.E. 37 \u00b6 17; D.E. 60 \u00b6 5(i)-(ii). The Letter provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The firm represents the above referenced creditor in the matter of your unpaid account.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     This debt is overdue and we will use all legally appropriate means for collection.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   If there is some dispute as to the amount of this claim, we will consider any information you wish to give us.

As an initial matter, Defendant agrees that it is not, and at the time of mailing the February 1, 2017 Letter was not, licensed as a consumer collection agency under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.553\">\n    Fla.

Second, however, Defendant argues that Plaintiff misinterprets\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   and cases interpreting\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   . According to Defendant, the\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   court did not hold that a debt collection agency's failure to register under the FCCPA necessarily constitutes a violation of the FDCPA; instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that failure to register\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   violate the FDCPA where the \"conduct or communication at issue ... also violate the relevant provision[s] of the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 44 p. 8, \u00b6 44;\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225498\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/1185/\">\n    601 F.3d at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's FDCPA claim hinges entirely on Defendant's failure to register under Florida law, which is insufficient to render Defendant liable under the FDCPA and\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   , because Plaintiff must also show a violation of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     another\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   FDCPA provision before it can prevail on his FDCPA claim. D.E. 53 p. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Lastly, Defendant argues that, in any event, Defendant is exempt from the registration requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.553\">\n    Fla.

McCarthy, Jr. (\"McCarthy\") the attorney and solo practitioner operating Defendant's law firm, filed in support of Defendant's Response. D.E. 53 pp. 10-15. In the affidavit, McCarthy states, in relevant part, that: (1) Defendant \"does not purchase debt on any market;\" (2) Defendant is \"hired by clients to collect debts owed to the client;\" (3) Defendant \"does not solicit consumer debt accounts for collection from credit grantors who have a business presence in Florida;\" and (4) therefore, Defendant \"by statute, is exempt from registration.\" D.E. 53 pp. 10-11, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11-12, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After carefully reviewing the parties' arguments and the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that Plaintiff is entitled to partial summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit reversed the trial court's entry of summary\n   judgment in favor of a debt collector, where the debt collector: (1) failed to register as a consumer collection agency, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.553\">\n    Fla.

In doing so, the\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   Court explained that based on the legislative history of the FCCPA and FDCPA, as well as an analysis of the plain language of both statutes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   We therefore hold that a violation of the FCCPA for failure to register may, in fact, support a federal cause of action under Section 1692e(5) of the FDCPA for threatening to take an action it could not legally take.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   As explained herein, we do not hold that all debt collector actions in violation of state law constitute\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violations of the FDCPA.

D.E. 1-6 (stating that \"[t]his communication is from a debt collector,\" that the \"purpose for this letter is to collect a debt,\" and Defendant intended to use \"all legally appropriate means for collection,\" including possibly \"filing ... a lawsuit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, Defendant's February 1, 2017 notice therefore violated various substantive provisions of the FDCPA. In particular, the Letter was, under the \"least sophisticated consumer\" standard\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   : (1) \"false, deceptive [and] misleading\", in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10) because it would lead a consumer to wrongfully believe that Defendant was lawfully permitted to directly engage Plaintiff for repayment of the outstanding debt; (2) a \"false representation of the character, amount, or legal status\" of the debt, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A), because it would lead a consumer to wrongfully believe that Defendant could take legal action, in its capacity as an unlicensed Florida debt collector, to recover the debt; and (3) a \"threat to take any action that cannot be legally taken,\" in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(4), because it would lead a consumer to conclude that Defendant threatened legal action that Defendant could not legally take in its capacity as an unlicensed debt collector under Florida law.\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225498\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/1185/\">\n    601 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1190 ;\n   <em>\n    Balthazor\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-60867-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20171097\">\n    2012 WL 171097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambroise\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-22444-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206080454\">\n    2016 WL 6080454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, the Court finds that there is,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     just barely\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether Defendant is entitled to the \"out-of-state consumer debt collection\" exemption set forth under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.553\">\n    Fla.

In particular, McCarthy offered a sworn affidavit in support of Defendant's Response which stated, in relevant part, that: (1) Defendant \"does not purchase debt on any market;\" (2) the creditors of the debt at issue in this case, Forest Recovery Services, LLC and Boca Raton Gastroenterology have offices in the State of Florida; (3) Defendant \"does not solicit consumer debt accounts for collection from credit grantors [such as Forest Recovery Services, LLC and Boca Raton Gastroenterology] who have a business presence in Florida;\" and (4) Defendant is, therefore, \"by statute, exempt from registration.\" D.E. 53 pp. 10-11, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11-12, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   McCarthy's affidavit is, to a large degree, conclusory, lacks specific supporting facts and contains inadmissible legal conclusions. Thus, the Court takes serious issue with McCarthy's affidavit. Still, McCarthy's affidavit does offer evidence unrefuted by Plaintiff, based on his McCarthy's personal knowledge, that: (1) Defendant \"does not purchase debt on any market;\" (2) the creditors of the debt at issue in this case, Forest Recovery Services, LLC and Boca Raton Gastroenterology have offices in the State of Florida; and (3) Defendant \"does not solicit consumer debt accounts for collection from credit grantors [such as Forest Recovery Services, LLC and Boca Raton Gastroenterology] who have a business presence in Florida.\" D.E. 53 pp. 10-11, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This evidence is just enough to defeat summary judgment with respect to the FCCPA exemption under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.553\">\n    Fla.
