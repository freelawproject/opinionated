Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns how much federal money Plaintiff Rocky Mountain Health Maintenance Organization is entitled to in reimbursement for delivering Medicare services. Plaintiff is a \"cost-reimbursed\" Health Maintenance Organization (\"HMO\") that contracts with Defendant, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to provide hospital, doctor, and patient care services to Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in its health care plans. Unlike some HMOs, Plaintiff does not directly deliver patient services to enrollees. Rather, it contracts with physicians and other suppliers for that purpose. Defendant reimburses Plaintiff for the \"reasonable cost\" of those services using a formula that estimates their total price tag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The manner in which Plaintiff calculates its federal reimbursement requests is at the heart of this dispute. Defendant takes issue with Plaintiff's inclusion of so-called \"carrier-paid claims\" within Plaintiff's cost reports that Plaintiff submitted to secure\n   final reimbursement. These types of claims are deviations from the norm. Ordinarily, Plaintiff directly pays health care providers for patient care. In a minority of cases, however, the health care provider bills a Medicare contractor, known as a carrier, who processes the claim and pays the provider directly, thus leaving Plaintiff out of the payment process. This latter situation is known as a \"carrier-paid claim.\" Plaintiff included carrier-paid claims in its cost reports for a four-year period, which, according to Defendant, resulted in Plaintiff receiving a roughly $15.75 million windfall. Plaintiff, on the other hand, believes that the controlling Medicare regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20417.560\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 417.560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\"the Regulation\"), allows the inclusion of carrier-paid claims in its reimbursement calculations. Therefore, Plaintiff asserts, it was entitled to receive the amount in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In proceedings before the agency, Plaintiff challenged an auditor's decision to reduce Plaintiff's allowed reimbursements by $15.75 million for the four-year period on the ground that carrier-paid claims are not reimbursable. At first, Plaintiff found success. It convinced a panel of two Hearing Officers with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") that its interpretation of the Regulation was the correct one. Defendant, however, appealed the Hearing Officers' decision to the CMS Administrator, who reversed. The CMS Administrator concluded that Defendant's interpretation of the Regulation was sound and therefore Plaintiff had to repay the government for the overpayment. Plaintiff then filed this action challenging the Administrator's determination, contesting both the substance of the decision and the process used to reach it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the court grants Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment in part and remands this matter to Defendant to resolve two issues that Plaintiff raised during the agency proceedings but which the Administrator did not address: (1) whether the Administrator had the authority to review the Hearing Officers' decision; and (2) whether the Administrator's failure to complete its review within 60 days of the Hearing Officers' ruling caused the Hearing Officers' decision to become final. As a result of the decision to remand this matter, the court declines at this time to consider the parties' remaining contested disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Among the \"procedural rules for a Board hearing\" is the requirement that \"[t]he date of rendering any decision after the review by the Administrator\n   <em>\n    must be\n   </em>\n   no later than 60 days after the date of receipt by the provider of a reviewable Board decision or action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405.1801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 405.1875(a)(1) (emphasis added).

The Administrator did not say, for instance, that the 60-day period was inapplicable to review of nonprovider disputes; to the contrary, it stated that its \"review is during the 60-day period mandated in \u00a7 1878(f)(1).\" JA at 2. Nor did the Administrator offer a reason for why its untimely decision did not operate to make the Hearing\n   Officers' ruling the final agency action. Accordingly, for the reasons already discussed, the court must remand this matter to the Administrator to address these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Once more Defendant tries to fill the gap left by the Administrator.

If the Board's procedural rules are to apply \"to the maximum extent possible\" when reviewing nonprovider reimbursement disputes, does the 60-day rule have the same force and effect for review of nonprovider disputes as it does for the review of provider disputes?
