The defendant has moved to dismiss the indictment, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b), asserting that the government has not stated a cognizable offense. He argues that \u00a7 844(e), as applied to his conduct, (1) exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, and (2) criminalizes speech protected by the First Amendment. He also claims the government cannot satisfy \u00a7 844(e)'s\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement of either willful or malicious and knowing conduct. Issues of fact exist as to whether the defendant's conduct falls within Congress's reach and whether the defendant acted with the requisite intent under \u00a7 844(e) for criminal liability to attach. For these reasons, the defendant's motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. The Supreme Court has \"identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power[:]\" (1) \"the use of the channels of interstate commerce,\" (2) \"the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities,\" and (3) \"those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce\" despite being themselves wholly intrastate, \"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those [intrastate] activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court also has recognized, however, that Congress lawfully may regulate conduct that has a \"connection with or effect on interstate commerce\" that is merely \"explicit\" rather than \"substantial,\" where a statute contains an \"express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach\" to such conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p558\">\n    at 561-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p558\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, how strong an impact on interstate commerce must the activity have? The D.C. Circuit held, in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   's wake, that the magnitude of charged conduct's impact on interstate commerce needed to sustain a federal criminal statute's application turns on whether the statute contains a jurisdictional element.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 1997). In charging conduct under a statute lacking a jurisdictional element, the government must show that the conduct had a \"substantial\" impact on interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640857,3703882\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640857,3703882\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1460/\">\n    at 1467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
