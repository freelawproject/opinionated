Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Alfred Dewayne Brown was tried and convicted for capital murder. He spent just over 12 years in prison, most of that time on death row. After the discovery and production of previously withheld exculpatory evidence, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals vacated Brown's conviction and sentence and remanded the case to the Harris County trial court. Months later, after the District Attorney declined to reprosecute, the court granted Brown's motion to dismiss and released him from custody. In this federal suit, Brown seeks damages under \u00a7 1983 from the City of Houston, Harris County, Houston Police Department Detective Breck McDaniel, Harris County Assistant District Attorney Daniel Rizzo, current Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, and Houston Police Department Officers Ted Bloyd and D.L. Robertson, for their roles in Brown's conviction. All defendants move to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This summary of relevant facts is drawn from Brown's complaint and documents in the public record from his trial, appeal, and habeas proceedings. On April 3, 2003, three men-Elijah \"Ghetto\" Joubert, Dashan \"Shawn\" Glaspie, and an unidentified third man-went to an Ace Check Cashing store in South Houston to rob it. Glaspie and the third man waited inside a neighboring furniture store while Joubert waited for the store clerk, Alfredia Jones, to arrive. Joubert forced her into the store and demanded that she open the safe. Jones responded that she had to call the store's headquarters to open the safe. When she made the call, she gave the code for a robbery, which resulted in alerting the Houston Police Department. When Houston Police Officer Charles Clark arrived, he fired one shot at the three men, but his gun jammed before he could fire a second. One of the three men shot Officer Clark, killing him instantly. One of the three men shot and killed Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Earlier that morning, Joubert, Glaspie, and an unidentified third man had tried to rob a different check-cashing establishment, but they left when the store owner showed them his gun. Shortly after that, two women, LaTonya Hubbard and Letisha Price, saw and talked briefly to Glaspie, Joubert, and a third man, later identified as Ernest \"Deuce\" Matthews, at a local gas station. All five individuals lived at the same apartment complex. Neither Hubbard, Price, the check-cashing store owner, nor the furniture-store owner identified Brown as the third man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After fleeing Ace Check Cashing in Glaspie's car, the three men returned to the apartment complex where Glaspie and Joubert lived. News of the robbery, including a description of Glaspie's car, broke almost immediately. Latonya Hubbard's sister, Lisa Hubbard, called the police and reported that she had seen Glaspie, Joubert, and a third man near Glaspie's car at the apartment complex earlier that day. Lisa Hubbard later identified that third man as Ernest Mathews. At Brown's trial, however, Lisa Hubbard testified that Brown was the third man with Glaspie and Joubert. After the trial, she signed an affidavit stating that her trial testimony was incorrect and that her original identification was the truth. She stated that Rizzo had pressured her to testify falsely to incriminate Brown by identifying him as the third man. Hubbard was specific as to Rizzo's pressure tactics. She stated that he threatened her with a perjury indictment and an indictment for stealing the reward money she had received for coming forward, unless she identified Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brown alleges that Rizzo also pressured LaTonya Hubbard to falsely identify him as the third man, and that Rizzo pressured a third witness, Sharonda Simon, to falsely testify that she had seen Brown sitting in Glaspie's car the morning of the murders. Brown alleges that Rizzo threatened Simon with causing her to lose custody of her children. Simon later admitted that her trial testimony identifying Brown was not true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the murders, Brown lived with his girlfriend, Ericka Dockery. On the day of his arrest, Brown gave police an alibi. He was at home the morning when murders were committed. Dockery confirmed Brown's account with significant detail. Brown alleges that Rizzo repeatedly threatened, intimidated, and harassed Dockery to change her grand jury testimony to inculpate Brown. Rizzo threatened Dockery with an indictment for perjury and to have her children removed from her custody unless she incriminated Brown. When she refused, Rizzo did charge Dockery with three counts of aggravated perjury. She sat in jail for four months, unable to afford bail, until she was released in\n   December 2003 under a plea agreement she negotiated with Rizzo. The agreement required Dockery to meet with Houston Police Department detectives once a week about her testimony or go back to jail. Brown alleges that this coercion and intimidation caused Dockery to change her grand jury and trial testimony to testify that Brown was not at the apartment when the murders were committed. Dockery provided a posttrial affidavit recanting her testimony and detailing Rizzo's intimidation. Brown alleges that Dockery's cousin, Reginald Jones, also corroborated Brown's alibi, but that the police refused to consider his statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Glaspie was the primary witness against Brown at his 2004 trial. Glaspie had previously confessed his involvement to the police. Brown alleges that Glaspie received a reduced sentence-30 years instead of a possible death sentence-in exchange for falsely testifying against Brown. Brown alleges that Rizzo knowingly elicited false testimony from Glaspie that Joubert had shot Jones, when Rizzo had reason to believe that Glaspie himself had shot her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to witness intimidation to produce perjured testimony, Brown alleges that Rizzo and the police unreasonably pursued him despite ample and consistent evidence that he had no involvement in the murders. Brown alleges that the police failed to investigate Jero Dorty, a suspect in a earlier aggravated robbery who the evidence pointed to as the third man involved in this robbery-murder. Telephone records showed that Dorty was a known associate of Joubert, who years later identified Dorty as the third man involved in the robbery-murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brown was convicted and sentenced to death. In April 2013, after Brown had been incarcerated for years, appealed without success, and filed a habeas petition, Houston Police Officer McDaniel \"discovered\" telephone records from the investigation of Brown's case in his home garage. McDaniel turned the records over to the Harris County District Attorney's Office, which had been subpoenaed to produce them in Brown's habeas case. The District Attorney's Office contacted Judge Ellis, the Harris County district court judge presiding over Brown's pending state habeas petition. Brown alleges that the telephone records corroborated Dockery's evidence in support of his alibi and showed that her recanted testimony had been obtained by intimidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2013, Judge Ellis entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Brown's habeas petition. Judge Ellis held that the State had withheld material exculpatory evidence. In November 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals vacated Brown's conviction, finding that the State had committed\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations by withholding the telephone records. The case was remanded to the trial court. In June 2015, after the State declined to retry Brown and moved to dismiss the indictment, the trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case. Brown was released from prison. He had spent twelve years there, ten on death row.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brown alleges the following grounds for relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. violations of \u00a7 1983,\n   </strong>\n   by fabricating evidence, against all defendants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. violations of \u00a7 1983,\n   </strong>\n   by failing to disclose material evidence, against Harris County, Rizzo, and McDaniel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    3. violations of \u00a7 1983,\n   </strong>\n   by concealing or conspiring to conceal evidence about Brown's whereabouts and failing to pursue other known leads, against the City of Houston and McDaniel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    4. violations of \u00a7 1983 and the 5th, 8th, or 14th Amendments,\n   </strong>\n   by creating unconstitutional customs, policies,\n   and practices, against Harris County;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    5. violations of \u00a7 1983,\n   </strong>\n   for unconstitutional polices, customs, and practices by the Houston Police Department, against the City of Houston;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    6. violations of \u00a7 1983 on a municipal and supervisory liability theory,\n   </strong>\n   against the City of Houston; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    7. violations of \u00a7 1983 on a municipal and supervisory liability theory,\n   </strong>\n   against Harris County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   All defendants have moved to dismiss. Kim Ogg and Harris County filed a joint motion to dismiss, (Docket Entry No. 9), and Rizzo filed a separate motion, (Docket Entry No. 7). Brown filed a consolidated response to both. (Docket Entry No. 22). The City of Houston, McDaniel, Bloyd, and Robertson filed a single motion to dismiss, (Docket Entry No. 24), to which Brown responded. (Docket Entry No. 32). Rizzo, Ogg, and the City defendants all replied to Brown's response. (Docket Entry Nos. 25, 26, 33). The motions and responses raise different issues; all are analyzed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to Harris County, these claims do not require dismissal of the charges for \"a favorable termination\" triggering \u00a7 1983 claim accrual. Instead, the County argues, Brown's claims based on the allegations that the defendants had withheld exculpatory evidence accrued when Brown was aware of the injury, that is, when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals recognized that a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation had occurred and set aside his conviction and remanded. For this proposition, Harris County relies on\n   <em>\n    Brandley\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the Fifth Circuit had recognized that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -based \u00a7 1983 claims do not require a favorable termination in the form of dismissal for accrual.\n   <em>\n    Brandley\n   </em>\n   does not say this, explicitly or implicitly.

The Fifth Circuit distinguished between Brandley's state-law claims for malicious prosecution and his claims for false arrest, a decision later refined by\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   . But the Fifth Circuit did not distinguish between Brandley's claims grounded in\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations and those resting on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Most circuits considering the issue do not distinguish between when a plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -based \u00a7 1983 claims accrue and when \u00a7 1983 claims based on other grounds accrue.

Harris County argues that, even if the court found that the County could be liable for the misconduct of the District Attorney or Assistant District Attorney, Brown fails to plead facts showing\n   that a Harris County policymaker had notice of a pattern of prior similar violations. (Docket Entry No. 9 at 14). Brown again argues that he has sufficiently alleged a pattern and practice of prior\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations; that Harris County ratified Rizzo's unconstitutional conduct; and that it would be premature to dismiss his claims as opposed to considering them after an opportunity for discovery into Harris County's policies and practices and knowledge of prior similar cases.

Rule 11 permits discovery and consideration of the arguments on a fuller record, by summary judgment or at trial.

In so doing, we expressly required the district court to apply 'Rule 8(a)(2)'s short and plain' standard' to the complaint.

(Docket Entry No. 33 at 18). Brown, however, defines the violation quite specifically as a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation of knowingly concealing exculpatory evidence. McDaniel's argument is that a reasonable officer would not have known that concealing exculpatory Police Department records in his home garage would be unlawful. To state that argument reveals it as unpersuasive, particularly in light of the years of delay in producing the records, even when they were sought in the state litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   McDaniel argues that Brown draws an illogical inference that he knowingly and intentionally concealed records. (Docket Entry No. 33 at 17). McDaniel argues that he would not have turned the records over to the District Attorney if he intended to conceal them. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Brown, however, the facts alleged support his \u00a7 1983 claim. The phone records were \"discovered\" in McDaniel's home garage after Brown's trial and conviction. The records included handwritten notations by McDaniel made during the investigation. These notations made it clear that McDaniel was aware during the investigation that the records corroborated Dockery's testimony about Brown's alibi. Brown argues that it was objectively unreasonable for the records to have been in McDaniel's home garage at all. He notes that they were not produced until years later, and not until after Brown's habeas counsel specifically subpoenaed the records. Even then, the production was delayed. The first response to the subpoena was that the officers had conducted a diligent search of their files and found no records. McDaniel in fact had kept these police department records in his garage for years. When the records were finally produced, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found their suppression to be a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation and vacated Brown's conviction on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Brown has clearly alleged sufficient facts to state a claim that McDaniel knowingly concealed exculpatory evidence in an objectively unreasonably manner that violated Brown's clearly established constitutional rights. McDaniel is not entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of the facts Brown alleges and the record provides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As to Bloyd and Robertson, Brown alleges that they elicited false testimony from Dockery and concealed exculpatory evidence from the grand jury. Brown relies on\n   <em>\n    Geter v. Fortenberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12044433\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/849/1550/\">\n    849 F.2d 1550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1988). In\n   <em>\n    Geter\n   </em>\n   , the allegations were similar to those at issue here. The plaintiff alleged that the officer obtained false identifications of the defendant by unlawful means and deliberately concealed exculpatory evidence. Brown alleges that Bloyd and Robertson threatened and pressured Dockery into maintaining her false testimony after she was released from jail, and that they obtained three false witness statements after concealing the exculpatory phone records. (Docket Entry No. 1 at 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    Geter\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable because the \"conduct was directly focused on the defendant.\" (Docket Entry No. 33 at 16). By contrast, they argue, the conduct alleged here related to another person, Ericka Dockery. The defendants appear to make a standing argument, that the officers violated Dockery's rights and therefore Brown has no standing to assert a violation of his own rights. But here, as in\n   <em>\n    Geter\n   </em>\n   , the false statements elicited from witnesses were \"directly focused on the defendant\" and taken to secure the (innocent) defendant's indictment and conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Geter\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded the lower court's denial of summary judgment, because the plaintiff had failed to identify specific facts about the officer's actions, but instead relied on conclusory statements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12044433\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/849/1550/\">\n    849 F.2d at 1559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, Brown alleges specific threats made to specific witnesses to elicit specific false testimony against him. The defendants' argument that \"encouraging a witness to cooperate with authorities and informing them of the realistic consequences/penalties of not cooperating and/or lying to the authorities does not violate any constitutional right\" of the wrongfully targeted defendant is unpersuasive. (Docket Entry No. 33 at 17). Brown's allegations describe much more than encouraging a witness to cooperate or informing the witness about the potential consequences. Instead, Brown describes, in detail, threats and coercion against different witnesses to obtain false testimony against him. Brown has alleged sufficient plausible facts to survive a motion to dismiss on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The defendants also argue that Brown cannot sustain a \"reckless investigation\" claim under \u00a7 1983. (Docket Entry No. 33 at 19). To the extent that Brown makes a claim for an independent constitutional violation of a right to be free from reckless investigation, the defendants are correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , 397 Fed.Appx. at 966 (\"[W]e conclude that there was no freestanding, clearly established constitutional right to be free from a reckless investigation at the time ....\"). However, under\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , conduct amounting to a reckless investigation can support a \u00a7 1983 claim under for malicious prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"We did not hold that the negligent investigation and ignoring of exculpatory evidence in\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   were freestanding constitutional violations, rather, they were conduct supporting Sanders' claims for false arrest and illegal detention [under \u00a7 1983].\"). To the extent that Brown's allegations of reckless investigation\n   support his theory of liability for malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983, dismissal is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Governmental Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The City of Houston argues that Brown's official capacity claims against Bloyd, Robertson, and McDaniel are claims against the municipality and that Brown cannot show that the relevant decisionmakers had any actual knowledge of, or acted with deliberate indifference to, constitutional violations, as required for municipal liability. (Docket Entry No. 24 at 8). The City also argues that Brown does not identify a specific policymaker or a formal policy or widespread custom sufficient to establish liability. (Docket Entry No. 24 at 8). Finally, the City argues that Brown does not allege facts sufficient to show deliberate indifference or to sustain a claim of liability by ratification. (Docket Entry No. 24 at 9-10). In response, Brown argues that the City of Houston is not entitled to governmental immunity because it ratified the misconduct of its officers and maintained unconstitutional policies and customs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The official-policy arguments made by and against the City of Houston echo the arguments made as to Harris County. As with those arguments, the court finds that Brown has alleged sufficient facts for this stage of the litigation. He has identified the policymakers: Chief Bradford and Chief Hurtt of the Houston Police Department. He has identified the policies or customs and practices: to manipulate witness recollections, fail to keep and maintain adequate records, manufacture evidence, and fail to disclose exculpatory evidence. And he has identified the causal link: these policies or customs and practices led to Brown's wrongful conviction, in violation of his constitutional rights. Brown relies on a pattern of similar violations, citing examples dating back to the 1970s. Brown also argues that it would be premature to dismiss the claims at this stage, before discovery, because evidence of the policies and customs are in the exclusive control of the Houston Police Department.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155988\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/826/#p843\">\n    800 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   843 ;\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522753\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/283/524/#p532\">\n    283 F.Supp.3d at 538-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The City argues that Brown has failed to show that the relevant decisionmakers had actual or constructive knowledge of a pattern of constitutional violations. Brown cites examples from 2005 and 2009 in which the Houston Police Department dealt with mishandled evidence and irregularities from its crime lab. The City responds that these examples post-date Brown's 2003 conviction and fail to establish that the City knew of a pattern of violations at the time of Brown's alleged harm.

Brown argues that the actions of the Houston Police Department detectives were \"subject to no investigation, no reprimand and no consequences whatsoever by the Houston Police Department or its Chief\" and that the Houston Police Department's refusals to address the misconduct rises to the level of ratification. (Docket Entry No. 32 at 27). The City argues that the ratification theory is limited and applies only in extreme situations not present here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

That claim is dismissed, with prejudice, because amendment would be futile. Brown has failed to state a claim that overcomes Rizzo's defense of absolute immunity.

The County's motion to dismiss the claim against it based on Rizzo's conduct is granted, without prejudice and with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Brown has stated sufficient facts to overcome the qualified immunity defense of Bloyd, Robertson, and McDaniel, and Brown has sufficiently stated a claim against the City of Houston for unconstitutional policies.
