Therefore, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Park's passports and visas constituted \"instrumentalities\" of foreign commerce and that he utilized international \"means of communication,\" section 2423(c), absent any regulation of passports, visas, or any other means of travel or communication, does not \"direct or inhibit\" these \"instrumentalities\" or \"communications,\" and therefore does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   's second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   is misplaced, however, because in that case the Court, in assessing the criminalization of pornography that \"had traversed interstate over the Internet,\" found that \"the\n   <em>\n    trade\n   </em>\n   in child pornography is 'quintessentially economic.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3272737,3455730\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/884/\">\n    451 F.3d at 885, 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citation omitted).

As a threshold matter, the legislative history of section 2423(c) is devoid of any indication that Congress intended for section 2423(c), originally or as amended, to effectuate the Optional Protocol. Indeed, the government concedes that Congress did not reference the Optional Protocol when it enacted or amended the statute. Opp. at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, even if Congress did intend to effectuate the Optional Protocol, section 2423(c), as amended and as applied to Park's non-commercial conduct, is not rationally related to the single goal of the Optional Protocol, which was to address the States Parties' grave concerns regarding the \"\n   <em>\n    international traffic\n   </em>\n   of children.\" Optional Protocol at *7 (emphasis added). The Protocol was expressly aimed at upholding \"the right of the child to be protected from\n   <em>\n    economic\n   </em>\n   exploitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (emphasis added). The States Parties believed that criminal laws were necessary to \"reduce consumer demand\" for the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The signatories were to ensure that their laws covered child exploitation offenses committed \"domestically or\n   <em>\n    transnationally\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 3(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 2423(c)'s criminalization of non-commercial sexual abuse and the production of child pornography by an American residing in a foreign country is not \"reasonably\" or plainly adopted to implement the Protocol's goal. In this case, where there is no evidence that any remuneration or consideration was offered or exchanged, section 2423(c) does not serve to prevent the trafficking of children or alleviate their economic exploitation. Additionally, as explained above, the non-commercial conduct section 2423(c) seeks to criminalize in this\n   case is wholly disconnected from any broader market.\n   <em>\n    See supra,\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.i, at 10-13. Moreover, as applied to Park's conduct, the statute does not criminalize behavior that occurred domestically-within the United States-or transnationally-between two or more nations-as required under Article 3 of the Optional Protocol. Optional Protocol art. 3 (\"Each State Party shall ensure that ... the following acts and activities are fully covered under its criminal or penal law, whether these offences are committed domestically or transnationally.\"). Instead, it criminalizes activity that occurred only in Vietnam, and that could be handled entirely by Vietnamese law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prosecuting an American residing abroad who molests a child or produces child pornography for no commercial purpose brings the State Parties to the Optional Protocol no closer to eliminating the international market in child trafficking, and therefore the Optional Protocol does not demand or authorize Congress to enact a statute criminalizing such conduct.\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203208458\">\n    2017 WL 3208458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18. Consequently, section 2423(c), as applied to Park's alleged conduct, does not bear a rational relationship to the Optional Protocol, and therefore cannot be upheld as a valid exercise of Congressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In support of its position, the government cites to several cases finding that section 2423(c) effectuates the Optional Protocol. Gov't Resp. to Supp. Auth. at 15. However, all of these cases involved individuals charged with traveling in foreign commerce and engaging in illicit sexual conduct. The \"travels in foreign commerce\" language of section 2423(c) arguably aligns with the Optional Protocol's transnational focus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Optional Protocol art. 3. Here, there is no such transnational component, as the statute criminalizes conduct that occurred exclusively in Vietnam, long after Park had left the United States. Therefore, the cases on which the government relies do not persuade the court that, as applied to the non-commercial conduct of an American who\n   <em>\n    resided\n   </em>\n   in a foreign country, section 2423(c) is rationally related to the Optional Protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court is also unpersuaded by the government's argument that the Optional Protocol was explicitly aimed at targeting\n   <em>\n    non-commercial\n   </em>\n   child pornography. First, the government has not identified any reference to the Optional Protocol in the legislative history of the May 2015 amendment adding \"production of child pornography\" to the definition of \"illicit sexual conduct.\" And while the Optional Protocol does require States Parties to ensure that their laws criminalize the production of child pornography, this requirement applies to offenses committed domestically or transnationally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Optional Protocol art. 3. In other words, the Optional Protocol requires the United States to ensure that its laws criminalize \"producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing ... child pornography\"\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the United States or\n   <em>\n    between\n   </em>\n   the United States and another country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203208458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 3(1)(c).
