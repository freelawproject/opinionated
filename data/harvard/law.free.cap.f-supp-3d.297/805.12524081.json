Before the Court are Cross Motions for Summary Judgment [ECF Nos. 18-19, 22]. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants Defendant Giolas' Motion and denies Plaintiff's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Professional Solutions Insurance Company (\"PSIC\") brought a declaratory action seeking a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend Defendant Dale Giolas, M.D. (\"Giolas\") in an Illinois state court lawsuit. For the purposes of the coverage dispute and the cross motions before the Court, the facts are undisputed. Both parties filed Rule 56.1(a)(3) statements, but neither filed a Local Rule 56.1(b) response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , N.D. Ill. L.R. 56.1(a)(3)(C) (\"All material facts set forth in the statement required of the moving\n   party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the [ L.R. 56.1(b) ] statement of the opposing party.\"). As such, the Court considers the facts contained in both parties' statements admitted. The Court does not deem any legal conclusions admitted. The facts of the underlying state court action are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Giolas, a licensed psychiatrist, treated Staci Ferguson (\"Ferguson\") as a patient from 2011 until early 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , PSIC's 56.1(a)(3) Statement, ECF No. 20 (\"PSIC's Fact Statement\") \u00b6 4.) On August 25, 2016, Ferguson brought a lawsuit in Illinois state court alleging that Giolas repeatedly engaged in improper sexual activity with her while he was treating her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Giolas' 56.1(a)(3) Statement, ECF No. 21 (\"Giolas' Fact Statement\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; PSIC's Fact Statement \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) Ferguson alleged that Giolas' improper sexual activity violated the Sexual Exploitation in Psychotherapy, Professional Health Services, and Professional Mental Health Services Act, 740 ILCS 140/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Gender Violence Act, 740 ILCS 82/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and constituted common law battery.

Insurance Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under this framework, the Court turns to the Policy at issue. The Policy provides coverage for \"[bodily injury, sickness, disease or death sustained by any one person] caused by a[ ] [negligent omission, act or error] in the performance of [the diagnosis of, treatment or medical care for or medical consultation regarding a patient's medical condition] by [Giolas].\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Policy, \u00a7\u00a7 I-II, VIII (quoted policy definitions inserted).) PSIC argues that the Policy does not cover Giolas' alleged conduct for two reasons: (1) the Underlying Complaint does not allege negligence in the performance of professional services, and (2) the Underlying Complaint does not allege bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Giolas contends that the sexual misconduct exception in the Policy provides coverage until a final adjudication in the underlying action establishes that sexual misconduct actually occurred in the underlying action. (\n   <em>\n    See, supra\n   </em>\n   , Policy, Illinois Amendatory Endorsement at 1.) PSIC is correct that an exception to an exclusion in an insurance policy does not create coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Cas. Co. v. Donald T. Bertucci, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4299795\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/399/775/\">\n    399 Ill.App.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=339%20Ill.%20Dec.%20358\">\n    339 Ill.Dec. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=926%20N.E.2d%20833\">\n    926 N.E.2d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846 (2010) (\"[A]n exception to an exclusion does not create coverage or provide an additional basis for coverage, it only preserves coverage granted in the insuring agreement.\"). The Court must first determine whether the factual allegations potentially fall within the Policy's coverage. If so, then the Court considers whether any exclusions bar coverage. Accordingly, the Court considers whether the factual allegations recited in the Underlying Complaint potentially fall within coverage by turning to the first of PSIC's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Professional Malpractice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   PSIC argues that the Policy does not provide coverage because the Underlying Complaint does not allege negligent performance of professional services. PSIC correctly notes that the Underlying Complaint does not assert a negligence claim. However, when considering whether an insurance company has a duty to defend, a court \"should not simply look to the particular legal theories pursued by the claimant [in the underlying action], but must focus on the allegedly tortious conduct on which the lawsuit is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Medmarc Cas.

The Policy defines \"Injury\" as \"bodily injury, sickness, disease or death sustained by any one person.\" PSIC contends that the Underlying Complaint complains only of emotional distress, which is not \"bodily injury, sickness, disease or death.\" The dispute thus centers on whether claims for bodily injury are alleged in the Underlying Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Claims of emotional distress are not claims for \"bodily injury\" under Illinois law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Momence Meadows\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647735\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/689/#p696\">\n    566 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   697 n. 10. It is worth noting that injuries caused by malpractice in the field of psychiatry would intuitively include claims of emotional distress as opposed to physical injuries anticipated in the case of malpractice in a traditional doctor's office. The Court notes the incongruity of a professional liability insurance policy for a psychiatrist that does not cover emotional distress, which seems the most likely and anticipated form of damages in the event of such a doctor's malpractice. \"Judges need not check their common sense at the door when interpreting insurance policies and the plain language within them.

The Appellate Court had already held that the victim's \"injuries from the sexual assaults did not arise out of the use, operation, or maintenance of the vehicle,\" precluding automobile insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=269%20Ill.%20Dec.%20767\">\n    269 Ill.Dec. 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781 N.E.2d at 568.

Following\n   <em>\n    Cichon\n   </em>\n   's reasoning, the Court finds that the facts alleged in the Underlying Complaint potentially fall within the Policy, reading both liberally in favor of the insured, as we are required to do.\n   <em>\n    See, id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Microplastics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786443\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/806/#p810\">\n    622 F.3d at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, Ferguson's allegations of sexual misconduct suffice to allege bodily injury. The Underlying Complaint alleges that: Giolas \"repeatedly engaged in improper sexual activity with [Ferguson]\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   , Underlying Complaint \u00b6 8), including \"sexual intercourse,\" \"oral sex\" and \"kissing or intentional touching\" of private areas (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20); \"[Giolas] repeatedly touched and invaded [Ferguson] sexually\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25); \"[Giolas] subjected [Ferguson] to frequent, regular and varied sexual contact,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30); \"[Giolas] repeatedly touched [Ferguson] sexually, [and] encouraged others to touch her sexually,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33); and Giolas \"coerced [Ferguson] into ... sexual acts while she was under treatment for psychiatric conditions,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33).

It is true that the Policy\n   excludes coverage for punitive damages and the Underlying Complaint requests punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Policy, \u00a7 VIII.13; Underlying Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 35.)
