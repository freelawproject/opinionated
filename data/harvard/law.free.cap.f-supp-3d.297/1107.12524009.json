Welfare Code \u00a7 15610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and state law claims for fraud, deceit, intentional misrepresentation; and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Bryan alleges that the City of Carlsbad's Code Enforcement Department unlawfully searched a residence where she lives. Although she refers to it as her home, the property was sold in a foreclosure sale in 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl., \u00b6 7.) Although the complaint says unlawful searches occurred four times since October 23, 2009 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), the complaint only mentions one search, on March 29, 2017, which was conducted pursuant to a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, supported by requests for judicial notice. (Docket no. 8.) While that motion was pending, Bryan filed a motion for preliminary injunction (Docket no. 17), a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint (Docket no. 29), and a motion for leave to add new party defendants. (Docket no. 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bryan claims that the house belongs to her, and her claim rests heavily on this allegation. She claims she prevailed in a case in this Court and that the Court ruled in her favor, determining that she was the owner of the house. (Compl., \u00b6 30.) The only other case in which she has been a party in this Court is number 10cv1605-CAB (KSC),\n   <em>\n    Kokopelli Community Workshop\n   </em>\n   , et al.\n   <em>\n    v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In fact, the reverse happened. In case 10cv1605, the Court ruled that Bryan cannot challenge the foreclosure sale and has no ownership interest in this property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Summary Judgment (Docket no. 308) in case 10cv1605, at 7:12-19 (holding that Catherine Bryan had transferred her interest in the subject property to Kokopelli Community Workshop Corporation before the foreclosure, and therefore had no standing to challenge the foreclosure sale or otherwise claim title to the property).) (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Reconsideration (Docket no. 311) in case 10cv1605, at 1:25-2:2 (\"[P]laintiff Catherine Bryan had no title interest in the subject property at the time of foreclosure and thereafter.\").) Bryan took an appeal, which was unsuccessful, and that case is now final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The motion for preliminary injunction, which spans over 400 pages, is primarily aimed at the condemnation and demolition of the house where Bryan lives. These claims involve other parties who are not yet named as Defendants, and claims not yet added to this case. For reasons discussed at length below, Bryan's request to add these claims and parties is being denied. Furthermore, Bryan's motion falls far short of the standard for preliminary injunctive relief, and it is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to File Supplemental Complaint; and Motion to Add Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bryan filed two motions, a motion to supplement her complaint and a motion to add new Defendants. Because the motions were unclear, the Court ordered her to supplement them, which she has done. (Docket no. 32.) Defendants have filed an opposition. (Docket no. 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bryan seeks to add a claim based on an inspection report she says is false, the City of Carlsbad's notice of order to repair, and a mandatory order to demolish the house unless upgrades and repairs were made. She says that violations identified by City officers are provably false and that she is unjustly being ordered to pay for repairs or her home will be demolished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bryan wants to name as new Defendants Carlsbad city council members who, she says, are acquiescing in the City's unconstitutional action. Although her proposed supplemental complaint mentions a conspiracy, the only overt act they are accused of is failing to act in response to a demand letter she sent them. (Docket no. 29-1, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 9, 10.) She has also attached a demand letter she sent to them, asking that they withdraw the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The statements in Bryan's motions are inaccurate. The order, which is attached as an exhibit, is addressed to her mother, Betty Bryan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket no. 29-3 at 4-5.) Plaintiff was not ordered to pay anything. Although she says she lived there for many years, she does not own the house. She has not shown that she has any legally cognizable interest in the house, or that the order would require her to pay or do anything. She therefore has not shown she has standing to seek this relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stacey v. City of Hermitage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=178%20Fed.%20Appx.%2094\">\n    178 Fed.Appx. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100 (3d Cir. 2006) (holding that son had not established standing to bring a \u00a7 1983 claim based on demolition of his mother's home).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shanko v. Lake County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362926\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/116/1055/#p1062\">\n    116 F.Supp.3d 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1062 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (\"...Plaintiff does not have standing to bring a Fourth Amendment claim for the County's destruction of someone else's home.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Furthermore, the relief she is asking for is an order from this Court requiring the city council members to rescind the order and to undertake further proceedings such as consulting a structural engineer. As Defendants correctly point out, local legislators are absolutely immune from claims arising from their discretionary legislative activities. In\n   <em>\n    Bogan v. Scott-Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/#p46\">\n    523 U.S. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/#p46\">\n    118 S.Ct. 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/#p46\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), for example, the Supreme Court unanimously held that city council members are entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability for their legislative activities. What Bryan has charged the city council members with is failure to take legislative action, which falls squarely within this holding. The Court has no authority to order the council members to vote to rescind the order, nor can the Court punish them for their failure to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the notice itself provides an opportunity for appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket no. 29-3 at 5.) Bryan has not shown that she or anyone else appealed, or if they did, whether the matter is still pending or how it was resolved. A claim based on a non-final order appears to be unripe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adam Bros. Farming v. County of Santa Barbara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053837\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/1142/#p1147\">\n    604 F.3d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (9th Cir.2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For these reasons, the motions are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The complaint, including its exhibits is 128 pages long and not well organized. With the adjudication of Bryan's claim to ownership of the house in case 10cv1605, however, this case has been simplified considerably. Bryan filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, supported by a request for judicial notice of twelve sets of documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Navarro v.

In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts all allegations of material fact in the complaint as true and construes them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. National League of Postmasters of U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616686\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/972/#p975\">\n    497 F.3d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (9th Cir. 2007). In addition to allegations on the face of the complaint, the Court may consider documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in the complaint, or matters judicially noticed.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ritchie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101181\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/903/#p908\">\n    342 F.3d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 908 (9th Cir. 2003). New or expanded allegations in opposition to a motion to dismiss are considered when deciding whether to grant leave to amend, but are not considered when ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider v.

The exception is that Bryan has, to some extent, affirmed the accuracy of the documents. For example, some of the documents attached to the affidavit are also attached to the complaint, and the Court accepts those as part of the pleading for purposes of ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ritchie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101181\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/903/#p908\">\n    342 F.3d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bryan requested notice of twelve documents, totaling over 200 pages, and giving a brief explanation of why she thinks each one is relevant. The Court has taken notice of the records in case 10cv1605, including the notice of appeal (Ex. 1) Bryan proffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Exhibit 2 is an incident report by the Carlsbad fire department, apparently reporting on the RV fire alleged in the complaint. It says the fire was unintentional and caused by a mechanical failure or malfunction. It also says someone named Dean Griffin was repairing the engine when the fire ignited. Such a report is probably not judicially noticeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pina v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"297030\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/752/47/#p50\">\n    752 F.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 (2d Cir.1985) (holding that the existence and content of a police report are not properly the subject of judicial notice). Even if it were noticeable, the Court would not assume the truth of the statements in it. Those statements are unhelpful to Bryan in any event, because they undermine the complaint's characterization of the RV fire and later events as some kind of cloak and dagger affair. The second part of Exhibit 2 is a motion for a change of venue in a different case, along with four subpoenas, none of which seem to have any bearing on this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Exhibit 3 is a copy of \u00a7 17912 of the California Building Code. While the Court can take notice of statutes, this statute has no bearing on this case. The second part of Exhibit 3 is a collection of records relating to the house. The first of these is a \"Residential Building Record.\" After this is a \"Master Property Record\" showing improvements on the land dating from 1958 to 1969. This has some tangential bearing on the case, but nothing directly. Apparently Bryan is relying on these to argue that because no other structures are listed on these records, those structures were never built. In fact, all it would show is that those structures were never recorded. If, as City officials apparently believed, unauthorized structures were built on the property and unpermitted alterations had been made, they would not be listed in these records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Exhibits 4 through 6 are records from case 10cv1605, of which the Court has already taken notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Exhibit 7 is a copy of a declaration of a loan service accountant filed in Betty Bryan's bankruptcy case. Exhibit 8 is a copy of Betty Bryan's declaration in that case. The existence of these documents has no clear bearing on this case and, as noted, the Court will not take notice of the facts they aver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Exhibit 9 is a recorded trustee's deed upon sale, and Exhibit 10 is a recorded notice of rescission. The Court could take notice of the fact that these were\n   recorded, if it had any bearing on this case. But the fact that a trustee's sale took place is not in dispute. In the case of the notice of rescission, many of its exhibits are arguments authored by Bryan. Taking notice that these documents were recorded would not show that anything Bryan says in her notice of rescission is true or that her reasoning is valid. Moreover, the issue of Bryan's right of rescission was already adjudicated in case 10cv1605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Exhibit 11 is a copy of the special verdict form that Bryan attached to the complaint. As noted below, this is attached to the complaint and therefore already part of the record. Furthermore, Bryan appears to have misinterpreted this as being helpful to her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Exhibit 12 is collection of correspondence. These do not meet the Fed. R. Evid. 201 standard and are not appropriate for judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Bryan's request is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , with the limitations noted, as to Exhibits 1, 4, 5, and 6. It is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Exhibits 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Overview of Sufficiency of Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The complaint's factual allegations are generally not in chronological or any other recognizable order. Nevertheless, some are identified with dates or at least years, mostly ranging from 2005 to 2009. Defendants argue that some claims are clearly time-barred. She mentions, for example, predatory mortgage loans, Defendant Scott Rudinger's alleged fraud, and an unlawful search of the home in 2005. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 35, 69.) Bryan, aware of the three-year limitations period for fraud, argues that because these are all part of an ongoing conspiracy, her claims all accrued on March 29, 2017, the date of the last overt act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Many of Bryan's allegations are vague and conclusory. Her generalized allegations that every Defendant conspired with every other Defendant, all ratified all of each other's acts, and each one acted in concert with all the others as to all alleged activities (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 14-20) do not meet the pleading standard.

Here, Bryan has alleged only that the City, Rudinger, and MTGLQ Investors, L.P. engaged in a conspiracy from about 2004 onward to steal her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Other than the March 29, 2017 search, the only overt acts she has alleged with any degree of specificity are two incidents, both of which occurred no later than 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The first incident involved the alleged arson of an RV by some unknown person. (Compl., \u00b6 13.) According to Bryan, an unknown person parked an RV illegally in front of her house, then set it on fire in the hope that it would ignite two tall palm trees that were in front of her house, and that those in turn would lead to her house burning, which in turn would force her and her mother to move out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This was thwarted when the City's own fire department put the fire out. (Compl., Ex. 1 at 40.) Then, Bryan says, the City towed the burned-out RV onto her lot. She says no towing company would agree to tow it away because she was not the owner, so it sat there for five months, after which the City threatened to fine her if she did not move both it and the two sailboats she was storing on the lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But some time before 2006,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   all this was resolved in Bryan's favor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Compl., \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The second incident involved an attempt by Rudinger in 2005 to trick her into telling her she needed to raise $600,000 for home upgrades, force her into a predatory loan, and arrange for the loan principal to be embezzled. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 69-74.) Then in 2013, when Bryan was confronted with records of numerous code violations, she accused Rudinger of being corruptly involved with MTGLQ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 75.) Bryan believes this angered Rudinger so much that he arranged for the March 29, 2017 search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 76.) He did this, she says, by making false representations to the judge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She says the deliberate falsehood is evident because the return said there was no new building or electrical work, the property had running water, and the \"home and its surrounding property [were] always clean and attractively maintained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   These three incidents or groups of incidents occurred over at least a fifteen year period, and are strung together with conclusory and non-detailed claims of conspiracy, corruption, and bad faith, similar to those\n   <em>\n    Lacey\n   </em>\n   held were inadequate. The role of each conspirator, what they said to each other or agreed to do, and when they agreed to it are not alleged. Furthermore, the facts that are pled do not plausibly point to a conspiracy as opposed to a combination of misfortunes (such as fire damage to trees, or Bryan's inability to get the RV towed away for five months) and events logically related to the City's efforts to enforce its codes. Even if the City's suspicions about code violations were mistaken, it does not imply bad faith, much less a conspiracy to steal her home.

The affidavit bears Hickerson's signature and identifies him as a code enforcement officer for the City.

Aside from the March 29, 2017 search, the only other search she is able to put in any time frame is one that occurred some time in 2005. Bearing in mind that she claims a conspiracy has been going on for years, vague references to other searches do not suffice to give Defendants fair notice of what Bryan is referring to, or what claims she might be bringing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The only claim that is pled with any degree of specificity is the claim that law enforcement officers unlawfully conducted an inspection of the house on March 29, 2017. The judicially noticed records show that this inspection was conducted pursuant to a warrant issued by Judge Wahlberg. This warrant was an administrative, not a criminal warrant, and the standard for issuance of this kind of warrant is lower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

It identifies complaints about conditions on the property, his own observations from outside the fence, and other facts gleaned from research. The declaration details a number of significant nuisances and probable code violations. It also says, based on complaints the City had received, that Hickerson had reason to believe ten to twenty people were living on the property in unsanitary and dangerous conditions. It also mentions accumulated debris, improper storage of boats and trailers, suspected problems with on-site wastewater treatment, construction of an unpermitted building, and various other violations and nuisances. The declaration says he sent a request to the property owner, lienholder, and tenants, requesting voluntary permission to inspect the property, and in return received an eight-page letter from Catherine and Betty Bryan, which he also attaches to the declaration. The declaration is also supported by photographic exhibits of the property. Several of these supporting documents, including the letter, an article about renovation of a building and water lines on the property, and the request for permission to inspect are also attached to the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the declaration, issuance of a warrant was proper under\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   . Bryan's eight-page letter admits there are many people on the property, but says they come there daily to do farm work, and do not live on the property. The letter admits there is an outbuilding (a greenhouse) on the property. Based on the letter's tone, and remarks made in it about the presence of many people, officers would have had reason to be cautious when conducting the inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The return was signed by another officer, Mike Peterson, who is also not a Defendant and not alleged to be part of the conspiracy. His statement supported some of the suspected violations, including an apparently compromised sewer system, no hot water or heat, a leaking roof and mold inside the house, and windows covered with boards or tarps. Although Peterson said he could not identify which parts of\n   the structure had been permitted, he said some of the work clearly would not have been approved if permission had been sought. The return is supported by illustrative photographs which bear out Peterson's description, as well as earlier reports of accumulated debris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The application, warrant, and return appear to be in order, and nothing about them suggests any Fourth Amendment or other constitutional violation. Although Bryan alleges that Rudinger made them (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 76-77), the records themselves show otherwise. Judge Dahlgren's warrant says Hickerson, not Rudinger, appeared before him. Bryan argues that the return shows the declaration was replete with lies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) But the return substantially bears out the declaration, mentioning safety hazards,\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   repairs, and the house's and property's overall poor maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Bryan's assertions that the inspection violated her rights or was unreasonable or illegal are almost entirely conclusory. A few factual details\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   support a Fourth Amendment claim for excessive in some other context. For example, Bryan alleges that eighteen officers arrived to conduct the inspection, that they had their guns drawn and pointed, and that they forced their way in. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 10, 61, 82.) In some other situation, this might amount to an unreasonable search. But given that Bryan in her letter had told them to expect a large number of people on site, had refused them entry, and had made clear she was hostile to them, sending a large number of officers and arming them was not unreasonable. Bryan has not alleged they failed to knock and wait, or otherwise request voluntary entry, nor that she was willing to let them in.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

But as Defendants correctly point out, she has not adequately alleged any policy that led to any constitutional violation.

Far from pleading such facts, Bryan has pled facts showing she knew or suspected a fraud much earlier, because she says she filed a mortgage fraud complaint in 2007. (Compl. at 35:1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The only reason she did not add Rudinger and the City as defendants in that complaint, she claims, is that although she knew Rudinger's name, she did not know where to find him or whether he was a duly authorized City employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:23-35:2.) Bryan's earlier allegations, however, show she had ample reason to believe he was a City employee. In fact her claim depends on her belief that he was. And her claim that she did not know where to find him does not explain why she did not add him as a defendant in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In short, Bryan's own allegations make clear she knew of all the facts supporting her fraud claim against Rudinger and the City in 2007 at the very latest, and nothing stood in the way of her suing them then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While state law prescribes the statute of limitations, federal law governs the time of accrual of \u00a7 1983 claims.\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Even if Bryan had adequately pled the existence of a conspiracy, the mere existence of a conspiracy does not necessarily extend the limitations period for her other claims. Under Ninth Circuit precedent, the cause of action flows from each overt act, not from the conspiracy or series of conspiracies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1536016,1536137\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/781/1334/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   What Bryan is describing is not a continuous violation, but a series of several overt acts over many years. Therefore, Bryan's causes of action over the years accrued with each separate overt act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The many events she describes from 2005 through 2009 therefore accrued as soon as she had reason to know of her injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maldonado v.
