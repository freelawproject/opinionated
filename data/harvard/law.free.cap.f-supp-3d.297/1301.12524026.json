D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 1; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 1. Defendant is a Delaware corporation registered with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation as a consumer collection agency. (\"Defendant\" or \"Portfolio Recovery\").

D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 4; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 4. Mr. Castellanos and Ms. Castellanos charged $1,484.45 on the Account by purchasing various electronics, including a video game console and Samsung TV. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 5; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 5. Mr. Castellanos failed to pay the Account balance. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 6; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 6. Thereafter, the Account was charged-off by the original creditor and sold to Portfolio Recovery. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 6; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 16, 2016, Portfolio Recovery initiated a state court action against Mr. Castellanos styled\n   <em>\n    Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC v. Castellanos\n   </em>\n   , Miami-Dade County Case Number 2016-011057-SP-25 to recover his unpaid Account balance (the \"Small Claims Action\"). D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 7; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 7. In the Small Claims Action, Portfolio Recovery alleged a single claim for Account Stated, demanding $1643.52 owed to Portfolio Recovery by Mr. Castellanos since August 19, 2016. Case No. 2016-011057-SP-25, D.E. 1. In the Small Claims Action and in connection with the instant summary judgment briefing, Mr. Castellanos admitted that, as of November 16, 2016, he owed the entire Account balance sought by Portfolio Associates in the Small Claims Action. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 8; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Neema R. Desai, Esq. (\"Ms. Desai\"), filed a Limited Notice of Appearance in the Small Claims Action on behalf of Mr. Castellanos, which stated: \"Neema R. Desai, Esq. notifies the Court and all parties of its appearance as counsel of record for Defendant, Javier A. Castellanos, solely for the purpose of receiving\n   pleadings EXCEPT for Service of Process.\" D.E. 41-5 p. 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Desai, acting as counsel on behalf of Mr. Castellanos, and Melanie S. Weseman, Esq., acting as counsel on behalf of Portfolio Recovery (\"Ms. Weseman\"), then engaged in numerous discussions to settle the Small Claims Action. On January 3, 2017, Myrna Nieves, Ms. Desai's paralegal (\"Ms. Nieves\"), prepared a check for $220.00 in settlement of the Small Claims Action and forwarded it to Ms. Weseman. D.E. 39 \u00b6 10; D.E. 58-1 \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 6, 2017, Portfolio Recovery's state court counsel deposited the $220.00 check for payment of the settlement into a trust account. D.E. 39 \u00b6 11; D.E. 58-1 \u00b6 11. In addition, Mr. Castellanos contends, and Portfolio Recovery disputes, that on January 11, 2017, the parties signed a binding Stipulation for Settlement (the \"Settlement Agreement\"). D.E. 1-1; D.E. 39 \u00b6 9. In short, Portfolio Recovery contends that the Settlement Agreement was non-binding because Mr. Castellanos and Portfolio Recovery's counsel, Ms. Weseman, signed the Settlement Agreement, but Ms. Desai did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 1-1; D.E. 39 \u00b6 9; D.E. 58-1 \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Portfolio Recovery, sometime thereafter, Portfolio Associates received at least three \"disputes\" regarding the Account, including a January 27, 2017 dispute submitted via TransUnion (the \"Dispute\"). D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 14; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 1, 2017, after receiving the Dispute, Portfolio Associates prepared and mailed a letter to Ms. Desai (the \"Attorney Response Letter\"). D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 17; D.E. 51-1 \u00b6 17. Just before mailing the Attorney Response Letter, Portfolio Associates also prepared a January 30, 2017 accounting of the Account (the \"Accounting\"). D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 8; D.E. 51-1 \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There is no dispute that the Attorney Response Letter was sent directly to Ms. Desai on or about February 1, 2017; however, in their respective summary judgment motions, the parties raise arguments concerning: (1) whether the Attorney Response Letter was an attempt to collect a debt; (2) whether Portfolio Recovery had any legal right to collect a debt from Mr. Castellanos; and (3) if Portfolio Recovery did not have the legal right to collect from Mr. Castellanos, whether Portfolio Recovery committed a bona fide error in seeking to collect. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 17; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 17; D.E. 39 \u00b6 14; D.E. 58-1 \u00b6 14; D.E. 41; D.E. 57; D.E. 64; D.E. 38; D.E. 58; D.E. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, in their respective summary judgment motions, the parties present arguments concerning whether the January 30, 2017 Accounting was sent directly to Mr. Castellanos, instead of to Ms. Desai, at a time when Portfolio Recovery knew that Mr. Castellanos was represented by Ms. Desai. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. In other words, Mr. Castellanos contends that he received the Accounting directly from Portfolio Recovery, whereas Portfolio Recovery contends that the Accounting was only sent to Ms. Desai as a single enclosure to the Attorney Response Letter. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 16, 2017, Portfolio Recovery voluntarily dismissed the Small Claims Action. D.E. 41-1 \u00b641; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on this underlying conduct, on February 15, 2017, Mr. Castellanos filed the instant action, alleging that Portfolio Recovery violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"FDCPA\") and Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.55\">\n    Fla.

D.E. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In particular, Mr. Castellanos alleges the following four claims: (1) communication with a consumer represented by counsel, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a)(2) (Count I); (2) collecting a debt previously paid, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2) (Count II); (3) communication with a consumer represented by counsel, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n    Fla.

D.E. 13. On May 3, 2017, the Court issued its Scheduling Order for Pretrial Conference and Trial which, among other things, set a June 2, 2017 deadline to amend pleadings, September 1, 2017 discovery cut-off, and September 22, 2017 dispositive motion deadline. D.E. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 22, 2017, Mr. Castellanos the instant Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, D.E. 37, and Portfolio Recovery also filed its instant Motion for Summary Judgment, D.E. 41. On September 29, 2017, Portfolio Recovery also moved to dismiss this action, in its entirety, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3), on grounds that Mr. Castellanos failed to plead concrete injury-in-fact required to alleged Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court will first address Portfolio Recovery's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, D.E. 54, and then address the parties' competing summary judgment motions, D.E. 37 and D.E. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (D.E. 54)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court should dismiss this case, in its entirety, because Plaintiff lacks Article III standing to bring the instant action.

In other words, Defendant contends that Plaintiff fails to meet his burden of showing a concrete injury-in-fact because Plaintiff only alleges technical violations of the FDCPA and FCCPA-without alleging how or whether these technical violations caused Plaintiff actual harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff argues that he has Article III standing for two reasons. First, Plaintiff argues that he alleges: \"(1) that Defendant contacted a consumer known to be represented by counsel; and (2) that Defendant mischaracterized the nature of the debt by sending two letters, the first, dated January 30, 2017, directly to the Plaintiff that sought to collect a balance of $1423.52 after the debt had been fully settled, and the second, dated February 1, 2017, to his legal counsel that claimed a balance owed of $1423.52 ... [which was] three weeks after the debt had been fully settled.\" D.E. 66 p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that the FDCPA and FCCPA confer on borrowers, such as Plaintiff, \"the right to a truthful disclosure of the amount of the debt ... and the false representation of that amount is a sufficiently concrete violation to survive a challenge\" on Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, because the FDCPA provides a private right of action authorizing debtors to file suit for a debt collector's failure to comply with the FDCPA, Plaintiff has Article III standing to sue for a technical violation of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff. In the unpublished decision\n   <em>\n    Church v. Accretive Health, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit held that a debtor had shown concrete injury-in-fact where she alleged that a letter sent to her \"did not contain all of the FDCPA's required disclosures\" because the FDCPA gives debtors a \"statutorily-created right to information pursuant to the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Church\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=654%20Fed.%20Appx.%20990\">\n    654 Fed.Appx. at 994-995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the debtor \"sufficiently alleged that she has sustained a concrete-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"real\"-injury because she did not receive the allegedly required disclosures,\" and \"[t]he invasion of Church's right to receive the disclosures is not hypothetical or uncertain; Church did not receive information to which she alleges she was entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=654%20Fed.%20Appx.%20990\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=654%20Fed.%20Appx.%20990\">\n    at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

D.E. 41 pp. 6-7. In particular, Defendant argues that the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   evidence to indicate that Defendant actually knew that an attorney represented Plaintiff with respect to Plaintiff's $1,423.52 debt was Ms. Desai's December 8, 2016 Limited Notice of Appearance in the Small Claims Action, which: (1) expressly limited Ms. Desai's representation to \"receiving pleadings EXCEPT for Service of Process;\" and (2) did not explicitly mention the $1,423.52 debt. D.E. 41 p. 6 (citing D.E. 41-5 at 15:1-19, 99). Thus, Defendant argues that the Limited Notice of Appearance, standing alone, does not create a reasonable inference that Defendant had actual knowledge that Ms. Desai, or any other lawyer, represented Plaintiff with respect to Plaintiff's $1,423.52 debt; instead, the notice merely placed Defendant on notice that Ms. Desai wished to receive pleadings-or the complaint, answer and reply-pertaining to the Small Claims Action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that even if a reasonable jury would conclude that Defendant had actual knowledge that Ms. Desai represented Plaintiff with respect to the debt at issue, the undisputed evidence, based entirely on the testimony of Janet Marie Cadell, Defendant's dispute specialist (\"Ms. Cadell\"), \"established that Defendant\n   did not mail the Accounting directly to Plaintiff.\" D.E. 41 p. 8; D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 20; D.E. 41-3 at 28:3-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In contrast, Plaintiff argues that it is entitled to summary judgment with respect to Counts I and III for two reasons. First, Plaintiff argues that Defendant had actual knowledge that Plaintiff was represented by counsel, with respect to Plaintiff's $1,423.52 debt, because \"Defendant was aware that Plaintiff was represented by Attorney Neema Desai beginning on December 8, 2016, the day that its state court attorney received Desai's Limited Notice of Appearance.\" DE. 65 p. 3. In other words, Plaintiff contends that Defendant had actual knowledge that Ms. Desai represented Plaintiff with respect to the $1,423.52 debt because: (1) Ms. Desai filed a Limited Notice of Appearance in the Small Claims Action: (2) Ms. Desai negotiated the Settlement Agreement in the Small Claims Action with Porfolio Recovery's counsel; and (3) as such, Defendant executed the Settlement Agreement, sent it to Ms. Desai, and listed Ms. Desai in the signature block of the Settlement Agreement. D.E. 65 p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that the undisputed evidence shows that Defendant sent a letter directly to Plaintiff, on or about January 30, 2017, which sought to collect the $1423.52 debt. D.E. 38 p. 3.

In support, Defendant relies on two undisputed facts: (1) that the Account was coded in Defendant's system as a \"soft settlement code indicating that the settlement had not yet been finalized;\" and (2) that Lauren Cordova, Defendant's Senior Legal Clerk (\"Ms. Cordova\"), sent an email to Defendant's lawyers in the Small Claims Action, including Ms. Weseman of the law firm Pollack &amp; Rosen, P.A. (\"Pollack\"), on February 15, 2017, to check the status of the potential settlement of the Small Claims Action, because Ms. Cordova \"could not tell whether the Account had been settled in full based on the codes contained in PRA's Account records.\" D.E. 41 pp. 11-12; D.E. 41-8. In short, Defendant argues that because of the way in which it chose to code the status of Plaintiff's debt, Defendant did not-and could not-know that the parties had settled Plaintiff's debt by the time that Defendant sent the February 1, 2017 Attorney Response Letter to Ms. Desai.

First, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Defendant's February 1, 2017 Attorney Response Letter constituted an attempt to collect debt and was not, as Portfolio Recovery argues, simply information provided to Mr. Castellanos upon Mr. Castellanos' request. The Eleventh Circuit has made clear that a letter constitutes an attempt to collect a debt, for FDCPA purposes, \"where it contains an implicit demand for payment, includes the amount of debt, provides the phone number and address of the law firm to which payment is to be made, and expressly states its purpose is to collect a debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

D.E. 1-4. Thus, while the Attorney Response Letter does not expressly state that its purpose is to collect a debt, the letter: (1) was sent to Mr. Castellanos' counsel in the Small Claims Action, which Portfolio Recovery filed specifically to collect the $1,423.25 debt referenced in the Attorney Response Letter and in this case; (2) was, according to Portfolio Recovery's own testimony, sent to Mr. Castellanos' counsel after January 27, 2017, when Portfolio Recovery contends that Mr. Castellanos disputed that he owed this very same debt; and (3) and included an implicit demand for payment, set forth the specific amount of debt owed, and provided the phone number and address of the entity to which payment should be made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064490\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/1299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Portfolio Recovery sent Mr. Castellanos a\n   letter setting forth the amount of debt claimed to be owed to Portfolio Recovery, including Portfolio Recovery's contact information and address to direct correspondence and payment,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all while Portfolio Recovery had just finished prosecuting the Small Claims Action to collect this very same debt\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could find, based on the least sophisticated consumer test, the Attorney Response Letter to be \"merely informational;\" instead, the Attorney Response Letter was plainly an attempt to collect Plaintiff's $1,423.35 debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caceres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064490\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/1299/\">\n    755 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1304 n. 5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202712886\">\n    2017 WL 2712886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Defendant lacked the legal authority to collect the $1,423.52 debt. In particular, there is no dispute that Ms. Desai and Defendant's counsel in the Small Claims Action engaged in numerous discussions to negotiate a settlement of Plaintiff's $1,423.52 debt. D.E. 39 \u00b6 10; D.E. 58-1 \u00b6 10. There is also unrefuted testimony from Ms. Nieves, paralegal and assistant to Mr. Castellanos' lawyer, Ms. Desai, that: (1) on January 3, 2017, Ms. Nieves prepared a check in the amount of $220.00, made out to the trust account for the law firm retained by Portfolio Recovery, Pollack &amp; Rosen, P.A.; and (2) on January 6, 2017, the check was deposited into the trust account of Pollack &amp; Rosen, P.A. D.E. 42-1; D.E. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 48-1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11. Lastly, there is no dispute that on January 11, 2017, Mr. Castellanos and Portfolio Recovery's lawyer, Ms. Weseman, executed the Settlement Agreement, which provided, in relevant part, that: (1) Portfolio Recovery \"agrees to accept the sum of $220.00 as settlement in full;\" (2) Mr. Castellanos \"agrees to enter into a payment arrangement\" requiring that \"$220.00 ... be paid on or before January 10, 2017;\" and (3) \"[u]pon receipt and clearance of the payment, the above styled cause of action will be dismissed with prejudice.\" D.E. 42-1; D.E. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 48-1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. D.E. 1-1. In addition, On February 17, 2016, Portfolio Recovery dismissed the Small Claims Action with prejudice. D.E. 41-1 \u00b6 41; D.E. 57-1 \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Thus, this undisputed evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Portfolio Recovery, shows that as of February 1, 2017, when Portfolio Recovery sent the Attorney Response Letter, Portfolio Recovery lacked the legal authority to collect Mr. Castellanos' $1,423.25 debt because Portfolio Recovery and Mr. Castellanos had finally settled Mr. Castellanos' debt for $220.00. D.E. 42-1; D.E. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 48-1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. D.E. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Lastly, with respect to Count IV, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Portfolio Recovery had actual knowledge that it lacked legal authority to collect on Mr. Castellanos' $1,423.52 debt. As discussed above, there is no genuine dispute that it was Portfolio Recovery that: (1) negotiated a settlement of Mr. Castellanos' debt; (2) agreed to settle the debt for $220.00; (3) on January 6, 2017, deposited the $220.00 check; and (4) on January 11, 2017, executed the Settlement Agreement.

Thus, the Court rejects Portfolio Recovery's argument that it lacked \"actual knowledge\" that it settled Mr. Castellanos' debt, as this argument is contrary to the plain record evidence in this case, which shows that Portfolio Recovery both actively worked to settle and, then, understood that it did settle and fully resolve any claims related to Plaintiff's $1,423.25 debt-all well before sending the February 1, 2017 Attorney Response Letter. D.E. 42-1; D.E. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 48-1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; D.E. 1-1;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Elmore v. Ne.

First, with respect to Plaintiff's claims that Defendant directly contacted him when he was represented by counsel, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a)(2) (Count I) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (18) (Count III), Defendant argues that any such letter could only have been sent inadvertently because: (1) Ms. Cadell, who prepared the Accounting, testified that she mailed the Accounting to Ms. Desai; (2) Ms. Cadell also testified that whenever an individual is represented by an attorney, she would only send documents directly to the attorney; and (3) Ricky Vaughan, Defendant's Record's Custodian (\"Mr. Vaughan\"), provided unrefuted testimony that Defendant has written policies prohibiting direct communications with any consumer represented by an attorney, including \"mail[ing] the response letter directly to the consumer's attorney listed in the system\" and \"track[ing] attorney response packages with unique tracking\n   codes that allow it to determine and oversee that its procedures are being followed.\" D.E. 41 pp. 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Second, with respect to Plaintiff's claims that Defendant attempted to collect a debt that it lacked legal authority to collect, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9), by sending the February 1, 2017 Attorney Response Letter, Defendant argues that an unintentional bona fide error occurred, whereby Defendant sought to collect a debt from Plaintiff, because: (1) on or before December 13, 2016, the parties tentatively agreed to settle Plaintiff's debt for $220; (2) on or about January 3, 2016, Plaintiff tendered settlement funds before tendering a fully signed Settlement; and, therefore, (3) on January 23, 2017, Defendant then marked Plaintiff's Account for \"a settlement soft close.\" D.E. 41 pp. 16-17. According to Defendant, as this was occurring, Plaintiff, or someone acting on his behalf, continued submitting \"fraudulent disputes arguing that the Account did not belong to Plaintiff,\" including a January 27, 2017 dispute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n    p. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Defendant, after the January 27, 2017 dispute came in, Ms. Cadell mistakenly flagged the $220 payment as evidence that the Account belonged to Plaintiff and, then, sent the Attorney Response Letter to provide information responsive to the dispute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Under these circumstances, Defendant contends that Ms. Cadell, acting on behalf of Defendant, was clearly acting unintentionally and based on a bona fide error when she sent Ms. Desai the Attorney Response Letter, as she \"had no reason to inquire further into the status of the pending settlement in order to resolve Plaintiff's specific dispute that the Account was not his,\" as any further inquiry \"would be unreasonable given the fact that: (1) the Dispute did not challenge the Account balance reported on the credit report or argue that the Account was settled in full; (2) most people don't dispute that a debt is theirs after making payment on the account or while in the process of settling the account; and (3) Defendant should be allowed to rely on its attorneys to determine when a settlement has been finalized and enter the appropriate hard close code at the appropriate time.\" D.E. 41 p. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Lastly, Defendant argues that it maintains policies and procedures designed to prevent FDCPA and FCCPA violations based on unlawfully: (1) contacting a debtor that Defendant knows to be represented by counsel; or (2) attempting to collect on a debt that is no longer owed. In short, Defendant relies on testimony from Mr. Vaughan regarding Defendant's written policies prohibiting direct communications with any consumer represented by an attorney, D.E. 41 pp. 15-16 (citing D.E. 41-11), and sworn declarations from Mr. Vaughan and Jennifer Cullen, Assistance Vice President for Legal Recovery (\"Ms. Cullen\"), explaining that Defendant requires outside counsel to \"enter settlement codes to close-out accounts in Defendant's system,\" so that when a \"hard close code *CC:C118 is entered, the account balance is automatically zeroed and Defendant's system will not generate any further correspondence containing an account balance,\" D.E. 41 pp. 18-19 (citing D.E. 41-9 and D.E. 41-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiff argues that is entitled to summary judgment with respect to Defendant's bona fide error defense or, at the very least, that Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment with respect to this defense, for three main reasons. First, Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to summary judgment because Defendant, without question, \"does not maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid sending debt collection letters\" either directly to individuals represented by counsel or to individuals with debts that have been settled\n   in full, because Defendant committed both types of FDCPA and FCCPA infractions in this case. D.E. 38 pp. 8-9. In other words, if Defendant had adequate procedures, it would never have violated the FDCPA and/or FCCPA here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant's procedures are not reasonably adapted to prevent Defendant from violating the FDCPA or FCCPA because Defendant relies entirely on outside counsel inputting the proper \"soft\" or \"hard\" settlement code into Defendant's system-without Defendant independently verifying its counsel's use of these \"soft\" and \"hard\" settlement codes in determining how and whether to contact debtors to collect on debts. D.E. 57 pp. 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant's policies are, in any event, not reasonably adapted to prevent Defendant from violating the FDCPA or FCCPA, as the \"soft\" and \"hard\" coding system and Defendant's written policies: (1) require that outside counsel enter a \"soft\" settlement code once a debtor remits payment; and (2) Defendant continues to send notices to debtors with \"soft\" settlement codes flagged in the system-even though remitting payment should preclude Defendant from sending\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   debt collection notices to debtors. D.E. 57 pp. 3-5. In other words, \"Defendant's procedures are not reasonably adapted to prevent Defendant from stating that money is due when a debt has already been settled because Defendant's procedures leave its computer with a balance due as of the entry of the soft code and up to the entry of a hard code when in reality the debt is fully settled as of the entry of the soft code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.72\">\n    p. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Court's ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court finds genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendant's procedures are reasonably adapted to prevent Defendant from violating the FDCPA or FCCPA.
