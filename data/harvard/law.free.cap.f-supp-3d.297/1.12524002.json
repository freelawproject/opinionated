(\"Discovery is a nondispositive pretrial matter that may be referred for disposition to a magistrate judge. Postjudgment discovery in collection proceedings may also be referred to a magistrate judge.\"). Because the management of post-judgment discovery is comparable in importance to the management of pretrial discovery, the Court will review the Magistrate Judge's Criminal Contempt Order under the \"clear error\" standard. The Court notes, however, that its decision would be the same whether it used the \"clear error\" standard, or whether it reviewed the Magistrate Judge's order\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    -there is ample support in the record, which the Court has reviewed in its entirety, for the Magistrate Judge's conclusions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
