Before the Court is Saleh's Motion for Conditional FLSA Collective Action Certification and Issuance of Notice. ECF No. 47. Having considered the parties' briefing, the relevant law, and the record in this case, the Court GRANTS Saleh's Motion for Conditional FLSA Collective Action Certification and Issuance of Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Saleh alleges that he is a former employee of Valbin who worked as a non-exempt role player at the Fort Hunter Liggett Military Base in California. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Many members of the U.S. military deploying to the Middle East or neighboring regions undergo training at Fort Hunter Liggett that \"includes simulation training in fabricated Middle Eastern villages,\" other terrains, and simulated battlefields featuring native role players.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. \"The villages are created to look like real villages from Iraq, Afghanistan, or other Middle Eastern countries and have attributes such as mosques [and] traffic circles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.

Once a role player arrived at Fort Hunter Liggett to begin a rotation, he was not allowed to leave the base for any reason.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Role players resided and slept in the simulated village, military tents, or similar accommodations with no running water, electricity, heating, or air conditioning, according to Saleh.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 84, 92, 96. Saleh alleges that exercises occurred at all hours of the day and night,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53, and that as a result his sleep was regularly interrupted and he was not able to get five hours of uninterrupted sleep,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82,\n   107-08.

Saleh argues that he is similarly situated to the putative collective action participants because Valbin \"systematically: (1) failed to provide Plaintiffs with private quarters in a homelike environment; (2) failed to provide Plaintiffs with at least five ... hours of uninterrupted sleep time per day; and (3) allowed Plaintiffs to work in excess of 40 hours per week without being paid all of their overtime.\" Mot. at 2. As to overtime, Saleh claims that he never entered into an agreement to exclude from hours worked a regularly scheduled uninterrupted sleeping period. Compl. \u00b6 109. In addition, Saleh claims that Valbin had a policy of compensating a maximum of thirteen hours of work per day, regardless of how many hours an employee actually worked. Mot. at 2. In support of his motion for conditional collective action certification, Saleh submits his own declaration, as well as the declarations of opt-in plaintiffs Andrew Ayon and Nabil Jany\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a copy\n   of a powerpoint slide deck that Valbin used as part of an employee orientation for its role players at Fort Hunter Liggett.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

Saleh Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; Ayon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Saleh and Ayon allege that they were required to remain in character at all times during a training rotation because the U.S. military personnel might enter a village at any time day or night as part of their training.

Saleh and Ayon claim that they were required to sleep in the fabricated villages, military tents, or similar accommodates with no running water or electricity.

Presumably as a result of this maximum compensation policy, Saleh and Ayon claim that they were not paid for all of their overtime hours worked while on rotation. Saleh Decl. \u00b6 14; Ayon Decl. \u00b6 14. They claim that after they entered Fort Hunter Liggett for a rotation, they were not allowed to leave for any reason.

Moreover, Saleh argues that the Court need not even consider evidence provided by the defendant at this stage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kress v. PricewaterhouseCoopers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268116\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/263/623/#p628\">\n    263 F.R.D. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628 (E.D.

Valbin's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Valbin opposes Saleh's motion for conditional certification on several grounds. First, Valbin argues that Saleh has not met his burden to show that he is similarly situated to the other collective action participants he seeks to represent. Opp. at 4. Second, Valbin argues that if the Court conditionally certifies a collective action, the time period defining the collective action membership should only reach back two years, not three, because there is no proof of a willful violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opp. at 9. The Court describes these positions in turn in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Valbin puts forward at least two reasons that Saleh has failed to show that he is similarly situated to the group he seeks to represent. First, Valbin points out that role players are divided into two types with three different job descriptions, as the Orientation Slides that Saleh submitted outline. Opp. at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Orientation Slides at 7 (summarizing the three different\n   job descriptions). First, there are generic role players, which are also referred to as civilians on the battlefield (\"COBs\"). COBs have primarily non-speaking roles. Second, there are generic casualty role players, which are COBs with battlefield wounds. Third, there are foreign language speakers (\"FLSs\"), which have speaking roles. Orientation Slides at 7. COBs and FLSs were classified differently for pay purposes and entered into different types of contracts. Opp. at 4; Declaration of Dakota Farr (\"Farr Decl.\") \u00b6 2; Exh. 1a, 1b to Farr Decl. Because the different job descriptions had different responsibilities, Valbin argues that all role players are not similarly situated. Opp. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Valbin disputes almost every factual allegation in the Complaint and Motion, including the length of role players' rotations and shifts, whether it paid role players overtime, whether role players were required to be in character twenty-four hours per day, whether exercises awoke role players during the night, whether role players were allowed to leave the base, and the circumstances of role players' lodging arrangements. Opp. at 4-7. Valbin hypothesizes that Saleh copied the allegations from another lawsuit in which he took part,\n   <em>\n    Ahmadi v. Calnet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:15-cv-02636 (C.D. Cal.), and made those same allegations in the instant case, despite those allegations having no basis in the facts of his employment with Valbin at Fort Hunter Liggett.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opp. at 2. Because Saleh's claims are all contradicted by Valbin's evidence, Valbin argues that Saleh has not carried his burden to show that there was any single policy affecting all putative collective action participants or that Saleh was similarly situated to these putative participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In support of this argument, Valbin submits two declarations and a range of documents. Valbin submits time sheets for Saleh and Ayon showing that they worked shifts lasting no more than twelve hours per day, and often no more than ten hours per day. Exh. 2a to Farr Decl. at 35-44 (Ayon); Exh. 2c to Farr Decl. at 57-68 (Saleh). Valbin also submits the declaration of Ken Plato, a Valbin exercise site manager, who states that rotations at Fort Hunter Liggett lasted five to fifteen days, not three to nineteen days as Saleh and Ayon claim. Plato Decl. \u00b6 2. Valbin submits pay stubs for Saleh and Ayon showing that they were paid overtime. Exh. 2a to Farr Decl. at 27-34 (Ayon); Exh. 2c to Farr Decl. at 54-56 (Saleh). According to Plato, role players were not required to remain in character twenty-four hours per day. Plato Decl. \u00b6 3. Nor were they awoken at night by Valbin or government employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Plato states that shifts generally lasted eight to ten hours per day, and that after a shift was over, role players were free to do whatever they wanted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5. Role players were allowed to and often did leave the base after the end of their shift.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5, 8. Plato states that role players did not sleep in fabricated villages or individual military tents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Rather, Plato says that role players slept in either \"large army portable barracks (large tent-like structures for 8 to 10 individuals) or actual barracks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plato goes on, \"If they wanted, they could sleep in hotels off base or the hotel on base, but most accepted Valbin's offer of free accommodations which, I note, included water and electricity, as well as heat and air conditioning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on this evidence, Valbin argues that Saleh has not identified \"the single decision, policy, or plan that affected all of the putative collective action members,\" nor has Saleh demonstrated that the plaintiffs are similarly situated. Opp. at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, Valbin argues that \"the evidence is plain that plaintiffs kept time sheets and that Valbin paid each of the plaintiffs overtime pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"If the plaintiffs are to be believed that other employees were not paid overtime as they state in their\n   <em>\n    Calnet\n   </em>\n   -copied affidavits, then these plaintiffs who were paid overtime are not similarly situated to those other persons and there is no basis for a collective action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Valbin argues that the Orientation Slides that Saleh submitted show that Valbin expected its employees to work from about 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. and that \"employees sign daily time &amp; attendance sheets before departing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Valbin argues that \"[g]iven this timesheet requirement, 'off the clock' work clearly was not a Valbin dictated decision, policy, or plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Valbin also argues that if the Court conditionally certifies a collective action, the collective action group should be defined as all role players who worked for Valbin at Fort Hunter Liggett during the last two years-not during the last three years, as Saleh suggests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. This argument is rooted in the relevant statute of limitations for FLSA claims. FLSA claims for unpaid compensation are generally subject to a two-year statute of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). However, \"a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Valbin argues that because there is no evidence of any FLSA violation-let alone a willful violation-any conditional certification should only include role players who worked for Valbin within the past two years. Opp. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As noted above, to show that he is similarly situated to the putative collective action participants, under the notice-stage standard, Saleh must provide \" 'substantial allegations, supported by declarations or discovery, that 'the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kress\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268116\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/263/623/#p628\">\n    263 F.R.D. at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Valbin concedes that the notice-stage standard applies to the instant motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Saleh has carried his burden under this \"fairly lenient\" standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2155674\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/234/1067/#p1082\">\n    234 F.Supp.2d at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Saleh alleges that role players: were required to be in character twenty-four hours per day; were required to sleep in fabricated villages or military tents; were often awoken during the night to engage in role-playing exercises; were not paid for sleep time; were not allowed to leave the base while on rotation; and were compensated for a maximum of thirteen hours of work per day. As a result, Saleh contends that role players were not paid all of the overtime pay that they were due. Saleh and Ayon submit declarations attesting to these facts. These detailed allegations go beyond \"boilerplate and legal conclusions without support\" that Valbin did not pay overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath v. Google Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271968\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/215/844/#p857\">\n    215 F.Supp.3d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 857 (N.D. Cal. 2016). The allegations provide a \"reasonable basis\" for concluding that Valbin's alleged policies applied to all role players at Fort Hunter Liggett. As a result, the Court concludes that the collective action should be conditionally certified and that notice should be provided to the putative collective action participants. For the reasons\n   below, Valbin's arguments do not compel a contrary result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Different Job Types at Issue Here Do Not Defeat Conditional Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As described above, Valbin argues that Saleh is not similarly situated to the putative collective action participants because the group he proposes encompasses two types of jobs (COB and FLS) with three job descriptions (generic role player, generic casualty role player, and foreign language speaker). Saleh's own evidence establishes that there were three job descriptions among the role players at Fort Hunter Liggett. Orientation Slides at 7. However, courts often conditionally certify collective actions that include multiple job types and titles.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208477918\">\n    2015 WL 8477918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *13 (conditionally certifying collective action comprising eleven job titles);\n   <em>\n    Wellens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202126877\">\n    2014 WL 2126877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2, 6 (conditionally certifying collective action comprising six job titles);\n   <em>\n    Stickle v. SCI W. Market Support Center, L.P.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-083-PHX-MHM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203241790\">\n    2009 WL 3241790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30, 2009) (conditionally certifying collective action comprising seven job titles). As a result, the mere fact that there were different types of role players does not alone defeat conditional certification. To the contrary, the declarations of Saleh and Ayon state that based on their personal experience, they believe that Valbin's policies and procedures applied uniformly to all role players. Saleh Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; Ayon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Valbin does not seriously contend otherwise. Indeed, Valbin vigorously disputes Saleh's factual allegations on everything from sleeping conditions to overtime pay, but Valbin does little to argue that the differences in job classification would translate into different applications of the policies Saleh alleges, were such policies to exist. In fact, in disputing Saleh's factual allegations, Valbin consistently refers to all role players collectively, rather than differentiating between COBs and FLSs, for example.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Opp. at 4-5 (\"Valbin provided role players to the Army only for work shifts of approximately 8 to 10 hours/day, it paid its role players overtime, and these role player were not in character for the 14 to 16 hours that they were not on a work shift.\"). Valbin does not contend that role players with different job types or job titles worked different hours, were subject to different overtime policies, had different sleeping arrangements, or were subject to different policies about remaining on base. As a result, the Court concludes that the fact that Valbin's role players at Fort Hunter Liggett were categorized differently for pay or had different job titles does not defeat conditional certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Resolution of Disputed Facts is Not Proper at the Notice Stage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, Valbin contends that Saleh is not similarly situated to the putative collective action group because he has failed to establish the existence of any of the policies he alleges, let alone establish that these policies were applied to him. Opp. at 7-8. Valbin points to the time sheets, pay stubs, and declarations it has submitted, all of which contradict Saleh's allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203241790\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Clearly, Valbin's evidence creates a factual dispute: Saleh and Ayon submitted sworn declarations claiming certain policies exist, and Valbin submitted evidence showing the opposite.

Finally, Saleh provides a proposed notice and a consent to sue form that he requests that the Court approve.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330614\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exh. E (\"Proposed Notice\" and \"Consent to Sue Form,\" respectively). Besides objecting to the scope of the collective action as discussed above, Valbin does not otherwise respond to Saleh's logistical requests or the form of the Proposed Notice. However, the Court finds that several changes to Saleh's requests, the Proposed Notice, and the Consent to Sue Form are appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann-La Roche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330614\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/165/\">\n    493 U.S. at 170-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330614\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/165/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a district court has a \"managerial responsibility to oversee the joinder of additional parties to assure that the task is accomplished in an efficient and proper way\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, with regard to Valbin's provision of the collective action member list, the Court finds that Saleh has not justified the need for such a short deadline. Accordingly, within 10 days of the date of this order Valbin shall provide Saleh a list, in electronic importable format, of the names and all known addresses of all proposed collective action participants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208477918\">\n    2015 WL 8477918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *14 (allowing defendant 10 days to provide collective action member list);\n   <em>\n    Villarreal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179051\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/66/1184/#p1194\">\n    66 F.Supp.3d at 1196-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, with regard to the 120-day opt-in deadline, the Court notes that the Proposed Notice contains a separate 90-day opt-in deadline. To avoid confusion, the Court declines to set two separate opt-in deadlines. Instead, Saleh shall mail notice\n   to the potential collective action participants within 30 days of the date of this order. The potential collective action participants shall then have 90 days from the date of the Notice's mailing to postmark and return the Consent to Sue Form. The Court finds that counting 90 days from the date that the notices are mailed is more judicially administrable than counting from the date of receipt, as Saleh proposes. Accordingly, Page 2, Lines 8-9 of the Proposed Notice shall be revised to read: \"The form must be postmarked and returned by [insert date 90 days from date of mailing].\" Page 3, Lines 4-5 of the Proposed Notice shall be revised to read: \"The envelope you return must be postmarked by [insert date 90 days from date of mailing].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villarreal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179051\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/66/1184/#p1194\">\n    66 F.Supp.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the opt-in period \"will run from the time the notice is sent, rather than from when it is received\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, the definition of the collective action on Pages 1-2 of the Proposed Notice shall be revised to reflect the definition adopted in this order, namely: \"All current and former role-players who worked for Defendant Valbin Corporation at Fort Hunter Liggett at any time between February 6, 2014 and the present.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Fourth, because the Court has granted summary judgment against Jany, the Proposed Notice shall be edited to remove reference to Jany as a plaintiff.

Removing the consent for separate suits also necessitates other changes to the Proposed Notice and the Consent to Sue Form, including the description of counsel's fee structure. Specifically, the references to contingency fees at Page 3, Lines 22-24 of the Proposed Notice shall be removed. On Page 7, Line 1, the phrase \"if accepted for representation\" shall be deleted. On Page 7, Line 2, the phrase \"without repayment of costs or attorneys' fees\" shall be deleted because the payment of costs and fees is often paid indirectly from any settlement fund. On Page 7, Lines 2-7, the text beginning \"I understand that if plaintiffs\" and ending \"2/5 of my settlement or judgment amount\" shall be deleted and replaced with the following language, which the Court finds more accurately describes attorneys' fees for collective actions: \"I understand that if plaintiffs recover money, plaintiffs' attorneys will be paid whatever attorneys' fees the Court orders. Those fees may be subtracted from the settlement fund obtained from\n   Valbin, or they may be paid separately by Valbin, or they may be a combination of the two. If plaintiffs recover no money from Valbin, plaintiffs' attorneys will not be paid for their work on this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Saleh shall submit a revised Proposed Notice and a revised Consent to Sue Form incorporating these changes for the Court's approval within 3 days of the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
