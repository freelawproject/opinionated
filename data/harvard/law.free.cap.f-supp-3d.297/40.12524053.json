KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Benoit Brookens worked as an economist for the Department of Labor (\"DOL,\" sued in this case through Defendant, the Secretary of Labor, in his official capacity). Brookens claims that DOL unlawfully terminated him, alleging that his firing amounted to age- and race-based discrimination and retaliation for his union activity. He litigated those claims before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"), which rejected them. He then sought to appeal the MSPB's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Because Brookens' discrimination claims deprived the Federal Circuit of jurisdiction, it transferred the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   DOL has moved to dismiss, arguing that Brookens' failure to file this lawsuit within 30 days of when he received the MSPB's\n   order deprives this Court of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court agrees and will dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

After Brookens failed to file timely objections to the ALJ's recommendations, the MSPB adopted those recommendations in an order dated December 16, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207146454\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5 -7. The MSPB explained that the order was its \"final decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. The order informed Brookens that he could seek further review of his discrimination claims before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, Brookens could seek review of all of his claims in federal district court if he did so in a timely manner, as the MSPB's order explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   You must file your civil action with the district court no later than 30 calendar days after your receipt of this order.

Instead, on February 12, 2015, he sought to appeal the MSPB's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2 (\"Fed. Cir. Dkt.\") at 3. The Federal Circuit required Brookens to file a form explaining the status of any discrimination claims by checking one of five boxes. His options included: that his case had never included discrimination claims, that he had abandoned any discrimination claims previously before the MSPB, and that the MSPB's ruling was jurisdictional. Brookens, who had been represented by counsel before the MSPB but was proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at the time, erroneously selected the first of those three options.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Form 10 Statement Concerning Discrimination,\n   <em>\n    Brookens v. Labor Dep't\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-3084 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 13, 2015), ECF No. 3. The Federal Circuit subsequently asked the parties to clarify whether Brookens had in fact permanently abandoned his earlier discrimination claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Cir. Dkt. at 5 (docket entry 57). The Federal Circuit also asked the parties to address whether the court had jurisdiction in light of\n   <em>\n    Kloeckner v.

Cir. Dkt. at 5 (docket entry 57). Having once again retained counsel by that point, Brookens explained that he did intend to preserve his\n   discrimination claims, but asserted that the MSPB's decision was jurisdictional and thus appealable to the Federal Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-5; ECF No. 16-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At oral argument, the Federal Circuit panel appeared convinced that it lacked jurisdiction, and suggested that a transfer to this Court might be more appropriate than outright dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Cir. Tr. at 4:7-12, 6:1-9. DOL argued against a transfer on the ground that Brookens had not met the 30-day deadline for bringing suit in district court.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:5-13. The judges on the panel expressed skepticism, opining that the \"30-day deadline is not jurisdictional\" and therefore could be \"waive[d]\" by the transferee district court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:14-17. When pressed at oral argument, DOL agreed that the 30-day deadline was not jurisdictional and could be waived,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:18-19, but asserted that Brookens could not justify equitable tolling of the 30-day deadline because he had been aware of the deadline, had been represented by counsel before the MSPB, and himself had a legal education,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:20-13:7. The panel, however, suggested that equitable tolling was \"a decision that the District Court should make, not us,\" and DOL agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:15-19. The panel further suggested that Brookens might have an argument in favor of equitable tolling, given that the MSPB's order did not explain that Brookens had a right to an appeal to the Federal Circuit if he gave up his discrimination claims,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:8-17, and that Brookens may have been \"confused\" about where to file,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:9-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 9, 2016, the Federal Circuit issued a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order concluding that Brookens' appeal was timely, but that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 (\"Fed. Cir. Order\"). The Federal Circuit transferred the case to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Cir. Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After this Court received the case, DOL moved to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (\"DOL Br.\"). DOL now argues that the 30-day deadline for filing suit is, in fact, jurisdictional under the D.C. Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    King v. Dole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552394,3605371\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/782/274/\">\n    782 F.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1986) (per curiam). Therefore, DOL argues, the case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Brookens filed the Federal Circuit appeal more than 30 days after he received the MSPB's order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOL Br. at 3. DOL argues in the alternative that, even if\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   is no longer controlling precedent, the case should be dismissed as time-barred under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552394,3605371\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/782/274/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brookens opposes on the ground that the Federal Circuit's order has already resolved DOL's motion by holding that his claims were timely and that this Court has jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18 (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\") at 3-8. Brookens further argues that the case should not be dismissed merely because Brookens erred by filing in the wrong court, especially since he did so within the 60-day deadline for taking appeals from the MSPB to the Federal Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

When Brookens disregarded that clear directive and filed in the Federal Circuit, he did so at his own peril.

Inexplicably, he waited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, even after filing in the wrong court at the wrong time, Brookens had one last chance to save at least part of his case. After discovering the jurisdictional problem posed by Brookens' appeal, the Federal Circuit asked him whether he had abandoned his discrimination claims. Fed. Cir. Dkt. at 5 (docket entry 57). Had Brookens said \"yes,\" he could have preserved the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction over the rest of his case. Instead, acting through counsel (which he had retained by that point), he continued to press his discrimination claims and advanced the meritless theory that the MSPB's ruling was jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-5. Brookens thereby argued his way out of federal court entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, Brookens' failure to file on time and in the right court was entirely the result of his \"misunderstanding of the law\" and \"tactical mistakes in litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Menominee Indian Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182336,4111055\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/51/\">\n    764 F.3d at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
