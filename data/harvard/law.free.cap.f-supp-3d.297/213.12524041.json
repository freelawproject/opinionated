(\"Citizens\") alleging a claim for violation of the National Bank Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2085\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Act\"). More specifically, Fawcett alleges that Citizen violated the Act by mischaracterizing charges to her account as \"Sustained Overdraft Fees,\" which were in fact interest charges with an annual rate of interest that exceeded the rate permitted to be charged under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Order addresses Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification And To Hold Motion In Abeyance Pending Class Discovery (Docket No. 5), and Defendant Citizen Bank, N.A.'s Motion To Dismiss And/Or Stay And To Compel Arbitration (Docket No. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    A Summary of Fawcett's Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When a Citizens Bank checking account customer incurs a debit to their account (such as a check, ATM withdrawal, or debit card transaction) which exceeds the amount of money in that account, and Citizens honors the debit (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pays the check, permits the ATM withdrawal, or pays the debit card transaction) and charges the customer an \"Overdraft Fee of $35.\" If Citizens returns a check presented for payment by one of its customers due to \"insufficient funds\",\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , does not honor the check, it charges $35 against the customer's account, which Citizens refers to as a \"Returned Item Fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   If Citizens returns the check due to insufficient funds, the $35 Returned Item Fee is the only fee Citizens Bank charges as a result of a check having been presented for payment which exceeded the balance remaining in the account. If, however, Citizens honors an overdraft by advancing the deficiency to the customer, and if the customer does not repay that advance (by depositing sufficient funds into the account to bring the account balance positive or at least zero) within a very short period, Citizens charges what it calls a \"Sustained Overdraft Fee.\" This charge is in addition to the initial \"Overdraft Fee\" Citizens charges at the time the customer's account was first overdrawn. Citizens continues to charge the so-called \"Sustained Overdraft Fee\" over regular intervals until the customer repays Citizens' monetary advances by returning his or her account to a positive balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fawcett acknowledges that the initial \"Returned Item Fee\" and the \"Overdraft Fee,\" are \"fees\" Citizens charges for the service of responding when a customer causes a check or other debit to be presented when there are insufficient funds in the customer's account. However, she contends that the so-called \"Sustained Overdraft Fee\" is, in reality, interest that Citizens charges to its customers for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money it has \"loaned\" to its customer by advancing the funds necessary to pay the overdraft. She contends that the only service or thing of value that Citizens provides in exchange for the so-called \"Sustained Overdraft Fee\" is the continued use of the funds it previously loaned to the customer, which are still owed by the customer to Citizens. Thus, according to Fawcett, the \"Sustained Overdraft Fee\" is, in fact, an interest charge. The Act limits the interest rate which a national bank such as Citizens can charge its customers. Fawcett argues that the annualized interest rate which Citizens\n   charges customers in the guise of \"Sustained Overdraft Fees,\" is substantially greater than the maximum interest rate that the Act permits Citizens to charge.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <em>\n     Citizens' Motion to Compel Arbitration\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Citizens, invoking the Federal Arbitration Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    (\"FAA\"), asserts that because the parties have an agreement to arbitrate, this Court must compel arbitration and stay or dismiss Fawcett's claims pending arbitration.

Fawcett has filed a Complaint alleging that the Sustained Overdraft Fee charged by Citizens is actually interest charged at a rate which violates the Act. It cannot reasonably disputed that this alleged claim falls within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement (and Fawcett does not assert otherwise).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Nevertheless, Plaintiff asserts that she cannot be compelled to arbitrate because Citizens cannot prove she was a party to an arbitration agreement. More specifically, she asserts that Citizens has not established that a copy of the 2015 version of the PDAA (the version which contained the Arbitration Agreement) was ever provided to her. She also contends that there is no evidence she ever assented to the arbitration provision, and that the Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable because Citizens retained the \"unilateral and unfettered right to modify the agreement's terms.\"\n    <em>\n     Pls. Opp. to Def's Mot. To Dismiss And/Or Stay and To Compel Arbitration\n    </em>\n    , (Docket No. 22) at p. 1. As to Ms. Fawcett's latter contentions, there is no dispute that when she opened her checking account, she signed an signature card which provided that she agreed to be bound by PDAA, as amended and in effect from time to time. Under Massachusetts law, which governs this case, formation of a contract requires an offer, acceptance and consideration, and is judged by the parties' objective conduct, not their subjective intent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bekele v. Lyft, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175912\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/284/#p294\">\n     199 F.Supp.3d 284\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 294 (D.Mass. 2016). Ms. Fawcett's suggestion that despite her having expressly agreed to be bound by subsequent amendments to the PDAA, Massachusetts law requires that she somehow \"manifest\" her assent to the Arbitration Agreement in order to be bound thereby is meritless. However, that does not end the inquiry. Ms. Fawcett is also, essentially, asserting that because she did not receive notice of the amendment to the PDAA, there was never a \"meeting of the minds\" regarding the Arbitration Agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind v. Container Store Inc.\n    </em>\n    , Civ. Act.

I agree. The Arbitration Agreement by its terms gives Fawcett the right to opt out. If she never received a copy of the Arbitration Agreement, that right is meaningless. Thus, while Ms. Fawcett need not communicate her assent to be bound by the Arbitration Agreement to Citizens, for example, by sending written acceptance or, perhaps by continuing to use her account, she still must be provided notice of the Agreement to Arbitrate in order for a contract to have been formed. Nowhere in its submissions does Citizens suggest that it sent Ms. Fawcett a copy of the amendment to the PDAA adding the Arbitration Agreement, or that it otherwise communicated the amendment to her. Indeed, the PDAA provides that it may be amended without notice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Because it is unclear to the Court whether Ms. Fawcett received notice of the amendment to the PDAA adding the Arbitration Agreement, I cannot make a definitive ruling on Citizens' motion to compel arbitration. Therefore, on or before March 21, 2018, Citizens shall provide the Court and Ms. Fawcett with whatever evidence it has in its possession to support a finding that it communicated the amendment to the PDAA adding the Arbitration Agreement to Ms. Fawcett and the time period during which it did so. If Citizens fails to provide the necessary evidence by that date, then its motion to stay and compel arbitration shall be denied. The Court will then address Citizens' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    A hearing will be held on Monday, April 9, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. to address Citizens' motion to compel and/or dismiss for failure to state claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     Supplemental Briefing\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Ms. Fawcett contends that the Arbitration Agreement is \"illusory\" because Citizens retains the right to unilaterally change its terms, or cancel it altogether, without prior notice to the account holder. As Ms. Fawcett points out, Citizens retains the right, \"in its sole discretion,\" to amend or terminate any term or condition of the PDAA without notice, unless applicable law would require advance notice. The Fifth Circuit has held that under Texas law, an arbitration agreement is illusory, thus not enforceable, \" '[w]here one party has the unrestrained unilateral authority to terminate its obligation to arbitrate.' \"\n    <em>\n     Nelson v.
