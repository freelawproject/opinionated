Unjust enrichment (Dkt. 33 at \u00b6\u00b6 11.1-11.14)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's counterclaim for Unjust Enrichment alleges that, as required by ICE, GEO operates the Voluntary Work Program, which is not intended to, and does not, create an employer/employee relationship between GEO and detainees, whose participation is voluntary. Dkt. 33 at \u00b6 11.1. The program is intended to promote institutional maintenance and reduce detainee idleness, it is alleged, with no traditional, standard, performance metrics used to measure job performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.3. The counterclaim further alleges that if Plaintiff prevails in a Washington Minimum Age Act claim for lost wages, Defendant is entitled to recover \"its costs and expenses associated with operating the Voluntary Work Program and caring for plaintiff and any putative class member.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Answer separately alleges an affirmative defense for offset of any costs incurred in caring for Plaintiff and costs associated with operating the Voluntary Work Program. Dkt. 33 at \u00b6 8.14. Plaintiff does not seek to strike or dismiss the offset affirmative defense. Dkt. 39 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant is not entitled to any restitution from Plaintiff for housing and other expenses, because\n   Defendant has already been fully paid by ICE for those services. Dkt. 39 at 3. Although Defendant may have conferred a benefit on Plaintiff, e.g., by providing food and lodging, Plaintiff was involuntarily detained and had no input over his conditions. Dkt. 37 at 6. Under circumstances where ICE paid Defendant for Plaintiff's and other detainees' living expenses, Plaintiff opines, it is not inequitable for Plaintiff to retain the value of his basic necessities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiff contends, Defendant cannot recover losses incurred because of its illegal failure to observe State wage laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant responds by again addressing the merits of whether Plaintiff is an \"employee\" under the Washington Minimum Wage Act. Dkt. 38 at 26, 27. Defendant argues further that \"[c]ourts\" have allowed \"contingent unjust enrichment counterclaims in minimum wage actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant cites to two nonbinding opinions,\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

A claim for unjust enrichment has three elements: (1) the defendant [or counter-defendant] receives a benefit, (2) the received benefit is at the plaintiff's [or counter-plaintiff's] expense, and (3) the circumstances make it unjust for the defendant [or counter-defendant] to retain the benefit without payment.\n   <em>\n    Young v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996704\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/164/477/#p484\">\n    164 Wash.2d 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20P.3d%201258\">\n    191 P.3d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first element is satisfied by the allegation that Defendant conferred on Plaintiff the benefit of food, lodging, and other necessities and amenities. The second element is satisfied under the theory that if Plaintiff receives an award for lost wages from Defendant, Plaintiff has received both the benefit conferred\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the award for lost wages, both at Defendant's expense. The third element is satisfied under the theory that such compensation would unfairly increase Defendant's burden to comply with ICE contract obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's argument, that Defendant cannot recover restitution from Plaintiff because it has already been fully paid by ICE, is relevant to the second and third elements, but not on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Court does not here reach the merits of whether Defendant should be precluded from recovery because of its own illegal conduct. That is an equitable argument better reached at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As a practical matter, the counterclaim overlaps substantially with Affirmative Defense 8.14 (offset). The counterclaim for Unjust Enrichment may be flawed, but the issue raised by Plaintiff is whether Defendant has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendant has done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the counterclaim for Unjust Enrichment for failure to state a claim should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Further, plaintiff is not an \"employee,\" and GEO is not an \"employer\" with respect to Voluntary Work Program participation, and therefore the FLSA's and MWA's minimum wage protections do not apply to plaintiff or any putative class member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dkt. 33 at \u00b6 12.12. Immediately following that paragraph, with no separate heading, the Answer reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   GEO prays for the following affirmative relief:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1.

The determination of what relief, if any, should be granted to either party is a long way off and should not be decided now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court notes that both the prayer for affirmative relief and \u00b6 12.12 seek declaratory relief for an order on the applicability of the FLSA. Plaintiff has explicitly brought this case only under the Washington Minimum Wage Act, not its federal counterpart. Therefore, requests for declaratory relief regarding the FLSA should be stricken. Whether the FLSA has some evidentiary value here remains an open question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike the counterclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief should be denied without prejudice, except relief requested under the FLSA, which should be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant also seeks leave to amend its counterclaim.

Dkt. 37 at 12. Further, Plaintiff contends, the Complaint seeks to certify only a class of detainees \"who perform or have performed ... at any time during the three years prior to the filing of this complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.

Dkt. 38 at 15. Per Defendant, although the Complaint limits the proposed class to detainees who worked within the three years prior to the case, the Complaint does not limit the scope of recovery of the proposed class from recovery outside the statutory period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This would allow recovery for, for example, unpaid wages from 2013 (outside the statutory period) for a plaintiff-detainee who worked in 2017 (within the statutory period).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff counters this argument by explaining his interpretation of the Complaint: the proposed class is limited \"to the work performed within the statutory period.\" Dkt. 39 at 8, citing to Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 5.1. Given Plaintiff's interpretation of his own claim, it is unlikely that the statute of limitations will be implicated. Nevertheless, naming the defense now is not redundant or insufficient, and protects the defendant, should any claim outside the limitations period appear as the case develops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defense 8.2 should be denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     8.4 Plaintiff has unreasonably delayed in requesting relief, and his lack of diligence and activity in stating or making a legal claim-to the prejudice of GEO-means his claim is barred by the affirmative defense of laches.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of laches should be stricken because Defendant has pleaded no set of facts that would give Plaintiff fair notice of an intended basis for the defense suggesting an unreasonable, prejudicial delay.

The Ninth Circuit has recently extended the logic of\n   <em>\n    SCA Hygiene\n   </em>\n   to habeas actions, subject to a different statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Grant v.

Its logic applies with equal force to the risk of shortening the three year statutory period in this case. The Complaint seeks relief for lost wages only within the statutory period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 1.1. Addressing the merits of a laches affirmative defense could shorten the statutory period for the case to be filed, an outcome that would place the Court in the role of legislator. Laches is an insufficient defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defense 8.4 should be granted and the defense stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     8.5 Plaintiff waived his claims when he (and/or putative class members) freely elected to participate in the Voluntary Work Program.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant is statutorily precluded from bringing a waiver defense under Washington law, which prohibits any agreement between employers and employees to pay employees below minimum wage. Dkt. 37 at 13, citing RCW 49.60.090(1). It follows, Plaintiff continues, that Plaintiff could not have waived his minimum wage protections even if he wanted to.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276006\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/914/#p919\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant argues that, by virtue of participating in the Voluntary Work Program, Plaintiff was not an \"employee\" for Washington State Minimum Wage Act purposes and not subject to, and thus waived, its protections. Dkt. 38 at 17, 18. Defendant maintains that Plaintiff participated in a voluntary program and received an allowance or stipend, electing not to complete the \"requisite paperwork\" to be treated like an ICE employee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276006\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/914/#p919\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The parties' arguments boil down to the issue of whether the Washington Minimum Wage Act applies. Defendant's argument repeats its attack on the issue of whether Plaintiff could be an \"employee.\" Dkt. 28 at 13, 14. RCW 49.60.090(1) provides: \"Any agreement between such employee and the employer allowing the employee to receive less than what is due under this chapter shall be no defense to such action.\" Under the assumption that Plaintiff is an employee, Washington law precludes Plaintiff from waiving his right to the prevailing minimum wage. Alternatively, under the assumption that Plaintiff was not an employee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 28 at 14, ln. 11, 12, Plaintiff would not be entitled to lost wages under the Washington Minimum\n   Wage Act, and waiver would be a nonissue. Under either scenario, the merits of waiver by Plaintiff would not be reached. The affirmative defense of waiver is therefore an insufficient defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defense 8.5 should be granted and the defense stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     8.8 Plaintiff's claim is not ripe\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     AND\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     8.9 Plaintiff's claim is not justiciable.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant's standing argument predominately overlaps with its exhaustion argument.\n   <em>\n    See 8.11 below\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff lacks standing because he was not a lawful permanent resident when detained and was ineligible to work and to bring a lost wages claim. Dkt. 38 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues that he was, in fact, entitled to minimum wage protections regardless of whether work was performed with employment authorization, because the Washington Minimum Wage Act applies to any \"employee\" as defined by state law. Dkt. 39 at 11. Plaintiff also argues that, as a threshold matter, ripeness is a subject-matter jurisdictional challenge under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), not an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276006\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/914/#p919\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court's subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). As a practical matter, whether the ripeness and justiciability affirmative defenses are stricken is inconsequential to the merits of whether the Court has jurisdiction. The defenses are not insufficient or redundant, and need not be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defenses 8.8 and 8.9 should be denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     8.10 Plaintiff has unclean hands.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant's theory is that Plaintiff has unclean hands, by filing this case under suspect circumstances, where he may have been motivated by political reasons, coercion, or undue influences. Dkt. 38 at 20. Defendant points to Plaintiff's apparent political influence and the coordination of this lawsuit with another filed by the Washington State Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276006\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/914/#p919\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Defendant has done nothing more than cast baseless, hyperbolic aspersions against Plaintiff, none of which are found in the Answer itself, so the Affirmative Defense, as alleged, is insufficient. Dkt. 39 at 12. Further, according to Plaintiff, the equitable defense of unclean hands does not apply to the Washington Minimum Wage Act. Dkt. 39 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff overstates what an affirmative defense must contain. Unlike the complaint, which must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(2), an Answer need only give notice of the defense \"in short and plain terms.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)(A). The rule gives examples of properly-termed affirmative defenses, \"including: accord and satisfaction; arbitration and award; assumption of risk; contributory negligence; duress; estoppel[.]\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)(1). As alleged by Defendant in this case, the Affirmative Defense is sufficient for Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)(A) purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument, that the unclean hands doctrine does not apply to the Washington Minimum Wage Act, relies only on persuasive authority. Plaintiff cites to\n   <em>\n    Bailon v. Seok AM No. 1 Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204884340\">\n    2009 WL 4884340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (W.D. Wash. 2009), a case from this district.\n   <em>\n    Bailon\n   </em>\n   is of minimal assistance, because it rejected the affirmative defense of unclean hands summarily and as to a \"FLSA/MWA\" claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204884340\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *2 and *5. Defendant has articulated a cognizable theory that provides Plaintiff with notice, and the defense is neither insufficient nor redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defense 8.10 should be denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     8.11 Exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   According to Defendant, Washington law recognizes the \"principle in [the Washington Minimum Wage Act]\" that administrative remedies must be pursued prior to court intervention. Dkt. 38 at 18, citing to RCW 49.46.040(2). Defendant also argues that Plaintiff should have, but failed to, exhaust federal administrative remedies, on two grounds: so that he could legally work for ICE with an approved I-765 work permit, and because he was a detainee and thus subject to administrative grievance procedures of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant has not made any showing that the Washington Minimum Wage Act requires exhaustion of administrative remedies, where Defendant cites only to RCW 49.46.040(2). The subsection states: \"With the consent and cooperation of federal agencies charged with the administration of federal labor laws, the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries director\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   ...utilize the services of federal agencies and their employees[.]\" RCW 49.46.040(2) (emphasis added). The statute simply authorizes Washington L &amp; I to partner with federal counterparts and does not speak to a required administrative remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Regarding federal administrative remedies, Defendant's arguments fare no better. First, the issue of whether Plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies for an I-765 work permit is not determinative of whether Plaintiff was an \"employee\" for Washington Minimum Wage Act purposes. Under Washington law, courts decide whether a person is an \"employee\" by applying the economic-dependence test.\n   <em>\n    Anfinson v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021791\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/851/#p871\">\n    174 Wash.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=281%20P.3d%20289\">\n    281 P.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). To this Court's knowledge-and Plaintiff has not provided authority to the contrary-applying this test does not necessarily implicate consideration of federal administrative remedies. Second, as Plaintiff correctly notes, \"an alien detained by [ICE, formerly known as] INS[,] pending deportation is not a \"prisoner\" within the meaning of the PLRA,\"\n   <em>\n    Agyeman v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405590\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/871/#p886\">\n    296 F.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886 (9th Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   There is no showing as a matter of law that, under either state or federal law, Plaintiff needed to exhaust administrative remedies precedent to bringing a Washington Minimum Wage Act claim. The defense is insufficient. Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defense 8.11 should be granted and the defense stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     8.12. Class certification is improper because plaintiff [\n    </em>\n    sic\n    <em>\n     ] cannot prove that certification is warranted\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     AND\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     8.13. Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney's fees or costs.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Affirmative Defenses 8.12 and 8.13 are not, in fact, affirmative defenses. Dkt. 37 at 15. Plaintiff maintains that striking them will minimize confusion and streamline the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405590\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/871/#p886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant has not opposed Plaintiff's motion to strike on these grounds and appears to have abandoned Affirmative Defenses 8.12 and 8.13.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff. Notwithstanding Defendant's right to oppose motions for class certification, and for attorney's fees or costs, these defenses are not truly defenses and are therefore insufficient. Plaintiff's motion to strike Affirmative Defenses 8.12 and 8.13 should be granted and the defenses stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
