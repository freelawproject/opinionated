Sonos seeks to exclude the testimony of D &amp; M's invalidity expert, Dr. Jay P. Kesan. Dkt. No. 292. D &amp; M seeks to strike all or parts of the expert opinions of (1) Sonos's damages expert, Mr. Michael E. Tate; (2) Sonos's infringement expert, Dr. Kevin C. Almeroth; and (3) Sonos's invalidity expert, Dr. Andrew Wolfe. Dkt. Nos. 299 and 300. On October 30, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the motions, at which the Court ruled on some of the issues and took some under submission. This order addresses all of the issues raised by the parties in the three motions. Sonos's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. D &amp; M's motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sonos, a seller of wireless audio equipment, has asserted several patents against D &amp; M, one of its competitors. The asserted patents cover five features that are offered in both Sonos's and D &amp; M's networked wireless speaker products. Two of the patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 9,195,258 (\"the '258 patent\") and 9,202,509 (\"the '509 patent\"), which are referred to as the synchronization patents, allow for synchronized audio playback by two or more speakers. Two other patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,571,014 (\"the '014 patent\") and 8,588,949 (\"the '949 patent\"), referred to as the group volume control patents, allow for the volume of two or more speakers or speaker groups to be adjusted simultaneously. Two other patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 9,219,959 (\"the '959 patent\") and 9,212,959 (\"the '959 patent\"), referred to as the pairing patents, allow for two or more separate speakers to be paired to provide multi-channel sound. Another patent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C042%2C556\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,042,556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '556 patent\"), referred to as the orientation patent, provides for shaping the audio output based on the orientation of the speaker, e.g., whether the speaker is horizontal or vertical. Finally,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C938%2C312\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,938,312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '312 patent\"), referred to as the autoplay patent, allows a speaker to detect an audio signal from an external source, such as the speaker's line-in input connector, and to select that source for playback when the external audio source begins outputting an audio signal. The two group volume control patents and one of the synchronization patents (the '258 patent ) are scheduled to be tried in a bellwether trial beginning December 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

No. 307, Ex. A \u00b6 106. The report of Sonos's expert, Dr. Almeroth, describes a person of ordinary skill in the art as \"a person having the equivalent of a four-year degree from an accredited institution (usually\n   denoted as a B.S. degree) in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, or the equivalent, and approximately 2-4 years of professional experience in the fields of networking and consumer audio systems, or an equivalent level of skill and knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Opening Expert Report of Dr. Kevin C. Almeroth (\"Almeroth Report\")\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 311, Ex. E-3 \u00b6 35. Dr. Almeroth explained in his deposition that the level of skill needed for a person to be considered one of ordinary skill in the art pertinent to this case is not demanding, that \"in some instances a master's degree can substitute for some or all of the professional experience,\" and that \"by the time you get to the level of a Ph.D., you have person who's beyond ordinary skill in the art.\" Dkt. No. 347-1, Ex. 44, at 82:8-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sonos argues that Dr. Kesan is not a person of ordinary skill in the art, because of his lack of technical work experience in the pertinent art at the time of the invention. Sonos contends that Dr. Kesan is simply an attorney and a law professor who has done no relevant technical work for more than 25 years. Most importantly, according to Sonos, Dr. Kesan has never worked in the field of \"consumer networked audio technology,\" and in particular he did not work in that field in the early 2000s, when consumer networked audio products were first emerging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court is satisfied that Dr. Kesan's qualifications are sufficient to make his testimony helpful to the jury in understanding the evidence in this case. Dr. Kesan holds a B.S. degree in electrical engineering and both a M.S. and a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering. During his professional career, he has conducted research on the use of radio frequency technologies for use in wireless communications.\n   <em>\n    Kesan Report\n   </em>\n   App. B;\n   <em>\n    Declaration of Dr. Jay P. Kesan (\"Kesan Decl.\")\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 345 \u00b6 6. After completing his education, Dr. Kesan was employed for four years at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center as a research staff scientist, where he worked on integrated chip technology.\n   <em>\n    Kesan Report\n   </em>\n   App. B;\n   <em>\n    Kesan Decl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Dr. Kesan then went to law school. Since his graduation from law school in 1999, Dr. Kesan has focused on the intersection of law and technology. He is currently affiliated with both the College of Law and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Kesan Report\n   </em>\n   App. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although in recent years Dr. Kesan has devoted much of his time to activities related more to law than to engineering, he has continued to work on radio frequency identification devices and has been issued a number of patents in that field of technology. Dkt. No. 371-1, Ex. I at 8:15-20, 260:6-12. He has also worked as a consulting expert in wired, wireless, and cellular communication technologies,\n   <em>\n    Kesan Decl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, and he has served as a technical expert in patent lawsuits regarding various communication technologies,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. In short, although his career has not been devoted exclusively to work as an electrical engineer and computer scientist, and although he has not specialized in the study of consumer networked audio technology, Dr. Kesan has a combination of education and work experience that is, at the least, equivalent to a person having a bachelor's degree and approximately two to four years of professional experience in the electrical engineering, computer science, and communication fields.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sonos discounts Dr. Kesan's experience by pointing out that he lacks two to four years of experience in \"consumer networked audio technology.\" Dkt. No. 370, at 1. But that argument draws the scope of the pertinent art too narrowly. Both Dr. Kesan and Dr. Almeroth agree that the pertinent art includes electrical engineering\n   and circuitry, computer science and engineering, and networking and wireless communications. However, Dr. Almeroth contends that the pertinent art is further limited to \"networking and consumer audio systems, or an equivalent level of skill and knowledge.\" Almeroth Report \u00b6 35. And in its reply brief, Sonos suggests that the pertinent field of art is even narrower than that, being limited to consumer networked audio technology and not including \"general networking concepts.\" Dkt. No. 370, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The question for the Court in assessing an expert's field of expertise is whether the expert's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a). In order for an expert to have such knowledge, it is not necessary that the expert have expertise in the precise technology that is the subject of the patent or patents in suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528111\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/717/#p741\">\n    35 F.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (3d Cir. 1994) (\" Rule 702's liberal policy of admissibility extends to the substantive as well as the formal qualification of experts.

Particularly in a field involving new and emerging technology, there may be few experts with the kind of highly specialized expertise that Sonos is demanding. The Court is satisfied that Dr. Kesan's technical expertise is sufficiently related to the subject matter of the patents in suit to be helpful to the jury in understanding the evidence and making appropriate findings with respect to the facts of the case. Sonos's challenges to the specificity of Dr. Kesan's expertise go more to the weight of his testimony and are therefore better left for the jury to assess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas &amp; Betts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=342%20Fed.%20Appx.%20754\">\n    342 Fed.Appx. at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The case law that Sonos cites is not to the contrary.

Sonos has not pointed to any particular portions of Dr. Kesan's report that constitute opinion evidence about the requirements of the law, and the Court therefore sees no reason to address that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sonos's contention that \"Dr. Kesan's improper legal opinions are scattered throughout various sections and appendices of the Kesan Report,\" Dkt. No. 336, at 9, is too general a complaint for the Court to address in any meaningful way. Does Sonos expect the Court to review all 1315 pages of Dr. Kesan's Report and Rebuttal Report in search of the \"improper legal opinions\" that are assertedly \"scattered throughout various sections and appendices\" of those reports? Without any more specificity than that, the Court is unable to address Sonos's objection and therefore deems that objection waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Relatedly, Sonos makes the broad assertion that \"the numerous, varied legal topics addressed in the Kesan Report make clear that Dr. Kesan, who is not a person of ordinary skill in the art in this case, is simply making attorney arguments clothed as expert testimony that go beyond the practices and procedures at the Patent Office.\" Dkt. No. 336, at 9. But the Court has already concluded that Dr. Kesan is sufficiently skilled in the art to testify as a technical expert. His testimony on technical factual issues leading to a conclusion of invalidity will therefore not be excluded. Moreover, as noted above, a person familiar with the practices of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Dr. Kesan is competent to testify as to issues of patent practice, and his opinions on those subjects are sufficiently reliable to submit to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Beyond its general complaints about Dr. Kesan's purported legal opinions, Sonos raises several specific objections to Dr. Kesan's report in the \"Legal Opinions\" portion of its motion. Dkt. No. 336, at 9-11. In particular, Sonos objects to Dr. Kesan's analysis of secondary considerations, such as commercial success and copying. Sonos contends that Dr. Kesan has merely stated ultimate conclusions without supporting facts. Dkt. No. 336, at 10. As to certain aspects of Sonos's challenge to Dr. Kesan's testimony, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, Dr. Kesan's report contains a single paragraph addressing commercial success as a secondary consideration bearing on the issue of obviousness. In that paragraph, the report asserts that \"it appears that the primary reason for [Sonos's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   commercial success is the availability of [Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) compatible] controllers, such as for PCs and smart phones.\"\n   <em>\n    Kesan Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123. The report continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Without such controllers, Sonos would have to sell a dedicated controller for its devices, which would have made the Sonos product line no different from that of the many other manufacturers of home audio equipment. In addition, UPnP enabled the Sonos speakers to operate, and there is no evidence that Sonos would have been able to make a product if it was unable to use UPnP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11494767\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/79/252/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Kesan provided no evidentiary support for his conclusion that the availability of UPnP-compatible controllers was the primary reason for Sonos's commercial success. Because Dr. Kesan's opinion on that issue is not supported by reference to any evidence, it does not satisfy the requirement of Rule of Evidence 702(b) that the testimony be \"based on sufficient facts or data.\" Moreover, the assertion does not appear to be based on Dr. Kesan's expertise in electrical engineering and computer science or any undisclosed familiarity with the home audio equipment market. It therefore does not satisfy the requirement of Rule of Evidence 702(a) that the expert's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   D &amp; M's only response to Sonos's argument on that point is that \"the challenged opinions are technical in nature.\" Dkt. No. 357, at 16. According to D &amp; M, Dr. Kesan \"is thus qualified, and has basis for, opining about the differences between UPnP, Sonos's, and other technology in the field, as well as the implementations of these technologies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11494767\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/79/252/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But D &amp; M's reply is a non-sequitur. Dr. Kesan may well be familiar with the technical features of UPnP, but that does not mean that he has any reason to know, without reference to any supporting evidence, that the availability of UPnP-compatible controllers was the primary reason for the commercial success of Sonos's products. The Court will exclude Dr. Kesan's testimony on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Dr. Kesan's report briefly asserts that Sonos copied devices that were in the marketplace when it drafted the claims of its patents-in-suit.\n   <em>\n    Kesan Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126. The report states that because \"there were many systems that were in operation and commercially successful prior to the filing of the applications for the Asserted Patents,\" it is \"more likely\" that Sonos copied prior art.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11494767\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/79/252/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Kesan provides no support for that assertion. And when discussing unsuccessful attempts by others, Dr. Kesan again concludes, without explanation or citation, that the success of UPnP and competing products by other companies suggests that Sonos \"merely copied\" those inventions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127. Copying may be proved by evidence such as internal documents, comparison of the devices, and analysis by witnesses of the similar features of the devices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iron Grip Barbell Co. v. USA Sports, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191676\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/1317/#p1325\">\n    392 F.3d 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Dr. Kesan's report, however, contains no such evidence. His barebones conclusion that Sonos copied the prior art will therefore be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Sonos separately objects to the portions of Dr. Kesan's report that are directed to invalidity on grounds of lack of enablement and indefiniteness. Dkt. No. 336, at 10-11. Sonos's objection is based on its contention that Dr. Kesan's opinions on that subject were provided in \"his capacity as a legal expert and not a technical expert in the pertinent art.\" Dkt. No. 336, at 10. Sonos does not point to any specific statements in that regard by Dr. Kesan, but once again simply contends that Dr. Kesan's \"speculative and conclusory opinions\n   are scattered throughout the Kesan Report.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191676\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/1317/#p1325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court rejects Sonos's motion to strike all of Dr. Kesan's opinions on enablement and indefiniteness. It has generally been held to be permissible for a technical expert in a patent case to provide an opinion on questions such as whether an asserted patent claim, as construed by the court, reads on an accused product, or whether a claimed invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the patent application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sundance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5883980\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1356/#p1363\">\n    550 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1364 ;\n   <em>\n    Symbol Techs., Inc. v.

Accordingly, the Court rejects Sonos's categorical objection to Dr. Kesan's testimony bearing on the issue of invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court grants in part and denies in part Sonos's motion to exclude Dr. Kesan's expert testimony on invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III. D &amp; M's Motion to Preclude Testimony from Mr. Tate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   D &amp; M moves to bar testimony on damages from Sonos's damages expert, Mr. Tate, on the ground that his opinions misapply established law in two respects. Dkt. No. 299. First, D &amp; M contends that Mr. Tate's reasonable royalty opinion is unreliable because it fails to apportion damages to the accused features and instead uses the full sales price of the accused HEOS devices as the royalty base. Second, D &amp; M contends that Mr. Tate's lost profits analysis is unreliable because it fails to demonstrate that there were no acceptable non-infringing alternatives to which D &amp; M could have turned to avoid infringing Sonos's patents and because it fails to analyze the non-infringing alternatives on a customer-by-customer basis. D &amp; M's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Tate's Reasonable Royalty Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In his damages report, Mr. Tate sought to determine Sonos's reasonable royalty damages beginning in March 2014, when D &amp; M began selling its allegedly infringing HEOS products.\n   <em>\n    See Expert Report of Michael E. Tate (\"Tate Report\")\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 310, at 61-112. In so doing, Mr. Tate analyzed the 15 factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Georgia Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Plywood Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3170522\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/318/1116/#p1120\">\n    318 F.Supp. 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (S.D.N.Y. 1970), which provide guidance for approximating the result of a hypothetical license negotiation between a patentee and an alleged infringer. Among other considerations, Mr. Tate relied on a report produced by KPMG that was produced on D &amp; M's behalf in January 2015. In that report, KPMG summarized the results of its research on royalty agreements in the consumer audio industry. The report concluded that patent royalty rates in the consumer audio industry ranged in amount from 2% to 25% of revenue, with a median of 6%.\n   <em>\n    Tate Report\n   </em>\n   , at 66-67. Using the KPMG report as his benchmark, Mr. Tate concluded that D &amp; M would have agreed to pay at least 6% of its revenue for Sonos's patents relating to the group volume control and synchronization features, and at least 2% of its revenue for the pairing, autoplay, and speaker orientation patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11. In calculating a reasonable royalty, Mr. Tate multiplied those royalty rates by the total revenue derived by D &amp; M from the sales of all of its HEOS products except for those on which Sonos was seeking damages under a lost profits theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   D &amp; M argues that Mr. Tate's reasonable royalty opinion is unreliable because Mr. Tate failed to apportion damages to the accused features. Dkt. No. 299, at 6-13. A patentee is entitled to damages that are related to the patented features of a product, but not to unpatented features found in the same product. For that reason, it is well established that the patentee must provide \"evidence tending to separate or apportion the defendant's profits and the patentee's damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features\" or demonstrate that \"the entire value of the whole machine, as a marketable article, is properly and legally attributable to the patented feature.\"\n   <em>\n    Uniloc USA, Inc. v.

The arguments made by Sonos, that the patented features are desirable and important or even essential, are not sufficient to prove that those features\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   drive the market for the HEOS products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The flaw in Mr. Tate's reasoning is underscored by the fact-raised in D &amp; M's opening brief and not adequately addressed in Sonos's opposition-that at least half of all HEOS owners own only one HEOS product. Dkt. No. 414, Ex. D \u00b6 62 &amp; n.140 (describing various sources of evidence that indicate that between 49% and 63% of HEOS customers own only one product). That is to say, at least half of all HEOS owners cannot use the synchronization, group volume control, or pairing features described in Sonos's patents, at least not without purchasing another HEOS unit. Therefore, it can be assumed that those features are not the driving factor in those customers' purchasing decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Mr. Tate did not adjust his calculations to take account of the one-HEOS-only customer purchases before using the entire market value for all of D &amp; M's speaker sales as his royalty base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Similarly, Sonos has not demonstrated that the orientation and autoplay features are so central to the utility of the D &amp; M products as to justify the use of the entire market value as the royalty base. Sonos launched its PLAY:5 product in November 2009 without the orientation feature; it added that feature in its second generation speaker in November 2015. Dkt. No. 299, at 13. Yet, the evidence in the record indicates that sales of the PLAY:5 were higher in 2014 and 2015 than they were in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Tate Report\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 11.1. Even assuming, as Mr. Tate states, that the orientation feature is \"important\" and \"necessary to achieve optimal sound quality,\"\n   <em>\n    Tate Report\n   </em>\n   at 31, Mr. Tate has not stated, and Sonos has not pointed to other evidence, that the presence of the orientation feature is what motivates consumers to buy the product. Similarly, although the autoplay feature is a desirable function that makes D &amp; M's sound bar a \"competitive and functional product,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, Mr. Tate has provided no evidence that the autoplay feature, on its own, drives sales of the D &amp; M products. To the contrary, the autoplay feature in Sonos's PLAYBAR is an optional setting that can be enabled or disabled. The optional nature of the autoplay feature suggests that the feature is not universally desired and does not drive demand for at least those customers who prefer to have the feature disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 n. 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. Tate's reasonable royalty analysis fails to consider the customers who were not induced to purchase a HEOS device based on the five features recited in the Sonos patents. Instead, Mr. Tate assumes that the royalty base should be the entire market value of the HEOS devices, and he estimates the reasonable royalty accordingly. Because Mr. Tate neither considered the value of the allegedly infringing features in relation to the product as a whole, nor showed that those features alone drive consumer demand, his opinion as to the\n   amount of a reasonable royalty for the HEOS products is methodologically unsound. Mr. Tate will therefore not be allowed to testify at trial as to the reasonable royalty theory set forth in his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Tate's Lost Profits Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Tate's report also provides an analysis of the profits that Sonos claims to have lost as a result of D &amp; M's alleged infringement.

Mr. Tate explained that D &amp; M could not have produced a competing product that did not infringe Sonos's patents, and that Sonos had the manufacturing and marketing capabilities to meet the demand for all the sales made to D &amp; M. Finally, assuming that Sonos would have sold additional products but for D &amp; M's infringement, Mr. Tate concluded that D &amp; M's accused sales would have been divided between Sonos and the other competitors in the wireless multi-room audio system market based on their market share. He therefore multiplied D &amp; M's sales by Sonos's market share to calculate the lost sales, and thus the lost profits due to Sonos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   D &amp; M asserts that Mr. Tate's lost profits analysis does not properly prove entitlement to lost profits. The parties' dispute is focused on the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Panduit\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   test, which requires the patentee to demonstrate the absence of acceptable non-infringing alternatives. That requirement exists because, if the customer might have purchased a different, non-infringing product, the patentee cannot establish entitlement to lost profits for that particular sale. That determination is \"made on a customer-by-customer\" basis. A patentee may therefore prove \"entitlement to lost profits for some of its sales, but not others.\"\n   <em>\n    Mentor Graphics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277880\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1275/#p1284\">\n    851 F.3d at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Tate provides no substantive analysis to support that conclusion, but instead relies exclusively on Dr. Almeroth's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Dr. Almeroth, in turn, devotes approximately 25 pages to refuting a document entitled \"Project Estimates: Modifications to HEOS System,\" which is dated October 25, 2016, and which \"relates to D &amp; M's claim that there are commercially acceptable non-infringing alternatives to the Sonos Patents.\"\n   <em>\n    Almeroth Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 652;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 652-710. Dr. Almeroth argues that D &amp; M would be unable to produce commercially acceptable alternatives of its products that do not infringe Sonos's patents, and thus it would be safe to assume that the sales that were made by D &amp; M would otherwise have gone to D &amp; M's competitors, one of which is Sonos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, Sonos's contention that there are no commercially acceptable non-infringing alternatives suffers from a significant flaw. Although Dr. Almeroth argues that D &amp; M could not offer a commercially acceptable non-infringing alternative, Mr. Tate acknowledges that other alternatives exist on the market. Specifically, Mr. Tate calculates that Sonos's share of the market for wireless multi-room speakers ranged from 93.6% in March 2014 to 41.0% in December 2016. Tate Report, Ex. 6.2. Mr. Tate recognized that Bose, Samsung, and Google, among others, offer competing retail products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also analyzed Sonos's market share in the custom integration market, in which Sonos also faces competition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 6.3, 6.4. Neither Mr. Tate nor Dr. Almeroth contended that Bose, Samsung, or Google infringes Sonos's patents. Dr. Almeroth's analysis is limited to describing why D &amp; M could not produce a non-infringing alternative. In calculating lost profits, Mr. Tate even acknowledged that \"some of the accused HEOS product sales would have been made by other companies in the U.S. market based on each company's relative share of the U.S. wireless multi-room audio market.\" Tate Report at 55. It appears, then, that Dr. Almeroth did not dispute that there are commercially acceptable non-infringing alternatives offered by other companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This flaw is not fatal to Mr. Tate's lost profits analysis, however. The Federal Circuit has condoned the use of the \"market share\" approach that Mr. Tate applied as an alternative to showing the absence of acceptable non-infringing alternatives. \"In a complex market with numerous competitors, a patentee may be awarded lost profit[s] damages calculated using its market share among its competitors.\"\n   <em>\n    Mentor Graphics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277880\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1275/#p1284\">\n    851 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1286 n.5 (citing\n   <em>\n    State Indus., Inc. v.

However, Mr. Tate did exactly that, describing the \"wireless multi-room audio system market\" and the primary competitors in both the retail and custom integration markets.\n   <em>\n    Tate Report\n   </em>\n   at 35-36. Mr. Tate further described how and why he used certain data sets to analyze market share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   D &amp; M disagrees with the way Mr. Tate defined the market. The rebuttal report of D &amp; M's expert, Mr. John R. Bone, argues that \"Mr. Tate fails to correctly define the multiple market segments in which the accused products are sold. Instead, Mr. Tate improperly groups all products and all customers into a single market segment, the 'wireless multi-room audio market,' failing to consider nuances that lead to a more broadly defined market for certain products or certain customer groups. He further fails to properly define the custom integration channel, significantly overstating Sonos' market share in that market.\" Dkt. No. 309, Ex. D \u00b6 58. However, whether Mr. Tate or Mr. Bone has more persuasively defined the market is a question for the jury. Mr. Tate has defined the market and analyzed Sonos's market share in a manner that could be helpful to the jury and is relevant and supported by evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, D &amp; M argues that Mr. Tate has improperly assumed that D &amp; M's customers would not buy an infringing HEOS device with the infringing features removed, and that Mr. Tate failed to consider that only certain HEOS products infringed certain of Sonos's patents. Dkt. No. 373, at 3-4. However, Dr. Almeroth's report, on which Mr. Tate relies, performs exactly that analysis. For example, with regard to the group volume control patents, Dr. Almeroth addresses five alternatives proposed by D &amp; M and argues why each is a not an acceptable non-infringing substitute for the infringing product.\n   <em>\n    Almeroth Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 675-79. Although D &amp; M challenges Dr. Almeroth's conclusions about whether or not D &amp; M's non-infringing alternatives are commercially acceptable, D &amp; M did not move to strike Dr. Almeroth's analysis on that ground. In any event, resolution of whether the alternatives are commercially acceptable is a question that is properly left for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly, D &amp; M's motion to strike Mr. Tate's lost profits analysis is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Dkt. No. 300, at 9-11. First, D &amp; M takes issue with Dr. Wolfe's opinions that imply that a \"player\" must be capable of \"actually rendering (i.e., playing) audio content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Opening Rebuttal Expert Report of Andrew Wolfe (\"Wolfe Rebuttal Report\")\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No 315, Ex. E-15 \u00b6 215). Second, D &amp; M contends that Dr. Wolfe's analysis improperly excludes playback devices that \"transmit[ ] audio data packets over a network.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wolfe Rebuttal Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 218). The Court finds neither ground persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In his claim construction order, Judge Andrews ruled that the terms \"zone player,\" \"playback device,\" and \"player\" should be construed to mean \"data network device configured to process and output audio.\" Dkt. No. 219 at 8. After discussing the extrinsic evidence, Judge Andrews concluded that a \"player\" does not need to have an integrated speaker or speaker transducer, but that it must contain an audio processing circuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11. Thus, Judge Andrews reasoned, a \"playback device\" may \"output audio either in the form of an audio signal to an external speaker or as sound waves from an integrated speaker.\" He therefore held that the term \"audio information\" could \"take the form of either an electrical signal or sound waves.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Dr. Wolfe's opinion as to the term \"player\" is consistent with those claim constructions. First, Dr. Wolfe requires that a \"player\" be capable of \"actually rendering (i.e., playing) audio content.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe Rebuttal Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 215. Dr. Wolfe's report does not, as D &amp; M argues, imply that a \"player\" must have an integrated speaker. Instead, it is clear that a playback device must simply \"process and output audio,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , which is consistent with the claim construction order. As Dr. Wolfe explained in his deposition, by using the term \"render\" he meant \"process and output,\" i.e., \"taking something from an encoded form ... and translating it into a sound signal, whether that be electrical or ... physical.\" Dkt. No. 349, Ex. A, at 98:20-99:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, Dr. Wolfe's opinion that a person having ordinary skill in the art would understand that \"transmitting audio data packets over a network does not amount to 'process[ing] and output[ting] audio,' \"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe Rebuttal Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 218 (alterations in original), is not inconsistent with Judge Andrews' claim construction order. In his report, Dr. Wolfe cites a number of Sonos's patents that \"describe transmitting audio data over a network and playing/outputting audio as distinctly different functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A device that only sends and receives network data packets would not be processing and outputting audio. Further, a \"player\" must be able to process audio and output audio \"either in the form of an audio signal to an external speaker or as sound waves,\" Dkt. No. 219, at 15-16, which suggests that a \"player\" must output audio signal, and not only network packets. Dr. Wolfe's opinion is consistent with the claim construction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On this issue, D &amp; M's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Sonos's Experts on \"Copying\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   D &amp; M moves to strike the sections of Sonos's expert reports that state that D &amp; M copied Sonos's patents in creating its HEOS products. D &amp; M asserts\n   three grounds in support of its motion: first, that the opinions are not based on the experts' \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge,\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a) ; second, that the opinions will not \"help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and third, that the opinions are contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20298\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which prohibits using the absence of advice of counsel to prove that the accused infringer willfully infringed. The Court concludes that expert testimony on the issue of copying is not likely to be helpful to the jury, which is fully competent to evaluate the evidence and draw its own conclusion about whether D &amp; M copied Sonos's technology and products.

This dispute matters because it bears on the question whether U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/378,639 (the \"Castor-Perry Provisional\"), which was filed on August 31, 2010, is eligible to be considered as prior art in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Sonos did not assert the '556 patent in its original complaint, filed on October 21, 2014, or in its first or second amended complaints. On January 29, 2016, Sonos sought leave to file a third amended complaint that asserted seven new patents, including the '556 patent. In response to an interrogatory, Sonos stated on October 10, 2016, that \"the subject matter claimed in the '556 Patent was conceived and reduced to practice at least as early as July 19, 2011.\" Dkt. No. 316, Ex. E-17, at 9. Sonos served a request for admission that \"the Asserted Claims of the '556 Patent are entitled to a priority date of July 19, 2011,\" which D &amp; M admitted. Dkt. No. 316, Ex. E-30, at 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Then, on January 18, 2017, in its final invalidity contentions, D &amp; M for the first time claimed the Castor-Perry Provisional, among other new references, as prior art. Sonos moved to strike the new prior art references. Dkt. No. 247. Judge Andrews denied the motion at a discovery conference. Dkt. No. 253. Dr. Kesan subsequently stated in his February 2017 report that the Castor-Perry Provisional is prior art to the '556 patent. Dkt. No. 307, Ex. A \u00b6 115. Sonos's expert, Dr. Wolfe, responded in his rebuttal report, dated April 17, 2017, that the '556 patent was entitled to a priority date at least as early as August 31, 2010. Dkt. No. 315, Ex. E-15 \u00b6 1283.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   D &amp; M complains that if Sonos's interrogatory responses required amendment, \"Sonos had an obligation to do so in a timely fashion.\" Dkt. No. 366, at 9. But Sonos has done just that. The parties anticipated that this sort of development might occur. They stipulated to, and the Court entered, a scheduling order that stated that \"a party may supplement its interrogatory responses to incorporate material timely disclosed in an expert report within ten days after service of the replies to expert reports.\" Dkt. No. 210 \u00b6 9. Expert reply reports were served on May 9, 2017, and on May 19, 2017, Sonos timely amended its interrogatory responses to recite the August 31, 2010, priority date. Dkt.

Sonos's disclosure is therefore not contrary to any court order or scheduling agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Even if Sonos's change of position regarding the priority date of the '556 patent were untimely, the Court would not strike it. In determining whether to exclude untimely or improper expert disclosures, the Third Circuit has instructed that district courts consider the following factors: \"(1) the surprise or prejudice to the moving party; (2) the ability of the moving party to cure any such prejudice; (3) the extent to which allowing the testimony would disrupt the order and efficiency of trial; (4) bad faith or willfulness in failing to comply with the court's order; (5) the explanation for the failure to disclose; and (6) the importance of the testimony sought to be\n   excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    W.L.

D &amp; M has not been unfairly prejudiced by Sonos's failure to make an earlier disclosure of its contention as to the 2010 priority date. Dr. Wolfe relied on evidence produced during discovery to reach his opinion as to the proper priority date, and D &amp; M's expert, Dr. Kesan, has presented counterarguments to Dr. Wolfe's opinion. Dkt. No. 308, Ex. B \u00b6 31. Moreover, the issue arose early enough that it appears unlikely to interfere with the parties' trial preparation and will not disrupt the trial schedule. Nor is there any suggestion of bad faith on the part of Sonos in revising the priority date in light of the discovery proceedings. The Court therefore declines D &amp; M's request to bar Sonos from relying on the 2010 priority date at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Contrary to D &amp; M's argument, this case is not like\n   <em>\n    Harvatek Corp. v.
