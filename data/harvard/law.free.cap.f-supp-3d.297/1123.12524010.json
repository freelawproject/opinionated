He seeks to suppress video and physical evidence obtained by law enforcement. Two police officers and Defendant testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth more fully below, the Motion is denied because an authorized third party consented to provide access to law enforcement to Defendant's home surveillance video account. The surveillance video content constituted probable cause for the subsequent entry into Defendant's home without a warrant to remove any minors and assume their protective custody. During the entry, certain physical items were observed in \"plain view\" and permissibly supported probable cause for a search warrant for Defendant's residence as well as the other search warrants issued for Defendant's computers, cellular telephones, cameras and websites that may have been accessed by him. Even if these observations are excised from the affidavit, ample probable cause still existed for the warrants to issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts pertinent to the background of this case are: A five-count criminal indictment was filed against Defendant on February 23, 2017. [Dkt. no. 41.] These charges are based upon evidence obtained by law enforcement: (1) video seized from Defendant's video surveillance system without a search warrant; (2) police observations made during a warrantless entry into Defendant's residence; and (3) physical evidence recovered pursuant to search warrants issued based on the video content seized, and observations made during the warrantless entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At approximately 3:00 a.m. on September 17, 2015, a witness met with local police to report child abuse.

Exh. 1 at 000148-49 (SW 2015-132K); 9/18/15 Aff. at 000154-55, 000158-59.] Items recovered from this search included a digital scale, syringes, smoking pipes, cellular telephones, a computer, computer tablets, and digital cameras.

[Motion, Decl. of Counsel at \u00b6\u00b6 j-t.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant contends that the third-party witness did not have permission to access his DropCam account, and therefore all evidence obtained as a result of law enforcement's viewing of the DropCam account's video content must be suppressed. He further argues that the witness accessed his account as law enforcement's agent and thereby triggering Fourth Amendment interests. Specifically, he seeks suppression of: copies of the DropCam account's video content; items recovered from his residence on September 18, 2015 pursuant to search warrant SW 2015-132K; items recovered as a result of searching the computer systems of Adult Friend Finder, Adultism and DropCam by Nest Labs pursuant to search warrants SW 2015-145W, SW 2015-146K and SW 2015-147K obtained on October 1, 2015; items recovered from Defendant's computers, cellular telephones and cameras pursuant to search warrant SW 2015-148K, obtained on October 5, 2015; and items recovered from Defendant's cellular telephone pursuant to search warrant SW 2015-177K filed, obtained on December 8, 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] If, as Defendant argues, the third-party witness had no authority to access for law enforcement and make copies of the DropCam account's video content, then the subsequent warrantless entry and search warrants are all tainted and the evidence must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff United States of America (\"the Government\") submits that: Defendant did\n   not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the video contents of the DropCam account; the witness had actual or apparent authority to access the DropCam account; the search was by a private citizen (the witness) and not law enforcement, and thus did not require a warrant; the searches of the DropCam account were justified by exigent circumstances (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , account video content is erased every ten days); the warrantless entry was justified by exigent circumstances (namely, the video content demonstrated imminent harm to minors); and the search warrants were supported by probable cause independent from any observations made during the warrantless entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether the entry into Defendant's residence without a warrant and the subsequent searches were permissible rise or fall on a single determination: did the witness have authority to access and display Defendant's DropCam account's video content?

His testimony was not directly contradicted because the witness did not testify. Ample evidence supporting actual authority to consent to search however was given by police officers' testimonies that: the witness stated that she had Defendant's permission to access the DropCam account; she stated that she was Defendant's close friend; she possessed both the user name and password; and she was able to access Defendant's DropCam account in the officers' presence. On balance, the Government established that it is more likely than not the witness had actual\n   authority to display and copy the DropCam account's contents because she had his consent or had mutual use and control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Alternatively, if Defendant's testimony is sufficient to defeat a finding that the witness had actual authority, reliable evidence exists for a finding that she had apparent authority. The three-part test for a third-party's apparent authority to consent to search is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   First, did the searching officer believe some untrue fact that was then used to assess the extent of the consent-giver's use of and access to or control over the area searched? Second, was it under the circumstances objectively reasonable to believe that the fact was true? Finally, assuming the truth of the reasonably believed but untrue fact, would the consent-giver have had actual authority?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 880-81 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, police officers testified that: the witness said that she was Defendant's friend; Defendant gave her permission to access his DropCam account; they questioned her as to how and why she was given permission; they believed her representation; and she was successfully able to retrieve the DropCam account video content with a user name and password. Thus, even if the witness falsely represented to law enforcement that Defendant gave her permission to access the DropCam account and this falsehood led the police to believe incorrectly that she had use, access and control over this account, the Government established that the police were objectively reasonable in believing the witness had Defendant's permission and in concluding that she had actual authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While the Government argues that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Knoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11981662\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/994/#p997\">\n    116 F.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 997-98 (2d Cir. 1997), the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures does not apply to the witness because she is a private citizen, in the event Defendant did not give permission for her search,\n   <em>\n    Knoll\n   </em>\n   does not apply here. In\n   <em>\n    Knoll\n   </em>\n   , individuals stole documents and turned that evidence over to law enforcement. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's conclusion that these individuals were not state actors and therefore exempt from Fourth Amendment search and seizure restrictions. In contrast, the witness here did not merely search and copy Defendant's video content, and then turn those copies over to law enforcement. Instead, she gave law enforcement access to Defendant's DropCam account, and the police conducted their own searches and seizures (i.e., viewed the content on police computers and directed the witness to make copies). \" 'Where a private party acts as an \"instrument or agent\" of the state in effecting a search or seizure, Fourth Amendment interests are implicated.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
