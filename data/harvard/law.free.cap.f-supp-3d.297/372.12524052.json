These statements were made between July 15, 2015, the day ProNAi's initial public offering prospectus was released, and June 6, 2016, the day ProNAi announced the discontinuation of development of PNT2258.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of all persons who purchased ProNAi securities between July 15, 2015\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and June 6, 2016 (the \"Class Period\"). They allege violations of \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and the corresponding rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 (\"Rule 10b-5\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pending now is ProNAi's motion to dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint (\"AC\") for failure to state a claim under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b).

This rendition is lengthy because plaintiffs allege that, during the Class Period, ProNAi made some 70 false and misleading statements, spanning a series of disclosures, and because the statements alleged to be actionable concern the status of PNT2258 at various points in its complex testing and\n   development. As a general proposition, plaintiffs' core theory is that ProNAi consistently overstated PNT2258's prospects, downplayed or failed to disclose historical and more recent negative test results, and identified as risk factors circumstances that had already come to pass. The 70 statements that plaintiffs claim to be actionable misstatements or omissions are listed chronologically in the Appendix to this decision. For ease of reference, they are identified there and here as misstatements (\"MS\") 1 through 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Typically the dosage administered in a Phase 1 trial is insufficient to demonstrate efficacy. And ProNAi never claimed that the Phase 1 study demonstrated the drug's efficacy.

It did so in the course of announcing its decision to discontinue development of PNT2258. This announcement post-dated the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 2016 Presentation. No reasonable investor would interpret ProNAi's statements during the Class Period about the Phase I and Pilot Phase II trials as addressing, let alone making representations about, the outcomes of the Wolverine or Brighton trials.

Prospectus at 90. Later, in the January 14, 2016 investor presentation, Glover disclosed updated data (as of November 2015) regarding Pilot Phase II adverse events. The bottom line remained the same: All patients had experienced adverse events at least plausibly related to PNT2258, and, of these, 14 were Grade 3. January 2016 Presentation at 16. The January 2016 presentation did not address the occurrence of Grade 4 adverse events. Finally, on June 6, 2016, ProNAi disclosed that 11 of the 13 patients in the trial (or 85%) experienced one or more grade three or four adverse events. AC at 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the failure earlier to disclose the statistical data disclosed on June 6, 2016 was a material omission. However, the disclosure on June 6, 2016 was not materially different from the prior disclosures. In particular, the June 6, 2016 disclosure did not, as plaintiffs imply, report that PNT2258 had caused these adverse events, only that 11 patients on PNT2258 experienced Grade 3 or 4 adverse events. That disclosure was in line with ProNAi's earlier disclosures. The limited incremental statistical specificity of the June 6, 2016 disclosure, which allowed for the possibility-although without explicitly stating-that some adverse events reached the grade 4 level, was not evidently material, absent an allegation that\n   PNT2258 had\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   those events. The \"mere existence of reports of adverse events,\" without some indication that the drug at issue caused those events, does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's\"total mix\" materiality standard.\n   <em>\n    Matrixx Initiatives\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457891,5941206\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/27/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Second, as to the discontinuance of treatment, ProNAi's Prospectus disclosed, at the start of the Class Period, that 10 of the 13 patients had discontinued PNT2258. Plaintiffs do not dispute the accuracy of that statement. In his January 14, 2016 investor presentation Glover disclosed that two more patients had stopped treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 2016 Presentation at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Plaintiffs appear to claim that ProNAi's disclosure of the termination of treatment by these two additional plaintiffs was unduly delayed, but they do not allege how long this delay was. Comparing the durability charts in the Prospectus and the January 2016 presentation, it is clear that the two patients had not discontinued their treatment right away; on the contrary, one appears to have remained in the treatment group for more than 200 days. Plaintiffs do not make allegations as to the date of discontinuance of treatment and hence the duration of any delay by ProNAi in updating the numbers of patients who had discontinued treatment. On the pleadings, it appears that for most of the gap between the Prospectus date and January 2016 presentation, there had been at least two patients, not one, still on PNT2258 as part of the Pilot Phase II study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Particularly given the hazy timeline as pled in the AC, ProNAi's alleged failure earlier to disclose the one (or two) terminations at issue is plainly not material. That is especially so because patients in Phase II trials regularly discontinue treatment, and because ProNAi had timely admitted the earlier termination of the vast majority of participating patients. In any event, for the reasons covered below, as pled, no inference of scienter attaches to any lapse as to the timing of disclosure of the termination of the one (or two) patients that plaintiffs put at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Third, as to the disclosure of disease progression data, ProNAi did not disclose that patients with multiple lines of prior therapy performed worse on PNT2258 than on previous therapies. Plaintiffs do not allege that ProNAi had a freestanding duty to disclose such information. Instead, they argue that the lack of such a disclosure made ProNAi's statements about the drug's efficacy as demonstrated in the Pilot Phase II trial materially misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   That argument is unconvincing. As context, plaintiffs admit that \"patients with multiple prior lines of failed therapies are less likely to respond favorably to subsequent therapy lines.\" AC at 18. And ProNAi did not make any representations about PNT2258's success relative to any prior therapies. Thus, when ProNAi became aware of this adverse data, it did not have a duty to correct or update its public statements.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Int'l Bus. Machines Corp. Sec.

In any event, for the reasons covered below, even if this omission were otherwise actionable, plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead that the omission was with scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Claims about PNT2258's Scientific Viability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The following is a representative sample of the statements by ProNAi about the scientific viability of PNT2258 and its novel applications that plaintiffs claim are actionable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   \u2022 \"[DNAi's] unique mechanism for impacting downstream BCL2 protein\n   levels ...\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   also potentially amplify and be complementary to other therapeutic modalities.\" MS3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   \u2022 \"We\n   <em>\n    believe\n   </em>\n   that DNAi technology may be applicable to additional high value genetic targets beyond BCL2 that are also challenging to drug by conventional means.

The PSLRA safe harbor provision, as noted, applies to all of ProNAi's forward-looking statements save those in the Prospectus, and insulates such statements where they were accompanied by meaningful cautionary language, were not material, or were made without actual knowledge that they were false or misleading.\n   <em>\n    Slayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053525\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/758/#p766\">\n    604 F.3d at 765-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And ProNAi's forward-looking statements in the Prospectus are protected by the bespeaks-caution doctrine, under which \"[a] forward-looking statement accompanied by sufficient cautionary language is not actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    MF Glob., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782572\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/137/#p141\">\n    620 F.3d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Here, ProNAi's forward-looking public statements were accompanied by a considerable array of cautionary disclosures. From the start of the Class Period, ProNAi repeatedly cautioned that (1) PNT2258's clinical trials might fail to demonstrate efficacy, (2) the previous clinical trials might not predict future results (either later in those trials or in future ones), (3) the Phase I and Pilot Phase II clinical trial were uncontrolled, involved small sample sizes, and were of a shorter duration than required for regulatory approval, and (4) because of the limited nature of these trials, they might not indicate future results (especially in larger-scale, controlled trials). Prospectus at 15. ProNAi also cautioned that (1) the science underlying its DNAi technology was limited and preliminary, (2) \"our DNAi oligonucleotides [might] not possess the ability to hybridize to complementary regions of genomic DNA of an oncogenic target,\" (3) ProNAi might never be able to refine the DNAi technology sufficiently, and (4) ProNAi may exhibit different characteristics when administered to people than it did in preclinical settings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. ProNAi continued to give such fulsome warnings throughout the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Q2 2015 Report at 32-33, 42; Q3 2015 Report at 29 (incorporating by reference the Q2 2015 Report); Nov. 2015 Presentation at 2; Jan. 2016 Presentation at 2; 2015 Annual Report at 26-28, 31; Q1 2016 Press Release at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Together the cautionary statements convey substantive information\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   about the\n   precise risks that the pleaded facts allege eventually materialized: specifically, that PNT2258 might fail because the technology might ultimately prove ineffective, and that the Wolverine and Brighton trials might fail to produce even the results seen in the Pilot Phase II trial. ProNAi's cautionary language was of a piece, in its specificity, with the cautionary language upheld as effective by this Court (and, on appeal, the Second Circuit) in\n   <em>\n    Sanofi I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   This case thus is far afield from\n   <em>\n    Slayton v.

Here, ProNAi warned that its specific drug, PNT2258, might fail to prove effective. Its cautionary statements were thus not, as plaintiffs claim, mere boilerplate.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ill. State Bd. of Inv. v.

Plaintiffs do not allege, for example, that a particular aspect of PNT2258's biological mechanism or design caused the drug's failure and that ProNAi failed to warn of that risk. Nor do they allege that a clinical trial design deficiency caused the drug's failure. (On the contrary, plaintiffs allege that ProNAi modified its study design to bring about more positive results, but that these efforts failed.) At bottom, plaintiffs argue that the drug, PNT2258, simply did not work. ProNAi emphatically and repeatedly disclosed that risk. Reading the company's disclosures as a whole, a reasonable investor could not possibly have missed the risk that PNT2258 might not prove effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Plaintiffs separately claim that the risks warned of in ProNAi's cautionary statements had already materialized, but that the company did not disclose this. Specifically, they argue that that the risk that \"PNT2258 will fail to demonstrate efficacy\" had already come to pass. But that, too, is wrong. Plaintiffs do not plead that PNT2258 had durably failed during the Class Period. Rather, as plaintiffs admit, ProNAi continued to conduct the Pilot Phase II, Wolverine, and Brighton trials throughout the Class Period, in an ongoing attempt to demonstrate PNT2258's efficacy. And ProNAi invested substantial sums in that pursuit. Plaintiffs do not credibly allege that these efforts were viewed in real time as dead on arrival and certain to prove futile. Not until the end of the Class Period did ProNAi cancel those trials and conclude, and announce, that PNT2258 did not merit further investment. ProNAi's cautionary statements thus did not warn of a risk that had already come to pass. ProNAi may thus rely on them in defending its forward-looking statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The remaining statements in this category-regarding the potential for novel applications for PNT2258-are statements of opinion.

Here, plaintiffs make no allegation that any of the supporting facts contained in these statements by ProNAi were untrue. For example, as to statement MS51, plaintiffs do not allege that BCL2 does not reside at a key node of the apoptotic pathway. Nor do plaintiffs allege facts supporting the claim that ProNAi and the individual defendants did not believe these statements when made. Plaintiffs concede as much by declining to refute ProNAi's contention that there is no evidence that it and the individual defendants did not sincerely believe its opinion. Rather, plaintiffs limit their claim of opinion liability to the avenue that\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   left open for situations in which \"an opinion is actionable, regardless of subjective belief,\" based on the omission of contrary material facts possessed by the speaker. Pl. Br. at 25 n.21. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that defendants' stated \"belief that PNT2258 was effective or had market potential lacked any reasonable basis as the monitored trial data demonstrating PNT2258 was ineffective in real-time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175115\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   In support of this theory of liability, plaintiffs argue that ProNAi's non-disclosure of certain Pilot Phase II data, the results from the Wolverine and Brighton trials, and the Wolverine and Brighton protocol amendments made materially misleading defendants' opinion statements to the effect that PNT2258 was believed to have certain potential applications. That is wrong. The opinion statements in question were explicitly qualified and conditional. They state, for example, that the drug \"could potentially amplify and be complementary to\" other therapies, \"may be applicable\" to certain \"high value genetic targets\" that had thus far proven challenging to address, and that the company \"may initiate\" a trial of PNT2258 on the basis that there was \"a strong scientific rationale\" that the drug \"could be clinically beneficial\" in combination with a targeted therapy. Defendants' opinion statements did not quantify the prospects of PNT2258's success other than to leave open that success was possible. And, read with precision, the opinion statements speak to the applicability of PNT2258 in distinct situations-ones that were not studied in the Pilot Phase II, Wolverine, or Brighton trials. In particular, those studies were single-agent studies that did not test the effect of PNT2258 in combination with other therapies. Nor did these studies test the applicability of DNAi technology, more broadly, to other genetic targets. The facts plaintiffs fault ProNAi for omitting-such as (1) that 1-2 additional patients in the Pilot Phase II trial had discontinued use of PNT2258 during the Class Period than the company earlier had disclosed, and (2) Wolverine and Brighton's protocol amendments (which actually were disclosed)-do not conflict with the information a reasonable investor would take from the statements of opinion at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanofi II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175115\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/199/\">\n    816 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Plaintiffs separately theorize that these opinion statements are actionable because ProNAi omitted information regarding the efficacy of DNAi. Plaintiffs contend that ProNAi had learned in its pre-clinical internal studies that DNAi and the PNT2258 application of it were not proving effective. This claim rests on factual averments credibly attributed to confidential witnesses CW-1 and CW-2. They are quoted as stating that the experiments they conducted and discussed, attempting to prove the scientific concept underlying DNAi and the mechanism of action for\n   PNT2258, had failed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   CW-1 has represented that DNAi proved ineffective even after ProNAi changed the studies' designs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC at 13-14, and CW-2 has represented that the studies in which CW-2 participated likewise failed to show evidence of a \"signal-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , down regulation of RNA and protein using PNT2258\"-again despite ProNAi's modification of study methodologies to attempt to yield positive results,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   In the Court's judgment, this theory of Section 10(b) liability-that ProNAi's failure to disclose that its design studies had thus far failed conceptually to validate either DNAi (or its PNT2258 application) made defendants' guardedly hopeful opinion statements about PNT2258's potentially misleading-is plaintiffs' most substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   To be sure, the Supreme Court has cautioned that this theory of liability for opinion statements, based on nondisclosure of facts \"cutting the other way,\" is not to be given an overly expansive reading and that establishing liability on such a theory \"is no small task for an investor\" plaintiff to meet.\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587416\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1318/#p1327\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tongue v.

And at least as pled, the omitted studies did not specifically test the applicability of DNAi and PNT2258 to the novel settings addressed in the ProNAi statements of opinion at issue. At the same time, if ProNAi's proof-of-concept studies had truly been unremittingly bad, a jury might find unreasonable corporate statements expressing hope that the drug could prove a solution to a range of medical problems when unaccompanied by a disclosure that ProNAi had wholly failed to date to validate the drug's underlying concept.

On the contrary, the AC alleges merely that \"[f]rom October 2014 until February 2015, CW1 worked on the mechanism of action of PNT2258.\" AC at 14. It is silent as to when within that time window ProNAi's scientists had concluded that that study had come up empty. The same is true for the allegations relating to CW-2.

Specifically, the AC alleges that CW-1 participated in research meetings attended by Glover and top scientists in September 2015, December 2015, and February 2016, that at these meetings participants were briefed about study results \"showing DNAi and PNT2258 were ineffective,\" and that in response, Glover was visibly upset.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   On the basis of this factual allegation, the Court finds that the AC adequately alleges that, as of September 2015, the outcomes of the preclinical trials-notably that DNAi and PT2258 were ineffective-had reached Glover and other high-level ProNAi executives in the company. It is a close question whether that allegation suffices to make ProNAi's opinion statements regarding PNT2258's scientific potential materially misleading, because CW-1 notably does not state that DNAi and PT2258 were found irremediably ineffective, only that as of those three meetings, they had not been shown effective. Nevertheless, the failure of these technologies to bear even conceptual fruit by then is, the Court holds, sufficiently significant to make material its omission from ProNAi's opinion statements guardedly noting PT2258's potential viability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Court therefore holds that the AC has adequately pled that ProNAi's opinion statements as to the scientific viability of PNT2258 were materially misleading from September 2015 forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court discusses below whether the facts pled support that this material omission was made with scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

ProNAi also warned that it had not discussed its trial design with the FDA and might not, therefore, have the benefit of the FDA's current thinking as to trial design.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prospectus at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   This Court's decision dismissing \u00a7 10(b) claims against a pharmaceutical concern in\n   <em>\n    Sanofi I\n   </em>\n   , and the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sanofi II\n   </em>\n   affirming that dismissal, are instructive as to these points. The FDA there had repeatedly noted its concern about the single-blind design that Sanofi had chosen for certain clinical trials of the drug Lemtrada, and had suggested that such a design \"will cause serious difficulties in interpreting the results of the trial\" and that \"extremely robust findings will be necessary to overcome these issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanofi I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305013\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/510/#p534\">\n    87 F.Supp.3d at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sanofi had disclosed the fact that its trials were single-blind, but not that the FDA had expressed concern that such a design would heighten the showing required for Sanofi to obtain approval.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305013\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/510/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sanofi had also repeated statements reflecting optimism about Lemtrada's efficacy results and approval prospects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In dismissing plaintiffs' \u00a7 10(b) claims, this Court noted that Sanofi had disclosed to investors that its studies were single blind and that the FDA's preference for double-blind studies was well known.

The challenged statements differ in that Sanofi's addressed efficacy and the possibility of regulatory approval whereas ProNAi's addressed its registration-oriented clinical development strategy.

And the central insights in\n   <em>\n    Sanofi I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   equally apply: that reasonable investors cannot be assumed to misunderstand the implications of publicly disclosed study-design information, including the implications of deviations from the FDA's publicly expressed views as to optimal study design. Here, ProNAi accurately disclosed that its clinical trials were open label and that they had been amended, both contrary to FDA's statements as to best practices.

ProNAi's statements were thus not materially misleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Plaintiffs also cast as misstatements three other statements by ProNAi about its planned clinical trial development of PNT2258 that do not fit neatly in the aforementioned categories of misstatements. These statements made representations about ProNAi's plans at the time for the drug. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   \u2022 \"Wolverine has also been designed to identify patient responders according to the genetics of their DLBCLcancer cells, specifically the cell-of-origin sub-type (germinal center B-cell (GCB) vs. activated B-cell (ABC) ), as these patients tend to differ in their prognoses and response to medical treatment. Since BCL2 is overexpressed in both sub-types, PNT2258 may be active in both types of disease, which could potentially differentiate our drug versus certain other therapeutics in common use or in development that only demonstrate activity in one sub-type.\" MS43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   \u2022 \"We anticipate reporting initial interim data from the Wolverine trial in third-line DLBCL in the second quarter of 2016.

Plaintiffs similarly attack the Section 302 Sarbanes-Oxley certifications by Glover and Jagpal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   But plaintiffs do not explain why these were actionable misstatements. Instead, in a perfunctory fashion in a footnote, plaintiffs state that such statements are false and misleading \"for the reasons stated herein.\" Pl. Br. at 18 n.14. The AC and plaintiffs' brief instead focus on ProNAi's development of PNT2258. They are effectively silent as to ProNAi's internal control processes, let alone how these were misleadingly described. The Court rejects these as bases for a \u00a7 10(b) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Recapping the foregoing, the Court has found only one set of statements materially misleading: ProNAi's non-forward-looking opinion statements made after September 2015 about the potential novel applications of PNT2258. The Court has held these statements misleading for failure to disclose the universally negative results to date of ProNAi's internal preclinical studies. As to other challenged statements, although not finding these actionable, the Court, solely for the purpose of considering scienter, will also assume\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that (1) ProNAi's omission of the fact that additional patients discontinued the Pilot Phase II trial made statements about the trial's efficacy materially misleading; and that (2) ProNAi's failure to disclose the disease progression of patients using ProNAi was also actionable. The Court does so because these categories present closer questions than the balance of the 70 statements that plaintiffs put at issue, as to which plaintiffs' challenges fall far short of the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   As to any challenged statement, to state a claim, plaintiffs would still need to adequately plead scienter.

Plaintiffs theorize that ProNAi concealed that fact to enhance its prospects of acquiring new drug candidates in lieu of the doomed PNT2258. But plaintiffs do not substantiate this conclusory claim with concrete factual allegations. And in any event, ProNAi did not acquire its successor drug candidate, AS-141, until after May 26, 2016. Plaintiffs' theory that ProNAi deliberately concealed negative information about PNT2258 to buy time to acquire an alternative drug does not explain why it would disclose that information some four months before it closed on a deal to acquire AS-141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Considering next the failure to disclose disease progression data-that patients in the Pilot Phase II trial had experienced disease progression PNT2258 at a faster rate than on prior treatments-that fact, too, does not support an inference of scienter.

Plaintiffs here have not pointed to any such materials putting ProNAi on notice of the relative disease progressions that it did not disclose. Second, even assuming ProNAi had such notice, it is not evident that ProNAi had a duty to disclose such comparative data; the Court has not found any authority to that effect. Without a clear duty to disclose or factual allegations as to the decision not to disclose such information, there is no reason to infer that the lack of disclosure of these details was an intentional or reckless act, as opposed to, at most, an errant lapse unaccompanied by scienter. Absent pleadings concretely amplifying on the circumstances under which ProNAi did not report such detail-including that overt attention was given to this issue-this omission cannot be assumed to be have been reckless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Finally, ProNAi's non-disclosure of its preclinical study data does not, without more, give rise to an inference of scienter on its part or that of the individual defendants. The Court has held that a reasonable investor would have expected to be told, alongside the opinion statements to the effect that PNT2258 had\n   some potential for useful application, that the testing to date had come up negative. But the scienter issue-whether the non-disclosure of this fact was a reckless act or merely an errant one-is different. For several reasons, an inference of recklessness does not arise here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   First, as noted, the AC pleads that only a subset of this testing data was conveyed to Glover-none, as pled, was communicated to CFO Jagpai.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20971805\">\n    2017 WL 971805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (declining to infer scienter when concerns not communicated to individual defendants),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=710%20Fed.%20Appx.%20471\">\n    710 Fed.Appx. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    City of Austin Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829070\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/277/#p295\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Second, and more important, the AC does not plead any facts to suggest that-until the actual termination of PNT2258's development at the end of the Class Period-Glover, Jagpai, or someone else whose intent could be imputed to ProNAi subjectively believed that PNT2258 had ceased to have promise or should be abandoned. Absent such factual allegations, defendants' qualified opinion statements reciting that there was some promise for ProNAi in novel applications must be viewed as reflecting sincerely held views. Notably, even the CWs on whom the AC relies are not claimed to have given up hope as to PNT2258 at these points. The AC alleges only that CW-1 conveyed to Glover and others at the September 2015, December 2015, and February 2016 meetings that the preclinical trials to date had not shown the drug to be effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the AC does not plead any facts suggesting a personal motive by any defendant to conceal the preclinical data. There is, for example, no pleading of an intention by an individual defendant to sell ProNAi stock before an adverse disclosure drove ProNAi's stock price down.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanford\n   </em>\n   , 794 F.3d at 307 (finding scienter based on confidential witness testimony where individual defendants had made suspicious stock purchases). And, in fact, the efficacy evidence from the Pilot Phase II trial-that 85% of patients had a complete response, partial response, or stable disease-suggests that Glover had at least some factual basis for his expressed optimism and undermines any circumstantial claim of recklessness. Without more, even if errant under the securities laws, the non-disclosure of these initial negative results by persons who sincerely believed the drug had promise cannot be labeled a reckless act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Third and finally, the nature of the undisclosed information matters. There is in general no freestanding obligation to disclose preclinical data. And sincerely held statements of opinion are rarely actionable (and in this Circuit, were not actionable until the Supreme Court's March 2015 decision in\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   held that, in unusual cases, omitted facts could make a genuinely held statement of opinion materially misleading). On the unusual circumstances here, the Court has narrowly held that, from September 2015 until the Class Period's end, when ProNAi opined that PNT2258 had some potential novel applications, a duty to disclose the consistently negative preclinical results arose. But it does not follow that a breach of that duty was a reckless act as opposed to an errant lapse. And beyond pleading Glover's notice of the negative preclinical test results, the AC is devoid of any factual allegations supporting a claim of recklessness. That is not enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   For these reasons, the AC does not adequately plead scienter as to any misstatements at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   <strong>\n    G. \u00a7 20(a) Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Plaintiffs also bring a claim against ProNAi, Jagpal and Glover under \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
