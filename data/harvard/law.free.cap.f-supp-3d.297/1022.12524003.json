Zipps, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendant Jessica Soto's Motion to Correct Clear Error Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a). Defendant asserts that there is no statutory basis for criminal forfeiture for Defendant's offenses of conviction and therefore the Court's forfeiture orders of February 21, 2018 are in clear error. (Docs. 1325, 1334.) The Government filed a response on March 1, 2018, and Defendant replied on March 5, 2018. For the reasons explained herein, the Court will deny Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 4, 2017, Defendant pled guilty to smuggling goods from the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and conspiracy to smuggle goods from the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 932.) On that same date, Magistrate Judge Bowman signed a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). (Doc. 936.) The Preliminary Order of Forfeiture provided a procedure by which a party could object to the forfeiture of the listed items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) No objection to the proposed forfeiture was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 21, 2018, this Court sentenced Defendant to four years' probation and entered a final judgment of forfeiture. (Docs 1324, 1325.) Prior to entry of the Forfeiture Order, the Court asked Defendant if there was any objection to the government's proposed form of order, and defense counsel answered \"no.\" The Court signed the order on that same date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) permits the Court to \"correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\" within fourteen days of sentencing. Rule 35 performs the \"narrow function\" of correcting an illegal sentence.\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Defendant was convicted of offenses which involve the exportation of firearms or ammunition to Mexico and her guilty plea to those offenses meets the clear and convincing evidence standard. Thus, section 924(d)(1) authorizes the forfeiture in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) authorizes forfeiture only upon conviction of an offense contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 31, Chapter 44 of 18 U.S. Code, which pertains to firearms offenses. Defendant asserts that section 924(d)(1)'s early reference to Chapter 44 should be read as limiting the application of section 924 to violations of Chapter 44. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1378, p. 2.) The Court disagrees. First, by its plain language, section 924(d)(1) authorizes forfeiture of firearms or ammunition involved in \"any violation of any criminal law of the United States\" and any firearm or ammunition intended to be used in any offense referred to in 924(d)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perrin v.

Second, section 924(d)(1)'s list of forfeiture-available offenses is written in the disjunctive. \"Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings.\").\n   <em>\n    Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531959\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/330/#p339\">\n    442 U.S. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531959\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/330/#p339\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531959\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/330/#p339\">\n    60 L.Ed.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Azure v.

Third, Defendant's suggested interpretation would contradict the statutory principle that a statute should be read \"to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under Defendant's suggested interpretation, the last offenses listed in section 924(d) would be superfluous and without meaning. In sum, section 924(d)(1) cannot plausibly be read so narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the Indictment cites\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C) as authority for the forfeiture.
