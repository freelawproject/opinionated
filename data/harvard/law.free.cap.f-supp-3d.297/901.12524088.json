GRITZNER, Senior Judge\n   This matter comes before the court on a Motion to Dismiss (the Motion) pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), ECF No. 18, filed by Defendants Kimberly Reynolds, Tom Miller, and Bruce Swanson (collectively, Defendants). Defendants request an order dismissing in its entirety the Complaint, ECF No. 1, filed by Plaintiffs Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement (CCI), Bailing Out Benji, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. (PETA), and Center for Food Safety (CFS) (collectively, Plaintiffs). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims and also fail to state a claim for violation of their constitutional rights. No party requested oral argument, and the Court finds oral argument is unnecessary. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Undercover Investigations at Iowa Agricultural Production Facilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Undercover investigations have long been an important tool used by journalists and advocacy groups to gather information about the inner workings of slaughterhouses and other agricultural facilities. Because Iowa is the nation's largest producer of pork and eggs, as well as a major source of other animal products, agricultural facilities in Iowa have been subject to numerous such investigations in recent years. For example, a 2008 undercover investigation at an Iowa pig farm revealed instances of workers beating pigs with rods and sticking clothespins into pigs' eyes and faces, leading to criminal charges being filed against multiple employees. Undercover investigations in the 2000s at a kosher slaughterhouse in Iowa revealed instances of cows being slaughtered not in accordance with kosher practices, such as by having their tracheas removed with meat hooks while fully conscious, and cows remaining conscious for minutes after their throats had been slit. Similar undercover investigations in other states have resulted in felony convictions for cruelty to animals or have spurred formal investigations by federal and state regulators. Undercover investigations at agricultural production facilities document other issues besides animal cruelty, such as unsafe working conditions, improper food safety practices, violations of labor law, or violations of environmental law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Most agricultural facilities, such as slaughterhouses, are not open to the public. Investigators have thus typically gained access to facilities by securing employment at the facilities through standard hiring channels. Investigators serve as regular employees performing the tasks demanded of them but also document activities in the facilities-such as animal cruelty, unsanitary conditions, pollution, sexual misconduct, and violations of labor law-using hidden recording equipment. Most undercover investigations use employees new to a facility rather than existing employees, who are often reluctant to become whistleblowers due to fear of retaliation, the risk of termination, and immigration concerns. Employers, meanwhile, seek to prevent undercover investigations by inquiring during the application process about whether a candidate has any connections to certain animal protection organizations. At other agricultural facilities, such as large-scale commercial dog breeding facilities,\n   undercover investigators instead pose as breeders or brokers to gain access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Iowa Code \u00a7 717A.3A : Agricultural Production Facility Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 2, 2012, former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad signed into law H.F. 589, 84 Gen. Assemb., 2nd Reg. Sess. (Iowa 2012), which criminalizes \"agricultural production facility fraud.\" A person commits the crime of agricultural production facility fraud if the person willfully:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   a. Obtains access to an agricultural production facility by false pretenses[, or]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   b. Makes a false statement or representation as part of an application or agreement to be employed at an agricultural production facility, if the person knows the statement to be false, and makes the statement with an intent to commit an act not authorized by the owner of the agricultural production facility, knowing that the act is not authorized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Iowa Code \u00a7 717A.3A. An \"agricultural production facility\" is \"an animal facility\" as defined in the Iowa Code or a \"crop operation property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.1(3). An \"animal facility\" includes \"a location where an agricultural animal is maintained for agricultural production purposes, including but not limited to a location dedicated to farming ..., a livestock market, exhibition, or a vehicle used to transport the animal,\" as well as animal research locations, veterinary facilities, kennels, and pet shops.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.1(5). An \"agricultural animal\" is defined to include \"[a]n animal that is maintained for its parts or products having commercial value.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.1(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The first conviction for violation of \u00a7 717A.3A is a serious misdemeanor, and a second or subsequent conviction is an aggravated misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.3A(2). A person can also be held criminally liable for conspiring to violate this statute or for aiding and abetting a violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.3A(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \u00a7 717A.3A was introduced in response to past undercover investigations in Iowa, including a 2011 investigation at a pork plant in Kamrar, Iowa, that generated media coverage of footage of pigs and piglets being abused. The Complaint details a number of statements made by legislators and lobbyists in conjunction with the enactment of \u00a7 717A.3A. The then-president of the Iowa Senate stated that he supported the legislation to \"make producers feel more comfortable.\" Compl. \u00b6 51, ECF No. 1. Another senator supporting \u00a7 717A.3A said, \"What we're aiming at is stopping these groups that go out and gin up campaigns that they use to raise money by trying to give the agriculture industry a bad name.\" Compl. \u00b6 52. Another senator characterized \u00a7 717A.3A as \"an attempt to protect agriculture.\" Compl. \u00b6 54. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that \u00a7 717A.3A received support in the legislature because it would silence animal protection organizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs and Their Interests in Undercover Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs are a collection of national and local non-profit organizations that engage in advocacy that they allege is impaired by \u00a7 717A.3A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. ALDF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ALDF is a national non-profit animal protection organization \"that uses education, public outreach, investigations, legislation, and litigation to protect the lives and advance the interests of animals, including those raised for food.\" Compl. \u00b6 26. ALDF provides legal assistance and training to law enforcement and promotes enforcement of civil and criminal laws and regulations concerning animal welfare, as well as legislative and industry reform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ALDF uses undercover investigations to provide information used in advocacy and outreach. ALDF has previously conducted undercover investigations at agricultural facilities across the country, including in Iowa. ALDF would like to conduct an investigation at an agricultural production facility in Iowa and has a \"professional working relationship\" with a licensed private investigator in the state. Compl. \u00b6 26. Since the statute's enactment, \u00a7 717A.3A has prevented ALDF from engaging in any undercover allegations in Iowa. ALDF also alleges that \u00a7 717A.3A has diminished the supply of investigations conducted by others in Iowa, which impairs its litigation and outreach efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As noted above, part of ALDF's organizational mission includes engaging in lobbying and litigation to promote its interests in animal welfare. ALDF alleges that it has had to spend significant resources lobbying and litigating against statutes such as \u00a7 717A.3A, detracting from the organization's ability to spend those resources in other ways in service of its organizational mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. CCI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CCI is an Iowa non-profit organization that seeks to empower individuals to engage in grassroots advocacy. CCI engages in advocacy concerning clean water, environmental preservation, labor rights, racial justice, and immigrant rights. CCI's members include workers in agricultural facilities, and CCI has worked with such employees to document poor or unsafe working conditions in agricultural facilities. In 2012, for example, CCI collected photographic evidence of working conditions at a facility near Algona, Iowa, leading to OSHA citations against the facility. CCI alleges that in 2015, following the enactment of \u00a7 717A.3A, it refrained from conducting an investigation into whether an egg and poultry facility in Iowa required workers to pay for their own protective gear. CCI also alleges that \u00a7 717A.3A has chilled it from obtaining video of illegal dumping into Iowa waterways or Clean Water Act violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Bailing Out Benji\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bailing Out Benji is an Iowa non-profit organization that promotes the welfare of dogs and companion animals and raises awareness about puppy mills in the state. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 717A.3A, Bailing Out Benji conducted undercover investigations into puppy mills by sending its volunteers to puppy mills, stating or implying that they were breeders or brokers, and collecting video or photographic evidence of animal abuse. Bailing Out Benji also previously used material gained from another organization's undercover investigations in its advocacy materials and public education activities. Bailing Out Benji alleges that it now no longer conducts undercover investigations or is able to use material gained from other organizations' undercover investigations in Iowa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    4. PETA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   PETA is a national public charity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). PETA seeks to protect animals from abuse, neglect, and cruelty, and engages in public education, advocacy, protest campaigns, and litigation. PETA conducts undercover investigations at agricultural facilities across the United States, including the investigations recounted above. PETA alleges that it is interested in conducting an employment-based undercover investigation at a specific Montgomery County, Iowa egg facility, having received a tip regarding conditions at the facility. Section 717A.3A prohibits this possible investigation. PETA also alleges, like ALDF, that it has had to divert resources to lobbying and litigation against \u00a7 717A.3A, detracting from the organization's other activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    5. CFS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   CFS, also a national \u00a7 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, promotes safe food production practices and environmental protection. CFS engages in public education, advocacy, lobbying, and litigation as part of an agricultural animal program that seeks to promote transparency and accountability in the animal agricultural industry. CFS does not allege that it conducts undercover allegations but alleges that \u00a7 717A.3A prevents CFS from obtaining the sort of information that arises from undercover investigations conducted by others. CFS also alleges that \u00a7 717A.3A directly harms CFS's interest in transparency in agriculture. Finally, like ALDF and PETA, CFS alleges that it has had to divert resources to combat \u00a7 717A.3A and laws like it rather than use those resources to promote alternatives to industrial animal farming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on October 10, 2017, alleging that \u00a7 717A.3A is unconstitutional on its face. In Counts One and Two, Plaintiffs allege that \u00a7 717A.3A violates the First Amendment both as a law that discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint and as an overbroad criminal sanction. In Count Three, Plaintiffs allege that \u00a7 717A.3A was enacted due to animus toward animal rights groups, targets those groups, and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also allege that \u00a7 717A.3A burdens the exercise of a fundamental right (freedom of speech) in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs request a declaration that \u00a7 717A.3A is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to Plaintiffs and injunctive relief to prevent Defendants from enforcing the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 11, 2017, Defendants filed the instant Motion. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 717A.3A. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for violation of the First Amendment or for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standards for a Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) on standing grounds.

Similarly, the relief requested-a declaration that \u00a7 717A.3A is unconstitutional, and an injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing it-would redress the alleged injuries in fact by removing the threat of legal sanction against Plaintiffs' undercover investigations and allowing Plaintiffs to reallocate their advocacy resources away from the repeal of \u00a7 717A.3A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Defendants argue that the First Amendment claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) because the conduct prohibited by \u00a7 717A.3A does not command First Amendment protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend that \u00a7 717A.3A regulates conduct, not speech, and to the extent \u00a7 717A.3A regulates speech, it only prohibits false statements that do not receive First Amendment protection.

To categorically deny protection for false speech that may cause the nominal invasion of a legal right but that does not result in actual, material harm would result in overbroad restrictions on speech, creating undue chilling of valued First Amendment expression. As Plaintiffs allege, an animal rights organization member could violate subsection (a) of the statute by obtaining access to a puppy mill auction by stating or implying that he or she was a breeder or pet broker. That individual might then surreptitiously take photographs or audio or video recordings, or perhaps simply take mental notes regarding what that person observed of the animals or their conditions.

Plaintiffs, however, do not allege that any such current-employee whistleblowers who have contacted PETA have ever been willing to engage in clandestine video or audio recording or to take any further action in gathering information. Rather, the Complaint alleges that existing employees at agricultural facilities often bear precarious economic and immigration situations.

Defendants raise no more than metaphysical doubt that the agricultural facilities that Plaintiffs would target with an investigation would\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    have open positions for which Plaintiffs could locate a qualified and willing candidate.
