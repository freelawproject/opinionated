Gorton, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves an employment dispute between Michaeline Grol (\"Grol\" or \"plaintiff\"), a sales representative, and Safelite Group, Inc. (\"Safelite\" or \"defendant\"), an auto glass replacement and repair company. Plaintiff asserts that defendant 1) discriminated against her on the basis of age, in violation of M.G.L. c. 151B \u00a7 4, 2 ) breached their employment contract and 3) breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The case was originally filed in the Massachusetts Superior Court for Bristol County but was removed by defendant to this Court on diversity grounds. Plaintiff is domiciled in Massachusetts while defendant is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment on all claims. Because genuine issues of material fact exist as to each claim, defendant's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Michaeline Grol plaintiff was a sales representative for Giant Glass, a glass repair and replacement company for nearly 20 years. In January, 2013, Safelite acquired Giant Glass and retained plaintiff, then 53 years old, as a sales representative. At a meeting in January, 2013, Tom Feeney, CEO of Safelite, indicated that Giant Glass employees would be entitled to one year of severance if they left the company. Defendant agreed to continue plaintiff's employment under terms that plaintiff proposed, including 1) her weekly draw at the same rate that she had received from Giant Glass, 2) a 13% commission on 80% of her total sales and 3) a monthly car allowance of $700. Grol contends that, in a series of emails with Chad Flowers, Regional Vice President of Safelite (\"Flowers\"), the defendant agreed to certain additional terms of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Grol signed a retention bonus agreement which provided for the payment of $50,000 in three installments payable in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That agreement provided that Grol would not receive any unpaid portion of that bonus if she was terminated \"for cause\" and was not an active associate at the time of payout. Plaintiff also executed an agreement with defendant providing that her employment was at-will and that she was subject to a non-compete clause. That agreement made no reference to commission-based compensation or to retention of Giant Glass sales accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October, 2013, Safelite announced a plan to unify the Safelite and Giant Glass employee teams that included moving all sales representatives to commission-based pay calculated at 11% of 80% of their total sales. Grol expressed her dissatisfaction with that plan to Feeney and Doug Herron, CFO of Safelite. She complained that paying all sales representatives the same commission rate would make \"no sense\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January, 2014, Flowers and Regional Sales Manager Dean Drinkwater (\"Drinkwater\") informed Grol that her employment was terminated. The parties dispute whether Flowers and Drinkwater told Grol that she was being terminated for cause due to alleged inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. Grol contends that she \"was completely blindsided\" by the termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties also dispute whether, at the time of her termination, Grol's accounts had been transferred to other salespersons. Defendant maintains that no such transfer had occurred but plaintiff contends that Safelite transferred more than one third of her sales accounts between December, 2013 and January, 2014. Grol submits that those accounts were transferred to sales representatives who were at least seven years younger than she was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed her complaint in Bristol County Superior Court in August, 2016, which defendant removed to this Court in September, 2016. Pending before the Court is defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The role of summary judgment is \"to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gen.

Defendant avers that Grol behaved inappropriately and unprofessionally, thus warranting her termination. For instance, Flowers testifies that Grol \"does not support the values of our company\" failed to \"help make our TEAM (key word) a success\". Defendants point to emails sent by Grol indicating that she would not assist other team members in acquiring sales accounts if she did not receive a commission. Accordingly, defendant successfully sets forth an alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Posadas de San Juan Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11902390\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/243/#p248\">\n    124 F.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted). The plaintiff must then demonstrate that the defendant's proffered\n   reason for its employment decision was not the real reason but rather a pretext for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Grol has raised a genuine dispute as to whether defendant's stated reason was pretextual. First, plaintiff notes that the record is devoid of any instance of Safelite management informing Grol that she had behaved inappropriately or unprofessionally.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipchitz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Raytheon Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080013\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/493/#p501\">\n    434 Mass. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=751%20N.E.2d%20360\">\n    751 N.E.2d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (stating that \"if the fact finder is persuaded that one or more of the employer's reasons is false,\" it may infer a discriminatory motive). In addition, the record shows that a reasonable jury could find that Grol's work quality was acceptable to and praised by her employer. Finally, Grol has set forth facts demonstrating that her accounts were transferred to younger sales representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because a reasonable factfinder could find that Safelite's stated reasons of inappropriate behavior and unprofessionalism were pretextual and motivated by age-based discrimination, defendant's motion for summary judgment will, with respect to Count I, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In her opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment, plaintiff, for the first time, presented the theory that Safelite engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination affecting her and two other sales representatives. To the extent that Grol maintains that practice of discrimination theory, or argues that Safelite did not credit her for certain sales in 2011 and 2012, those arguments have been waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calvi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Knox County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5665030\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/422/#p431\">\n    470 F.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming summary judgment for defendant because plaintiff \"was not entitled to raise new and unadvertised theories of liability for the first time in opposition to a motion for summary judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
