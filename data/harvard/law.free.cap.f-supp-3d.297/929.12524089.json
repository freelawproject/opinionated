The named plaintiffs, members of SCSU's varsity women's tennis and Nordic skiing teams, sued SCSU and its governing body, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (\"MSCU\") (collectively, \"SCSU\"), following the school's announcement that it planned to eliminate several sports, including women's tennis and women's Nordic skiing. Plaintiffs assert claims against SCSU for violating Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201621\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Four motions are presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   First, SCSU has moved for partial summary judgment, seeking to dismiss Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claim and damages claim. The Court will grant SCSU's motion\n   and dismiss Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claim and damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs have moved for class certification. The Court will grant Plaintiffs' motion but will redefine the class as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   All present, prospective, and future female students at St. Cloud State University who are harmed by and want to end St. Cloud State University's sex discrimination in: (1) the allocation of athletic participation opportunities; (2) the allocation of athletic financial assistance; and (3) the allocation of benefits provided to varsity athletes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Additionally, the Court will appoint Fafinski Mark &amp; Johnson, P.A., as class counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Third, in relation to Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, SCSU moves to strike Plaintiffs' reply brief because it was filed after the scheduled deadline. The Court will deny this motion because neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the local rules for the District of Minnesota permit a party to move to strike a belatedly filed brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fourth and finally, SCSU has moved to exclude expert testimony from Dr. Donna Lopiano. The Court will grant SCSU's motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant St. Cloud State University (\"SCSU\") is a public university owned and operated by the State of Minnesota. (2d Am. Compl. (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 18, Aug. 15, 2017, Docket No. 184.) SCSU is a member of the Minnesota State system, which is governed by a board of trustees known as the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities Board of Trustees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) SCSU receives federal financial assistance and is subject to Title IX. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiffs are current or former student-athletes on the women's tennis and women's Nordic skiing teams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   SCSU offers a number of varsity intercollegiate sports, which are divided into a four-tier system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59, 67.) Tier I consists of SCSU's Division I men's and women's ice hockey programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Tier II consists of SCSU's Division II men's and women's basketball, football, and volleyball programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Tier III consists of SCSU's Division II baseball, softball, women's indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, women's cross country, women's soccer, men's and women's swimming and diving, and men's wrestling programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Tier IV consists of SCSU's men's and women's golf, women's tennis, and women's Nordic skiing programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 2, 2016, SCSU announced its intent to reorganize its athletic offerings by eliminating six intercollegiate sports programs, including the women's tennis and women's Nordic skiing teams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SCSU's enrollment peaked in 2011 at 22,024 total students; excluding high school students, enrollment was 19,186. (Aff. of Lisa Foss (\"Foss Aff.\") \u00b6 4, May 11, 2016, Docket No. 26.) By 2016, total enrollment was down to 18,859; 14,990 excluding high school students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Revenues from tuition fell by approximately $8.6 million from 2011 to 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December 2015, \"the President's Office\" asked SCSU's athletics director, Heather Weems, \"to come forward with a cost containment strategy in athletics.\" (First Aff. of Heather Weems (\"Weems Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10, May 11, 2016, Docket No. 25.) Weems proposed that SCSU eliminate men's tennis, cross country, and indoor and outdoor track, as well as women's tennis and Nordic skiing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Weems's proposal also called for a number of men's teams to reduce their number of participants, and for certain women's\n   teams to increase their levels of participation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs maintain that SCSU has never complied with Title IX, and eliminating the women's tennis and Nordic skiing teams would only worsen the disparity between male and female athletic opportunities. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-75, 79.) According to Plaintiffs, \"SCSU's discrimination against females is so substantial, as a matter of law it cannot eliminate any female athletic participation opportunities unless and until it first eliminates a substantial number of male athletic participation opportunities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) But, if SCSU eliminated male participation opportunities such that they equaled the number of female participation opportunities, then SCSU would lose its NCAA Division I membership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that the only realistic solution is for SCSU to increase women's participation opportunities.

But Plaintiffs allege that \"SCSU has always provided its male students with proportionally more opportunities to participate in varsity intercollegiate athletics than it has offered its female students.\" (Compl. \u00b6 75.) Moreover, Plaintiffs assert that if SCSU eliminates the women's tennis and women's Nordic skiing teams, the disparity between male and female participation opportunities will grow further. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With regard to Plaintiffs' second allegation, Title IX requires institutions of higher education to offer equal athletic-related financial assistance to male and female students.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20160.37\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . SCSU offers more athletic participation opportunities for male students than female students at Tiers I and II, and Plaintiffs allege that SCSU offers more scholarships to students who participate in Tier I and II sports than those participate in Tier III and IV sports. (Compl. \u00b6 70.) As a result fewer female student-athletes receive athletic-related financial assistance. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20160.37\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, with regard to Plaintiffs' third allegation, Title IX requires institutions of higher education to provide female and male student-athletes the same treatment and benefits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20106.41\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)-(10). Plaintiffs allege that SCSU fails to provide female student-athletes with an equal allocation of benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) Plaintiffs allege that the female student-athletes are\n   provided with subpar facilities compared to those provided to male student-athletes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-32.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) These requirements are often referred to as the \"laundry list\" requirements.

Second, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 121A.04 is contained in the chapters of the Minnesota Statutes that comprise \"Education Code: Prekindergarten-Grade 12,\" Minn.

Plaintiffs provide no authority for the proposition that the state waives its sovereign immunity for purposes of Section 1983 claims by accepting federal funds. It is true that states waive sovereign immunity\n   <strong>\n    for purposes of Title IX\n   </strong>\n   when they accept federal funds. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7.

The\n   <em>\n    Ezell\n   </em>\n   Court noted that\n   <em>\n    Grandson\n   </em>\n   adopted a broad view of\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   : \"It held that the\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   test applies even when a recipient's own decisions, not a third party's, are at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

Substantively, the facts of this case are similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Grandson\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Grandson\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that the university\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   There is no evidence that SCSU had actual knowledge of Plaintiffs' claimed monetary injuries or that Plaintiffs' provided notice to a university official with authority to address the complaint.

In fact, Weems asserted that, since 2012, SCSU has had an even stronger case for Title IX compliance because SCSU has added a number of women's sports programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98:21-99:15.)

Scope of the Proposed Class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court must first decide whether Plaintiffs' proposed class definition is acceptable. For a number of reasons, SCSU argues that it is not. The Court need not deny certification based on these arguments because the Court may redefine the class to accommodate certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20328446\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, the Court must decide whether Plaintiffs' proposed class is overbroad because it includes individuals effectively accommodated by SCSU's athletic programming. In\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs sought to certify a class of \"[a]ll present and future Colgate University women students and potential students who participate, seek to participate, and/or are deterred from participating in Colgate's intercollegiate athletics program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.

The\n   <em>\n    Biediger\n   </em>\n   Court certified a class of \"All present, prospective, and future female students at Quinnipiac University\n   <strong>\n    who are harmed by\n   </strong>\n   and want to end Quinnipiac University's sex discrimination in (1) the allocation of athletic participation opportunities; (2) the allocation of athletic financial assistance; and (3) the allocation of benefits provided to varsity athletes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202017773\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Biediger\n   </em>\n   definition avoids any overbreadth problems arising from the inclusion of individuals who are not harmed by SCSU's noncompliance with Title IX. Accordingly, The Court will redefine the class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   All present, prospective, and future female students at St. Cloud State University who are harmed by and want to end St. Cloud State University's sex discrimination in: (1) the allocation of athletic participation opportunities; (2) the allocation of athletic financial assistance; and (3) the allocation of benefits provided to varsity athletes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, the Court must decide whether the inclusion of \"future female students\" renders the class unascertainable. In other cases in the Eighth Circuit, certified classes have included members who will be affected in the future if defendants are allowed to continue to practice their harmful conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rajender v.

The Court therefore concludes that the inclusion of \"future female students\" does not render the class unascertainable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Third and finally, the Court must decide whether it must restrict the class to women's tennis and Nordic skiing teams. The\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   court restricted the definition of plaintiffs' proposed class to just members of the women's ice hockey team after finding that \"plaintiffs proffer no evidence that the interests and abilities of female varsity or club athletes other than members of the women's club ice hockey team are ineffectively accommodated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20328446\">\n    1996 WL 328446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. But Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that more than just the women's tennis and Nordic skiing teams are affected by SCSU's noncompliance. For example, Plaintiffs allege that SCSU offers more athletic scholarships to men as a result of its tiered system. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) The Court therefore concludes that the class need not be restricted to members of the women's tennis and Nordic skiing teams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

First, the class must be \"so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\" (\"numerosity\"). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). Second, there must be \"questions of law or fact common to the class\" (\"commonality\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23(a)(2). Third, the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be \"typical of the claims or defenses of the class\" (\"typicality\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23(a)(3). Fourth, the representative parties must \"fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\" (\"adequacy of representation\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23(a)(4).

It is unlikely that all female students at SCSU \"participate, seek to participate, or have been deterred from participating in intercollegiate athletics at St. Cloud State University.\" Nevertheless, the Court agrees that the class is comprised of a significant number of SCSU female student-athletes. Plaintiffs allege that SCSU has deprived its female student-athletes of equal athletic-related financial assistance and that SCSU does not provide equal benefits to women's athletics as compared to men's athletics. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 116-17; 127-37.) The number of female athletes at SCSU exceeds the customary forty-person class that generally results in a finding of numerosity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beaver Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204098741\">\n    2016 WL 4098741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Moreover, the class is comprised of future female SCSU students who want to participate in intercollegiate athletics.

Female students intending to enroll in SCSU and participate in intercollegiate athletics have an interest in SCSU's Title IX compliance and will be harmed by the institution's failure to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Again, SCSU seeks to define the class as just members of the tennis and Nordic skiing teams, arguing that the teams are comprised of only 10 to 15 students. The proposed class is not restricted to female student-athletes participating on these two teams. Rather, the class includes any female students who participate in sports and may do so in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court concludes that the class meets the requirement of numerosity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

SCSU argues that the Plaintiffs have never expressed an interest for sports other than women's tennis and Nordic skiing. The\n   <em>\n    Foltz\n   </em>\n   court rejected a similar argument.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272399\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/269/419/#p423\">\n    269 F.R.D. at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All Plaintiffs in this case have filed declarations stating that their primary goal is \"to force SCSU to provide sex-based equality in athletics\n   <strong>\n    overall\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs rejected a settlement offer that would give them each $2,000 and allow them to continue playing their individual sports because \"it did not contain any provisions to require SCSU to provide equal opportunities for SCSU's current and future female students to play intercollegiate sports, or to ensure SCSU's compliance with Title IX.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As another\n   example, Portz testified at her deposition that Plaintiffs \"want to see an equal opportunity in terms of women's sports and all sports.\" (Decl. of Kevin Finnerty \u00b6 2, Ex. 1 at 53:21-24, June 5, 2017, Docket No. 154);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foltz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272399\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/269/419/#p423\">\n    269 F.R.D. at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs have expressed a desired to end the alleged sex discrimination for all women's sports.

R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C), (e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Second, SCSU argues that hidden conflicts exist because Plaintiffs refuse to disclose their fee arrangements. Costs in a class action can be staggering, including the costs of preparing and sending the notice, costs of depositions, preparing motions and briefs, and conducting the hearings and trial of the case.\n   <em>\n    Klein v. Henry S. Miller Residential Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3930625\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/82/6/#p8\">\n    82 F.R.D. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (N.D. Tex. 1978). But \"courts do not normally examine the financial responsibility of class representatives.\"\n   <em>\n    Dirks v.

Minn. 1985). When courts choose to investigate plaintiffs' financial responsibility, it is because the court \"is legitimately concerned about the class representatives' ability to bear the costs of sending adequate notice to class members.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7852753\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/105/125/#p134\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7852753\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/105/125/#p134\">\n    at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The financial conflicts identified by SCSU are purely speculative, and the Court does not believe that further investigation is warranted at this time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will note, however, that class counsel has an ethical duty to the Court to come forward and notify the Court of any potential conflicts that may arise during the course of litigation. Moreover, the Court will review any proposed settlement agreements with an eye toward avoiding conflicts and ensuring that all class members receive equal treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Third and finally, SCSU argues that Plaintiffs have participated minimally in this lawsuit and, therefore, vigorous representation of the class cannot be assured. Other courts have identified four situations in which plaintiffs may be deemed inadequate representatives: (1) the plaintiffs lack personal knowledge concerning the type and extent of damages they have suffered; (2) the plaintiffs lack credibility concerning their claims; (3) the plaintiffs have afforded unfettered discretion to conduct the litigation; and (4) the plaintiffs have physical or mental limitations which may preclude them from being in a position to act in the best interests of the class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks v. Cent. Refrigerated Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-CV-356-DAK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201683056\">\n    2017 WL 1683056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D.

Plaintiffs' affidavits recognize that their respective sport might be eliminated as a result of SCSU's noncompliance with Title IX and that SCSU was providing female students with fewer participation opportunities overall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' claims are\n   credible as evidenced by the Court's previous finding that Plaintiffs stand a fair chance of prevailing on their Title IX claims.\n   <em>\n    Portz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182986\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/963/\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, there is nothing to suggest that Plaintiffs have mental limitations that prevent them from acting within the best interests of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The only real question is whether Plaintiffs have afforded their attorneys unfettered discretion to conduct the litigation. Sufficient evidence shows that they have not. Plaintiffs have filed affidavits, attended depositions, and communicated with their attorneys. Plaintiffs have indicated that they have personally reviewed settlement offers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have thus demonstrated a willingness to work with their attorneys and vigorously represent the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   SCSU's most noteworthy complaint is that Plaintiffs themselves were absent from a scheduled mediation. Plaintiffs' attorney notified SCSU that Plaintiffs were from the mediation because \"they were just returning from break and they had significant responsibilities for their classes, including examinations to study for and papers to complete.\" (Letter to Judge Brisbois at 3, Oct. 26, 2016, Docket No. 66.) While it is ideal that Plaintiffs attend mediations in the future, the Court does not believe that this single incident indicates that Plaintiffs are incapable of vigorously representing the class. Plaintiffs are students with academic obligations; any class representative in this sort of case must necessarily be a student. To hold that Plaintiffs must drop their academic careers to pursue this litigation would frustrate the ability of student-plaintiffs to bring class-action lawsuits under Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court concludes that the class meets the requirement of adequacy of representation and, therefore, that Plaintiffs have met their burden with respect to each element in Rule 23(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Rule 23(b) Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Court must decide whether the proposed class falls within one of the three categories of Rule 23(b). A party may satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) by showing that \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" \" Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Defs.' Opp. Mem. at 8, Sept. 11, 2017, Docket No. 202.) Plaintiffs' main request for relief is an injunction restraining SCSU from\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (1) continuing to discriminate against female students on the basis of sex; (2) restraining Defendants from eliminating any women's varsity sports programs, including, but not limited to, the women's varsity tennis and Nordic skiing programs; (3) requiring Defendants to provide women with an equal opportunity to participate in\n   varsity intercollegiate athletics by sponsoring additional women's sports based upon the interests and abilities of SCSU's present, prospective, and future students; (4) requiring Defendants to provide female athletes with equal access to athletic-related financial assistance; and (5) requiring Defendants to provide female athletes with equal athletic benefits and resources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   (Compl. at 47-48.) This injunctive relief would remedy the complaint of the entire class. The Court, therefore, concludes that Plaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have satisfied all of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b), the Court will certify the Plaintiffs' class as modified by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Finally, counsel has demonstrated that the firm has sufficient resources to manage a class-action lawsuit. (Mark Decl. \u00b6 2-5.) SCSU admits that Plaintiffs' counsel is sufficiently prepared to serve as class counsel in this action.

Dr. Lopiano's testimony primarily concerns statistics related to college athletic participation. (Lopiano Report at 10-11.) The Court acknowledges that Dr. Lopiano's proposed testimony-in some instances-comes close to being legal in nature (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Even though Title IX prohibits retaliation ....\").

Dr. Lopiano's report \"simply accepted [ ] SCSU['s] representation that it was not in compliance with Prong [1] prior to 2015,\" and therefore focused her inquiry on Prongs 2 and 3. (Lopiano Report at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Under Prong 2, the factfinder assesses \"where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the institution can show\n   <strong>\n    a history and continuing practice\n   </strong>\n   of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the members of that sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071%2C413\">\n    44 Fed.

Dr. Lopiano's proposed testimony is relevant to determining whether SCSU has a history of being responsive to the interests and abilities of female student-athletes. As one example, Dr. Lopiano describes informal requests made to SCSU to add certain women's sports, and SCSU's refusal to add those sports. (Lopiano Report at 50.) The Court finds that Dr. Lopiano's proposed testimony in Section D of her report is relevant for the factfinder's determination under Prong 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Under Prong 3, the factfinder assesses \"where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution\n   <strong>\n    cannot show a continuing practice of program expansion\n   </strong>\n   such as cited above, whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.\"\n   <em>\n    Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071%2C413\">\n    44 Fed.

SCSU does not provide any support for the notion that the statute of limitations requires the exclusion of evidence in Title IX cases-particularly where the Office of Civil Rights' policy interpretation requires a historical analysis. Excluding the evidence from beyond the statute of limitations would restrict the historical analysis necessary for Prongs 2 and 3 to a six-year period; the Court does not believe that either Title IX or its associated regulations support such a restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Court will deny SCSU's Motion to the extent that it involves testimony from Section D of Dr. Lopiano's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

(Lopiano Report at 73-75.) The Court will deny SCSU's Motion to the extent that it involves proposed testimony from Section E of Dr. Lopiano's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that SCSU has allocated athletic-related financial aid in violation of Title IX. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 112-123.) As such, the Court finds that Lopiano's testimony about SCSU's athletic-related financial aid is relevant and useful to the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lauzon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466091\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/681/#p686\">\n    270 F.3d at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   SCSU argues that expert testimony is not required about SCSU's athletic-related financial aid because the regulations require \"[s]imple math.\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. to Exclude at 10, May 12, 2017, Docket. No. 126.) In the alternative, SCSU argues that even if expert testimony is necessary, Lopiano is an unqualified expert because she is not a \"mathematician or statistician.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The applicable regulations state that Title IX compliance is determined by \"dividing the amounts of aid available for the members of each sex by the numbers of male or female participants in the amounts of aid available for members of each sex by the numbers of male or female participants in the athletic program and comparing the results\" and looking for \"substantially equal amounts or if a resulting disparity can be explained by adjustments to take into account legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071%2C413\">\n    44 Fed.

The factfinder will benefit from having an expert explain what \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors\" may or may not explain disparities in the allocation of athletic-based financial aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that Dr. Lopiano is qualified to testify about the disparity in athletic-based financial aid, and Plaintiffs do not need to hire a mathematician or statistician to conduct this analysis. SCSU concedes this calculation requires \"simple math.\" A District Court may allow an expert to testify about \"basic math\" that involves \"simple deductive reasoning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Prempro Prods.

As such, the Court finds that Dr. Lopiano's testimony about SCSU's compliance with the \"laundry list\" is relevant and useful to the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lauzon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466091\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/681/#p686\">\n    270 F.3d at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In this case, Dr. Lopiano based her opinions in part on conversations with two former SCSU employees: former Director of Athletics Dr. Morris Kurtz and former Associate Director of Athletics Dr. Susan\n   Becker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.) Dr. Kurtz retired from SCSU in 2012 and Dr. Becker retired from SCSU in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Lopiano worked through a series of worksheets with Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker based on the 1990 Title IX Athletics Investigator's Manual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43, 77.) Dr. Lopiano developed qualitative definitions she believed were appropriate for SCSU, which were reviewed by Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.) Dr. Lopiano then asked Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker to provide a qualitative rating for facilities as \"Superior,\" \"Adequate,\" or \"Inadequate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Lopiano \"took those ratings and mathematically determined the percent of male and female athletes, for example, who received Superior, Adequate or Inadequate treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.) At her deposition, Dr. Lopiano testified that Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker provided her with the inequality determinations as defined by her proposed definitions and that she relied on it. (Finnerty Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 2 (\"Lopiano Dep.\") at 165:14-18.) Dr. Lopiano did not independently verify any of the ratings provided by Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158:3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Dr. Lopiano's opinion is based on inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiffs have not offered any exception to the hearsay rules that would otherwise allow Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker's out-of-court statements to be admitted. However, this alone does not result in exclusion of Dr. Lopiano's proposed testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \"If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for\n   <strong>\n    the opinion\n   </strong>\n   to be admitted.\" Fed. R. Evid. 703. \"[E]xpert opinions based on otherwise inadmissible hearsay are to be admitted only if the facts or data are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinion or inferences upon the subject.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    509 U.S. at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Lopiano discussed her traditional method for assessing Title IX compliance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   Whenever I am hired to do a Title IX assessment in my consulting practice, I take one or more institutional athletic administrators ... through a series of meetings in which they complete pre-prepared worksheets on each Title IX element with my assistance for the purpose of teaching them how to perform a comprehensive Title IX athletics self-evaluation. Normally I do not have the opportunity to do this for a lawsuit because defendants are not eager to reveal differences in treatments that might be judged to constitute gender inequities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   (Lopiano Report at 75-76.) Her deposition clarifies that the system she used is \"contained in the Athletic Director's Desk Reference.\" (Lopiano Dep. at 156:11-15.) The Court, therefore, finds that Dr. Lopiano's opinions are based on hearsay that is reasonably relied on by experts in the field.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    509 U.S. at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Lopiano's opinions are admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Whether the actual hearsay statements of Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker can be admitted is a separate inquiry. Rule 703 specifies, \"if the facts or data would otherwise be inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose to the jury\n   <strong>\n    only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect\n   </strong>\n   .\" (emphasis added.) The Court is particularly concerned that the assessments provided by Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker may be outdated. Dr. Kurtz retired from SCSU in 2012 and Dr. Becker retired from SCSU in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.) Dr. Lopiano stated that she was \"comfortable\" relying on the opinions of Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker because \"within any three to five year period, treatment remains relatively constant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beyond her vague assertion that facilities rarely change, Dr. Lopiano has done nothing to ensure that Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker's evaluations remain current. For example, she has neither conducted a site visit nor interviewed the current athletic director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Yet this case relates to whether SCSU\n   <strong>\n    presently\n   </strong>\n   complies with Title IX. Generally, the Rules of Evidence prohibit the introduction of evidence of past violations to show that an actor is in current violation of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1). The advisory committee notes specify that \"[c]haracter evidence is of slight probative value and may be very prejudicial. It tends to distract the trier of fact from the main question of what actually happened.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court need not conduct a full inquiry under Rule 404 to see the prejudicial effect of Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker's evaluations. At best, the factual predicates on which Dr. Lopiano bases her opinion-the evaluations of Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker-establish that SCSU was not in compliance when Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Becker were employed at SCSU. These factual predicates do not establish that SCSU is presently violating the \"laundry list\" requirement of Title IX. The Court therefore concludes that, under Rule 703, the probative value of the factual predicates of Dr. Lopiano's opinion do not outweigh their prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In sum, the Court will permit Dr. Lopiano to testify about her opinion in Section F but will not permit Dr. Lopiano to disclose to the jury the factual predicates of her opinion. The Court will grant SCSU's Motion to the extent that it is consistent with this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   1.

Nevertheless, the Court agrees with the\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    court's concerns of overbreadth. Hypothetically, there is a female student-athlete at SCSU who participates in women's athletics and has not been injured by SCSU's Title IX violations. The Court acknowledges-as Plaintiffs' argue-that given the scope of Plaintiffs' allegations, this hypothetical student would be the rare exception. Nevertheless, the Court believes narrowing the proposed class is legally necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Moreover, even if the class were restricted to just members of the tennis and Nordic skiing teams, the Court would still conclude that the class is sufficiently numerous.

A class with thirty members approaches a class that \"is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).
