MOODY, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiff Colleen Rowe had breast augmentation surgery using Defendant Mentor Worldwide, LLC's MemoryGel Silicone Gel Breast Implants (\"MemoryGel Implants\"). The left MemoryGel Implant failed, and was replaced seven months later. Now Rowe is suing Mentor for negligence, strict liability, and breach of implied warranty. The Court concludes all but one of the claims must be dismissed because they are preempted or are otherwise unavailable to Rowe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mentor designs, manufactures, tests, and distributes MemoryGel Implants for use in breast augmentation surgeries. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 55). The MemoryGel Implants are a Class III device under the Medical Device Amendments (\"MDA\") to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"), and require premarket approval (\"PMA\") from the Food &amp; Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 10). Mentor filed a PMA application for the MemoryGel Implants in December 2003. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 56). The FDA provided the PMA in November 2006, allowing Mentor to market the MemoryGel Implants. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 57). A condition of the PMA required Mentor to conduct six post-approval studies regarding the long-term safety and effectiveness of the MemoryGel Implants. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 58-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Rowe had breast augmentation surgery on April 2, 2015, and was implanted with MemoryGel Implants. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 125). Nearly seven months later, Rowe began experiencing pain and limited functionality in her left arm. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 127). Rowe also experienced \"extreme and chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, muscle pain, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, nausea, bone pain, swelling [in] her joints, stiffness in her joints, irritability, shortness of breath, signs of silicone toxicity, and weight gain.\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 127). On November 6, 2015, Rowe underwent a second surgery that revealed the left MemoryGel Implant had ruptured. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 129). Her\n   surgeon removed the ruptured MemoryGel Implant and replaced it. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite replacement of the ruptured MemoryGel Implant, Rowe continued to experience \"pain, discomfort, swelling and soreness to her left side at the surgical site....\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 131). Rowe also continued to experience \"extreme and chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, joint pain, joint stiffness, irritability, weight gain, shortness of breath, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nausea and other ailments.\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 132).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2015, Rowe's surgeon recommended a third surgery conditioned on Rowe signing a release and hold harmless agreement in favor of Defendant Mentor. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 133). Rowe has not yet undergone that surgery, but says she intends to have her MemoryGel Implants removed. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Now Rowe is suing Mentor for negligence, strict liability, and breach of implied warranty. (Doc. 1). Rowe alleges generally that Mentor failed to properly conduct the post-approval studies, and failed to warn consumers and physicians about known risks associated with the MemoryGel Implants. Rowe also alleges that her MemoryGel Implant was somehow defective. Finally, Rowe alleges that the MemoryGel Implant was not of merchantable quality, nor reasonably fit for its intended purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a complaint to be dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.

(Doc. 11). The Court agrees, except as to Rowe's negligent manufacturing defect claim. So all of Rowe's claims will be dismissed except that one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But first the Court will address a growing plague on the justice system, which has wreaked havoc in this case and numerous others: poorly drafted pleadings. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires claims and defenses to be pleaded in \"short and plain\" statements. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), (b)(1)(A). Pleading allegations also \"must be simple, concise, and direct.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). As the Eighth Circuit explained\n   50 years ago, \"The clear purpose of the rule is to give notice to the other party and not to formulate issues or fully summarize the facts involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Clausen &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Theo. Hamm Brewing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2151258\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/395/388/#p390\">\n    395 F.2d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (8th Cir. 1968).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Courts are also directed to construe pleadings \"so as to do justice.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e). To that effect, the liberal federal pleading standard \"reject[s] the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept[s] the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Beem v. Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=713%20Fed.%20Appx.%20974\">\n    713 Fed.Appx. 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (11th Cir. 2018). So a pleading generally is sufficient if it gives notice of the claims or defense and the grounds upon which they rest.\n   <em>\n    Lombard's, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292538\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/974/#p975\">\n    753 F.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (11th Cir. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There is a point, though, where a pleading becomes deficient not because it lacks sufficient allegations to provide notice of claims, but because it buries those allegations among pages of irrelevant and impertinent material. In other words, it lacks \"simple, concise, and direct\" allegations that provide \"short and plain\" statements of the claims. This happens when, to borrow from a familiar analogy, attorneys throw every allegation they can think of into a pleading to see what sticks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Inevitably, opposing counsel then moves to dismiss. The parties ask the courts to carefully comb through the pleading, determining whether the facts alleged are sufficient to support a claim and whether all of the necessary elements have been pleaded. In doing so, parties skirt their Rule 8 pleading requirements and rely on the Court's obligation to construe the pleading so as to do justice. But this flips Rule 8 on its head and is not required even under the most liberal view of the federal notice-pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rowe's Complaint is such a pleading. The four-count Complaint is a sprawling 60 pages, with an additional 151 pages of exhibits. Count I, for negligence, begins at paragraph 143 on page 41. None of the preceding allegations are incorporated into this count (or any other), indicating that the first 40 pages of the Complaint was unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To compound these issues, Rowe's actual claims are far from \"short and plain\" statements contemplated by Rule 8. The negligence count itself is eight pages long and, as far as the Court can determine, includes six separate negligence theories that are confusingly interwoven among each other. Rowe alleges causation and damages for some of the theories, but not others. She also repeats the same allegations within and among the various theories, making it unclear to which theory certain allegations pertain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   These problems continue into the other counts as well. For instance, in count II for strict liability for failure to warn, paragraphs 198 and 208 are nearly identical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And while Rowe separated her strict liability claims for failure to warn (count II) and manufacturing defect (count III), both counts contain allegations only relevant to the other claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Having painstakingly reviewed the Complaint, the Court can say without doubt that Rowe threw every allegation into the Complaint to see what would stick. And to\n   borrow another saying, the Court is tempted to throw the baby-in this case, one potentially viable claim-out with the bath water. But to do so would not do justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   So the Court will instead parse through the Complaint and explain why all but one of Rowe's claims fail. But this Order shall serve as notice that this Court will no longer accept pleadings that deviate so drastically from the requirements of Rule 8, and will instead either dismiss the pleading upon proper motion or order a repleader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In a well-written motion, Mentor argues that each of Rowe's claims are preempted, either expressly or impliedly. Mentor also argues that Rowe failed to plausibly plead that the violation of federal requirements caused her injuries, and that she lacks privity with Mentor to sue for breach of implied warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rather than responding to these arguments, Rowe copied a response to a motion to dismiss that was filed in a California case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 18 (Rowe's response) and 19-1 (response filed in other case).

And Rowe alleges in the Complaint all of the necessary elements to state a claim for negligent failure to warn: she alleges Mentor had a duty to provide adequate warnings about the risks of the MemoryGel Implants (Doc. 1, \u00b6 145), that Mentor breached the duty by failing to warn of the risks associated with MemoryGel Implants (Doc. 1, \u00b6 148), and that the failure to warn caused her damages (Doc. 1, \u00b6 154). So Rowe adequately pleaded a claim that can stand under Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But this claim is expressly preempted. Rowe does not allege that Mentor failed to give the warning required by the FDA and federal requirements. So Rowe is attempting to hold Mentor to a state-law requirement that is different or in addition to what federal law requires.\n   <em>\n    Mink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276498\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/1319/#p1325\">\n    860 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a) ).

Failure to report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similar to the prior theory, Rowe states a viable Florida state-law claim for negligent failure to report. In fact, the Eleventh Circuit has equated failure to report with failure to warn under Florida law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276498\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/1319/#p1325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276498\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/1319/#p1325\">\n    at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Florida law recognizes this [failure to report adverse events] theory as 'negligent failure to warn.' \").

Rowe alleges that Mentor should have reported adverse events, presumably to the FDA as required by federal regulations. As the Eleventh Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Mink\n   </em>\n   , a failure to report claim like this is \"very much like the 'fraud-on-the FDA' claim the Supreme Court held was impliedly preempted in\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   \" because Rowe is alleging Mentor \"failed to tell the FDA those things required by federal law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276498\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/1319/#p1325\">\n    860 F.3d at 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So Rowe cannot pursue negligence based on this theory of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Failure to comply with federal laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Rowe alleges that Mentor's MemoryGel Implants PMA required them to conduct six studies (Doc. 1, \u00b6 149), and that Mentor negligently failed to comply with these requirements (Doc. 1, \u00b6 150). Rowe also alleges that Mentor breached a general duty of care to Rowe by Mentor's \"failure to comply with its PMA and FDA post-marketing regulations,\" which caused Plaintiff's damages. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 154).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rowe's claim is for breach of the federal requirements and regulations. But Rowe never identifies a parallel state duty to comply with the requirements and regulations. And this Court is unaware of any duty imposed under Florida law imposing such a duty. So the Court concludes that Rowe has failed to state a viable negligence claim under Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if she had, though, this theory of liability would be impliedly preempted.

Rowe never identifies what the misrepresentations were, when they were made, how they were made, where they were made, or who made them. As best this Court can tell, the misrepresentations about which Rowe complains have to do with Mentor's reports to the FDA since she does not allege any other communications were made by Mentor.

Her remaining negligence theories are either unable to stand under Florida law, or are preempted by federal law. Rowe's strict liability claims for failure to warn and failure to report are also expressly and impliedly preempted. Rowe's strict liability manufacturing defect claim is preempted because she fails to identify any specific regulation the MemoryGel Implant did not satisfy. And Rowe's claim for breach of implied warranty fails because she lacks privity with Mentor.
