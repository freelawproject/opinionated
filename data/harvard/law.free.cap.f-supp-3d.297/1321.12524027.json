ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants, Noadiam USA, LLC; Steven Neiger; Dean David Neiger; Emma\n   Hazzan; and Global Assets Gem, S.A., seek to compel arbitration of this action under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"Convention\") and its implementing legislation, 9 U.S.C. sections 201 - 08 (the \"Convention Act\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Compel Arbitration ... [ECF No. 17] ). Plaintiffs, SBMH Group DMCC; and Saul Neiger, individually and as shareholder of, and on behalf of, DG Trading DMCC, oppose the Motion on the grounds two of the Plaintiffs and four of the Defendants are not parties to the arbitration agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration ... [ECF No. 38] ). Defendant, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., has not filed any papers in this action. The Court has carefully reviewed the briefing and exhibits, including Defendants' Reply [ECF No. 39], the record, and applicable law. For the reasons stated below, the Motion to Compel is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The September 15, 2017 Order [ECF No. 33] denying Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand ... [ECF No. 18], details the factual background of this case and Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 15 Order 2-7). There is therefore no need to revisit the facts of the case in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As noted in the September 15 Order, Defendants assert the parties have agreed to arbitrate the claims raised in this action, based on a provision in DG Trading's Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association [ECF No. 1-2], attached to the Notice of Removal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 4). Section 91 of the Memorandum of Association, titled \"Arbitration,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Whenever any differences arise between the Company on the one hand and any of the shareholders, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns on the other hand touching the true intent and construction or the incidence or consequences of these Articles, touching anything then or thereafter done or executed, omitted or suffered in pursuance of the Law or touching any breach or alleged breach of these Articles or to any act affecting the Company or to any of the affairs of the Company, such difference shall, unless the parties agree to refer to a single arbitrator be referred to two arbitrators one to be chosen by each of the parties to the difference and the arbitrators shall before entering on the reference appoint an umpire. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In absence of any arbitration rules in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the arbitration rules and procedures of the Dubai International Arbitration Centre.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (AOA 21\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). The Amended Memorandum of Association, by virtue of which Dean David Neiger became a shareholder, states \"[a]nd with regard to the rest of Memorandum of Association, it remains unchanged.\" (MOA 5\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants assert \"[a]ll of the claims that have been asserted by and between DG Trading, Serge Neiger as beneficiary of DG Trading, and Defendants Steven Neiger and Dean Neiger are subject to\" the broadly written arbitration agreement. (Mot. 4 (alteration added) ). Additionally, the non-signatory Defendants, namely Emma Hazzan, Noadiam, and\n   Global Assets, claim they are entitled to invoke the arbitration provision under a theory of equitable estoppel, given arbitration should be \"ordered when the allegations against [a non-signatory] are inextricably intertwined with or mirror those against a signatory, when the allegations are of interdependent and concerted misconduct between a non-signatory and a signatory, or when the claims are based on the same facts and are inherently inseparable,\" as they are here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8 (alteration added; citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To these arguments, Plaintiffs respond: (1) Defendants have requested only DG Trading be compelled to arbitrate its claims; (2) relevant contract law determines who may be compelled to arbitrate; and (3) the governing law, in this instance, either UAE or Florida law, bars the nonsignatory Defendants from invoking the arbitration agreement.

This exception requires courts, after concluding the parties have clearly and unmistakably manifested their intent to arbitrate arbitrability, to engage in a \"second, more limited inquiry to determine whether the assertion of arbitrability is wholly groundless.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275730\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1257/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275730\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1257/\">\n    at 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Qualcomm Inc. v.

The Eleventh Circuit instead held the wholly groundless exception ran \"counter to the Supreme Court's mandate\" precluding courts from ruling on the potential merits of any claim that the parties have clearly intended should be arbitrated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1270. Nevertheless, this strict enforcement of the delegation provision can apply only to those parties who actually signed the agreement and manifested their desire to arbitrate arbitrability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants incorrectly insist federal arbitration law governs the construction of arbitration agreements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 7). It is by now well-established the relevant contract law governs whether a non-signatory may compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Life of the S. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740462\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/1166/#p1170\">\n    648 F.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1170-71 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing\n   <em>\n    Carlisle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653731\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/624/\">\n    556 U.S. at 630-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653731\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/624/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Because the AOA is governed by the \"laws, rules[,] and regulations from time to time in force in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre\" (AOA 22 (alteration added) ), the Court applies that relevant contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although none of the parties has explicitly stated Dubai contract or arbitration law applies to this matter, all have done so implicitly by submitting affidavits from UAE law experts regarding arbitration in the United Arab Emirates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand, Ex. 2, Declaration of Dr. Habib Mohamed Sharif Al Mulla [ECF No. 29-2]; Resp., Ex. A, Declaration of Mr. Adrian Chadwick in Opposition to the Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration [ECF No. 38-1]; Resp., Ex. B, Declaration of Ms. Lyudmila O. Yamalova [ECF No. 38-2] ). Accordingly, the Court applies the UAE legal principles set forth in those Declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under UAE law, arbitration agreements must be written and signed by the parties to the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Al Mulla Decl. \u00b6 48; Chadwick Decl. \u00b6 34). United Arab Emirates courts will find exceptions to this requirement where (1) an arbitration clause is incorporated into a contract by reference; (2) the contract containing the arbitration provision has been assigned; or (3) a principal has ratified the act of its agent in signing the arbitration clause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Al Mulla Decl. \u00b6 49; Chadwick Decl. \u00b6 40 (\"I agree that in exceptional circumstances it is possible for an arbitration agreement to bind a party even if he has not physically signed the arbitration agreement. Where I disagree with Dr. Habib Al Mulla is whether the exceptional circumstances apply in the circumstances of this case.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants have not, either in their Motion or Reply, attempted to argue the nonsignatory Plaintiffs or non-signatory Defendants are agents or assignees of the signatories. Their primary strategy appears focused on compelling arbitration under a theory of equitable estoppel and, in the alternative, on the basis the arbitrable claims are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the non-arbitrable claims. (Mot. 7-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply 8). Yet, as the Reply and Motion make clear, Defendants' argument regarding equitable estoppel is premised on the application of U.S. federal law; there is no mention of UAE law in either of Defendants' filings related to this Motion. Notably, the Declarants have not explained how UAE courts might apply equitable estoppel; indeed, two Declarants have affirmatively stated no such concept exists under UAE law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chadwick Decl. \u00b6 41; Yamalova Decl. \u00b6 32). Because UAE law would not permit the non-signatories in this action to compel, or be compelled to, arbitration, only DG Trading's claims against Steven Neiger\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Dean David Neiger are properly referable to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under section 3 of the FAA, once a district court has satisfied itself an issue is arbitrable, it \"shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Where an issue is properly referred to arbitration, the stay is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klay v. All Defendants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9151647\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/1191/#p1204\">\n    389 F.3d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1204 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing\n   <em>\n    Shearson/Am. Express, Inc. v.

Therefore, and although two Plaintiffs are not signatories to the AOA, Counts I, II, III, IV, and V-which are all brought directly against Steven and Dean David Neiger, either in whole or in part-are all mandatorily stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to Counts VI and VII-the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act claims against Emma Hazzan, JPMorgan Chase, and Noadiam-the Court has some discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212026\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/220/#p226\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"When confronted with litigants advancing both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims ... courts have discretion to stay non-arbitrable claims.\" (alteration added; citations omitted) ). Generally, \"when it is feasible to proceed with the litigation,\" courts will decline to stay arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212026\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/220/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Central to the question of whether it is indeed feasible to proceed is \"whether arbitrable claims predominate or whether the outcome of the non-arbitrable claims will depend upon the arbitrator's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212026\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/220/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Both Counts VI and VII are premised upon the contention transfers made by Dean and Steven Neiger were fraudulent. Any wrongdoing on the part of Emma Hazzan or Noadiam is alleged to be wrongful insofar as it involves receipt of funds from Dean and Steven. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 73 (\"Defendant Noadiam was simply a shell and conduit for Steven Neiger to repatriate and send funds to and from abroad.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55 (\"[T]he sons commenced laundering portions of the Fraudulent Fiduciary Payments and the Embezzled Funds to their mother, through transfers ... to Defendant Emma Hazzan's account.\" (alterations added) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60 (\"Acting as a mere conduit, Defendant, Emma Hazzan then transferred the proceeds of the Hazzan Fraudulent Transfers to Defendants Dean Neiger and Steven Neiger.\") ). Because Counts VI and VII, as well as Count III as it applies to the non-signatory Defendants, cannot be resolved without reference to the Counts against Steven and Dean, the better course is to stay the remaining, non-arbitrable, claims until such time as the arbitral tribunal has completed its work and either determined this dispute is not properly before it, or resolved Plaintiff, DG Trading's claims on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
