In an apparent matter of first impression, the Court finds that bonuses originating from and determined exclusively by a third-party must be included in the regular rate of pay of an employee, where the employer sacrifices discretion over fact and amount and agrees to pay bonuses designed to incentivize employees into working harder. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 19) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Defendants' motions for summary judgment (Doc. 22; Doc. 23)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Bristol Excavating, Inc. is an excavation contractor, incorporated and engaging in business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Defendant Calvin Bristol is the owner and sole shareholder of Bristol Excavating. Bristol Excavating entered into a master service agreement with Talisman Energy Inc. (\"Talisman\"), whereupon Bristol Excavating would provide \"mix off\" services at Talisman's drilling sites, to be rendered by Bristol employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some point around when Bristol employees began work at Talisman sites, the employees learned of a Talisman bonus program after discussions with non-Bristol employees. Talisman had a bonus program available to workers at its drilling sites, offering bonuses earned based on safety, efficiency, and completion of work. Bristol's employees spoke with Krystle Bristol, then business manager of Bristol Excavating, and she spoke with Talisman about the bonus program and the requirements for Bristol employees to participate. Per her discussions with Talisman, Krystle Bristol learned that mix off operators were indeed eligible for the Talisman bonus program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The employees were then informed of the three available bonuses. The safety bonus was attained if there were no accidents or injuries during the job. The AFE bonus was attained for completing a hole faster than Talisman expected. The pacesetter bonus was attained also for efficiency, with the government describing the requirement as drilling a hole \"faster than a specified amount of time\" and Bristol characterizing the criteria as \"drilling deeper on any given day than Talisman had anticipated.\" (Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 17; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 29). Mix off operators knew the terms for earning each bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Talisman retained sole discretion in determining whether or not the requirements for a bonus had been met. Once Talisman determined a particular bonus was earned, Talisman would email Bristol, who would then issue an invoice to Talisman for the amount of the bonus. Talisman would approve the amount cited on the invoice, and Bristol issued payment. Bristol also deducted taxes and fees prior to issuing a check to the employees. This check was issued separately from employee paychecks. Upon Krystle Bristol's departure, this process was outsourced to the accounting firm LaBarr &amp; LaBarr, who continued issuing a separate check for the bonuses and not including the amount in the calculation of the employee's regular rate of pay. Over the course of this working relationship, Talisman changed the amount of the bonus at its leisure. At no\n   point did the contract between the two include a provision on the bonuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 22, 2016, then-acting Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez brought this suit against Bristol Excavating and Calvin Bristol. (Doc. 1). In the complaint, the Secretary argued that Defendants' failure to include the bonus payments in the employees' regular rate of pay violated the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1). The Secretary sought back wage compensation for each of the harmed employees and liquidated damages in an amount equal to the amount of back wages. (Doc. 1). Defendants answered on September 20, 2016, arguing that they did not have to include the bonuses in the regular rate of pay for overtime purposes because the bonuses were \"discretionary gifts\" from a customer and remuneration promised by Bristol. (Doc. 5; Doc. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties consented to proceed before the undersigned on November 7, 2016.

Namely, the dispute centers upon whether these bonuses should have been included in the regular rate of pay of\n   Bristol's employees, thus increasing the total compensation owed for overtime. Under \u00a7 207(a)(1):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The term \"regular rate\" is defined as \"all remuneration for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee,\" with eight enumerated exceptions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

Three of these exceptions have been discussed either in briefs or at oral argument: bonus payments as gifts; payments made for occasional periods when no work is performed; and payments paid for services, without prior agreement, where discretionary payment in fact and amount is retained by the employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 207(e)(1)-(3).

Both of these arguments have been touched upon in the parties' briefs and at oral argument. Both exceptions are summarily inapplicable given the facts at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The term \"gifts\" is meant to include \"payments in the nature of gifts made at Christmas time or on other special occasions, as a reward for service, the amounts of which are not measured by or dependent on hours worked, production, or efficiency[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Both parties acknowledge that the bonuses were dependent on work factors such as production and efficiency. (Doc. 19-1, at 5; Doc. 22-2, at 8). As the bonuses were incurred for strictly work-related performance, they cannot be characterized as gifts and immune from inclusion in the regular rate of pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for the Defendants likened the bonuses received by Bristol employees to payments made for occasional periods when no work is performed. Under this exception to inclusion of bonuses in the regular rate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   payments made for occasional periods when no work is performed due to vacation, holiday, illness, failure of the employer to provide sufficient work, or other similar cause; reasonable payments for traveling expenses, or other expenses, incurred by an employee in the furtherance of his employer's interests and properly reimbursable by the employer; and other similar payments to an employee which are not made as compensation for his hours of employment [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Counsel argued that bonuses based on production and efficiency would lead to early completion of work and by extension less money for Bristol Excavating. Thus, the bonuses were for work contrary to the\n   Bristol's interest. Because the bonuses were attributable to time spent away from Bristol and contrary to Bristol's interests, then the bonuses constitute payments to an employee that are not compensation for his hours of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Contrary to the characterization offered, these bonuses appear indisputably related to employment with Bristol, regardless of the facts that Bristol did not originate the bonuses and that bonuses were earned for work that would cut down on the days requiring Bristol employees to be present, thus costing Bristol money. The scope of an employer-employee relationship is far broader under the Fair Labor Standards Act than under traditional common law guidance.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) - (e) ; U.S. DEP'T OF LABOR WAGE HOUR DIVISION FIELD OPERATIONS HANDBOOK \u00a7 10b05 (defining worker as an employee under FLSA \"if, as a matter of economic reality, he or she is economically dependent on the employer.\"). The enumerated exceptions under the FLSA reflect non-inclusion for compensation related to time away from an enterprise, be it for the employee's interest or on an employer's behalf. Plainly, the bonuses in this matter were not tied to vacation or sick time or employer-driven time away where an employee incurs expenses, as the employees were at Talisman drilling sites by virtue of their employment with Bristol and Bristol's contractual agreement with Talisman. The employees were not distanced from Bristol's interests, only distanced from Bristol's place of business. Per Bristol's agreement with Talisman, it had agreed to provide employees to Talisman for their operations. Without these employees, Bristol has no contract and receives no compensation from Talisman. Thus, the employees' performance at Talisman sites clearly advances Bristol's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even were the bonuses earned for work severable from Bristol's interests, they still do not fit the (e)(2) exception. The Regulations on non-productive worktime provide that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   an employee must be compensated for all hours worked. As a general rule the term \"hours worked\" will include: (a) All time during which an employee is required to be on duty or to be on the employer's premises or at a prescribed workplace and (b) all time during which an employee is suffered or permitted to work whether or not he is required to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.223\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The bonuses were tied to hours of employment, as they could only be earned while on the clock. Particularly, the bonuses could only be earned by performance at Talisman worksites; worksites at which employees could not work but for their employment relationship with Bristol. Bristol sent the employees to Talisman worksites. Bristol compensated the employees for their time at Talisman worksites. The employees were on duty at a prescribed workplace at the behest of Bristol. While bonuses could be earned for efficient performance that in turn would require fewer days to complete the work and thus fewer days where Bristol needed to provide employees, the conduct of the employees remained squarely within the interests of Bristol and directly related to on-the-clock performance. There is simply no basis to conclude that the bonuses are \"not made as compensation for hours of employment.\" Thus, the second exception is equally inapplicable to the facts at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The third offered exception provides that discretionary payments or bonuses are not included in the regular rate. In order to exclude bonuses under (e)(3), an employer must retain sole discretion over the fact that a bonus will be paid and the amount to be paid until at or near the end of the period that would include the bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   If the employer promises in advance to pay a bonus, he has abandoned his discretion with regard to it.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.211\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

(Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 27; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 19-20, 34). As Bristol never had discretion in bonus determinations, they did not retain discretion until \"near the end of the period for which it covers.\" Additionally, the bonus payments were subject to prior agreement or promise. While not contemplated in employment contracts or the Master Services Agreement between Bristol and Talisman (Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 13), Bristol employees were aware of the specific terms necessary for earning a bonus and Bristol's participation in the scheme. (Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 14-15, 20-21; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 16, 28-29). The absence of a contractual obligation does not render bonus payments promised to employees excludable from the regular rate of pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walling v. Richmond Screw Anchor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143399\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/154/780/#p784\">\n    154 F.2d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784 (2d Cir. 1946). The employees knew prior to daily attendance at the job site how bonuses would be determined and earned. It is immaterial that the employees did not know prior to their first day of work about the bonuses. The question is whether they knew about the bonuses prior to their incentivized performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, all four requirements for exclusion of bonus payments in the regular rate of pay weigh in favor of inclusion. Even considering the facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the Defendants, they have not met their burden of establishing the applicability of a \u00a7 207(e) exception. Bristol did not have discretion over the fact or amount of bonus payments and agreed to the terms provided. Further, the payments were incentive based and tied to work that benefitted Bristol. As the burden rests with the Defendants to establish that remuneration should be excluded under \u00a7 207(e), and concluding that the Defendants did not meet this burden, generally no further analysis would be required. The Court would be forced to conclude as a matter of law that the bonus\n   payments are part of the regular rate of pay owed to employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B. THE EFFECT OF THIRD-PARTY DISCRETION OVER BONUSES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Were the relationship between Bristol and Bristol's employees the sole consideration here, summary judgment would be warranted. However, having determined that the \u00a7 207(e) exceptions do not apply, the crux of this case is whether Talisman's retained discretion over the bonus payments usurps \u00a7 207's general rule that bonus payments must be included in the \"regular rate\" where an employer maintains no discretion over the bonus. More generally, are bonuses agreed to by an employer, but determined exclusively by a third-party based on safety and performance parameters, included in the regular rate of pay for overtime purposes? The parties believe this to be a case of first impression. The parties have not identified judicial precedent and the Court is unable to find any caselaw definitively answering the pertinent question of how the discretion of a third-party over bonuses affects the regular rate of pay under the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because precise guidance on the effect of third-party bonuses on the regular rate of pay is not addressed by the FLSA, the Court must consider if Congress intended for this type of payment to be included. It is well established that courts engaging in statutory interpretation first look to the plain language of the statute and where \"the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, further inquiry is not required, except in the extraordinary case where a literal reading of the language produces an absurd result.\"\n   <em>\n    Idahoan Fresh v.

The bonus payments in question do not fit the exceptions provided in \u00a7 207(e). \"Bonuses which do not qualify for exclusion from the regular rate as one of these types must be totaled in with other earnings to determine the regular rate on which overtime pay must be based.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.208\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The language of the statute and regulations is clear and unambiguous: where no exception applies, bonus payments must be included in the regular rate.

The Court denied summary judgment on both theories. In determining that the bonuses were not discretionary as a matter of law, the Court pointed to the promise by SAI to pay bonuses, the known terms and amounts of bonuses, the fact that all parties knew which employees were eligible, and the incentivized nature of the bonuses as supporting a conclusion that the bonuses were not discretionary, nor gifts.\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202634643\">\n    2017 WL 2634643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9. The fact that a third-party, AT &amp; T, retained the decision-making power over the requirements for a bonus did not exclude the bonus from the regular rate.

Here, employer Bristol contracted with third-party Talisman to provide labor at Talisman work sites. (Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 10-11; Doc. 22-2, 9). After commencement of work, Bristol employees became aware of a bonus program sponsored by the Talisman. (Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 13; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 14). Bristol met with the employees and all parties understood the scope of the bonus program. (Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 14-15; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 16-17). Employees were informed when they had met the requirements for bonuses and in fact Talisman sent the payments to Bristol for processing to employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 19-1, 27-28\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 19-23). As with AT &amp; T in\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   , Talisman made the ultimate decision on whether the terms for a bonus were met by the employees. (Doc. 19-1, \u00b6 27; Doc. 22-2, \u00b6 34). The\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   Court determined that it could not find the bonus payments discretionary on the part of the employer, and thus excludable from the regular rate of pay, as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202634643\">\n    2017 WL 2634643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Faced with similar circumstances here, the Court agrees that by the terms of the statute the requirements for exclusion under \u00a7 207(e)(3) are not met. It is apparent from the\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   opinion that inclusion of third-party driven bonuses in the regular\n   rate does not produce the \"absurd result\" necessary for the Court to deviate from the plain language of the statute. Inclusion of the bonuses instead fits the intent and terms of \u00a7 207 that provide for inclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Secretary directed the Court to Department of Labor administrative guidance that they argue further supports this position of inclusivity. (Doc. 19, at 20). Agency interpretive guidelines do not rise to the level of a regulation and do not have the effect of law.\n   <em>\n    Madison v.

WHD Opinion Letter, FLSA2005-4NA (July 5, 2005). The Wage and Hour Division determined that in situations where a vendor \"informs the employees of the requirements for the bonus prior to the work being performed, these bonuses are promised to the employees who meet the vendor's requirements, rather than being paid at the discretion of the employer.\" WHD Opinion Letter, FLSA2005-4NA (July 5, 2005). Because the employer forfeited discretion, the bonus did not fit the exception and thus \"must be included in the calculation of the employee's regular rate of pay.\" WHD Opinion Letter, FLSA2005-4NA (July 5, 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Wage and Hour Division's interpretation of regular rate is consistent with the language of the statute and with the judgment reached today. A reading of the letter demonstrates that a determination on the inclusivity of third-party bonuses under \u00a7 207 does not revolve around the source of the bonus but on the applicability of the exceptions provided by the statute. Where a bonus does not satisfy any condition for exclusion, it must be included. While presenting a scenario in the retail context, the underlying theory of inclusion is no less applicable to the case at hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is clear that the Wage and Hour Division's interpretation of applying bonuses to the regular rate under \u00a7 207 is correct.

(Doc. 19-1). The Defendants' briefs on summary judgment and in opposition to the Plaintiff's own do not present counters to any of these arguments, as the Defendants rested upon the applicability of \u00a7 207(e) to exclude the bonuses from the regular rate of pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court agrees that Calvin Bristol is generally liable for the FLSA violations committed by Bristol Excavating.

Calvin Bristol, Krystle Bristol, and Jodi McNeal-the sole principal and both account managers who Bristol testified would have calculated overtime pay-all testified that they did not make any attempt to inquire into whether the bonuses from Talisman should be included. (Doc. 19-6, at 118-19; Doc. 19-7, at 70; Doc. 20-5, at 13-14). Accordingly, the Defendants cannot demonstrate good faith and reasonable grounds for exclusion, no matter how meritorious their belief was. By taking no affirmative steps, an employer cannot demonstrate good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Souryavong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328065\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/159/514/#p519\">\n    159 F.Supp.3d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent good faith, this Court is without discretion to reduce the otherwise mandatory liquidated damages provided for by the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958809\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/111/#p125\">\n    469 U.S. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958809\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/111/#p125\">\n    105 S.Ct. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958809\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/111/#p125\">\n    83 L.Ed.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The liquidated damages provision imposes liability equal to the amount of deficiency. Plaintiff has provided accounting of the bonuses owed, based upon calculations performed and provided to the Department of Labor by Bristol's account manager, Jodi McNeal. This accounting shows a deficiency of $8,000.87 in total;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   an amount verified by the Department of Labor. (Doc. 20-6; Doc. 20-8; Doc. 20-9). Combined with the mandatory liquidated damages, the total judgment owed by the Defendants for violations of \u00a7 207 is $16,001.74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Lastly, the Secretary requests this Court issue injunctive relief to prevent recurrence of statutory violations. (Doc. 19-1, at 28). The FLSA authorizes district courts to issue injunctive relief restraining violations of \u00a7 207 upon a showing of cause.\n   <em>\n    Solis v. A-1 Mortg.

The Court also considers the reasonable possibility of recurrence. Considering the facts of this case, the Court has no reason to suspect abuse of the overtime provisions in the future. While the Defendants did not comply with the terms of the FLSA, this does not appear to be a case of malicious or intentional disregard of the statute. This Memorandum suffices to put the Defendants on notice of the requirements of \u00a7 207. Performance bonuses paid under the facts presented must be included in the regular rate of pay. Thus, the Court finds further pronouncement in the form of injunctive relief unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     SUMMARY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 19) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . The failure of the Defendants to include bonus payments paid by Talisman was a violation of \u00a7 207 of the Fair Labor Standards Act. These bonuses did not fit any of the enumerated exceptions contained within \u00a7 207(e). Further, Defendant Calvin Bristol is jointly and severally liable for these violations. Additionally, liquidated damages are mandatory as a result of the Defendants' failure to show good cause for the violations. Judgment will be entered in the amount of $16,001.74, in accordance with the accounting provided. Conversely, the motions for summary judgment filed by the Defendants (Doc. 22; Doc. 23) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Defendants Bristol Excavating, Inc. and Calvin Bristol filed one brief in support for both motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Because the facts are mostly undisputed, the Court omits citations to the record except where disputed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Bristol did retain a portion of the bonuses for taxes and processing fees, but the amount of the bonus earned was not discretionary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In contrast to the ambiguity in\n    <em>\n     Romano\n    </em>\n    , Bristol's employees did in fact receive the bonuses paid.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    While the Secretary notes that Bristol paid the bonus amount approved by Talisman prior to receipt of the bonus, there has been no dispute that Talisman in fact paid the bonuses approved.
