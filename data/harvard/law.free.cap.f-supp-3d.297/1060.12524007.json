Presently before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 20), which, for the following reasons is GRANTED with leave to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are organizations whose members treat and recycle wastewater. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"CWA\"), Plaintiffs' members must obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permits in order to release treated water into the environment. These permits are issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Boards, the State Water Resources Control Board (\"State Water Board\"), and sometimes the EPA. It is the EPA, however, that promulgates formal test methods for determining whether discharged water is deemed \"toxic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The NPDES permits contain monitoring requirements that must be conducted according to test procedures approved under 40 C.F.R. pt. 136. As is relevant here, the test procedures employed include whole effluent toxicity (\"WET\") test methods, which measure the biological effects (survival, growth and/or reproduction) on aquatic organisms exposed to environmental samples. In WET testing, the final result is not based on a single measurement, but is the product of a series of replicated measurements on a range of at least five effluent concentrations compared to a control sample. Those replicated measurements can be assessed through a number of distinct statistical procedures, the outcome of which are referred to as \"endpoints.\" The endpoints are expressed as percent of the effluent, rather than as \"Pass/Fail\" or \"unitless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2002, the EPA promulgated a number of WET test methods for use in monitoring compliance with NPDES permit limitations (\"2002 Rule\"). The 2002 Rule does not expressly mention or authorize the TST statistical procedure. Nor does it mention or authorize, among other things, either an alternative hypothesis presuming the water tested is toxic, unitless expressions of toxicity, or reliance on information from two tested concentrations as opposed to six (of both effluent and control).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, in 2010, the EPA published a guidance document regarding the TST (\"2010 TST Guidance\")-which provided guidance regarding the use of a new potential statistical method of analyzing WET test data for the NPDES program. The TST relies on an alternative hypothesis presuming toxicity and includes Pass/Fail endpoints. The 2010 TST Guidance was not promulgated through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, expressly confirms that it is not \"a permit or a regulation itself\" and makes clear that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The document does not and cannot impose any legally binding requirements on EPA, states, NPDES permittees, or laboratories conducting or using WET testing for permittees (or for states in evaluating ambient water quality). EPA could revise this document without public notice to reflect changes in EPA policy and guidance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The EPA later amended the 2002 Rule's WET test methods and procedures in 2012, but still did not expressly incorporate or authorize the use of the TST. The agency also proposed modifications to 40 C.F.R. pt. 136 in 2015, but still did not include reference to the TST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the EPA nonetheless began to require use of the TST in various permits in the meantime. For example, in July 2012, the EPA, along with the Regional Water Quality Control Board Santa Ana Region, issued NPDES Permit No. CA0110604 to the Orange County Sanitation District. This permit required the use of the TST and stated, \"The reported results shall include: determination of 'Pass' or 'Fail' and 'Percent Effect' following the Test of Significant Toxicity hypothesis testing approach in [the 2010 TST Guidance].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably, while the EPA had been urging the State of California to utilize the TST for years, regulated dischargers objected based on concerns regarding high false positive error rates and because the TST approach had not been formally promulgated and publicly vetted. In light of those objections, the State Water Board requested pursuant to 40 C.F.R. pts. 136.4 and 136.5, approval of an Alternate Test Procedure (\"ATP\") that would permit use of the TST statistical method in conjunction with a test design incorporating only two samples in lieu of the five-concentration WET test procedure. On March 17, 2014, the EPA approved the two-concentration TST design as a limited use ATP for NPDES permits issued in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 25, 2014, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants EPA and Jared Blumenfeld, then Regional Administrator of EPA Region IX, alleging that those defendants had illegally and improperly approved the State Water Board's request to use a newly formulated methodology as an ATP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    So.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cal. Alliance of Publicly Owned Treatment Works v. EPA\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:14-cv-01513-MCE-DB (\"\n   <em>\n    SCAP I\n   </em>\n   \"). Plaintiffs filed that action seeking to overturn the ATP approval and to obtain a permanent injunction preventing the EPA from mandating use of the two-concentration TST.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   First Am. Compl., ECF No. 15, Prayer for Relief \u00b6 E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 11, 2015, however, just before Defendants' Reply to its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment was due, the EPA withdrew its ATP approval of the two-concentration TST testing method \"effective immediately.\" Because of that withdrawal, the Court determined the case to be moot on May 15, 2015, granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, denied Plaintiffs' own motion and entered judgment in favor of Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Memorandum and Order, ECF No. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs contend, however, that despite having withdrawn the ATP, the EPA continued to use, require the use, or approve the use of the TST as a statistical procedure. On March 6, 2015, for example, the EPA issued a NPDES Permit and accompanying Fact Sheet for the Guam Waterworks Authority requiring use of the TST statistical approach. The Fact Sheet stated that \"[t]he permit includes new WET requirements based on EPA's [2010 TST Guidance]\" as a permit requirement. Additionally, in June of that same year, the EPA issued NPDES Permit No. 0084280 for Table Mountain Rancheria Wastewater Treatment Plant, which required use of the TST and indicated that \"[t]his discharge is subject to a determination of 'Pass' or 'Fail' from a single-effluent concentration chronic toxicity test.\" Finally, according to Plaintiffs, on February 2, 2017, the EPA issued NPDES Permit No. CA0109991 for Hyperion Treatment Plant. That permit likewise required the use of the TST and indicated that \"[t]his discharge is subject to a determination of 'Pass' or 'Fail' from a single-effluent concentration chronic toxicity test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In keeping with the foregoing, EPA has also purportedly informed state-permitting authorities that the use of the TST as set forth in the 2010 TST Guidance is a \"requirement\" in at least some permits that involve WET testing. On March 18, 2015, EPA issued an NPDES Permit Quality Review, State of Hawaii, providing that \"[t]he State has made significant improvements in permit quality over the last few years as permit practices have changed from...requiring only monitoring requirements in some case for chronic toxicity, to including chronic toxicity limits based on the...TST.\" The Quality Review also refers to use of the TST as a requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That same day, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, revised the Water Discharge Requirements for Continental Maritime of San Diego in Order R9-2015-0009 to require use of the TST and \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" discharge determinations based, at least in part, on the 2010 TST Guidance. This Regional Water Quality Control Board purportedly adopted those requirements because it believed use of the TST was required by the EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Just over a month later, on April 9, 2015, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region, revised the NPDES permit for the Joint Outfall System, Order R4-2015-0070, for the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant, to continue requiring the TST and \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" discharge requirements based on the 2010 TST Guidance. This Regional Board, like the last, also purportedly believed that use of the TST was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsequently, on May 7, 2015, the EPA's Becky Mitschele informed Cassandra Owens of the State Water Board in an email that \"[all] NPDES effluent compliance monitoring for chronic toxicity shall be reported using the 100% effluent concentration and negative control, expressed in unites of USEPA's TST statistical approach (pass or fail, % effect). The TST hypothesis (Ho) is statistically analyzed using only the permit-specified in-stream waste concentration and a negative control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The following week, on May 13, 2015, State Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, issued an NPDES permit, Order No. R9-2015-0002, for the Padre Dam Municipal Water District, which required use of the TST method based on the 2010 TST Guidance. Again, this regional district is believed to have thought the EPA required use of the TST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the EPA has repeatedly taken the position that despite withdrawal of the ATP, the state may still\n   require use of the TST and the state has continued to include such requirements in its permits believing they are mandated. After the termination of\n   <em>\n    SCAP I\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs thus initiated this action, now proceeding on the FAC, through which they seek to enjoin approval and/or use of the TST or non-promulgated procedures and methods for NPDES toxicity compliance determinations. Presently before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the FAC in its entirety on the basis that: (1) to the extent Plaintiffs' claims are a re-packaged version of an attack on the 2010 TST Guidance they are time-barred; (2) Plaintiffs' attacks on the various NPDES permits do not belong in this Court; and (3) regardless, Plaintiffs have failed to identify any final agency actions over which this Court would have jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704, 706.

It is clear from the FAC and Plaintiffs' opposition that despite their assertions to the contrary they fundamentally take procedural issue with the EPA's failure to formally promulgate the 2010 TST Guidance pursuant to notice-and-comment requirements. The six-year statute of limitations applicable to that claim, which is itself already lengthy, ran in June 2016, and the instant action was not filed until December of that year. Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs challenge the 2010 TST Guidance itself, their claims must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In an attempt to save the FAC, Plaintiffs nonetheless argue that the statute did not begin to run until July 2012 when the EPA purportedly began treating the 2010 TST Guidance as a rule. First, that argument is contrary to the case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727158\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/177/1126/#p1129\">\n    177 F.3d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"Under well-settled circuit authority, a cause of action challenging procedural errors in the promulgation of regulations accrues on\n   the issuance of the rule.\");\n   <em>\n    Shiny Rock Mining Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1812417\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/906/1362/#p1364\">\n    906 F.2d 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1364-66 (9th Cir. 1990). To the extent actual or constructive knowledge is a necessary condition precedent to the commencement of the statutory period, Plaintiffs do not allege in the FAC that they were unaware of the 2010 TST Guidance when it was issued or that they somehow lacked the requisite notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shiny Rock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1812417\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/906/1362/#p1364\">\n    906 F.2d at 1364-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs' argument that the 2010 TST Guidance is being applied in some new and unforeseen way is also not supported by the allegations in the FAC. Plaintiffs have taken the position here that no alternative statistical approaches may be employed unless formally promulgated. But that is exactly why the 2010 TST Guidance was issued (i.e., to provide a basis for implementing the TST approach in NPDES permits). If only promulgated approaches were permitted then there would be no justification for issuing the 2010 TST Guidance in the first place and no reason not to immediately challenge its endorsement of an unpromulgated procedure. Accordingly, based on the allegations in the FAC, Plaintiffs were on notice at the time the 2010 TST Guidance was issued such that they could have raised the instant claims at that time, and there is no reason alleged as to why they needed to wait until the Guidance was actually applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have not shown that the statute of limitations applicable to their instant claims should be equitably tolled. In order to meet their burden, Plaintiffs must establish: \"(1) that [they were] pursuing [their] rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in [their] way.\"\n   <em>\n    Pace v.

The problem with this argument is that Plaintiffs did not plead such a claim in their First Amended Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs of course attempt to argue to the contrary, reasoning that \"[b]ecause of a grave concern that [permits might still issue even if the ATP approval was withdrawn], Plaintiffs raised in their Complaint the issue of the 2010 TST guidance documents being used as a regulation before being properly incorporated into the applicable regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing FAC, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 22, 30, 31, 32 and 34). Plaintiffs would thus have the Court conclude that \"even outside of the issue of the approval of the ATP, Plaintiffs adequately pled the issue of the use of the TST guidance to set effluent limitations\n   and monitoring requirements in...NPDES...permits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Not so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Throughout this entire case, through both complaints, through briefing on Plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief, through briefing on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, and even most of the way through the original briefing on Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration, the only issue Plaintiffs raised was the EPA's approval of the ATP. It was not until Plaintiffs filed their Reply to their Motion for Reconsideration that they switched gears. Before then, Plaintiffs never argued that Defendants were impermissibly relying on guidance documents to justify decisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Indeed, Plaintiffs gave the 2010 TST guidance documents barely a mention in the FAC. For example, while Plaintiffs do cite the documents in the \"Legal Background\" section of their pleading, it is clearly by way of background only, to show that because Defendants could not rely on the guidance as a regulation, they concocted the challenged ATP strategy instead. Moreover, the guidance documents were not referenced at all in the \"Factual Background\" pertaining to the instant action, and all of the claims for relief focused only on ATP approval. There is simply no plausible reading of the FAC that supports the conclusion that Plaintiffs were challenging anything other than the EPA's actions in approving the ATP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties' course of conduct also makes clear that neither side believed Plaintiffs were challenging Defendants' reliance on guidance documents as opposed to the ATP approval. Throughout extensive briefing on multiple issues, the guidance documents were never raised as a basis for Plaintiffs' requested relief. Nor did Plaintiffs include any claim based on the guidance documents in the parties' joint status report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   This makes sense because throughout this case, the permits were being issued pursuant to the ATP. There was no reason to challenge the EPA's reliance on the guidance documents because those documents were not being used to justify issuing permits. Indeed, even if Plaintiffs had wanted to raise such a challenge in their FAC, any such claim would have been speculative and unripe at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Because Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege a claim challenging Defendants' reliance on the 2010 TST guidance documents, they cannot pursue that claim now. It was simply too late to pursue a new claim once summary judgment had been granted and the parties had reached the tail end of briefing on Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v.
