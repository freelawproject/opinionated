(Docs. 32, 39). Defendant Northfield Insurance Company (\"Northfield\") moved for summary judgment (Doc. 32), Plaintiff Rockhill Insurance Company (\"Rockhill\") filed an amended Response (Doc. 42), and Northfield replied (Doc. 45). Rockhill also moved for summary judgment (Doc. 39), Northfield responded (Doc. 46), Rockhill replied (Doc. 49), and Northfield filed a sur-reply (Doc. 52). On October 13, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the motions, the record of which is incorporated herein. (Doc. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute between insurance companies concerns coverage priority in relation to the settlement of a wrongful death suit. On November 10, 2010, Leroy McDonald was shot and killed in the Briar Oaks at Oakleaf Plantation townhome community (\"the Community\") (Doc. 39-1), which is overseen by the Briar Oaks at Oakleaf Plantation Townhomes Owners' Association, Inc. (\"Briar Oaks\"). (Doc. 11). On June 1, 2007, First Coast Association Management, LLC (\"First Coast\") entered into a contract with Briar Oaks to manage the Community. (Doc. 39-6). This contract was in effect on November 10, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 10, 2010, Briar Oaks had insurance coverage through Rockhill (Doc. 39-4), and First Coast had insurance coverage through Northfield (Doc. 39-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, Latasha McDonald, as the personal representative of the Estate of Leroy McDonald, filed a wrongful death action against First Coast and Briar Oaks (\"Underlying Action\"). (Doc. 11). In 2015, a jury trial returned a verdict in favor of McDonald for $2,658,852, with First Coast and Briar Oaks jointly and severally liable for 70% and Briar Oaks solely liable for 30%. (Doc 39-2). Subsequently, the parties agreed to a settlement, paying Leroy McDonald's Estate $2,790,000, divided among three insurers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 39-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 30, 2016, Rockhill filed its First Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") (Doc. 11), seeking a declaratory judgment determining the priority of coverage for the Underlying Action, judgment to recover fees and costs incurred in the Underlying Action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and costs. (Doc. 11 at 4). Northfield filed an answer and counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment, attorney's fees, and costs. (Docs. 11, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Rockhill Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rockhill issued businessowners' policy THB001324-01 to Briar Oaks, providing both first party property coverage and business liability coverage. (Doc. 39 at 3). Section I of the policy explains the coverage for first party property, Section II explains the coverage for business liability, and Section III contains policy conditions common to Sections I and II. (Doc. 39 at 3). The policy also contains multiple amendments, endorsements, exclusions, and limitations in separate forms. (Doc. 39-4). The coverage provides up to $1 million per occurrence as part of its liability and medical expense limit. (Doc. 39-4 at 4). First Coast is an omnibus insured under the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 39-4 at 56). Section III of the policy contains an \"other insurance\" provision, making the coverage excess over other insurance in certain situations. (Doc. 39-4 at 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Northfield Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Northfield issued First Coast a commercial policy numbered WS023188 that contains a liability limit of $1 million per occurrence. (Doc. 32 at 7). First Coast is the sole named insured under the Northfield policy, and the parties agree that Briar Oaks is not insured under that policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 39 at 6). The Northfield policy also contains an \"other insurance\" provision, a combination endorsement to the \"other insurance\" provision, and a second endorsement. The \"other insurance\" provision, as modified by the combination endorsement, provides that the policy is excess over other valid and collectible insurance in certain situations. This combination endorsement further states that if excess, Northfield has no duty to defend the insured in any suit if another insurer has such a duty, and that Northfield will only pay the amount that exceeds the other insurance coverage and deductibles. (Doc. 39-5 at 28, 39-40). The second endorsement makes the coverage excess when the liability arises from First Coast's activities as a property manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

When the Complaint and Answer and Counterclaims were filed, the Underlying Action had not yet settled. However, on January 11, 2017, the parties settled the Underlying Action.

Ga. 2016), expressed concern that it may not have jurisdiction to provide declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties, at the request of the Court, submitted a joint brief responding to the Court's concerns. (Doc. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In their Joint Brief on Jurisdiction and Notice Regarding Settlement, the parties provide two reasons why this Court has jurisdiction. (Doc. 56). First, the settlement agreement did not destroy jurisdiction to provide declaratory relief because the settlement reserves the parties' rights to maintain this action. (Doc. 56 at 1-5). The second reason is that the complaint could be liberally construed to include a claim for equitable contribution over which the Court maintains jurisdiction. (Doc. 56 at 5-6). Although the Complaint was unartfully drafted-containing no counts, and titled \"Plaintiff's Amended Complaint for Declaratory Relief\"-the \"wherefore\" clause contains several requests for relief, at least one of which can be construed as an equitable contribution claim. (Doc. 11 at 4). As the Court agrees that the Complaint could be interpreted to include a claim for equitable contribution and that the parties have a concrete dispute regarding coverage, it retains jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The \"Other Insurance\" Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This dispute concerns the interpretation of \"other insurance\" provisions in the Rockhill and Northfield policies, both of which cover First Coast. Rockhill alleges that both insurance policies are co-primary because they each contain \"other insurance\" provisions that attempt to make the policy excess to any other coverage to which the insured is entitled. (Doc. 39 at 9). Northfield alleges that Rockhill's \"other insurance\" provision does not apply and that Northfield's policy is excess over Rockhill's policy. (Doc. 32 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Florida, \"where two or more policies that apparently cover the same loss both contain excess 'other insurance' provisions, the clauses are deemed 'mutually repugnant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Keenan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760650\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/653/1255/#p1263\">\n    653 F.Supp.2d at 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the excess \"other insurance\" provisions cancel each other out, each insurer is liable for a pro rata share in accordance with their policy coverage limits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1263-64. Thus, the Court must consider whether the \"other insurance\" provisions in both the Rockhill and Northfield policies apply to the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Northfield's \"other insurance\" provision makes its coverage excess.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Northfield policy's \"other insurance\" provisions apply to First Coast vis-a-vis the Underlying Action. (Doc. 32 at 9; Doc. 39 at 13). Northfield's \"other insurance\" provision, as modified by the combination endorsement, states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Other Insurance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If other valid and collectible other insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as described in Paragraphs\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n   below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   As used anywhere in this Coverage Part, other insurance means insurance, or the funding of losses, that is provided by, through or on behalf of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   Another insurance company;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other\n   insurance by the method described in Paragraph\n   <strong>\n    c.\n   </strong>\n   below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

First Coast is an omnibus insured under Rockhill's insurance policy. (Doc. 39 at 4). Therefore, First Coast is an insured that is not a named insured under the Rockhill policy-meaning that Northfield's excess \"other insurance\" combination endorsement applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Additionally, Northfield's policy contains a \"Real Estate Property Managed\" endorsement that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    REAL ESTATE PROPERTY MANAGED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   With respect to your liability arising out of your management of property for which you are acting as real estate manager this insurance is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Doc. 39-5 at 61). The liability from the Underlying Action arose from First Coast's management of the Community. Therefore, the Real Estate Property Managed endorsement applies, making the Northfield policy excess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Rockhill contends that these two endorsements are \"inconsistent\" and \"irreconcilable\" and should cancel each other out. (Doc. 39 at 15). However, both provisions can be given operative effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trailer Bridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20F.3d%201135\">\n    657 F.3d at 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the provisions may sometimes overlap, they are separate and independently operable means of limiting coverage to excess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tudor Ins. Co. v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419092\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/274/1278/#p1286\">\n    274 F.Supp.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1286-87 (N.D. Fla. 2017). Therefore, Northfield's policy contains \"other insurance\" provisions that are applicable to its coverage for the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    2. Rockhill's \"other insurance\" provision does not apply to the Underlying Action.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rockhill's \"other insurance\" provision has three subsections. (Doc. 11-1 at 63). This provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION III-COMMON POLICY CONDITIONS (APPLICABLE TO SECTION I-PROPERTY AND SECTION II-LIABILITY)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

But we will not pay more than the applicable Limit of Insurance of\n   <strong>\n    Section I-Property.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   Business Liability Coverage is excess over:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   a. Any other insurance that insures for direct physical loss or damage; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   b. Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which\n   you have been added as an additional insured by attachment or endorsement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Doc. 39-4 at 63) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rockhill asserts that subsection H(1) is broad, covering any \"loss or damage,\" and should not be constrained by the final sentence that arguably limits its applicability to the Property section of the policy. (Doc. 42 at 8). Northfield says that the final sentence of H(1) limits that subsection only to situations involving property damage. (Doc. 46 at 6). As the Underlying Action did not involve property damage, if Northfield is correct, H(1) would not apply to the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Rockhill's policy contains two coverage sections: \"Section I-Property\" and \"Section II-Business Liability.\" (Doc. 11-1). The \"other insurance\" provision also has two sections that explain when coverage is excess; subsection H(1) references Section I-Property, and subsection H(2) refers to Business Liability. (Doc. 11-1 at 63). Throughout the policy, \"Section I-Property\" and \"Section II-Liability\" are used to refer back to those specific coverage sections-the \"other insurance\" provision should be treated no differently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intervest Const. of Jax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6948029\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/133/494/#p498\">\n    133 So.3d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that provisions of an insurance contract should be read\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   ); (Doc. 11-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Thus, Rockhill's broad reading of subsection H(1) fails to give meaning to the final sentence that (albeit awkwardly) limits the excess provision to \"Section I-Property\" claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trailer Bridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20F.3d%201135\">\n    657 F.3d at 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that every provision should be given \"its full meaning and operative effect\").

Although Rockhill's subsection H(1) contained the same first sentence as the provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    W9/PHC\n   </em>\n   , the second sentence in that case did not limit itself to property claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W9/PHC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893943\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/407/177/\">\n    970 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   395 ; (Doc. 11-1 at 63).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   H(1) does not apply to the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, Rockhill asserts that subsection H(2) also makes its policy excess vis-a-vis the Underlying Action. (Doc. 39 at 11). Subsection H(2) of the \"other insurance\" provision contains parts (a) and (b) that stipulate when Business Liability Coverage is excess. (Doc. 11-1 at 63). The policy defines Business Liability Coverage as those sums that Rockhill \"becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury,' 'property damage' or 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.\" (Doc. 11-1 at 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Rockhill does not argue that H(2)(b) applies to this case. As to H(2)(a), Rockhill says that \"damage\" should be separated from the clause \"direct physical loss\" to allow a reading that covers more than just property liability. (Doc. 39 at 11-12). Northfield claims that the phrase \"direct physical loss or damage\" unambiguously refers to first party property insurance. (Doc. 46 at 8). Under this view, \"direct physical\" modifies both \"loss\" and \"damage\" and only refers to property loss or damage. (Doc. 46 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The phrase \"direct physical loss or damage\" is not a defined term in the policy and must be given its common meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pac.

In\n   <em>\n    North Pacific\n   </em>\n   , North Pacific Insurance Company sued Travelers for the costs of defending and indemnifying a common insured in an underlying personal injury suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.

The\n   <em>\n    North Pacific\n   </em>\n   court held that the phrase \"direct physical loss or damage\" applied to property damage and not monetary damages.\n   <em>\n    N.

The court based its decision on the distinction between \"damage\" and \"damages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2069819\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The North Pacific policy differentiates between \"damages\" and \"damage\" throughout the policy. Notably, the policy uses \"damages\" in the liability coverage section and \"damage\" in the property coverage section. The policy provides liability coverage for \"\n   <em>\n    sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\n   </em>\n   because of 'bodily injury,' 'property damage' or 'personal and advertising injury.' \" Meanwhile, the policy provides property coverage for \"\n   <em>\n    direct physical loss of or damage\n   </em>\n   to Covered Property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on this language, \"damages\" has a different meaning than \"damage\" in the North Pacific policy. \"Damages\" refers to money owed to a plaintiff because of an injury or harm, while \"damage\" refers to injury to property. As noted above, Clause H.2(a) pertains to \"direct physical loss or damage\" rather than \"damages.\" Clause H.2(a) therefore applies to property coverage, which is not at issue in this case. For these reasons, the Court concludes Clause H.2(a) is not applicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2069819\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Rockhill's policy also uses the term \"damage\" exclusively throughout its Property coverage section and the term \"damages\" in its Business Liability coverage section. (Doc. 11-1). A closer examination reveals that the phrase \"direct physical loss or damage\" appears more than twenty times in Section I-Property, but is not included in Section II-Liability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 11-1). Rockhill urges an expansive reading because, unlike elsewhere in the policy, the phrase \"direct physical loss or damage\" in H(2)(a) is not subsequently limited. (Doc. 11-1 at 12). However, Rockhill's examples undermine its argument, as each demonstrates that \"direct physical loss or damage\" refers to property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2069819\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, since an excess \"other insurance\" provision limits when the insurer provides coverage, it should be interpreted to \"provide the greatest extent of coverage\" and thus given its natural limited reading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keenan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760650\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/653/1255/#p1263\">\n    653 F.Supp.2d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court holds that Rockhill's \"other insurance\" provision does not apply to the Underlying Action. Northfield's \"other insurance\" provision does apply to the Underlying Action. Therefore, the Northfield policy is excess over the Rockhill policy. Because this ruling is case dispositive, the\n   Court does not address the parties' other arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   1.
