The cross-motions for summary judgment have been fully briefed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 48, 60, 66, 71, 73 and 74. Also before the Court is the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike filed on May 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 70. The Defendants filed a response in opposition to the motion on May 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 80. The Plaintiffs filed a reply on June 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 81. For the reasons set forth below, the Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is granted, the Defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied, and the Plaintiffs' motion to strike is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Missouri Basin Well Service, Inc. d/b/a MBI Energy Services (\"MBI\") is a fluid management logistics and well-intervention provider that was founded in North Dakota in 1979. In 2011, MBI acquired High Plains, Inc. (\"HPI\"), also a North Dakota corporation. In June 2016, HPI officially merged with MBI. During the relevant time period, MBI and HPI served the Williston Basin and Rocky Mountain regions providing well-intervention services for their oil company customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiffs were employed by Defendants as wireline operators. The Plaintiffs provided oil and gas well perforation services to the Defendants' customers in the oil and gas industry. The Defendants paid members of their wireline crews a base hourly rate plus overtime at one-and-one-half times the base hourly rate for hours worked over forty hours in a workweek. The Plaintiffs regularly worked in excess of 40 hours per week. The Plaintiffs also received bonuses that were not included in the regular rate used to calculate overtime. Bonuses were paid if the job was performed satisfactorily and with no safety issues. The bonuses, which are sometimes referred to as commissions, were calculated based on a percentage rate each individual operator received times the revenue they produced while on duty at a job site, as set forth on a job ticket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wireline operators were classified into two different crews: a pump down crew or a service/day job crew. The Plaintiffs primarily worked on pump down crews. A pump down crew typically consisted of three to four operators working under the supervision of one engineer. The crew drove the necessary vehicles to the job site. The Plaintiffs' job included the use of a fleet of pickup trucks, wireline trucks (also referred to as loggers), cranes, and associated equipment for completions, logging, pipe recovery, and related cased-hold e-line services. Except for the pickup\n   trucks, most of these vehicles weighed more than 10,000 pounds. The wireline operators were required to maintain a commercial drivers license. The engineer was usually assigned a pickup which was used for many purposes, including transporting the crew to and from the job site at the beginning and end of each shift. One or two pickups trucks would be assigned to each job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiffs loaded and drove pickup trucks as part of their job duties, including to and from drilling locations. The Defendants kept no record of which vehicles were driven by which Plaintiffs or when. The Plaintiffs' job duties also included regularly making hotshot runs with pickup trucks running a tool or supplies to an oil site where a crew was working so that the crew could continue the job. Other job duties included driving pickup trucks to pick up parts, taking the pickups to get serviced and/or to get windshields put in, and transferring the vehicles from one of the Defendants' yards to another. The majority of the pickup trucks in the Defendants' fleet have a gross vehicle weight rating (\"GVWR\") of 10,000 pounds or less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 60-3. Because the Plaintiffs' work involved the use of vehicles which weighed 10,000 pounds or less as well as vehicles which weighed more than 10,000 pounds, their work is often referred to as \"mixed fleet\" operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Defendants paid the Plaintiffs overtime at a rate of one-and-one-half the regular hourly rate, but excluded bonuses in calculating the hourly rate. The Plaintiffs contend the Defendants violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and the North Dakota Administrative Code by failing to include bonuses in calculating the regular rates of pay used to calculate overtime premiums. The Defendants claim the Plaintiffs were exempt from the FLSA overtime requirements based on the Motor Carrier Act (\"MCA\") exemption. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the FLSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, indicates that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Davison v.

It is undisputed the Defendants are motor private carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation and the Plaintiffs are or were employed by the Defendants. It is also undisputed the\n   Plaintiffs performed duties as drivers or loaders and those duties affected the safety of operation of motor vehicles in interstate travel. There is also no dispute the Plaintiffs performed duties on a \"mixed fleet,\" that being a fleet consisting of both small and large vehicles. For TCA purposes, small vehicles are those weighing 10,000 pounds or less, and large vehicles are those weighing more than 10,000 pounds. The weight of a particular vehicle is determined by reference to its gross vehicle weight rating (\"GVWR\").\n   <em>\n    McCall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065619\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/962/#p966\">\n    723 F.3d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Steffan references a report by the law firm but the Defendants have not made the report a part of the record.

Accordingly, the Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 47) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , the Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment (Docket No. 59) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , the Plaintiffs' motion to strike (Docket No. 70) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot, the Defendants' motion for decertification (Docket No. 61) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and the motions for a hearing (Docket Nos. 62 and 63) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
