Furthermore, a Rule 24(c) pleading is even less critical where, as here, the Committee is seeking to intervene to assert its rights under Section 1109(b), and does not assert ownership of a claim or defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adelphia Commc'ns Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173987\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/848/\">\n    285 B.R. 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 n.18 (Bankr.

For example, but without limitation, the UCC has made it clear that it is seeking to have more funds available for unsecured, as opposed to secured, creditors, and that funds should not be \"diverted away\" from the Debtors. Supplemental Brief \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9. Moreover, the UCC has asserted that it is seeking to intervene because it \"cannot satisfy [its] statutory supervisory and oversight obligations from a distance, and section 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code is one of the tools created by Congress through which the Committee may exercise its watchdog functions.\" Motion \u00b6 3. The UCC's position on specific issues that may arise during the course of this proceeding can be developed in the specific pleadings it files. For present purposes, no additional description of the UCC's interest in this adversary proceeding is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Plaintiffs are not presently challenging the Committee's Constitutional standing to appear in this case generally, but [Plaintiffs argue that] the Committee still must demonstrate that it has standing on each claim and issue it seeks to address.\" Plaintiffs' Response at 2. Similarly, the Defendants caution that while the UCC \"has section 1109(b) standing as a party in interest to appear and be heard, it lacks constitutional and prudential standing of a party to control any of the issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants' Response at 4. However, the UCC's intervention is limited to its rights under Section 1109(b), and it has not requested, and is not being permitted, to intervene to control any of the issues. If the UCC seeks to exceed the scope of its permissible intervention, the opposing parties may raise their objections at the appropriate time. For present purposes, however, the UCC has standing to intervene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Applied Theory Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511674,1090983\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/82/\">\n    493 F.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85-86 (2d Cir. 2007) (the UCC was authorized under \u00a7 1109(b) to raise, appear and be heard on any issue, although it was not authorized to assert a claim absent a direct interest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Limitation Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The fact that \"the [Committee] is entitled to participate in the district court proceedings does not, of course, dictate the scope of that participation.\"\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269818,12263653\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/57/\">\n    872 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   64 (citing\n   <em>\n    Adelphia Commc'ns Corp. v.

This Court has the discretion to tailor intervention as needed to ensure the rights of the respective parties and the efficiency of the litigation. \"[C]ourts are not faced with an all-or-nothing choice between grant or denial: Rule 24 also provides for limited-in-scope intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Intervention of right, whether obtained, as here, through Section 1109(b) or more generally through Rule 24, \"may be subject to appropriate conditions or restrictions responsive among other things to the requirements of efficient conduct of the proceedings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, advisory committee's note, 1966 amendment. Moreover, \"a distinction can be drawn between the right to intervene in an adversary proceeding, to which [the Committee is] plainly entitled, and the right to take ownership of the debtor's claims in that adversary proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Smart World Techs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8922249,8925062\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/166/\">\n    423 F.3d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (2nd Cir. 2005). Finally, \"[l]imited intervention is particularly appropriate [where] ... getting all interested parties to the table promotes an effective and fair solution, but preventing an expansion of the scope is necessary to keep control of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556160\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/925/#p931\">\n    712 F.3d at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the First Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]hese competing concerns are particularly poignant in the present case, which represents the largest proceeding to restructure debt in the history of the American municipal bond market.\"\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269818,12263653\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/57/\">\n    872 F.3d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted). Bearing in mind these considerations, this Court modifies the scope of the Committee's proposed intervention as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Discovery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Right to Receive Discovery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Committee requests to receive \"all discovery taken to date ... within seven (7) calendar days of the date of this Order\" and all future discovery \"within seven (7) calendar days of the production of discovery, or the production of the transcript of a deposition, as the case may be, subject to execution of any relevant protective order.\" Proposed Order \u00b6 2. As no party opposes this proposal, and since the ability to receive and review discovery is consistent with the Committee's role under Section 1109(b) as well as its obligation to monitor the proceedings, it will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Depositions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Committee asks to attend any depositions subsequently taken in the Adversary Proceeding. Proposed Order \u00b6 2. No party opposes this request and this Court finds that the ability to attend depositions, like the ability to receive and review discovery, is consistent with the Committee's\n   role under Section 1109(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173987\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/848/\">\n    285 B.R. at 850-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs propose an instruction making clear that \"the Committee may not raise new claims or issues in the Adversary Proceeding.\" Plaintiffs' Response, Proposed Order, Dkt. No. 781.

This Court has already set certain requirements for extensive consultation between parties and for briefing guidelines in both the Third Amended Notice, Case Management and Administrative Procedures (No. 17-BK-3283, Dkt. No. 1512-1) and the Standing Order issued September 15, 2017 (No. 17-mc-00506-JGD, Dkt. No. 1). This Court finds no reason, at this time, to further limit briefing procedures in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Additionally, and as the Committee suggests, the right to be heard at argument will be subject to requirements that this Court may impose. As a result, the Committee shall move for leave from this Court prior to appearing at a particular argument. Plaintiffs request that when speaking in favor of the Defendants, \"the time allocated to the Committee shall count against the total time allocated to Defendants, and Plaintiffs shall be permitted to speak for as long as the Committee and Defendants combined.\" Plaintiffs' Response, Proposed Order \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs are entitled to move for such an instruction when the Committee moves to appear at oral argument. The Court, at this time, finds no reason to modify Defendants' allotted argument time. Defendants, as controllers of issues and claims in this case, should not be deprived of time to argue absent good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Right to Settle or Appeal Settlement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Committee, in its Motion, admits that it should \"\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   have the right to control, appeal or settle causes of action ....\" Motion \u00b6 8 (emphasis in original). However, in its Proposed Order, the Committee suggests that the ruling of this Court be \"without prejudice to any rights of the Committee to object to any settlement of the Adversary Proceeding, nor shall this Order restrict the Committee's standing, if any, to file appeals (including as an objector) relating to any settlement ....\" Proposed Order \u00b6 5.
