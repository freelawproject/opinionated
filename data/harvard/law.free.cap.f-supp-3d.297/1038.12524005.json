Given the shortage of district judges and staff, this Court addresses only the arguments, evidence, and matters necessary to reach the decision in this order. The parties and counsel are encouraged to contact the offices of United States Senators Feinstein and Harris to address this Court's inability to accommodate the parties and this action. The parties are required to reconsider consent to conduct all further proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, whose schedules are far more realistic and accommodating to parties than that of U.S. Chief District Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill, who must prioritize criminal and older civil cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Civil trials set before Chief Judge O'Neill trail until he becomes available and are subject to suspension mid-trial to accommodate criminal matters. Civil trials are no longer reset to a later date if Chief Judge O'Neill is unavailable on the original date set for trial. Moreover, this Court's Fresno Division randomly and without advance notice reassigns civil actions to U.S. District Judges throughout the nation to serve as visiting judges. In the absence of Magistrate Judge consent, this action is subject to reassignment to a U.S. District Judge from inside or outside the Eastern District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is an insurance coverage dispute between Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant RLI Insurance Company (\"RLI\") and Defendant/Counter-Claimant, City of Visalia (\"Visalia\") regarding coverage for claims asserted against Visalia in an action pending before a different judge in this district. RLI brought this action for declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2202 on September 7, 2017. (ECF No. 1). Visalia filed an answer along with a counter-claim for declaratory relief against RLI on September 29, 2017. (ECF No. 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties submit that there is jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1332(a)(1) and that venue is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 11, 2017, RLI filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) against Visalia. (ECF No. 12) (\"Motion\"). Visalia filed an opposition on October 25, 2017 (ECF No. 17) (\"Opp.\") and RLI filed a reply on November 1, 2017. (ECF No. 21) (\"Reply\"). While the motion for judgment was pending, Visalia requested to amend its answer and counter-claim. (ECF No. 19). The Court granted Visalia leave to amend and Visalia filed an amended answer and counter-claim on December 11, 2017. (ECF Nos. 29-31). The Court also allowed supplemental briefing on the limited issue of the impact of the amended pleading on the pending motion for judgment on the pleadings. (ECF Nos. 36-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   RLI and Visalia then filed supplemental briefs. (ECF Nos. 39 (\"Supp. Br.\"), 41 (\"Supp. Opp.\"), 42 (\"Supp. Reply\") ). The parties' briefs were also accompanied by multiple requests for judicial notice which are addressed below. (ECF Nos. 13 (\"RJN 1\"), 18 (\"RJN 2\"), 40 (\"RJN 3\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The issue presented on the Rule 12(c) motion is whether a policy exclusion contained in the RLI insurance policy precludes insurance coverage in an underlying litigation brought against Visalia as a matter of law. The Court finds it appropriate to rule on the motion without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 230(g). Having considered the parties' briefing and the relevant law, the Court issues the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND AND FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   RLI issued Policy No. R20040U, an umbrella liability insurance policy, to Visalia for the policy period March 8, 1978-1979 (\"RLI Policy\" or the \"Policy\"). (ECF No. 1, \"Compl.\" at \u00b6 10); (ECF No. 31, \"Am. Answer\" at \u00b6 1). The Policy was attached to RLI's Complaint and to the Amended Answer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy provides that RLI will indemnify Visalia for sums it is obligated to pay by reason of liability \"for damages, direct or consequential and expenses, all as more fully defined by the term 'ultimate net loss'\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on account of: (i) Personal injuries, including death at any time resulting therefrom, (ii) Property Damage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iii) Advertising liability, caused by or arising out of each occurrence\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   happening anywhere in the world.\" (ECF No. 1-1). Additionally, the Policy also provides that RLI must \"defend against any suit ... alleging such injury or destruction and seeking damages on account thereof, even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent,\" if such suit is not covered by underlying policies listed in an appended Schedule or by other underlying insurance, but covered by the\n   terms and conditions of the RLI Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The RLI Policy contains certain Policy exclusions. The Policy exclusion at issue here provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THIS POLICY IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIONS:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The policy shall not apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (f) as respects all operations,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) to the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, solids, liquids or gases, waste materials, or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water unless such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) for the cost of removing, nullifying or cleaning up substances described in (1) above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (ECF No. 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Policy is also subject to certain Policy conditions including a \"prior insurance non-cumulation of liability\" clause which provides that if any loss is covered in whole or in part under any other excess policy that is issued prior to the RLI Policy, the limit of liability under the Policy will be reduced by the amount due under the prior insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, the policy has an \"Other Insurance\" clause which provides that if other collectible insurance with any other insurer is available that covers a loss covered by the RLI Policy, the insurance afforded by the RLI Policy will be in excess of and shall not contribute to such other insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Visalia claims that it is entitled to insurance coverage under RLI's Policy for an underlying lawsuit where Visalia was sued,\n   <em>\n    Mission Linen Supply v. City of Visalia\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:15-cv-00672-AWI-EPG, filed in the U.S. District Court Eastern District of California (the \"Mission Linen Action\" or \"Underlying Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mission Linen Supply (\"Mission Linen\"), a corporation that operated a commercial laundry facility, including dry cleaning, sued Visalia in relation to environmental contamination at and around property Mission Linen owned. (ML Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). The Underlying Action arises under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). Mission Linen was identified by the Department of Toxic Substance Control (\"DTSC\") as a responsible party for contamination in soil and ground water at and around its property by chlorinated solvents, primarily tetrachloroethylene also known as perchloroethylene (\"PCE\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). On February 3, 2010, DTSC issued an Imminent and Substantial Endangerment Order (\"2010 ISE Order\") to Mission Linen indicating PCE is present in soil and groundwater at its property and required Mission Linen to \"perform response actions and activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Specifically, \"[t]he 2010 ISE Order requires [Mission Linen's] implementation of any appropriate removal actions, completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study, preparation of a Remedial Action Plan or Removal Action Workplan, preparation of a California Environmental Quality Act document, and Design and Implementation\n   of the remedial actions approved in the Remedial Action Plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). The Mission Linen Action presents ten causes of action against Visalia including state law-based claims for nuisance in various forms, dangerous condition of public property, claims for declaratory relief under state and federal law, equitable indemnity, and for cost recovery and allocation under CERCLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-115). The Mission Linen Action alleges that Visalia is liable for the environmental contamination (at least in part) due to Visalia's failure to maintain and repair its sewer system while accepting PCE for transport via the City's sewers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-25). More specifically, the Underlying Action alleges that the holes, cracks, and leaks in Visalia's sewer system and its failure to maintain and operate its sewers caused or contributed to the release of PCE resulting in the contamination of soil and groundwater at or around the Plaintiff's property since at least 1978. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 30-31). The Mission Linen Action correspondingly seeks damages pursuant to CERCLA for \"all response costs incurred, and to be incurred by [Mission Linen], in response to the alleged release of PCE and other hazardous substances, in and around the Plaintiffs Property, and the environment...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) permits a party to seek judgment on the pleadings \"after the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial.\" Fed.

RLI submits that the only material facts necessary to make this determination on its Motion is the RLI Policy and the complaint in the Mission Linen Action, neither of which Visalia dispute since both documents are attached to its answer. (Motion at 1). In response, Visalia has three arguments for why RLI is not entitled to judgment on the pleadings. First, Visalia argues that RLI's interpretation of section f(2) amounts to a \"fundamental overreading of the exclusion\" provided therein because both subparts (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   and (2) are qualified by the \"sudden and accidental\" exception that is contained in subpart (1). (Opp. at 1-2). Second, Visalia independently argues that even if RLI's interpretation of section f(2) were correct, RLI's Motion is \"predicated on the fundamentally erroneous premise\" that the Mission Linen Action only seeks \"recovery of the costs to clean up contamination.\" (Opp. at 3; 21-23). Visalia contends that the Mission Linen Action also seeks property damages and contains various causes of action, including for nuisance and dangerous condition to public property which go beyond the \"the cost of removing, nullifying or cleaning up substances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, Visalia argues that the affirmative defenses it has asserted preclude granting judgment on the pleadings.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7645992\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/1344/#p1346\">\n    107 F.3d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1346 (9th Cir. 1997) (applying California insurance law in diversity case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   RLI and Visalia interpret the subject policy exclusion under section f(2) differently. RLI contends that section f(2) is an absolute bar to coverage for any pollution cleanup costs with relation to \"smoke, vapors, soot, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, solids, liquids or gases, waste materials, or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants,\" i.e. the substances described in f(1). In contrast, Visalia argues that the conditional statement that is included in section f(1) which provides that the Policy does not apply to a dispersal of contaminants \"unless such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental\" is also applicable to reading f(2). Under such a reading of the exclusion in f(2), the cost of removing, nullifying, or cleaning up substances described in subpart (1) is precluded\n   <em>\n    unless the dispersal is sudden and accidental\n   </em>\n   . In support of its reading of subpart (2), Visalia makes a number of arguments. Visalia points to the history and intent of drafting such \"qualified\" pollution exclusions as intending to negate coverage for intentional polluters and encourage insureds to take precautions against long term conditions that may lead to pollution damages. Additionally, Visalia argues that reading subpart 2 as broader than subpart 1 would nullify the contracting intent of the parties and contravene common sense because RLI's broad reading \"would in essence eliminate the 'sudden and accidental' exception altogether since the 'property damage' remedies sought in connection with pollution losses necessarily involve 'removing nullifying or cleaning up' the pollution itself.\" (Opp. at 14). In support, Visalia points to other courts that have held that interpretation of pollution exclusion clauses must be read in the context of the entire policy. Lastly, Visalia argues that at a minimum, one reasonable interpretation of section f(2) is that it does not apply to exclude cleanup costs for sudden and accident dispersals. Correspondingly, Visalia contends it is ambiguous and any uncertainty in language of the contract must be construed against the insurer.

The plain terms of f(2) clearly excludes coverage for the \"cost of removing, nullifying or cleaning up substances\" irrespective of whether the dispersal of such substances was \"sudden and accidental.\" The Court respects the limitations to coverage that the parties contracted for as demonstrated by the written instrument which manifests the parties' mutual intention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Damages Sought In The Mission Linen Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Visalia additionally argues that even if RLI's interpretation of section f(2) is accepted, RLI still cannot show that the Policy exclusion precludes all coverage as a matter of law since the Mission Linen Action seeks other damages besides those \"costs of removing, nullifying or cleaning up substances\" which are precluded by subpart (2) of the Policy. (Opp. at 21-23). Visalia argues that \"the relief sought by plaintiff in the Mission Linen Action is not limited to CERCLA 'response costs' incurred in connection with the alleged discharges of pollution\" but that the action also seeks \"compensatory damages,\" \"incidental and consequential damages\" as well as \"attorneys' fees and costs\" and \"consultant fees.\" (Opp. at 22) (citing ML Compl., pg. 21:14-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In response, RLI argues that the only damages sought in the Mission Linen Action are CERCLA response costs associated with clean-up of contamination which is precluded by section f(2). (Reply 7-9). Accompanying RLI's motion for judgment was a request for judicial notice of an October 4, 2017 signed order by the court in the Mission Linen Action granting the stipulated request for voluntary dismissal of third through eighth causes of action without prejudice. (ECF No. 13, RJN 1, Ex. A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Correspondingly, RLI argues\n   that the \"various forms of nuisance and dangerous condition of public property raised in the City's Opposition are no longer at issue\" and that the remaining causes of action, \"[First, Second, Ninth and Tenth,] each similarly seek clean-up costs for the alleged pollution.\" (Reply at 8) (citing ML Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 52, 110, 114).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Visalia did not oppose the request for judicial notice of the order on dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Visalia appears to admit that CERCLA response costs are precluded by section f(2) if RLI's reading of the contract is accepted, as the Court has concluded is the clear and explicit reading. Instead, Visalia states that the Mission Linen Action additionally seeks other non-CERCLA damages which would not be precluded by section f(2). (Opp. at 22-23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without much elaboration, Visalia states that the dismissal of the third through eighth causes of actions does not affect damages allegations given the retention of the cause of action for indemnity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). Visalia further argues that even if the majority of damages sought in that complaint are \"response costs\" then RLI would still have a duty to defend (and indemnify) Visalia if there was \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   potential for liability under the policy\" and that RLI cannot show as a matter of law that all forms of recovery sought by Mission Linen Action are excluded by section f(2) of the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). The cases cited by Visalia in support of this argument deal specifically with the duty to defend and not the duty to indemnify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Visalia's argument concerning the potential for liability deals specifically with the duty to defend, the Court here addresses the broader scope of the law on the nature of this duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Duty to Defend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   It is a well-accepted rule that \"the carrier must defend a suit which\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   seeks damages within the coverage of the policy....\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

Therefore, there can be no doubt that RLI had no duty to defend insofar as plaintiff in the Underlying Action sought damages for the cost of removing, nullifying or cleaning up contaminating substances. Hence, the remaining issue is whether the remaining causes of action in the Mission Linen Action potentially implicate any other type of injury besides the cost of removing, nullifying or cleaning\n   up contaminating substances that are precluded under section f(2). The remaining causes of action after the voluntary dismissal are the first, second, ninth and tenth causes of action.

The ninth cause of action for equitable indemnity similarly seeks that Visalia \"indemnify and hold harmless [Mission Linen] from and against any and all response costs, arising out of, or relating in any way to the contamination at the Property.\" (ML Compl. \u00b6 110). The tenth cause of action for declaratory relief requests declaratory relief pursuant to CERCLA \u00a7 113(g)(2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2), and seeks Visalia's contribution for \"all necessary response costs and any other costs and attorneys' fees heretofore or hereafter incurred by Plaintiff in responding to the release or threatened release of PCE and other hazardous substances.\" (ML Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In sum, plaintiff in the Mission Linen Action seeks relief for response costs associated with the environmental contamination of the relevant property.

By the facts alleged in the complaint, Mission Linen seeks to recover all or part of the response costs associated with cleaning up the contamination caused by the dispersal of PCE.
