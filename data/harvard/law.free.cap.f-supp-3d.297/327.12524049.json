(\"Celestial\") and Hain BluePrint,\n   Inc. (\"BluePrint\") on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeking monetary and injunctive relief. He alleges that defendants, which manufacture and sell juice, have engaged in deceptive product labeling in violation of N.Y. General Business Law sections 349 and 350. Plaintiff also brings claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment based on the same alleged conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. In addition, defendants argue that the unjust enrichment claim must also be dismissed because it duplicates the other claims in the complaint. Finally, defendants argue that plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief. For the reasons discussed below, defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BluePrint-a wholly owned subsidiary of Celestial Group-manufactures personal-sized juices and sells them to third-party sellers and directly to consumers. First Amended Complaint \u00b6 3, ECF No. 11 (\"Compl.\"). The two BluePrint product lines at issue in this case are their \"BluePrint Cold Pressed\" juices and their \"BluePrint Organic\" juices (individually, the \"Cold-Pressed Line\" and the \"Organic Line\"; collectively, the \"Products\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 &amp; n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff bought two BluePrint beverages in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 93. First, he bought a juice from the Cold-Pressed Line for roughly $7.99 at a local store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. The front label said \"beet, apple, carrot, lemon, ginger\" and \"raw.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-91. The side label listed the ingredients (in order of weight\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) as \"organic apple, organic carrot, organic beet, filtered water, organic lemon and organic ginger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Plaintiff alleges that the label led him to believe that the product was cold-pressed and raw, and-because beet was listed first on the front label and because the beverage itself was red-that the drink was predominantly made of beet juice (allegedly the most expensive ingredient).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 91-92. Second, he purchased a juice from the Organic Line, titled \"Lemon Yay,\" for roughly $2.99 at a local store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. The back label stated that the beverage was \"crafted with cold pressed juice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff contends that he relied on these representations in purchasing both drinks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed the operative complaint in December 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The complaint brings claims for (1) deceptive commercial practices and false advertising in violation of N.Y. General Business Law sections 349 and 350,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-107, (2) fraudulent misrepresentation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-20, and (3) unjust enrichment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 121-22. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that labels would mislead a reasonable consumer and that he, in fact, was misled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-106. Further, he alleges that defendants had an affirmative duty to disclose that \"the Products were processed\" and that \"their definition of a raw product excludes products which are fresh.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110. Finally, he alleges that defendants improperly obtained profits that they must disgorge to the plaintiff and class members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed class is \"all consumers in all states who purchased any Products\n   bearing any of the actionable representations [described in the Complaint] ... during the statute of limitation periods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. According to plaintiff, the Products share some or all of the following characteristics, which he alleges are fraudulent and misleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, the Cold-Pressed Line uses the terms \"Cold Pressed Juice\" or \"Cold Pressed Juice Beverage\" on the front label.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Cold Pressed\" also appears on one of the side panels, under which it says that \"[t]he BluePrintMethod applies tons of hydraulic pressure to get the most out of our organic fruits and vegetables.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52; Request for Judicial Notice in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Class Action Compl., Ex. F, ECF No. 15-8 (\"Label Example\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Cold-Pressed Line uses the term \"raw\" on the front label, where it appears in a green circle that says \"raw and organic,\" Compl. \u00b6 65, and on the back label, which says that \"drinking raw juice\" helps maintain good health. Label Example. Third, the Cold-Pressed Line uses the term \"Manifreshto\" on the back label,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48, which is followed by \"the simple rules [BluePrint] live[s] by.\" Label Example. One of those rules is that \"[j]uice should never be cooked. Cooking juice reduces vitamins and live enzymes. Even 'flash' pasteurized means cooked.\" Compl. \u00b6 46; Label Example. Fourth, the Cold-Pressed Line includes a vertical list of ingredients on the front label in large, bold text. Compl. \u00b6 65; Label Example. The ingredients on the front label are not listed in the same order as they are on the side label. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66. For example, one juice says \"arugula kale apple romaine celery cucumber lemon ginger\" on the front label.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. On the side label, under the nutrition facts, it says: \"Ingredients: organic juice from: organic vegetables (organic romaine, organic celery, organic arugula, organic cucumbers, organic kale), organic apple, organic ginger, organic lemon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Label Example. Fifth, the Organic Line's back label says that it is \"crafted with cold pressed juice,\" which plaintiff alleges is impossible for a beverage containing only citrus juices. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-34, 68-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Cold-Pressed Line is made in the following way: First, the individual ingredients are \"cold-press[ed].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. \"Cold pressing\" means that several thousand pounds of pressure are applied to fruits and/or vegetables to extract their juice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. This is in contrast to the traditional \"centrifugal\" method, in which spinning blades reduce the produce to juice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The traditional method's spinning blades create heat that negatively affects the enzymatic and nutritional content of the end product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cold pressing avoids that effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Juice that is cold pressed has a shelf life of three to five days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. To extend that shelf life beyond five days, comply with federal regulation, and kill potential bacteria, BluePrint subjects the juice to an additional round of pressure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; Defs.' MTD 3-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This process\n   is called \"high pressure pascalization\" and it does not involve heat (unlike pasteurization, another method of preservation). Defs.' MTD 3-4. Once the juice has undergone this second round of pressure, it has a shelf life of six weeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' MTD 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to plaintiff, FDA regulations require that low-acid foods (i.e., those having a total pH of greater than 4.6) undergo heat processing. Compl. \u00b6 18. Many of defendants' juice ingredients have pHs over 4.6, including beets, arugula, and kale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Plaintiff alleges that defendants avoid the requirement for heat processing by acidifying their products with lemon juice until the total pH is 4.6 or less.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19-21 &amp; n.5, 35 (noting that each ingredients list contains \"organic juice from ... organic lemon\" or \"organic lemon juice\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, plaintiff states that lemon juice cannot be obtained through cold pressing, in part because doing so would lead to \"imprecise quantities\" of peel and peel oil in the juice, which would in turn affect the flavor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Once the lemon juice is extracted, plaintiff says, it is pasteurized to \"stabiliz[e]\" it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. According to plaintiff, \"[i]t is probable that defendants use lemon juice from third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2018, defendants filed their motion to dismiss. Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 15. They argue principally that the complaint fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Defendants also argue that plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim must be dismissed as duplicative of the other claims in the complaint. Defs.' MTD 15-16. According to defendants, an unjust enrichment claim is not available under New York law \"where it simply duplicates ... a conventional contract or tort claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Corsello v.

Lastly, defendants argue that plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief, because there is no danger that he will be deceived by defendants' alleged misrepresentations again in the future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. In addition, they move to dismiss plaintiff's request for injunctive relief for lack of standing. For the reasons discussed below, defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is granted in part and denied in part. Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's request for injunctive relief for lack of standing is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Lundy v.

In deciding defendants' motion to dismiss, the court must therefore accept the facts alleged in plaintiff's amended complaint as true.

First, the term \"cold pressed juice,\" he says, suggests to the consumer that cold pressing is the last step in the production process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Second, reasonable consumers are unaware of non-thermal processing methods, so when they read that the juice is \"raw,\" \"never heated,\" and \"never ... cooked,\" they understand that to mean the juice has never been processed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 54. The use of the word \"fresh\" (embedded in \"Manifreshto\") reinforces the impression that the product has not been processed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-50. Third, because consumers are unfamiliar with high pressure processing, they are likely to be confused and think that the references to \"pressure\" on the label refer to the initial cold pressing process, rather than the additional preservation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53. Comparing the Cold-Pressed Line to competitors' products compounds the confusion, plaintiff alleges. Defendants' juices are approximately two dollars more expensive than their competitors', which, plaintiff argues, falsely suggests that they are the superior product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. And the competitors' products say only \"cold pressed\" on their labels, rather than \"cold pressed juice,\" suggesting that that cold pressing is only an \"attribute\" of the competitors' products, but the definition of defendants' products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments, however, are unavailing. The label taken as a whole makes clear that the juice was subjected to pressure for food safety purposes. It states that \"BluePrint uses pressure instead of heat to keep our beverages raw and safe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 52; Label Example. This language is prominently displayed, in the same or similar size font as the other text on side labels. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 52; Label Example. Even accepting plaintiff's allegation that consumers are not generally aware of non-thermal processing methods, the Cold-Pressed Line labels clearly indicate that such methods exist. Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, a reasonable consumer would not conflate the two different rounds of pressure (the one that extracts the juice and the one that renders it shelf stable) and would understand that the juice had been subjected to pressure after the initial \"cold pressing\" step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, defendants' description of the juice as \"cold pressed\" is accurate. Plaintiff acknowledges that the components juice is cold pressed. Compl. \u00b6 9. \"Cold pressed\" does not cease to be a truthful moniker for the juice simply because there were subsequent steps in the juice's production process. Nor are the words \"raw\" or \"manifreshto\" misleading in this context. A reasonable consumer would understand raw to mean uncooked-unheated, in other words. And a reasonable consumer would understand \"manifreshto\" to be referring to BluePrint's general attitude towards juice-making, as is clearly explained by the text immediately following that term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48; Label Example.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments about the differences between BluePrint and its competitors are likewise unpersuasive. A reasonable consumer would not make the distinction plaintiff does between \"cold pressed\" and \"cold pressed juice.\" Nor does the difference in price between BluePrint's and its competitors' juices render the product misleading. In fact, the broader context of plaintiff's BluePrint purchases cuts against his claim. As plaintiff himself pleads, cold pressed juice that is not subject to subsequent processing is generally sold in stand-alone stores, for approximately ten to twelve dollars, and has a shelf life of only three to five days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. But plaintiff made his purchases from a local store (not alleged to be a specialty\n   store), for three to eight dollars, and received a product with an evidently longer shelf life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 93. A reasonable consumer in his situation would not have expected to receive an unprocessed cold-pressed juice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, plaintiff's claim under N.Y. General Business Law sections 349 and 350 regarding the Cold-Pressed Line may not proceed on the theory that the labels misleadingly create the impression that the juice was not processed after being cold pressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Lemon Juice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    (i) Cold-Pressed Line\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that the product labels are misleading because a reasonable consumer would understand them to mean that none of the ingredients in the juice has been subject to thermal processing.\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. According to plaintiff, lemon juice cannot be cold pressed and must undergo thermal processing to stabilize it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, 30. Defendants argue that this is \"rank speculation\" and \"flat-out false.\" Reply in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Class Action Compl. 8, ECF No. 17 (\"Defs.' Reply\"). Nevertheless, at the motion to dismiss stage, I must take the factual allegations pleaded in plaintiff's complaint as true. Plaintiff's statement that citrus juices must be subjected to thermal treatment is a factual statement. It may or may not be borne out, but I cannot discount it in deciding this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The labels on the Cold-Pressed Line state that the juice is \"never heated\" and \"not cooked,\" and that BluePrint \"uses pressure instead of heat\" to ensure food safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 46, 52. Assuming the lemon juice is actually heated, then these statements are misleading. Plaintiff's claim under N.Y. General Business Law sections 349 and 350 regarding the Cold-Pressed Line may therefore proceed under the heat-treated lemon juice theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) \"Crafted with Cold Pressed Juice\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, plaintiff alleges that the Organic Line, including the Lemon Yay juice that he purchased, is misleading because its labels say \"crafted with cold pressed juice.\" Compl. \u00b6 68.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to plaintiff, all of the juice in the Organic Line is citrus, which cannot be cold pressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Defendants respond that lemon juice\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be cold pressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 8-10. As I have stated above, however, I must accept plaintiff's factual allegations as true at this stage of the proceedings. Assuming citrus juices cannot be cold pressed, then the phrase \"crafted with cold pressed juice\" is misleading. A reasonable consumer would not know that citrus fruit cannot be cold pressed and would take the phrase \"crafted with cold pressed juice\" to mean that at least one of the ingredients in the Organic Line had been cold pressed. Plaintiff's claim under N.Y. General Business Law sections 349 and 350 regarding the Organic Line may therefore proceed under this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Predominance of Ingredients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that the front labels on three of the Cold-Pressed Line juices-those whose front labels list arugula, chard, and beet first, respectively-are misleading because they \"give the false impression [that] these more expensive ingredients are predominant.\" Compl. \u00b6 65. The beet juice that plaintiff purchased, for example, lists beet first on the front, but the ingredients list on the side label reveals that beet is only the third-most predominant ingredient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66. This is misleading, plaintiff says, in light of the fact that (1) the juices are expensive, suggesting that they contain more of the premium\n   ingredient(s) than the non-premium ingredients; (2) the juices do not have a product name-such as \"chard-flavored vegetable juice blend\"-that would highlight the fact that the premium ingredients are not the most predominant; and (3) the label and juice color correspond to the first-listed, premium ingredient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff's claim for deceptive practices and false advertising cannot survive on this theory. A reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances would not understand the front label to be listing the ingredients from most to least predominant. Consumers are accustomed to seeing a product's ingredients listed by weight under the nutrition facts-as they are here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' MTD 13; Label Example. The ingredient lists thus clarify-in exactly the spot consumers are trained to look-that the premium ingredients are not the most predominant ingredients. No reasonable consumer could have been misled in light of this clarifying language.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868029\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/739/#p741\">\n    714 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   742 ;\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225862\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/141/1032/#p1035\">\n    141 F.Supp.3d at 1035-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing complaint where product listed expensive ingredients on front label but cheaper ingredients predominated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
