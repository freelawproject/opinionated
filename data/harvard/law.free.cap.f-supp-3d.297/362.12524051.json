The Complaint alleges that Defendants violated the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by copying Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   comic book series in their\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   television series. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint on the ground that\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   is not substantially similar to\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   as a matter of law. As discussed below, Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Columbia Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055185\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/46/#p48\">\n    831 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (2d Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Amphoman\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff began developing the Amphoman character in 1989, and holds thirty-one related copyrights, the first of which he obtained in 1995. Between 2012 and 2013, Plaintiff self-published\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   as a nine-part comic book series. The comic books tell the story of Dr. Ulrius Joules, a marine biologist striving to cure his own rare form of terminal cancer. Dr. Joules also worries about the money he lost in the \"mortgage housing crisis,\" his expensive car loan payments, lack of a pension and the American healthcare system. He uses profane and sexually explicit language, often in Yiddish, throughout the comic books.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Joules lives in a condo in Fort Lauderdale. One day, he finds a green gem that fell from space. After Dr. Joules accidentally gets water on the gem, it magically fuses into Dr. Joules' forehead. Since then, whenever Dr. Joules gets wet, he transforms into Amphoman, an amphibious male superhero. Amphoman has a long powerful tongue and slippery skin. He can jump great distances, scale walls, swim at \"stupendous\" speed and is cured of cancer. Those superpowers and the freedom from cancer last only a few hours, after which Amphoman transforms back to Dr. Joules, until he gets wet again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Amphoman's gem contains the soul of a frog, which was placed there by an evil space king. Other gems that have landed in Fort Lauderdale also contain the souls of animals and each gem has its own trigger resulting in its own unique superpowers. For example, a gem with the soul of an electric eel endows its human host with electric energy depicted as lightning bolts. People who find these gems \"trigger\" them and transform into super-beings, usually villains, who cause mayhem across Fort Lauderdale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Amphoman saves the city by fighting these super-villains to return them to their human form, at which point he is able to dislodge and crush their gems. The super-villains include Black Bull, a male super-villain who wants to create an army of womanizers to \"teach girls that men are in charge,\" and Shadow Witch, the only female character. Amphoman is sometimes accompanied by Bleash, another super-hero who has learned to manipulate his gem's trigger and control his powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Steven Universe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants are the creators, distributors and copyright holders of the animated television series\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   , which first aired on Cartoon Network in 2013. The show, with scores of episodes, is still being produced and aired. It tells the story of a boy named Steven who lives with three \"Crystal Gem\" female guardians, Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst, in a magical temple in \"Beach City.\" Crystal Gems are anthropomorphic space rocks. Good Crystal Gems, like Steven's guardians, protect Earth from invasions by evil Crystal Gems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Steven is half Crystal Gem (on his mother's side) and half human (on his father's side). Crystal Gems have gemstones embedded in their bodies, symbolizing that the characters are Crystal Gems. Steven's pink gemstone is in his stomach. Crystal Gems have unique weapons that emanate from their gems, and Steven can summon a magical shield from his gemstone. While the gemstones occasionally glow, they are not the source of a Crystal Gem's magical powers; a Crystal Gem's superpowers are innate. For example, Steven can heal and engulf himself in a protective bubble, and Garnet can see into the future. Over time,\n   Steven learns to use his powers to help protect Earth from evil Crystal Gems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite having superpowers, Steven loves \"Cookie Cat\" ice-cream sandwiches and is passionate about arcade videogames. He hopes to fit in with Beach City's popular kids and scouts for potential playdates. During the course of their adventures, Steven and his Crystal Gem companions learn valuable life lessons; each\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   episode comes with a message. For example, one episode teaches that everyone is different and things come at one's own time. Another episode shows that pretending to be someone you are not will cause more harm than good. The show is also replete with musical-theater-like numbers; the characters sing, Steven plays the ukulele and the piano, and his father plays the guitar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Concept and Plot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The core similarity between\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   is that both employ characters associated with magical gems, but the two works use the concept in different ways. In\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   , gems are inanimate objects from space and contain the soul of an animal (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a frog). The gems are invasive; they fuse into the foreheads of the humans who find them and impart superpowers related to the animal whose soul is contained in the gem. Each gem has a particular trigger, which temporarily activates the gem's superpowers. Amphoman's gem is triggered by water, which transforms him into a half-man, half-frog superhero, whereas sunlight transforms Bleash into a half-man, half-hawk superhero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The gems cause most humans in whom they lodge to become malevolent super-villains. They cannot control their superpowers and cause destruction across Fort Lauderdale. Amphoman and his friend Bleash are exceptions; they have learned to control their powers and manipulate their gems' triggers. The gems seem to be a metaphor for the cancer that has infected Dr. Joules and for which he seeks a cure; they lodge in the bodies of their\n   human hosts, transforming them usually in destructive ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Most issues of\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   introduce a new gem-infected villain, whom Amphoman fights and overcomes to save Fort Lauderdale. He defeats the super-villains by removing and then crushing their gems, which is possible only when the super-villain transforms back to human form (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , their gem is not triggered). Even though Dr. Joules in human form cannot find a cure for his cancer, as superhero Amphoman, he overcomes and destroys the gems that infect others and make them villains. Mostly, the comic books follow the adventures of Amphoman, rather than the human life of Dr. Joules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   , Crystal Gems are anthropomorphic characters, not inanimate objects. Crystal Gems have magical powers that they wield of their own volition. Steven lives with three female Crystal Gems, and is half Crystal Gem on his mother's side. Crystal Gems' superpowers are permanent and require no trigger. Rather than being invasive and destructive, Crystal Gems are the heroines of\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plot of both works is similar in that the protagonists fight and defeat the villains.

He wears a tight green outfit and has a small green gem on his forehead. Steven wears jeans and a bright red shirt with a yellow star on it, and has a large, permanent, pink gem-where a typical belly button would be located-from which he yields his superpower shield. \"The bar for substantial similarity in a character is set quite high,\" and the similarity between Amphoman and Steven falls short of this standard.\n   <em>\n    Spielberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261701\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/748/200/#p208\">\n    748 F.Supp.2d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The differences in \"totality of ... attributes and traits\" are equally apparent between Steven Universe and Amphoman.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261701\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/748/200/#p208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Steven is a cheerful child who has childish interests like \"Cookie Cat\" ice-cream sandwiches and videogames.

Many of Steven's adventures with the Crystal Gems take place in dark mountainous regions or inside their home. In\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   , the scenes take place both inside and outside, but the outside scenes usually do not show a beach and instead depict grass and trees to indicate that the characters are outside. Also, Amphoman lives in a condo whereas Steven lives in a magical temple. The setting of the two works does not make them substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Overall Feel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The difference between the two works is starkest when analyzed at the macro level.

By contrast,\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   is an animated cartoon with scores of episodes, forty-nine of which were submitted on this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The differences in the themes and moods of the two works are palpable.\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   is designed for young children. It tells the optimistic and essentially happy story of a playful child, with some poignant moments. Steven goes on adventures with his Crystal Gem guardians and friends, and in each episode learns a valuable life lesson. Steven's is a coming of age story as he learns about his parents, learns to use his powers and to accept himself. The show is also dotted with musical comedy numbers, reflecting the happy mood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   By contrast,\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   is a dark series intended for adults. Dr. Joules is a sardonic marine biologist striving to cure his own terminal cancer. The comics contain sexual content and adult language, often in Yiddish. Amphoman assures his mother that he is not a \"fagala\" (a homophobic Yiddish slur), nor a \"nymphoman\" and explains that \"ho is a bad word.\" He warns his male friend Bleash, \"[j]ust don't kiss me-I will shoot mind you,\" and exclaims during a\n   fight, \"never thought I'd be putting my tongue on some guy.\" The comic refers to smartphones as iPutzs, and Amphoman complains about \"furcockt\" gems-Yiddish profanities. A woman asks Amphoman whether he is a \"nympho,\" at which point he asks her on a date. Amphoman refers to the super-villain Black Bull as a \"perv.\" No reasonable jury could conclude that\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   are substantially similar in overall feel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Purported Similarities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Complaint appends a list of sixty purported similarities between\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   in Exhibit B. Many of the similarities are too general to affect the analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Similarity # 2 (\"Universe gems come in different shapes\"); Similarity # 16 (\"Gem power can cause violence\"); Similarity # 22 (\"Universe gems fall from the sky\").\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272306\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/274/#p279\">\n    207 F.Supp.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiff's alleged similarities in orientation and camera angle-'left' facing and shot 'from the left'-fare no better, because they are so general ...\"). Other similarities listed in Exhibit B prove false upon examination of the works. For example, the following appear only in\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   , and not\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   : Similarity # 5 (\"Universe gems can be activated with a specific trigger event\"); Similarity # 19 (\"Universe gems pop off defeated gem bearers\"); Similarity # 13 (\"Universe gem contains the soul of once living being who is now trapped inside ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Three isolated similarities not included in Exhibit B are worth discussing, although they do not change the calculus. First, Pearl, one of Steven's Crystal Gem guardians, has a gemstone embedded in her forehead. While the location of Pearl's gemstone is reminiscent of\n   <em>\n    Amphoman's\n   </em>\n   characters, the similarity ends there. Crystal Gems all have permanent gems, but each is in a different place on their body. Pearl's gem happens to be on her forehead. In\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   , humans are not born with gems. When a human finds and \"triggers\" a gem, it implants in the character's forehead. A gem can be removed only when the character is in human form. Other than the location of her gem, Pearl is nothing like Amphoman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, in an eight-second scene in\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   , Steven is practicing shapeshifting and his tongue becomes extra-long. Steven does not use his extra-long tongue to fight or in any other way similar to Amphoman. Third, in a single episode of\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   , a character named Ringo steals a magical gemstone and places it in his hair, thereby gaining superpowers. Ringo becomes a larger and more colorful version of himself, and he shoots magical light beams from the gem in his hair. He is quickly defeated by actual Crystal Gems and returned to human form. Ringo never becomes part animal, nor does the gem actually fuse to his body. None of the isolated similarities between\n   <em>\n    Amphoman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Steven Universe\n   </em>\n   provides a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find substantial similarity between the works' \"total concept and overall feel.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920659\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/57/#p64\">\n    602 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff's request for leave to file an amended complaint is denied because the finding of a lack of substantial similarity turns on the works themselves and not on the artfulness or sufficiency of the pleading. \"Leave to amend should be 'freely give[n] ... when justice so requires,' Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), but should generally be denied in instances of futility....\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Ladas v.
