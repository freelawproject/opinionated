Plaintiff seeks damages for discrimination on the basis of his disability\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 151B, discrimination on the basis of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 151B, and hostile work environment in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 151B against former Upton town manager, Blythe Robinson, Plaintiff's former supervisor, James Gardner, and the town of Upton (the \"Town\"). The Town brings the instant motion to dismiss the state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Facts\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff worked for the Town as a maintenance worker and driver for the Upton Council on Aging (\"COA\") from 2006 to 2014, when he was terminated. He alleges that, beginning in 2010, Gardner discriminated against him because of his age and disability. For example, Plaintiff alleges that on a handful of times between February 2010 and March 2013, Gardner \"docked\" Plaintiff's pay resulting in a decrease of benefits and told Plaintiff that he would never be able to get another job because of his age. (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 32). Gardner's discriminatory conduct against Plaintiff continued until March 1, 2013, when Gardner stopped working for the Town. While Gardner was still employed by the Town, Plaintiff informed Robinson about Gardener's discriminatory conduct towards him but Robinson \"dismissed [Plaintiff's] complaints without discussion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 20, 2013, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination in the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"). In July 2013, Plaintiff's hours were further reduced to 19 hours per week, resulting in a loss of benefits. \"While the MCAD's investigation proceeded, Plaintiff became increasingly concerned that Upton would terminate his employment based upon pretext\" and in September 2014, \"Plaintiff requested a leave of absence pending the resolution of the MCAD process. Robinson refused this request, and either Robinson or Upton misrepresented the nature of the leave requested by Plaintiff, claiming it to be health or mental health issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 30, 2015, the MCAD issued a finding of lack of probable cause. Plaintiff appealed, which was denied and the finding of lack of probable cause was affirmed. The Plaintiff subsequently filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on December 9, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After an Amended Complaint was filed, the Town of Upton filed the instant motion to dismiss Plaintiff's allegations brought under Mass.

Therefore, in order for the Plaintiff's action to be timely the alleged unlawful act must have occurred on or after December 9, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Robinson and the Town are liable for discrimination because they failed to stop Gardner from discriminating against Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming, for purposes of this motion, that Robinson and the Town are liable for failing to intervene in Gardner's discriminatory conduct, that claim is time barred since all of the alleged discriminatory conduct committed by Gardner occurred while he was still employed\n   by the Town, more than eight months before December 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the continuing violation doctrine applies, the Court disagrees. In order for the continuing violation doctrine to apply, the plaintiff must show that \"(1) at least one discriminatory act occurred within the ... limitations period; (2) the alleged timely discriminatory acts have a substantial relationship to the alleged untimely discriminatory acts [and] (3) earlier violations outside the ... limitations period did not trigger [the plaintiff's] 'awareness and duty' to assert his rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v.

Here, it is unequivocal that the Plaintiff knew that he was being discriminated against, at the latest by June 2013.

To permit the Plaintiff to rely on the misrepresentation of his request for leave in order to restart the statute of limitations clock, even when it is clear that he had actual notice of the discriminatory conduct, would subject the statute of limitations to be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shay v.

A complaint filed pursuant to \u00a7 5 must be filed within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory conduct while \u00a7 9 limits the filing of civil actions to \"90 days after filing a charge of discrimination in the MCAD...but not later than three years after the alleged unlawful practice occurred.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 9. The Defendant focuses this motion to dismiss on \u00a7 9 arguing that all of the state law claims are barred by the 3 year statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action on the basis of age and disability when his hours were reduced resulting in ineligibility of receiving benefits. The Plaintiff states that he was terminated in 2014 but he does not allege that his termination was a result of discrimination. In fact, the Amended Complaint suggests that Plaintiff was terminated as a result of failing to show up to work. (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 47). Even assuming that Plaintiff was alleging unlawful termination on the basis of discrimination, the only fact alleged that is related to such a claim is that \"[p]laintiff became increasingly concerned that Upton would terminate his employment based upon pretext.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 46). This statement is conclusory and not sufficient to state a claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The Plaintiff also points to the allegation that Plaintiff \"became increasingly concerned that Upton would terminate his employment based on pretext\" and that \"[o]n one occasion in August, 2014 Upton personnel falsely accused Plaintiff of 'angrily exiting' a room, and reported this to Upton Police. No Charges were ever filed,\" to argue that the continuing violation doctrine applies. (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 46). Although these acts occurred within the statute of limitations period, I find that they consist of conclusory statements and allegations of conduct that are insufficient for a factfinder to draw a reasonable inference that the Plaintiff's hours and benefits decreased as a result of the Defendants discriminatory animus.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    To the extent that this Court granted the Second Amended Complaint, it would fail to state a viable claim the same for the reasons discussed above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
