The Court, having considered the motion, briefs, and relevant law, and being otherwise fully informed, finds that the Motion is well-taken and will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts as alleged by Plaintiff in his Second Amended Complaint [Doc. 19] are as follows. In September 2014, Plaintiff was hired as a temporary employee in the Dona Ana County Clerk's Office (\"Clerk's Office\"). Doc. 19 \u00b6 11. His assignment was to develop policies and procedures across polling places in the county, which was the same type of work that he had done with the Clerk's Office for over 20 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Plaintiff expected his temporary assignment to continue through February of 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March of 2015, Defendant Scott Krahling, Chief Deputy Clerk for Dona Ana County, announced to the employees of the Clerk's Office that he intended to run in 2016 for the position of County Clerk for Dona Ana County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Also in March of 2015, Defendant Lynn Ellins, Clerk for Dona Ana County, announced to the employees of the Clerk's Office that he intended to serve in the position of Chief Deputy County Clerk for Dona Ana County for two years following the 2016 election,\n   and to thereafter run for the position of Dona Ana County Commission[er] in the 2018 election.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 15, 2015 at 2:00 p.m., Plaintiff \"casually mentioned\" to Defendant Krahling that he was considering running in 2016, as a Republican, for Dona Ana County Clerk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Thereafter, Defendant Krahling \"approached\" Plaintiff through a Facebook posting on April 16, 2015, and \"confronted\" Plaintiff in Plaintiff's office on April 17, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Plaintiff \"was subjected to\" the following: he was locked out of the computer system; clerk staff \"were instructed\" not to speak to him; clerk staff did not speak to him; and Defendant Krahling did not speak to him for over two months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Plaintiff filed \"several\" EEOC complaints outlining his concerns, which complaints were \"largely disregarded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on this series of events, Plaintiff claims that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants[ ] improperly harassed Plaintiff and subjected him to harassment, retaliation, hostile work environment and outrageous conduct in retaliation against Plaintiff associated with Plaintiff's constitutionally protected action of seeking support in his off duty hours for his possible candidacy for Dona Ana County Clerk in the 2016 election after Plaintiff mentioned his interest in running for this political position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint further alleges that, on May 11, 2015, Maria Ceniceros approached Plaintiff and asked if he was interested in making extra money by cashing fraudulently obtained United States Treasury refund checks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Plaintiff agreed to go along with the scheme for the purposes of getting more information and speaking out about this criminal activity to law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Plaintiff spoke out about his concerns to law enforcement after the end of his work day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After his initial statement to law enforcement, Plaintiff's continued activities related to the ongoing crimes were directed by federal and local government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On Friday, May 29, 2015, three people were arrested based on Plaintiff's statements to law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Over the weekend, Plaintiff gave an interview to the Las Cruces Sun-News about the criminal activity in the Clerk's Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. On Monday, June 1, 2015, as three more employees of the Clerk's Office were being arrested, Defendant Ellins stopped at Plaintiff's desk, pointed his finger into Plaintiff's face, and said, \"either you're dead or you're next.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Also that day, the Sun-News ran the article on the issues in the Clerk's Office, which article included the interview with Plaintiff, and the website NMPolitics.net ran an article citing the Sun-News article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, on June 4, 2015, Dona Ana County terminated Plaintiff's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Plaintiff claims that Dona Ana County's termination of his employment was done \"in retaliation for the public harassment caused to Lynn Ellins, associated with [Plaintiff]'s Constitutionally protected action of speaking out about criminal activity that was taking place in the Dona Ana County Clerk's Office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 17, 2015, Plaintiff commenced the instant action against the Board of County Commissioners for Dona Ana County and the following individuals, in their individual capacity and in their official capacity\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   : Lynn Ellins (Dona Ana\n   County Clerk), Julia Brown (Dona Ana County Manager), Dave Medieros (Dona Ana Interim County Attorney), and Scott Krahling (Dona Ana County Chief Deputy Clerk). In his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff sets forth eight claims against all of the Defendants, which include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , two claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, for \"Deprivation of First Amendment Right of Freedom of Association\" (Count I), and for \"Deprivation of First Amendment Right of Freedom of Speech\" (Count II), and a claim \"Pled in the Alternative to the Second Cause of Action Deprivation of First Amendment Right of Freedom of Speech\" (Count VIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 22, 2016, Defendants filed their motion to dismiss Counts I, II, and VIII of the Second Amended Complaint, arguing that Plaintiff fails to state a claim on the merits against Defendants, and that Plaintiff's claims against the individual Defendants are barred by qualified immunity. Plaintiff opposes the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff claims that, under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, both the individual Defendants and Dona Ana County violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech and that, even if Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on his First Amendment claims, he nonetheless is entitled to a \"nominal judgment in the amount of $1.00 (one dollar) ... so that the case law on this issue of Freedom of Speech under the circumstances of this cause of action can be developed so that there is not a stagnation of the law in this area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Defendants move to dismiss, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim for relief against any of the individual Defendants or against Dona Ana County, and that, further, Plaintiff's claims are barred by qualified immunity. As set forth herein, the Court agrees that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to show that any of the Defendants plausibly violated his constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard on Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under Rule 12(b)(6), a Court may dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \"The nature of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of the allegations within the four corners of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Mobley v.

In support of that claim, Plaintiff points to his allegations that, after Plaintiff \"casually mentioned\" to Defendant Krahling that he was considering running against him in 2016, as Republican, for the County Clerk position, the following occurred: Krahling \"approached\" Plaintiff through a Facebook posting on April 16, 2015, and \"confronted\" Plaintiff in Plaintiff's office on April 17, 2015; Plaintiff was locked out of the computer system; clerk staff \"were instructed\" not to speak to him; clerk staff did not speak to him; Krahling did not speak to him for over two months; and Plaintiff filed \"several\" EEOC complaints outlining his concerns, which complaints were \"largely disregarded.\" Doc. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 14-20.

Nor does he allege that his employment was discontinued, or even threatened to be discontinued, as a result of his association with the Republican Party. There are simply no allegations in the Second Amended Complaint to support Plaintiff's newly articulated theory that the alleged retaliation was based upon Plaintiff's support of a political party rather than his prospective candidacy itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tavizon v.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Krahling \"approached\" him through a Facebook posting, \"confronted\" him in Plaintiff's office, and did not speak to Plaintiff for two months.

In the absence of allegations that one of its employees committed such a constitutional violation, the Second Amended Complaint is insufficient to state a claim of liability against Dona Ana County.\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Indeed, Plaintiff makes no mention\n   of any policies or customs of Dona Ana County at all, in any form, whether formal or informal, or of any failure by Dona Ana County to train or supervise. For this additional reason, the Second Amended Complaint fails to state a viable freedom of association claim against Dona Ana County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Freedom of Speech Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In Count II, Plaintiff claims that Defendants terminated his employment in violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. In support of that claim, Plaintiff points to his allegations that, after he \"spoke out about his concerns\" about the illegal activity that was going on at the Clerk's Office by giving an interview to the press over the weekend of May 30, 2015, on the following Monday, June 1, 2015, Defendant Ellins stopped at Plaintiff's desk, pointed his finger into Plaintiff's face, and said, \"either you're dead or you're next,\" and three days later, on June 4, 2015, Dona Ana County terminated his employment. Doc. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 22-28. According to Plaintiff, he was terminated \"in retaliation for the public harassment caused to Lynn Ellins, associated with [Plaintiff]'s Constitutionally protected action of speaking out about criminal activity that was taking place in the Dona Ana County Clerk's Office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff seems to suggest that because his allegations, if proven true, would establish that he \"spoke out on matters of public concern,\" he has properly stated a freedom of speech claim against each of the Defendants. Doc. 25 at 20. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff's speech involved matters of public concern, this fact is not dispositive of the adequacy of his Second Amended Complaint. Rather, as explained above, in order to survive dismissal, a complaint must \"make clear exactly\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   is alleged to have done\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    whom\n   </em>\n   , to provide each individual with fair notice to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations against the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553315\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1242/#p1249\">\n    519 F.3d at 1249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Plaintiff fails to identify any personal participation by the named Defendants in his termination, and thus falls short of meeting his burden of providing fair notice of the grounds for the claims against those Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While Plaintiff alleges that Dona Ana County terminated his employment, he does not allege that any individual Defendant was personally responsible for, let alone participated in, the decision to terminate him.

Indeed, the only individual whom Plaintiff mentions by name in connection with his termination is Ellins. Plaintiff does not, however, allege that Ellins participated in his termination, but rather that, three days prior to his termination, Ellins stopped at Plaintiff's desk, pointed his finger into Plaintiff's face, and said, \"either you're dead or you're next.\" These allegations alone, however, \"are of insufficient gravity to premise a First Amendment violation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Lybrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11161906\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1334/#p1340\">\n    232 F.3d at 1340-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to render his freedom of speech claim plausible as to any of the individual Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff similarly has failed to adequately plead his freedom of speech claim against Dona Ana County. As explained above, in order to state a Section 1983 claim against a municipality, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that it is plausible that the municipal employee committed a constitutional violation, and that a municipal policy or custom was the moving force behind the constitutional deprivation. Here, Plaintiff fails to allege that any individual Defendant violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. In the absence of allegations that one of its employees committed such a constitutional violation, the Second Amended Complaint is insufficient to state a freedom of speech claim against Dona Ana County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, nowhere does Plaintiff allege that Dona Ana County itself had a policy or custom that was the \"moving force\" behind his allegedly retaliatory termination. As noted above, Plaintiff makes no mention of any policies or customs of Dona Ana County at all, in any form, whether formal or informal, or of any failure by Dona Ana County to train or supervise. For this additional reason, the Second Amended Complaint fails to state a viable freedom of speech claim against Dona Ana County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Alternative Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In Count VIII, Plaintiff requests that, if the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on his First Amendment claims, the Court nonetheless allow his claims to \"continue under a demand for nominal damages so that the law on this issue can be more fully developed without subjecting the state actors to the threat of a damages award against them.\" Doc. 25 at 10. Also in Count VIII, Plaintiff seeks a nominal judgment in the amount of $1.00, in the alternative to the damages he requests in connection with his First Amendment claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff has provided no legal authority, and the Court has found none, to support his request for the Court to allow his First Amendment claims to proceed regardless of the fact that the Court finds those claims to be insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. In the absence of a viable claim, Plaintiff is not entitled to seek damages, even damages in a nominal amount. For this reason, Count VIII of the Second Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and is subject to dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Pendant State Law Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition to his federal constitutional claims, Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint includes various claims arising from New Mexico law (Counts III through VII). The Court's pendent jurisdiction over these state claims \"is exercised on a discretionary basis,\" and the Tenth Circuit has generally held that \"if federal claims are dismissed before trial, leaving only issues of state law, the federal court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the case without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.
