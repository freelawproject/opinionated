PharmaCann Penn, the new owner of the property, sued in state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that it may open a medical marijuana dispensary on the property despite these deed restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants (PharmaCann's predecessors in interest and the partnership entities that operate the shopping center) removed the case to federal court. PharmaCann then moved to remand, challenging the defendants' assertion of federal question jurisdiction, questioning the removal procedure, and invoking doctrines of abstention. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that (1) it has federal question jurisdiction, (2) the removal process was proper, and (3) abstention doctrines do not control the case. The motion to remand to state court is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The property in question is part of the Franklin Mills shopping center (now called\n   the Philadelphia Mills). The shopping center is managed by defendants Simon Property Group, Franklin Mills Associates, and Franklin Mills Residual. Defendants Western Franklin Mills and BV Development Superstition are previous owners of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2017, BV Development conveyed the property to PharmaCann. PharmaCann then obtained a permit from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to operate a medical marijuana dispensary pursuant to the Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.101. In addition, the City of Philadelphia granted PharmaCann a zoning permit for the dispensary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The deed to PharmaCann's property contains several restrictions. Two restrictions potentially block PharmaCann from opening a \"medical marijuana dispensary\"; hence, this case. First, the deed prohibits \"[a]ny activity or use which is unlawful.\" This prohibition is the basis of the parties' dispute over federal question jurisdiction, discussed below. Second, the deed prohibits PharmaCann from operating a drug store, defined in part as \"a store used for the sale and display of drugs.\" This prohibition bears on the merits of the case and, thus, is not address in this Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PharmaCann sued in state court for a declaratory judgment interpreting the deed's prohibitions on \"unlawful\" uses and on \"drug stores\" as inapplicable. Franklin Mills removed to this Court. After a motion to remand and an amended notice of removal, PharmaCann filed the amended motion to remand at issue now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PharmaCann's motion to remand presents three questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1) Whether the Court has federal question jurisdiction because existing federal drug laws render PharmaCann's marijuana dispensary \"unlawful\" under the deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2) Whether two defendants who did not consent to the removal were fraudulently joined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3) Whether the abstention doctrines emanating from the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   cases counsel against hearing this case in federal court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court addresses each question in turn and concludes that (1) the Court has federal question jurisdiction over this case; (2) the removal process was proper because the only defendants who did not consent to removal were fraudulently joined; and (3) abstention doctrines do not control this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The federal status of these state schemes could be clarified or brought into sharper focus by a ruling on whether PharmaCann's proposed dispensary violates federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the issues at hand counsel in favor of review by a court used to federal drug law and versed in principles of federalism. The immediate law to be applied is the federal Controlled Substances Act. On a deeper level, too, federalism principles lurk in the background of this dispute. If a court were to rule that PharmaCann's dispensary violated federal law, the Supremacy Clause could cast doubt on the validity of dozens of state marijuana schemes. Such a ruling, in other words, would require a court to consider the delicate comity between our federal and state systems.

Western Franklin Mills is only mentioned twice in the entire complaint-and each time, only to illustrate that complete diversity is not satisfied (the removing defendants have since dropped their diversity-jurisdiction argument). Western Franklin Mills appears to have been the general partner of Franklin Mills Associates, which does have an interest in the case. But Western Franklin Mills withdrew from the partnership in 1997. At oral argument, counsel for PharmaCann conceded that his client had no present case against Western Franklin Mills. In other words, no one can make a straight-faced argument for the involvement of Western Franklin Mills in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Pa. Jan. 17, 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   , this Court articulated a two part test for fraudulent joinder: First, the Court \"accept[s] as true all allegations\" in the complaint, and \"if there is even a possibility that a state court would find that the complaint states a cause of action\" against the defendant in question, then joinder is proper.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20451636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p217\">\n    448 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (3d Cir. 2006) ). Second, the Court asks whether the plaintiff \"intends in good faith to prosecute the action\" against the allegedly fraudulently joined defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p217\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At this step, the Court may \"look beyond the pleadings 'to identify indicia of fraudulent joinder.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p217\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p217\">\n    448 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   219 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   PharmaCann has satisfied the first part of the two-part test. Without straying from the pleadings, which allege that BV Development sold the property to PharmaCann, the Court can conclude that PharmaCann\n   has articulated a cause of action against BV Development. At the very least, based on the complaint alone, the Court cannot conclude that \"recovery from [BV Development] is a clear legal impossibility.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaborek v. Allstate Fin. Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273907\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/748/#p751\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751 (E.D. Pa. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The question becomes more complicated at the second part of the two-part test, when the Court \"must look beyond the allegations of [PharmaCann's] complaint,\" including an inquiry into its conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abels v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333048\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/770/26/#p32\">\n    770 F.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (3d Cir. 1985). Here, motive and intent come to the fore. The crucial question is whether PharmaCann's conduct demonstrates that it has \"no real intention in good faith to prosecute the action\" against BV Development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531167\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/108/#p111\">\n    913 F.2d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The best evidence of PharmaCann's lack of intent to prosecute its case against BV Development is the agreement between BV Development and PharmaCann. As explained above, BV Development (1) is in complete agreement with PharmaCann's view of the facts and the law, and (2) is relieved from filing any responsive pleading in this case. Taken together, these two conditions demonstrate that PharmaCann has no intention to prosecute this case against BV Development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , BV Development's total agreement with PharmaCann's factual and legal arguments demonstrates that BV Development and PharmaCann are not \"adversaries\" in any common sense of the word. Indeed, BV Development's interest in the case is identical to PharmaCann's: to see that the marijuana dispensary is deemed a valid use, in order to avoid putting the sale in jeopardy. This alignment of interests sets the case apart from\n   <em>\n    J.H.\n   </em>\n   , in which a police officer defendant accused of assault \"vigorously denie[d] the allegations against him.\"\n   <em>\n    J.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20451636\">\n    2018 WL 451636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Even though the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    J.H.\n   </em>\n   had agreed never to enforce a judgement against the officer, the officer's reputation was still at stake in the case, thus strongly suggesting his continued interest in seeing a result in the case not fully compatible with the plaintiff's desired outcome.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20451636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To be sure, BV Development's and PharmaCann's interests could possibly diverge in the future-if their current agreement proves unsuccessful or unfruitful. If a court rules that PharmaCann's marijuana dispensary violates the deed, then PharmaCann may seek to unwind its purchase from BV Development. Under Pennsylvania's declaratory judgment statute, therefore, PharmaCann was likely correct to name BV Development as a party with \"any interest which would be affected by the declaration.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7540. But\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   compliance with a state-law joinder rule is undercut by the fast-to-follow\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   agreement that brought the interests of BV Development and PharmaCann into complete harmony. In other words, compliance with Pennsylvania rules of joinder says little about PharmaCann's intent to prosecute BV Development in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nor does PharmaCann's potential, theoretical future suit against BV Development to unwind the sale change the fraudulent-joinder calculus. Such a hypothetical dispute once again differs from\n   <em>\n    J.H.\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff needed to\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   obtain a verdict against the defendant officer\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she could obtain a judgment against the City.\n   <em>\n    J.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20451636\">\n    2018 WL 451636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minehart v.

Pa. Nov. 28, 2017) (Brody, J.) (rejecting the argument that one defendant was fraudulently joined just because the plaintiff could \"obtain complete relief\" from the other defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , PharmaCann's agreement to relieve BV Development from any duty to respond in the case further demonstrates\n   that BV Development is fraudulently joined. PharmaCann's decision not to hold BV Development to any of the usual response requirements sets this case apart from\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   , in which a settlement as to some claims against two defendants did not alter the plaintiff's \"expectation that [the defendants would] defend themselves\" against the remaining claims.\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204876330\">\n    2015 WL 4876330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Here, by contrast, PharmaCann has relieved BV Development of any need to defend itself. Thus, BV Development is fraudulently joined, its failure to join in the removal process was of no moment, and the other defendants' removal to this Court was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Abstention Doctrines\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Contending that the case presents issues so unique to Pennsylvania law that only a Pennsylvania court should decide them, PharmaCann argues that the Court should abstain from the case on the grounds of both the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   doctrines.

Or for a state to issue licenses to hunt wildlife protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    At the oral argument on this remand motion, an effort was undertaken by counsel to introduce into the mix (1) the perceived (by some) political popularity of altering the status of marijuana, (2) the considerable physical relief offered by some variations of marijuana to people suffering from certain conditions, and (3) the supposed passivity of law-enforcement personnel. Of course, the federal judiciary is charged with the obligation to resist just such pitches that are best made to those who write laws, perhaps those who are charged with enforcing them-but not those who have accepted a lifetime position to resist deciding disputes on the basis of political popularity or assessments of enforcement energy or appetite, so long as enactment or enforcement are not unconstitutionally selective.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The Court fails to see how these arguments bear on the narrow, preliminary question of whether federal jurisdiction exists in this case. Nothing in this opinion should be taken as a pronouncement on the merits of this dispute. Even on the merits, however, a word of caution is in order. It is not this Court's role to second-guess the political wisdom of federal legislation on marijuana.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Washington v. Sessions\n    </em>\n    , No. 17-CV-5625,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201114758\">\n     2018 WL 1114758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2018) (rejecting a rational-basis challenge to federal law categorizing marijuana as a Schedule I drug). Thus, the task at hand is one that concerns the conventional judicial role, nothing less and nothing more.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
