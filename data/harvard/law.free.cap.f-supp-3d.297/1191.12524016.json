The Court held an evidentiary hearing on July 17, 2017. The primary issue is whether Defendant Maximo Olivas-Perea, a Mexican citizen who was deported in 2005, was \"found\"-as that word is used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -in the United States of America when he was booked into the Santa Fe County Detention Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico on June 11,\n   2011-approximately five-and-a-half years before Plaintiff United States charged Olivas-Perea in this case-thereby triggering\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   's five-year statute of limitations. The Court concludes that, on June 13, 2011, federal immigration authorities knew that: (i) Olivas-Perea was in the United States; and (ii) Olivas-Perea had been deported previously. The Court also concludes that federal immigration authorities could have determined Olivas-Perea's whereabouts soon thereafter with the diligence typical of law enforcement. Accordingly, more than five years passed between when Olivas-Perea was found in the United States and the United States charged Olivas-Perea with Reentry of a Removed Alien (\"Illegal Reentry\"). Information, filed December 2, 2016 (Doc. 15)(\"Information\"). Section 3282's five-year statute of limitations therefore bars Olivas-Perea's prosecution, so the Court grants the MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The United States' Criminal Complaint, filed December 23, 2015 (Doc. 1)(\"Criminal Complaint\"), states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   A review of Maximo OLIVAS-Perea's immigration file revealed that he is a citizen and national of Mexico who was ordered removed from the United States by an Immigration Judge in El Paso, TX on April 7, 1997 and was physically removed from the United States to Mexico on April 8, 1997. Maximo OLIVAS-Perea was last removed from the United States to Mexico on April 8, 1997. Maximo OLIVAS-Perea was ordered removed from the United States subsequent to a conviction for Possession with Intent to Distribute more than 50 kilograms of Marijuana in violation of 21 USC 841(a)(1) and 21 USC [841](b)(1)(C) on March 16, 1994 in U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   There is no evidence in the immigration file of Maximo OLIVAS-Perea applying for or receiving permission to re-enter the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Criminal Complaint at 2. The Court takes facts from the Criminal Complaint for the purpose of deciding the MTD, but it acknowledges that Olivas-Perea is presumed innocent and that, in a criminal prosecution, the United States would need to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all of the elements of Illegal Reentry, including that Olivas-Perea had been deported previously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Olivas-Perea was booked into the Santa Fe County Detention Center on June 11, 2011 for failure to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Exhibit E at 2 (\"Booking Form\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   MTD \u00b6 15, at 7; Inmate Booking List for OLIVAS, MAX at 1, filed June 2, 2017 (Doc. 33-3)(\"Booking List\").

According to Olivas-Perea, \"[Homeland Security] was aware, or in the exercise of the diligence reasonably expected of law enforcement should have been aware, of ... his whereabouts,\" MTD \u00b6 18, at 7-8, because he was \"booked into the Santa Fe County Detention Center\" under his own name, MTD \u00b6 17, at 7, and because he \"remained in the United States continuously from on or before June 11, 2011[;] [h]e lived in Santa Fe with his family[; and h]e was not in hiding or seeking to avoid detection,\" MTD \u00b6 16, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The United States filed its Response on June 23, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7. The United States argues that Olivas-Perea was not found in the United States until December 18, 2015, because that date is \"when agents discovered defendant's status as a previously deported alien.\" Response at 5. The United States contends that Olivas-Perea's June 11, 2011, arrest took place on a Saturday night, and Olivas-Perea was released just after midnight on Sunday morning, so, \"[a]lthough jail personnel submitted Defendant's fingerprints, ... there would have been no one on the other side of the submission ... to make a match\" and thereby determine Olivas-Perea's immigration status. Response at 5. The United States argues: \"In fact, Government's Exhibit 1 shows the prints were not submitted until the following Monday, June 13, 2011, over 24 hours after Defendant had been released.\" Response at 5 (citing DHS Person Summary at 1). It follows, according to the United States, that \"the Defendant was released before authorities would have been able to ascertain his legal status.\" Response at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The United States also argues that Olivas-Perea \"concealed his true identity by giving the name 'Max Olivas,' rather than his full name.\" Response at 6. \"Knowledge of defendant's physical presence in the United States and his status as a previously deported alien should not be imputed to the government when Defendant surreptitiously reentered the United States and used a false name.\" Response at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Olivas-Perea filed his reply brief on July 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mr. Olivas' Reply to the Government's Response to Motion to Dismiss at 7, filed July 14, 2017 (Doc. 44)(\"Reply\"). Olivas-Perea states that, in the MTD, he based his argument on Santa Fe County's \"participation in the Secure Communities program, giving rise to a presumption that ICE had 'constructive' knowledge of his illegal presence in the United States on, or shortly after, his booking into\" the Santa Fe County jail. Reply at 2. Olivas-Perea elaborates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Olivas does not abandon that argument; however, in its response to the motion to dismiss, the government submitted evidence which proves that ICE in fact had actual knowledge of Mr. Olivas's illegal presence in the United States as of June 13, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DHS Person Summary at 1]. This document demonstrates that, as of June 13, 2011,\n   DHS possessed actual knowledge that Mr. Olivas, a prior deportee, was illegally present in the United States. The only question that remains, therefore, is whether law enforcement knew, or could have known \"through the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement,\" the final element of the inquiry: Mr. Olivas's whereabouts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Knowing Mr. Olivas's whereabouts does not mean that law enforcement had to know Mr. Olivas's precise location; nor, as the government appears to suggest, does it require that Mr. Olivas have remained incarcerated. If \"diligence typical of law enforcement\" required only that the authorities be able to find people in jail, that would be cause for concern for the efficacy of law enforcement. This element requires only that, through the exertion of reasonable efforts, the kind we would expect from professional law enforcement, authorities could find Mr. Olivas at or around the time that those authorities became aware of the fact of his arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Reply at 3. Olivas-Perea then argues that federal immigration authorities could have determined his whereabouts in June of 2011, because ICE received the same information on June 13, 2011 as it did in the December 18, 2015 referral from NCATC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4. Olivas-Perea elaborates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The only difference is that, in response to the information it received in 2011, ICE did nothing, and in response to the information it received in 2015, ICE exercised diligence typical of law enforcement by pulling Mr. Olivas's driver's license, matching up his driver's license photo with his DHS photo, and, eventually, obtaining and executing an arrest warrant on Mr. Olivas. These actions constitute \"the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement.\" The mere fact that ICE apparently chose not to exercise the same diligence in 2011 does not excuse the violation of the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Reply at 4. Olivas-Perea also contends that \"[t]he complete booking form from the Santa Fe County Detention Facility prepared in connection with his June, 2011 arrest includes substantial detailed information about Mr. Olivas, including his residence address\"-which is where Olivas-Perea returned after being released on June 12, 2013, and where he continued to reside until he was arrested in this case-such that \"[n]o investigative skill would have been required to locate Mr. Olivas following his release from Santa Fe County custody in June of 2011.\" Reply at 5. According to Olivas-Perea, that he obtained a copy of the booking form from the June 11, 2011, arrest \"with a simple IPRA [Inspection of Public Records Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-2-1\">\n    N.M.

Olivas-Perea first notes that the DHS Person Summary indicates that Homeland Security equated \"Max Olivas\" with \"Maximo Olivas-Perea.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 5 (citing DHS Person Summary at 1). Olivas-Perea then casts aspersions on \"the suggestion that 'Max Olivas' is an alias of such cunning as to be able to confound the police in their search for 'Maximo Olivas-Perea.' \" Reply at 5. Olivas-Perea then concludes by observing that \"Mr. Olivas gave his true name, or at least the proper diminutive of it, his correct residence address and other personal identifying information, leaving minimally diligent law enforcement officers a clearly observable\n   record of Mr. Olivas' presence, status and trail to his whereabouts.\" Reply at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court held an evidentiary hearing on July 17, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1:2-3 (Court). Olivas-Perea began by introducing the booking sheet from Olivas-Perea's June 11, 2011, arrest-which he obtained via a \"Freedom of Information request under state law of New Mexico\"-as Defense Exhibit E. Tr. at 2:25-3:4 (Robert). Olivas-Perea then commented that \"Exhibit E, among other pertinent information, most importantly contains information about where Mr. Olivas-Perea lived.\" Tr. at 3:5-7 (Robert).

Olivas-Perea argued, however, that immigration authorities had constructive knowledge of Olivas-Perea's address, because, \"had they exercised the diligence typically expected of law enforcement they would have had th[at] information.\" Tr. at 9:1-3 (Robert). To make that point, Olivas-Perea argued that, \"in November of 2015, [immigration authorities] had the same information that they had in 2011[, but] different from 2011, in 2015 they acted on that information[,] went to [his] house[, and] arrested him.\" Tr. at 9:5-8 (Robert).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Olivas-Perea's counsel then offered to have Olivas-Perea testify that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [h]e had lived at the North Platte address for at least a couple of years before he was arrested in 2011, and that's where he was arrested in 2015.

And when he was released from custody in 2011 ... he went home to the residence on North Platte Street, and there he remained until he was arrested more than five years later, in November of 2015. He went to work after he was released from custody. He worked at the same place for a long time so both his residence and his employment were remarkably consistent before and following his arrest and release in June of 2011.

The United States also called to the stand an ICE agent, Deportation Officer Matthew Saucedo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:10 (Saucedo), who did \"have personal knowledge of what was happening in 2011, because he's worked the Santa Fe County area for the last 10 years,\" Tr. at 26:24-27:1 (Simms).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Saucedo explained that the ICE logbook is a \"printout of a log book that El Paso-ICE in El Paso holds.\" Tr. at 32:6-7 (Saucedo).

Additionally, Saucedo indicated that the Santa Fe County jail did not send Olivas-Perea's booking form to ICE, because \"Santa Fe County would never send us that information or nor have they prior or past, roughly 2007, 2008.\" Tr. at 37:16-21 (Simms, Saucedo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On cross examination, Saucedo agreed with Olivas-Perea's statements that \"[t]here is no[ ] doubt that a Secured Communities hit was received in 2011, based on your review of the records,\" Tr. at 40:5-8 (Robert, Saucedo), and that \"[t]here is no question that the federal authorities had the information about the fact that Mr. Olivas-Perea had been encountered by law enforcement in June of 2011, and that he was a prior deportee,\" Tr. at 40:24-41:4 (Robert, Saucedo). Saucedo indicated, however, that, \"[b]ased upon Santa Fe County's failure to recognize or work with ICE, it was a little more difficult, actually it was a lot more difficult to get information about individuals that were arrested apart from Secured Communities.\" Tr. at 50:15-19 (Saucedo).

The United States argued that Olivas-Perea's driver's license renewal in 2014 was significant, because it was the mechanism that informed \"the local ICE officer\" of Olivas-Perea's residence.

Olivas-Perea also argued that the standard for constructive knowledge-\"[r]easonable diligence[,] the kinds of diligence typically expected of law enforcement\"-is \"an objective standard by its terms,\" so subjective factors, such as the amount of resources available to federal immigration authorities, are irrelevant. Tr. at 79:11-21 (Robert). Olivas-Perea analogized to another objective standard-the level of diligence expected of lawyers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   What if I was accused of not being sufficiently diligent[,] of committing malpractice[,] of not being professionally responsible[.] [A]re they going to give me a break because they say I was busy or home sick that week[?] [No.] I am expected to perform a standard that's set objectively by the people who determines those things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Tr. at 80:4-11 (Robert).

For example, defendants might argue that they did not commit the charged criminal offense within the limitations period, because they did not commit the charged criminal offense at all. While such arguments go to the timeliness of a prosecution as a formal matter, they should still be submitted to the jury, because evaluating such an argument requires determining whether the defendant is innocent or guilty.
