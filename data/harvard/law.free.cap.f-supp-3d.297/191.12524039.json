A student must evidence a post-graduate commitment to remain in the school state to rebut the presumption.

Pa. 1989) (\"It is generally presumed that a student who attends a university in a state other than the student's 'home' state intends to return 'home' upon completion of studies.\"). Applying these principles here, the Court must presume that the plaintiff \"intend[ed] to return [to California] on completion of his studies,\" and to rebut this presumption, defendant TriNet must produce evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the plaintiff had \"a post-graduate commitment to remain in the [District].\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Moore\n     <em>\n      et al.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     , \u00a7 102.37[6].\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     The Court concludes that defendant TriNet has failed to rebut the presumption that the plaintiff intends to return to California after completing his studies.

Reply at 1-2. However, the plaintiff's association with his District-based company does not compel the conclusion that the plaintiff intends to remain in the District after completion of his studies, and the fact that the plaintiff was able to perform his duties as president remotely from California belies defendant TriNet's position that running a District-based company necessarily means that the plaintiff intends to remain in the District. Defendant TriNet also points to the plaintiff's District of Columbia driver's license issued in 2014 and valid until 2021, as support for its position.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Notice of Removal \u00b6 7;\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     , Ex. 2 (copy of the plaintiff's California driver's license).

A (Nytes Aff.) \u00b6 11.

While defendant TriNet relies on the fact that the plaintiff \"filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia arising out of his former employment [ ]here,\" Notice of Removal \u00b6 7, it cites no legal authority, nor is the Court aware of any, for the proposition that filing a lawsuit in a state is evidence of one's intent to remain there. Furthermore, the plaintiff's statement that \"[w]hen [he] left for California [in May 2016], [he] intended to return to Georgetown,\" Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 1 (Nytes Aff.) \u00b6 9, and the fact that since the filing and removal of this case, the plaintiff has indeed returned to the District to continue his studies,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     Defs.' Reply at 2, simply say nothing about whether the plaintiff intends to remain in the District\n     <em>\n      after\n     </em>\n     completing his studies. And finally, the fact that the plaintiff's LinkedIn page has indicated that the plaintiff was \"located\" in the District, Notice of Removal \u00b6 6, is likewise not probative of the plaintiff's intent to remain in the District after graduation.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     Furthermore, the import of all of this evidence is undermined because \"as of the time [the plaintiff] commenced this suit, he had not affirmatively severed his ties to [California].\"\n     <em>\n      Murphy v.

For the reasons already explained, and particularly in light of the plaintiff's significant ties to California, the Court concludes that defendant TriNet's evidence is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the plaintiff intends to return to his home state of California upon completion of his studies. Consequently, because defendant TriNet has not shown that the plaintiff has at any time intended to remain in the District indefinitely or for an unspecified period of time, defendant TriNet has failed to satisfy its burden of showing that the plaintiff was ever domiciled in the District,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Prakash\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794136,1934359\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/727/1174/\">\n      727 F.2d at 1180\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , and therefore, it has failed to demonstrate that complete diversity of citizenship exists among the parties in this case.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-41\">\n     <strong>\n      B.

CONCLUSION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-60\">\n     For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that defendant TriNet has failed to satisfy its burden to demonstrate that diversity jurisdiction exists in this case. Furthermore, defendant TriNet has also failed to demonstrate that it was fraudulently joined. Consequently, the Court concludes that it must remand this case to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n     <footnotemark>\n      14\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-64\">\n     The caption for this case created by the Clerk of the Court identifies the plaintiff as Jarius Nytes; however, the plaintiff's filings and various identification documents attached as exhibits to those filings reflect that the correct spelling of the plaintiff's first name is Jairus.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Second Amended Complaint at 1;\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     Response to Court, Exhibit B (copy of the plaintiff's California driver's license) at 3.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-65\">\n     In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) Defendant TriNet HR Corporation's Memorandum in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (\"TriNet's Mem.\"); (2) the Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant TriNet HR Corporation's Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"); (3) Defendant TriNet HR Corporation's Reply in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (\"TriNet's Reply\"); and (4) Defendant Trustify, Inc.'s Answer to Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (\"Trustify's Answer\").\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-66\">\n     The plaintiff alleges that he made requests for accommodation \"on more than one occasion,\" Am.
