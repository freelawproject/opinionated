Reply at 1-2. However, the plaintiff's association with his District-based company does not compel the conclusion that the plaintiff intends to remain in the District after completion of his studies, and the fact that the plaintiff was able to perform his duties as president remotely from California belies defendant TriNet's position that running a District-based company necessarily means that the plaintiff intends to remain in the District. Defendant TriNet also points to the plaintiff's District of Columbia driver's license issued in 2014 and valid until 2021, as support for its position. <em>See</em> Notice of Removal \u00b6 7; <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em>, Ex. 2 (copy of the plaintiff's California driver's license).

A (Nytes Aff.) \u00b6 11. And although not explicitly relied on by defendant TriNet, the plaintiff worked at Trustify in the District, which is another \"indicia of domiciliary status,\" <em>Core VCT</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129651\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/59/123/#p126\">59 F.Supp.3d at </extracted-citation>126 ; however, defendant TriNet has given the Court no reason to believe that his brief employment with Trustify is persuasive evidence of an intent to have \"a permanent career ... in [the District]\" rather than a mere \"desire to earn money to help fund the expenses of h[is] education,\" <em>Hakkila</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080528\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/745/988/#p990\">745 F.Supp. at </extracted-citation>991 ; <em>see also</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080528\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/745/988/#p990\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080528\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/745/988/#p990\"> at 990-91</extracted-citation> (finding that an out-of-state student's \"work-study job ... and her various part-time employments[ ]working as a waitress and in a retail store[ ][we]re not steps toward a permanent career in radio in [her school's state]\").</p><p id=\"p-37\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"201\" href=\"#p201\" id=\"p201\">*201</a>The remaining evidence cited by defendant TriNet and otherwise in the record is even less persuasive.

Notably, it has not provided evidence that the plaintiff registered to vote in the District, voted in the District, registered a vehicle in the District, or paid taxes in the District, all recognized as \"indicia of domiciliary <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"202\" href=\"#p202\" id=\"p202\">*202</a>status,\" <em>see</em> <em>Core VCT</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129651\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/59/123/#p126\">59 F.Supp.3d at 126</extracted-citation>, and some which are recognized as particularly probative of domiciliary intent, <em>see</em> <em>Blackwell</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1984%20WL%202753\">1984 WL 2753</extracted-citation>, at *3 n.1 (finding \"the fact that the plaintiff maintained his voting registration in the District of Columbia and voted in the District immediately before filing [his] lawsuit and several months thereafter [to be] of particular significance\").

For the reasons already explained, and particularly in light of the plaintiff's significant ties to California, the Court concludes that defendant TriNet's evidence is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the plaintiff intends to return to his home state of California upon completion of his studies. Consequently, because defendant TriNet has not shown that the plaintiff has at any time intended to remain in the District indefinitely or for an unspecified period of time, defendant TriNet has failed to satisfy its burden of showing that the plaintiff was ever domiciled in the District, <em>see</em> <em>Prakash</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794136,1934359\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/727/1174/\">727 F.2d at 1180</extracted-citation>, and therefore, it has failed to demonstrate that complete diversity of citizenship exists among the parties in this case.</p><p id=\"p-41\"><strong>B.

However, it cites no legal authority, nor is the Court able to locate any, for the proposition that an employee must directly interact with his joint employer in order to establish joint employer liability. The <em>Browning-Ferris</em> test is concerned with \"control of the terms and conditions of [the plaintiff's] employment,\" <em>Redd</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675786,11158558\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/933/\">232 F.3d at 938</extracted-citation>, and although an employee's direct interactions with a joint employer could be probative of the joint employer's control over that employee, it does not necessarily follow that such interactions are required to establish control.</p><p id=\"p-53\">Defendant TriNet also argues that the \"administrative services\" it provided to the plaintiff and to defendant Trustify \"cannot serve as a basis for [the p]laintiff's claims against [defendant] TriNet\" because the plaintiff fails to allege that defendant TriNet had the \"authority to hire or fire, promulgate work rules, or set conditions[,] [ ] day-to-day supervision of [the] plaintiff's employment including discipline or control of his schedule[,] or [ ] control of his pay,\" TriNet's Mem. at 5, and without those \"hallmarks of joint or co-employment ..., a defendant is not a joint employer for purposes of statutory claims like those raised here.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675786,11158558\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/933/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> As already explained, the plaintiff has alleged facts that support his argument that some of these \"hallmarks\" existed. Furthermore, none of the decisions defendant TriNet cites compel the conclusion that each of these \"hallmarks\" must be present for joint employer liability to exist. Importantly, none of these decisions is controlling authority, nor do any explicitly apply the <em>Browning-Ferris</em> factors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although two of these decisions underscore the importance of whether a joint employer has a right to terminate an employee, <em>see</em> <em>Sandoval v. City of Boulder, Colo.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152977\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/1312/#p1324\">388 F.3d 1312</extracted-citation>, 1324 (10th Cir. 2004) (\"Most important to control over the terms and conditions of an employment relationship is the right to terminate it under certain circumstances.\" (internal quotations omitted) ), as well as the right to hire and supervise employees, <em>see</em> <em>EEOC v.

Moreover, these cases were decided on summary judgment or motions for judgment as a matter of law, <em>see</em> <em>Sandoval</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152977\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/1312/#p1324\">388 F.3d at 1324</extracted-citation> (summary judgment);</p><p id=\"p-54\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"207\" href=\"#p207\" id=\"p207\">*207</a><em>Pac.

Valega's Prof. Home Cleaning, Inc.</em>, No. 12-cv-644, <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205386028\">2012 WL 5386028</extracted-citation>, at *14-15 (N.D.

Again, these decisions are not controlling authority, but even if they were, they do not foreclose the plaintiff's claims. Indeed, <em>Coldwell</em> explicitly recognizes that it \"in no way concludes that a [professional employer organization] ... would never qualify as an employer.\" <em>Coldwell</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201737715\">2017 WL 1737715</extracted-citation>, at *10. And again, these cases have limited relevance to the fraudulent joinder analysis because they were applying the more rigorous summary judgment standard. <em>See</em> <em>Adams</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205386028\">2012 WL 5386028</extracted-citation>, at *2, 4 ; <em>Coldwell</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201737715\">2017 WL 1737715</extracted-citation>, at *1-2, 10.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-56\">Finally, to the extent that the Court would require the plaintiff to show that defendant TriNet \"knew or should have known of the [alleged unlawful] conduct and that it failed to take [ ] corrective measures within its control,\" <em>Caldwell v. ServiceMaster Corp.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11963734\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/966/33/#p46\">966 F.Supp. 33</extracted-citation>, 46 (D.D.C. 1997) -a showing that at least one member of this Court has required a plaintiff to demonstrate in order to prevail on a theory of joint employer liability against a temporary agency, <em>see</em> <em>id.</em>-the Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate the possibility that the plaintiff has satisfied this requirement. The plaintiff alleges that defendant TriNet not only knew of the alleged discriminatory and retaliatory conduct, <em>see</em> 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 54, but that it \"permitted,\" \"approved,\" and, in one instance, \"joined in\" it, <em>see</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6 39 (\"TriNet ... permitted the materially adverse action[s] taken against [the plaintiff] when [defendant] Trustify refused to provide ... the requested reasonable accommodation ... and when Trustify terminated [the plaintiff's] employment.\"); <em>id.</em> \u00b6 29 (\"TriNet approved the decision ... to terminate [the plaintiff].\"); <em>id.</em> \u00b6 40 (\"TriNet [ ] joined Trustify in opposing [the plaintiff] obtaining unemployment benefits.\"). Furthermore, the plaintiff has alleged facts suggesting that defendant TriNet possessed authority with respect to requests for reasonable accommodations, <em>see</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6 22 (quoting instruction from TriNet Employee Handbook that \"[a]ll [Trustify] managers should immediately report ... matters [regarding concerns about accommodation requests] to a TriNet HR Representative\"), as well as employee termination, <em>see</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6 29 (\"TriNet approved the decision ... to terminate [the plaintiff].\"), which suggests that \"corrective measures [were] within its control,\" <em>Caldwell</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11963734\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/966/33/#p46\">966 F.Supp. at 46</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-57\">Defendant TriNet argues that the plaintiff has not satisfied <em>Caldwell</em>'s standard <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"208\" href=\"#p208\" id=\"p208\">*208</a>because the plaintiff \"does not allege ... that he [contacted defendant TriNet about an accommodation] (and in fact he did not),\" and in any event, \"[defendant] TriNet [does not] control[ ] such decisions ... [because] it does not dictate the essential functions of the jobs designed by and performed for [defendant Trustify] or determine what may be a hardship ... to accommodate.\" TriNet's Reply at 2-3. First, the Court cannot agree that the absence of an allegation that the plaintiff directly contacted defendant TriNet regarding his accommodation requests forecloses the plaintiff's ability to show that defendant TriNet knew about the requests. As already explained, the plaintiff has alleged that defendant TriNet not only knew of his accommodations requests, but also \"permitted\" defendant Trustify to refuse to satisfy those requests. <em>See</em> 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 39. Furthermore, the allegation that defendant TriNet knew about the requests is made plausible by the instruction in the TriNet Employee Handbook that \"[a]ll [Trustify] managers should immediately report ... matters [regarding concerns about accommodation requests] to a TriNet HR Representative.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 22.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, the issue of whether defendant TriNet had control over decisions related to the plaintiff's accommodation requests and other terms of employment is a factual one that must be resolved in the plaintiff's favor for purposes of assessing a fraudulent joinder claim. <em>See</em> <em>Walter E.

CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-60\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that defendant TriNet has failed to satisfy its burden to demonstrate that diversity jurisdiction exists in this case.
