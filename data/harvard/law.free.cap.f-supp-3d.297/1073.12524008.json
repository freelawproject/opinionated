He names Daniel Jaffurs, Amanda Gosman, The Regents of the University of California, Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, Rady Children's Specialists, Rady Children's Medical Staff, Children's Hospital of Orange County (\"CHOC\") and CHOC Medical Staff as defendants. Plaintiff alleges Defendants conspired to engage in and engaged in illegal, retaliatory, defamatory and anti-competitive conduct against Plaintiff, a pediatric plastic and craniofacial surgeon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant CHOC and CHOC Medial Staff (\"CHOC Defendants\") filed an answer to the FAC on August 31, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29. Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, Rady Children's Specialist of San Diego, Rady Children's Medical Staff and Gosman (\"Rady Defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss the FAC on September 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 32. On September 13, 2016, The Regents filed a motion to dismiss the FAC and a joinder in the co-defendants' motions to dismiss, and Jaffurs filed a motion to dismiss the FAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 36, 37. On October 14, 2016, the Rady Defendants and Defendant Jaffurs filed separate motions to strike (\"anti-SLAPP motions\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 41, 42. Thereafter, Defendant The Regents filed a notice of joinder in the motions to strike and Defendant Jaffurs filed a notice of joinder in the Rady Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 43, 45. On October 24, 2016, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed The Regents from the action without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 28, 2016, Plaintiff filed an application seeking leave to conduct discovery relevant to Defendants' anti-SLAPP motions and to continue the hearing and dates to file his opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 49. In light of the application, the Court vacated the hearing date and briefing schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51. Plaintiff's application for leave to conduct discovery was referred to the Honorable Nita L. Stormes, United States Magistrate Judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed a response to Defendant Jaffurs' motion to dismiss and the Rady Defendants' motion to dismiss on November 2, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 58, 59. Defendants filed replies in support of their motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 61, 62. Thereafter, the Court vacated the hearing date on the motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 23, 2016, Judge Stormes issued an order denying Plaintiff's request not to stay general discovery and granting his request to conduct limited, specific discovery with respect to the claims raised in the anti-SLAPP motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 64. On January 23, 2017, Defendant filed an application seeking an order setting the motions to dismiss and anti-SLAPP motions for hearing which Plaintiff opposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 65, 66. The Court denied the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 3, 2017, Judge Stormes held a status conference regarding discovery and issued an order, following the conference, lifting the stay on discovery and setting a scheduling order for discovery relating to the anti-SLAPP motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 71. Plaintiff filed a motion to compel which Judge Stormes granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. Judge Stormes also set a briefing schedule on the pending motions to dismiss and anti-SLAPP motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 77. Defendant Jaffurs and the Rady Defendants objected to Judge Stormes' order granting the motion to compel and requested this Court reverse Judge Stormes' order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 81. The parties briefed the issue upon order of the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 84, 85, 86, 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed an application seeking an order vacating the briefing schedule and hearing date on the anti-SLAPP motions pending the resolution of Defendant's objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 88. The Rady Defendants opposed the application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 89. This Court granted Plaintiff's application and vacated the briefing schedule and hearing date for Defendants' anti-SLAPP motions. Thereafter, the Court vacated the hearing on Defendants' motion to dismiss and took the motions under submission without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Defendants contend Plaintiff only alleges his application for privileges has been presumptively denied. They maintain, if the application is ultimately denied, Plaintiff must seek relief through an administrative hearing, and after the administrative process is completed, he must successfully have the decision set aside in a\n   <em>\n    mandamus\n   </em>\n   action before bringing a tort action for damages. Because he does not allege any facts to show a final decision was reached or that he complied with the administrative process, they argue, the state law causes of action, bad faith professional review, defamation, tortious interference with prospective economic relations and unfair competition, are premature and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff contends he is not required to exhaust his administrative remedies because he was not provided a reason for his rejection or an opportunity to respond and, thereby, was denied basic procedural protections to which he was entitled when his application was presumptively denied. Even if he were required to exhaust administrative remedies, Plaintiff argues, he is excused from doing so because any pursuit would be inadequate and futile. He maintains, at the time his opposition was filed, over a year had passed since his application and nine months since it was presumptively denied, and he has received no adequate explanation for the presumptive denial and no opportunity to respond. Any further attempts to exhaust the remedies would, therefore, be futile. Additionally, he maintains pursuit of administrative remedies would result in irreparable harm because complex pediatric craniofacial plastic surgery procedures must be performed regularly for a surgeon to maintain qualifications to perform them, and Defendants' administrative process has harmed the health and safety of patients with longer wait times and higher costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue Plaintiff's claims do not fall under any exception to the exhaustion requirement. Defendants contend Plaintiff cannot allege his application was denied because his application is still pending. They maintain the presumptive denial demonstrates the peer review process has begun and he has not been denied a fair procedure. Even if Plaintiff could allege presumptive denial entitled him to relief, he is still required to bring a writ of mandate to challenge the decision. Additionally, Defendants argue the administrative remedies available are not inadequate or futile because he has not received a final disposition and could possibly receive privileges. They also argue he has adequate remedies after a decision is made and he could provide services to children at other hospitals at which he has privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff alleges he received a call from the chair of Rady Children's department of surgery, and was told his application for admitting privileges would presumptively be denied and Rady Children's failed to grant him an interview or hearing despite repeated requests. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 33, 87, 88, 94. He further alleges he was advised he would be presumptively reported to the California Medical Board if he did not withdraw his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. Plaintiff did not withdraw his application and, instead, supplemented it in March and July 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 91, 93. Defendants contends the peer review process is ongoing and, therefore, Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and, can only do so when he receives a denial and is successful in a\n   <em>\n    mandamus\n   </em>\n   action. Plaintiff maintains he is not required to exhaust prior to bringing a tort action pursuant to the exception in\n   <em>\n    Westlake\n   </em>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Westlake\n   </em>\n   held that a hospital that denies a doctor privileges without basic procedural protection to which he is entitled can be immediately sued in a tort action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2292829\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/17/465/\">\n    17 Cal.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2090\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20P.2d%20410\">\n    551 P.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's allegations that Defendants denied him a hearing or interview after being informed his application was \"presumptively denied\" and threats to report him to the Medical Board if he does not withdraw his application demonstrate he was denied basic procedural protections. As such, Plaintiff is not required to exhaust the administrative remedies prior to filing suit. Additionally, the court in\n   <em>\n    Westlake\n   </em>\n   specifically rejected the same argument raised by Defendants here, that, under these circumstances, Plaintiff must still obtain\n   <em>\n    mandamus\n   </em>\n   relief prior to filing suit. While the court determined that a doctor must initially succeed in a\n   <em>\n    mandamus\n   </em>\n   action when a hospital excludes or\n   dismisses a doctor pursuant to quasi-judicial proceedings, it found the hospital's conduct in dismissing the doctor without basic procedural protections was not \"undertaken pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20P.2d%20410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court finds Plaintiff's action is not barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

They further maintain the allegations of the FAC make clear the Rady Defendants acted as agents of each other.

Plaintiff further argues the issue of whether the various Rady Defendants are a single entity is fact specific and cannot be decided in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Even if the Rady Defendants and Gosman cannot conspire among themselves, Plaintiff contends the FAC clearly alleges the conspirators include Jaffurs, who is not affiliated with the Rady Defendants. Plaintiff maintains the FAC contains numerous specific facts creating a reasonable inference that Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to deny him privileges at Rady Children's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Jaffurs, the chief of plastic surgery of the CHOC medical staff and an employee of University of California, Irvine (\"UCI\"),\n   made false and defamatory statements about Plaintiff to the Rady Defendants and in concert with Gosman, \"who was eager to conspire...because in 2015 she became the sole pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeon at Rady Children's\" and she viewed Plaintiff as a competitive threat.

Assuming the relevant product/service market is appropriate, Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to allege a relevant geographic market. Specifically, Defendants argue Plaintiff does not plead any facts to support the conclusion that San Diego and Imperial Counties are the only areas where buyers of pediatric plastic and craniofacial surgery would travel to obtain such specialized services. They maintain nothing in the FAC supports the notion that Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County and San Bernardino County should not be included in the geographic market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff maintains the question of the relevant geographic market does not turn on whether a patient would either obtain the surgery in San Diego and Imperial Counties or go without, as suggested by Defendants, but whether patients in San Diego and Imperial Counties would tolerate a small but significant nontransitory increase in price by the Rady pediatric craniofacial plastic surgery group. Plaintiff maintains this is a question of fact that implicates complicated issues of insurance coverage and in-network benefits versus out-of-network benefits, and cannot be resolved at the pleading stage. He contends the question before the Court is whether a geographic market of San Diego and Imperial Counties is \"facially\" sustainable, and argues the relevant market defined in the FAC clears this low threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff defines the relevant market as pediatric and craniofacial surgery medical services in San Diego and Imperial Counties.

He argues Defendants do not dispute their monopoly power in the geographic market as defined in the FAC. Plaintiff also alleges the practice of pediatric craniofacial plastic surgery is viable only for medical facilities dedicated to pediatric patients and Rady Children's is the only hospital serving San Diego and Imperial Counties that offers the practice environment necessary for pediatric craniofacial plastic surgery.

Defendants' challenge to Plaintiff's allegations of monopoly power are based upon their argument that the alleged geographic market is improper. As discussed above, Plaintiff's identified market is facially sustainable, and Plaintiff clearly alleges Defendants have 100% of the market within San Diego and Imperial counties. Accordingly, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges monopoly power to state a claim for monopolization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defendants maintain the conspiracy theory fails for many of the same reasons it argues the conspiracy claim fails under Section 1 including: (1) the Rady Defendants are part of a single entity, incapable of conspiring with one another under antitrust laws; (2) Dr. Gosman was an employee and/or agent of the Rady Defendants, and therefore, cannot conspire with the Rady Defendants for antitrust purposes; and (3) there are no factual allegations to support any conspiratorial communications between Dr. Gosman and the Rady Defendants. Defendants also maintain Plaintiff alleges different participants for the conspiracy of the Section 2 claim and Defendant Jaffurs had no involvement in the Section 2 claim. Defendants argue this difference calls into question the plausibility of both conspiracy theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff argues the FAC contains numerous factual allegations that, taken as true, sufficiently allege a conspiracy among Jaffurs, Gosman, and the Rady defendants to deny Plaintiff procedurally fair consideration of his application for privileges at Rady Children's and alleges that Gosman and the Rady defendants acted with the specific intent to monopolize, and sets forth their economic rationale for doing so. Plaintiff further argues Defendants misread the FAC and/or misapprehend the Sherman Act. He maintains he alleges a single conspiracy among all Defendants who assisted with Defendants Jaffurs' and Gosman's coordinated efforts to have his application for privileges denied. He contends all Defendants are included in the first claim for relief because Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits restraint of trade. Additionally, he contends the second claim for relief details how Gosman and the Rady defendants conspired to maintain their monopoly on pediatric craniofacial plastic surgery in the relevant market. He maintains Defendant Jaffurs is not named in that claim because, athough he is one of the primary actors behind the conspiracy, he is not the monopolist. Plaintiff argues the first and second claims do not allege two separate and independent conspiracies, but rather set forth separate causes of action arising from the same conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   A review of the FAC supports Plaintiffs contention that he seeks two separate causes of action, restraint of trade and monopoly, against different defendants based upon the same conspiracy. As discussed above in section I.B.1., Plaintiff sufficiently alleges a conspiracy amongst the various defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Antitrust Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants contend Plaintiff has not alleged any facts to show consumer welfare has been harmed. Additionally, they contend, Plaintiff fails to plead facts supporting a plausible claim under Section 2 and, therefore, none of his alleged injuries flow directly from that provision of the antitrust laws. Thus, Defendants argue, Plaintiff has not suffered antitrust injury under Section 2 and the second claim for relief must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff maintains he alleges Defendants' exclusionary conduct prevents certain highly complex pediatric craniofacial surgery procedures from being available at all in San Diego and Imperial Counties because he is an expert in certain procedures that Gosman does not perform, and their exclusionary conduct has resulted in longer patient wait times and higher costs. Taken as true, he argues, these factual allegations show harm to competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue Plaintiff's mere frustration to gain access to a hospital does not amount to an antitrust injury. Defendants also argue Plaintiff's allegations of longer patient wait times and higher costs are nothing more than conclusory allegations without any factual support and are based on Plaintiff's incorrect description of the relevant market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As discussed in section I.B.4. above, Plaintiff's factual allegations sufficiently plead antitrust injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Bad Faith Professional Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiff's claim for the alleged violation of California Business &amp; Professions Code 809.05 arguing there is no separate right for civil remedies. They further contend, even if a viable cause of action did exist, any attempt to invoke this section is premature because Plaintiff only alleges his privileges have presumptively been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff argues Defendants provide no authority for their contention that a physician cannot bring a civil claim to enforce rights included in section 809. Plaintiff contends section 809 expressly recognizes that physicians are harmed by peer review that is not conducted fairly, and provides the right to a review process that is not arbitrary or capricious and a specific procedure to safeguard the rights of physicians. He maintains the legislation provides for administrative remedies but does not provide a means to enforce the rights contained therein. Citing\n   <em>\n    Jacobellis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

Plaintiff contends he alleges sufficient facts to support a claim for relief for violation of section 809.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue Plaintiff misrepresents\n   <em>\n    Jacobellis\n   </em>\n   and the Restatement test to artificially create an implied private right of action. They contend there is no support for a private right of action under section 809, and plaintiff has provided no authority to show otherwise.

They contend the entirety\n   of Plaintiff's lawsuit involves the alleged presumptive denial of privileges at Rady Children's, and therefore, any alleged statements were made as part of the peer review process used to evaluate Plaintiff's application for privileges. They maintain this peer review process must be considered a judicial proceeding, and therefore, any alleged defamatory statements by Defendant Gosman or anyone representing the Rady Defendants during the evaluation of Plaintiff's application for privileges are absolutely privileged under section 47(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiff argues, as a threshold matter, determining whether a defendant is entitled to immunity under Section 47(b) is generally a question of fact. He further argues, even if the Court considers Defendants' fact-based argument now, Defendants are not entitled to immunity under Section 47(b), because defendants have not engaged in the kind of quasi-judicial proceeding that courts have recognized as subject to Section 47(b), and because Gosman's statements were not made in connection with a legitimate peer review process. Plaintiff maintains there was no administrative hearing, much less one conducted in a manner similar to a judicial proceeding, including notice, informal pleading and hearing. Instead, he maintains his application was \"screened out.\" Pla's Opp. at 19. He argues Defendants' cursory screening out of his application, without any legitimate peer review, is not protected activity. He further argues, even if Defendants' conduct could be considered a quasi-judicial process subject to section 47(b), Gosman's unlawful conduct was not entirely related to or connected with that process. He maintains Defendant Gosman's conduct preceded any colorable peer review by several months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue Plaintiff too narrowly limits the scope and purpose of the litigation privilege. They maintain section 47(b) applies to statements made in the course of, and preparatory to, official proceedings authorized by law. Defendants contend Plaintiff's email inquiring about employment and privileges at Rady Children's, alone, effectively triggers the start of the peer review process. They argue the allegedly defamatory statements are absolutely protected by the litigation privilege of section 47(b), because they were made in connection with an official proceeding that started when Plaintiff emailed Gosman in July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As discussed above, Plaintiff's allegations demonstrate there have been no quasi-judicial proceedings.

They contend Plaintiff has not and cannot show they lacked a good faith intent to aid in Plaintiff's evaluation. Additionally, they contend the allegation that Plaintiff received a call from Dr. Carvalho who told Plaintiff his application was being presumptively denied shows the Rady Defendants and Defendant Gosman were in the process of reviewing Plaintiff's application, and, thus, the alleged defamatory statements fall within the protections of section 43.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendants also argue the alleged statements are privileged under California Civil Code section 47(c) because the statements were made in the interest of the operation of Rady Children's. Defendants maintain the Rady Defendants and Defendant Gosman, as the Chief of Plastic Surgery at Rady Children's, have a common interest in Plaintiff's application for privileges as a craniofacial plastic surgeon at Rady Children's. Additionally, they contend Plaintiff failed to plead any facts alleging they acted with malice. Instead, they maintain, Plaintiff merely speculates Defendants acted with malice, and, they argue, Plaintiff's conclusory speculation is not supported by any facts. They maintain, if they did make or repeat a statement regarding Plaintiff's job performance with a former employer, it would fall squarely within the scope of common interest under section 47(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff argues Defendants are not immune under section 43.8 and 47(c) because Defendants' statements were not intended to aid in his evaluation and were made with malice. He maintains section 43.8 provides no immunity if the person asserting the privilege lacked a good faith intent to assist in the evaluation. Plaintiff asserts he extensively pleads Defendants' true intent by alleging Defendant Jaffurs harbored malice toward Plaintiff and viewed Plaintiff as an economic threat to his pediatric plastic and craniofacial surgery practice in Orange County, and Defendant Gosman viewed Plaintiff's arrival as a competitive threat to her status as the sole practicing pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeon at Rady Children's. Thus, he argues, in making the defamatory statements alleged, neither Jaffurs nor Gosman acted with the subjective purpose or goal to assist in Plaintiff's evaluation. Rather, he maintains. Defendant Gosman acted with the purpose of denying him fair consideration of his application for admitting privileges at Rady Children's, and preserving her position as the sole pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeon at Rady Children's. Additionally, the other Rady Defendants similarly acted with the purpose of preventing Plaintiff from obtaining privileges at Rady Children's, to further their economic incentive to exclude physicians who are not employed by the Rady Foundation. Thus, he argues, no defendant acted with the purpose protected by section 43.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff further maintains sections 43.8 and 47(c) provide only qualified immunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   He contends Defendants are not entitled to immunity under either section 43.8 or 47(c), because they acted with malice, and without reasonable grounds for belief in the truth of their statements. Plaintiff maintains he alleges all Defendants, including the Rady defendants, knew the statements were false, and the evidence available to them proved the statements were false, and he specifically alleges the Rady defendants failed to take reasonable care to determine the truth or falsity of the statements at issue, as they did not contact Plaintiff or the numerous physicians who sent letters to Rady Children's refuting Defendant Jaffurs' statements and offering support to Plaintiff's application for admitting privileges. He argues Defendants' defamatory and anti-competitive purposes, combined with their deliberate falsehoods and false statements made without reasonable grounds to believe them true, take their conduct outside the scope of the qualified protections otherwise provided by sections 43.8 and 47(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue the alleged statements are privileged because they were made in order to evaluate Plaintiff for staff privileges and Defendants would have a strong interest in receiving such information. They further argue there is nothing in the FAC setting forth facts that the alleged statements were motivated by hatred or ill will towards Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants knew the statements to be false, and the evidence available to defendants proved the statements false. Defendants Dr. Gosman, Rady Children's, Rady Foundation, UCSD and Rady Children's Medical Staff failed to take reasonable care to determine the truth or falsity of the statements, as they did not, for example, contact Dr. Toranto or the numerous physicians who sent letters to Rady Children's refuting Dr. Jaffur's statements and offering unconditional support to Dr. Toranto's application for admitting privileges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   FAC \u00b6 163.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges Defendant Gosman viewed Plaintiff as a competitive threat to her status as the sole practicing pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeon at Rady Children's and was motivated by her desire to suppress competition in her local market to her benefit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 96, 116.

Specifically, they argue\n   Plaintiff makes conclusory allegations that an economic relationship was established between Plaintiff and the Rady Defendants or Plaintiff and Dr. Gosman based on speculation. They maintain Plaintiff's allegation that Defendant Gosman's response to his email that there was enough craniofacial coverage at Rady Children's regarding his interest in potentially relocating to San Diego shows that a relationship was not established or intended to be established between Plaintiff and Dr. Gosman or the Rady Defendants.

Additionally, the Plaintiff alleges Defendant made defamatory statements he knew to be untrue to Rady Children's with the intent to professionally harm Plaintiff and Plaintiff obtained letters from other physicians which described Defendant's allegations against Plaintiff as false, unprofessional and having no basis in fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Assuming the truth of Plaintiff's non-conclusory allegations, Defendant's statements were knowingly false, made with malice and lacked the intent to assist the peer review or credentialing decisions.

Sections 47(b) and 821.6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The immunity provided by section 47(b) is laid out in section I.E.2.a. Under section 821.6, \"a public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously or without probable cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Defendant argues he is entitled to immunity under section 47(b) and section 821.6 because the alleged statements arose during a medical peer review process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Plaintiff contends Defendant's arguments in support of immunity under sections 47(b) and 821.6 are not appropriate at this stage of the proceedings because entitlement to immunity under these sections is usually a question of fact. Even if the Court considers the arguments, Plaintiff contends Defendant is not protected by section 821.6 because he did not institute or prosecute anything, and his statements were made to serve his own purposes and out of deep-seated personal animosity towards Plaintiff. He further contends Defendant is not entitled to immunity under these sections because the defamatory statements were made outside the context of a peer review process and long before peer review began. Additionally, he argues Defendant continued his wrongful conduct by making false statements to the Rady Defendants after Plaintiff submitted his application outside the kind of formal or quasi-judicial proceeding that courts have\n   recognized as protected. Plaintiff maintains there has been no such formal or quasi-judicial proceeding, but, instead, the Rady Defendants conducted a cursory screening out of his application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Defendant argues, in reply, the statements were made in anticipation of or during the peer review process, and therefore, are absolutely protected. He further argues he acted in his professional capacity as an employee of UCI, so Plaintiff's claim that he was acting to serve his own purposes is not plausible. Defendant also argues Plaintiff's application has not been screened out because it has not yet been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As discussed above, Plaintiff's allegations demonstrate there have been no quasi-judicial proceedings and the question of whether the statements were made to achieve the objects of a quasi-judicial proceeding is a question of fact not suitable for disposition on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

While the court in\n   <em>\n    De La Torre v. Progress Rail Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204607730\">\n    2015 WL 4607730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D.Cal. 2015) found the language ambiguous, it made no determination as to whether the statute permitted individual liability when it remanded the action to state court. This Court is persuaded by the district courts' distillation of the statutory language and, similarly, finds no individual liability under section 1102.5. As such, Defendant's motion is granted as to the claim for retaliation under section 1102.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Unfair Competition Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Defendant argues Plaintiff's claim under the UCL is insufficiently pled and fatally vague. Specifically, he argues Plaintiff fails to allege a claim under the unfair prong because he does not allege harm to the victim outweighs any benefit, and he fails to allege a claim under the fraudulent prong because he does not allege conduct that is likely to deceive members of the public. He further argues Plaintiff fails to state a claim under the unlawful prong because he has not identified a pattern or practice of specific unlawful conduct and only asserts harm to himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Plaintiff argues he alleges Defendant engaged in unlawful and unfair conduct by violating the Sherman Act, retaliating\n   against Plaintiff, engaging in defamation, violating section 1050 and interfering with Plaintiff's prospective economic relations. Plaintiff also contends an act may violate the UCL even if the practice only affects one victim. Additionally, he contends he alleges Defendant's conduct injured competition to the detriment of seriously disabled infants and children. Plaintiff also maintains he alleges Defendant acted for anti-competitive purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In reply, Defendant argues Plaintiff fails to allege how Defendant's conduct in Orange County impacted children in San Diego and fails to allege Defendant worked in San Diego/Imperial counties to permit an inference of anticompetitive motive to keep Plaintiff off Rady Children's staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Plaintiff does not address Defendant's contention that he does not assert a claim under the fraudulent prong. Furthermore, there are no allegations the Defendant's conduct is likely to deceive members of the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schnall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"196763\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/78/1144/#p1167\">\n    78 Cal.App.4th at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20439\">\n    93 Cal.Rptr.2d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   As stated above, an unlawful practice that affects only one victim may still violate the UCL.\n   <em>\n    Blanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124190\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/171/336/#p364\">\n    171 Cal.App.4th at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20710\">\n    89 Cal.Rptr.3d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, as discussed above, Plaintiff sufficiently asserts violations of the Sherman Act, defamation and retaliation to support a claim under the unlawful prong. The Court also finds Plaintiff alleges Defendant's conduct in making defamatory statements harmed competition. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 8, 29. Accordingly, the motion is denied as to the UCL claim under the unfair and unlawful prongs, and is granted under the fraudulent prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Relations Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Defendant argues Plaintiff's tortious interference with economic relations claim fails because Defendant engaged in protected speech not actionable as defamation. He further argues he fails to state sufficient facts showing a relationship with CHOC or Rady Children's that was harmed by the alleged wrongful conduct. Additionally, Defendant argues Plaintiff sets forth conclusory assumptions to support his claim that he was not hired as a result of Defendant's statements. Defendant also contends Plaintiff fails to allege harm because he resigned from UCI and he still treats patients at CHOC, and Plaintiff's application is still pending at Rady Children's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff argues he sufficiently alleges a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic relations. He maintains the FAC alleges he joined the medical staff at CHOC, and thus, had an existing relationship with it when he sought employment with the CHOC Foundation, and, given his relationship with CHOC, he had a reasonable expectation that his relationship with the CHOC Foundation would develop into an employment relationship. He further maintains he alleges Defendant made false and defamatory statements to the CHOC Foundation in order to prevent his employment. Additionally, he maintains he establishes harm by alleging the CHOC Foundation did not hire him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In reply, Defendant argues his statements to the CHOC Foundation were protected as part of its employment application process and Plaintiff fails to allege Defendant caused the denial of his application. He also contends Plaintiff's presumption that he had some economic relationship with the CHOC Foundation is not plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   In support of his claim for tortious interference with prospective economic relations, Plaintiff alleges he was in a relationship with the CHOC Foundation, an entity closely affiliated with CHOC, with whom Plaintiff worked during his employment at UCI. FAC \u00b6 183. He further alleges the\n   CHOC Foundation employed many physicians who had admitting privileges at CHOC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff alleges he entered into employment discussions with the CHOC Foundation in 2015, and Defendant intended to disrupt the relationship between Plaintiff and the CHOC Foundation and made false and defamatory statements to the CHOC Foundation about Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 185-187.

As discussed above, Plaintiff's allegations based upon economic relations with Rady Children's does not support a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Based on the foregoing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   1.
