Because the defendants did not answer or otherwise respond to the complaint within the time period allotted by Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiffs requested an entry of default. Dkt. 5. The plaintiffs also mailed a copy of their request to the defendants. Dkt. 5-4. The Clerk of the Court entered default on March 13, 2017. Dkt. 7; Dkt. 8. On September 1, 2017, the plaintiffs moved this Court to enter a default judgment against the defendants under Rule 55(b)(2). Dkt. 9.

LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure empower a federal district court to enter a default judgment against a defendant who fails to defend its case.

Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Obtaining a default judgment is a two-step process. First, the plaintiff must request that the Clerk of Court enter default against a party who has failed to plead or otherwise defend. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). The Clerk's default entry establishes the defaulting defendant's liability for the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boland v. Providence Constr.

Second, if the plaintiff's claim is not for a \"sum certain,\" the plaintiff must apply to the court for a default judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b). At that point, the plaintiff \"must prove his entitlement to the relief requested using detailed affidavits or documentary evidence on which the court may rely.\"\n   <em>\n    Ventura v. L.A.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Canales is JSP's president and owner. \"Officers of a corporation do not fall within ERISA's definition of an 'employer,' and thus officers cannot be held personally liable for a corporation's alleged ERISA violations by virtue of their relationship\n   to the employer alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

In particular, the plaintiffs do not allege that (1) Canales and JSP lack separate personalities due to a unity of interest and ownership, based on factors such as the nature of corporate ownership and control, failure to maintain adequate corporate records and formalities, and commingling of funds and corporate assets; and (2) an inequitable result would follow if the JSP's actions were treated as those of JSP alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Labadie Coal Co. v.
