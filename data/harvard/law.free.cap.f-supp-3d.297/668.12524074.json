More particularly, the '139 Patent describes a wireless communication system in which a plurality of base stations are classified into a plurality of groups, and a method for selecting one of the plurality of base stations to connect to a terminal based on calculated characterized quantities of communication quality for each group. As shown in Figure 1, the method described in the '139 Patent obtains an index of communication quality (e.g., a received power, bit rate or signal-to-noise ratio) for each base station (step 102), calculates a group score (e.g., a total power or average power) for each group of base stations (step 103), specifies one of the groups based on the group score (step 104), and selects one of base stations in the specified group to establish a connection (step 105). In one example, the group with the largest total power is specified and a base station within that group is selected to connect to a wireless terminal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , '139 Patent 2:37-64, 4:45-5:12, Figure 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"a storage unit in which group information generated by classifying the plurality of base stations into groups\" ( '139 Patent claim 11)\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-53\"><strong>Maxell's Proposed Construction</strong> <strong>Huawei's Proposed Construction</strong> \"Not indefinite; plain and ordinary meaning\" \"Indefinite because the claim term does not inform those skilled in the art about the claim's scope with reasonable certainty</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Huawei contends that the claim language contains \"an obvious grammatical error that renders the term indefinite because one of skill in the art would be unable to determine with reasonable certainty which of (at least) two possible corrections to make.\" Docket No. 100 at 9.

The parties both agree that as drafted the claim contains an error. The Federal Circuit has held that a district court can \"act to correct an error in a patent by interpretation of a patent where no certification of correction has been issued ... only if (1) the correction is not subject to reasonable debate based on consideration of the claim language and the specification and (2) the prosecution history does not suggest a different interpretation of the claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Novo Indus., L.P. v.

In effect, Huawei seeks to limit \"a storage unit\" to \"a RAM storage unit\" but has pointed to no lexicography, disclaimer or disavowal in the intrinsic record indicating that the term \"storage unit\" should be so limited. Even Huawei's own expert states that one skilled in the art would recognize that \"storage unit\" is a term that is not limited to RAM but inclusive of multiple types of memory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Akl Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 173-79.

The mobile handset also receives transmissions from cellular base stations, determines the position of the mobile handset using the cellular signals, and calculates the reliability of the cellular position.

Further, a reliability factor is output from each of the cellular and GPS calculation units even when it is determined that a position calculation is impossible for the particular unit. '292 Patent 3:64-4:3, 4:36-42. The specification describes and shows the position being output to the combiner in all cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063954\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/1331/#p1344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Figures 1-3, 3:33-59, 3:64-4:3, 4:10-35, 4:36-42. Maxell's construction would encompass a system that merely selected one or the other of GPS and cellular-for example switching between the two. Construing \"combining\" / \"combined\" to mean a determination based on one or more inputs would allow for selection and, thus, ignore the language of the claim and the clear corresponding scope of the specification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:49-56, Abstract, 2:13-18, 3:12-17, 4:43-49, 5:7-12, Figures 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Maxell contends that Huawei's construction excludes the \"value of 0\" embodiment in which one of the GPS position or cellular position will have \"no effect on further processing.\" In that embodiment, however, the data from both the GPS and cellular units is still provided to the combiner. The specification and the claims do not state that in such a situation the data is not combined; instead, the specification explains that the reliability weighting is adjusted to achieve the \"no effect.\" That one value may have a corresponding reliability set at zero to have no effect does not mean that the data from the two units is not provided to the combining unit for combining. As described, both values are still output to the combiner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, as noted in the specification, the \"mobile handset of the present invention preferably combines the positioning results obtained by both of [the GPS and cellular]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   positioning means [with] the reliability of the positioning... [so that] the mobile handset can accurately determine its position in diverse ambient conditions and environments.\" '292 Patent 2:13-18. The specification describes a mathematical function (shown in Figure 3) for combining the four inputs supplied to the combining unit 400/410. Although combining all four inputs is preferable, the specification notes that the GPS position results (or the cellular position results) supplied to the combining unit may not be accurate. '292 Patent 3:64-4:3, 4:36-42. When this occurs, the reliability value corresponding to the inaccurate GPS or cellular position is set to 0, so that when the GPS/cellular position and reliability values are combined in the mathematical function, the inaccurate GPS or cellular position has no effect on the position calculation result. '292 Patent 4:43-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Maxell's construction would enable the combining unit to determine a position calculation result based on only one, two, three or four of the inputs being supplied to the combining unit. For example, Maxell's construction could enable the combining unit to determine the position of the mobile device based on GPS position alone without ever receiving the other values. This is in direct contrast to the scope of the invention and the claims themselves.

In light of Maxell's unsupported view of \"combining\" and to clearly address that dispute between the parties, the Court makes clear the usage of all of the factors (though a factor could be set to \"0\" to provide \"no effect\" for certain factors) as described in the specification by construing the term to require \"merging.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l Ltd. v.

In the '440 Patent, a moving picture corresponding to a selected one of the thumbnail images is output or displayed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '440 Patent 10:41-11:14, 11:31-12:50, Figures 4 and 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    11. \"still pictures encoded by a second encoding method, and second pictures corresponding to the still pictures and having a smaller number of pixels than the still pictures are recorded\" ( '440 Patent claims 1, 3, 5, and 7)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-149\"><strong>Maxell's Proposed Construction</strong> <strong>Huawei's Proposed Construction</strong> Plain and ordinary meaning \"still pictures encoded by the first encoding method and by a second encoding method, and second pictures corresponding to the still pictures and having a smaller number of pixels than the still pictures are recorded\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Maxell contends that the fact that this term does not require any construction is apparent from Huawei's proposed construction, which parrots the claim language with the exception that Huawei adds the underlined phrase: \"still pictures encoded\n   <em>\n    by the first encoding method and\n   </em>\n   by a second encoding method....\" Docket No. 95 at 9.

Huawei seeks not to interpret any word or phrase in the claim, but, rather, seeks to add a whole limitation missing from the claim language. As noted by Maxell, the specification does disclose an embodiment that includes still pictures encoded by the second encoding method (pointing to Figures 2 and 4). Though Huawei may be correct that this embodiment also teaches still pictures produced by the first encoding method (moving picture encoding method), Huawei has not identified intrinsic evidence mandating this additional limitation to be added to the clear claim language. Huawei has not pointed to clear language in the intrinsic record of lexicography, disavowal or disclaimer mandating that the still pictures must also be ones produced by the first encoding method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GE Lighting Solutions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066341\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1304/#p1309\">\n    750 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1309 ;\n   <em>\n    Cordis Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480485\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/1319/#p1329\">\n    561 F.3d at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Huawei does point to the embodiments of the specification. However, even if a limitation is in all embodiments, that is not necessarily enough to read a limitation into the claim from the specification.\n   <em>\n    Arlington Indus., Inc. v. Bridgeport Fittings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088182\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1246/#p1254\">\n    632 F.3d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1254 (Fed.

As noted by Maxell, the specification does support an interpretation that still pictures are encoded by a second encoding method (the JPEG encoding format). '440 Patent Figure 4. That the figure also shows pictures encoded by a first encoding method (the moving picture encoding format) does not mandate, however, that the claimed still pictures must be encoded by two different encoding formats. As noted by Maxell, for example, the specification does describe embodiments in which one may omit \"converting the format of the fine still picture signals to the same signal format as that of the single frame moving picture signals\" and \"no fine still picture signal is output.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:51-64.

The prosecution history speaks to a claim in which the claim language at issue included \"still pictures encoded by the first encoding method by which moving pictures are encoded.\" Docket No. 100-19 at 2. Further, the fact that the claim language of that patent explicitly includes such language further emphasizes that the term \"still pictures\" itself does not mandate still pictures are encoded by the moving picture encoding method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/\">\n    415 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To take a simple example, the claim in this case refers to 'steel baffles,' which strongly implies that the term 'baffles' does not inherently mean objects made of steel.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Finally, the '440 Patent file history is-at most-ambiguous and does not make an affirmative statement regarding the \"still pictures encoded by a first encoding method.\" The '440 Patent claims do recite \"moving pictures encoded by a first encoding method and\n   <em>\n    first pictures\n   </em>\n   having a smaller number of pixels than the moving pictures\" (emphasis added). Separately, the '440 Patent claims recite that what is recorded is \"the moving pictures, the first pictures, as well as still pictures encoded by a second encoding method, and second pictures corresponding to the still pictures\n   and having a smaller number of pixels than the still pictures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The chart cited by Huawei from the '440 Patent file history does not represent to the '440 Patent claims in multiple respects. For example, the claims do not recite \"first still picture\" and \"second still picture,\" as identified in the chart but instead call out first pictures, second pictures and still pictures which have the corresponding second pictures. In relation to the claim language, the chart does not indicate that the \"still pictures encoded by a second encoding method\" and which have \"second pictures corresponding to the still pictures\" are still pictures encoded by both MPEG and JPEG standards. Further, the chart purports to relate to claims 1-8, yet it is only claims 2, 4, 6, and 8 which incorporate MPEG for the first encoding method and JPEG for the second encoding method. Finally, it is noted that the use of the chart was explicitly presented during prosecution to argue that Anderson \"doesn't disclose applicant's 'outputting a moving picture corresponding to any selected first picture.' \" Docket No. 119-3 at 10.

As noted by Huawei, such language does not just require identification of movement or rest, but rather some level of the relative speed: \"the movement being faster.\" As noted by Huawei, the disclosures related to the \"switching determination unit\" generally provide for only a determination based on rest versus movement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '517 Patent Figure 4 (block S407), Figure 6 (block\n   S407), Figure 9 (block S910), 5:3-14; 6:28-35, 6:45-52, 6:53-62, 9:5-18, 9:54-10:9. At the oral hearing, Maxell acknowledged that the language \"determines the movement speed being faster\" does not relate to rest versus movement, but rather high speed versus low speed movement. H'rg Tr. at 96:2-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Speed is discussed with regard to the switching priorities. Specifically, Figure 6 section (b) and the passage at 7:45-67 discloses three states: \"rest state priorities,\" \"high speed moving state priorities\" and \"low speed moving state priorities.\" However, these relate to what interface is chosen based on the determination of the moving speed being faster or slower, not changing the waiting time until switching based on the high speed versus low speed. At the oral hearing, Maxell emphasized the passages at 5:3-14 and 9:5-18.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:12-94:21. However, the first passage relates again to the different priorities given, specifically a higher priority given to a portable telephone during movement. '517 Patent 4:64-5:14. The second passage also relates to determining which physical interface to select.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:2-18. Neither passage references changing the wait time \"when said movement determination unit determines the movement speed being faster.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   As discussed in more detail below, with regard to the \"wait\" term, the \"waits a longer time\" concept is disclosed at '517 Patent 6:62-7:8.

Rather, the wait time just changes based on resting versus movement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again however, as the parties agree, the claimed function is not a rest versus movement determination. Rather, the claimed function relates to changing the wait time based on the determination of the movement speed being faster (low speed versus high speed). Maxell has not identified, and the specification provides no disclosure of, any algorithms for performing this claimed function.

Huawei contends that this \"fundamental feature of the alleged invention\" is reflected in its proposed construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Huawei, the claim is not about incidental delays in switching due to the inherent time it takes to analyze wireless signals received by a moving device, as those delays occur whether or not the switching mechanism accounts for moving speed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Instead, Huawei contends, this incidental instability is the alleged problem in the prior art that the patent wants to solve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Huawei contends that the invention attempts to solve the problem by expressly using the device's moving speed as a factor in the interface selection, by waiting longer intentionally before attempting to switch interfaces when the device is moving faster.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing '517 Patent 1:58-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   In response to Maxell's contention that construction is unnecessary, Huawei counters that Maxell's infringement contentions reveal a fundamental dispute over claim scope.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Huawei contends that Maxell alleges infringement of claim 1 by devices that ignore moving speed in their switching decisions, but that may coincidentally\n   take longer to establish a connection because of inherent instability in the connection or temporary reductions in signal strength that occur when moving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Docket No. 100-24 at 59). Huawei contends that if devices ever (incidentally) take longer to switch, it is due to inherent aspects of wireless communication in a moving device, which the '517 Patent sought to ameliorate by expressly using moving speed in the switching decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Huawei contends that unlike a passive word like \"takes\" (i.e., \"takes a longer time\"), \"wait\" implies an intentional delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Huawei further states that the specification likewise speaks of \"setting\" the delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing '517 Patent 6:66-7:5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   As to use of \"may\" in the cited specification passages, Huawei contends that this ignores the text immediately before Maxell's cite noting that the device \"waits for a fixed time for the physical interface to recover\" and only switches \"[i]f the physical interface does not recover even after the fixed time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (citing '517 Patent 6:62-7:8). Huawei contends that \"may\" only means that the fixed time can be set to different intervals; it does not mean that waiting a longer time is optional. Huawei contends that some \"fixed time\" is defined (i.e., \"set\") as the wait time before deciding whether to switch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Huawei has not pointed to any language of lexicography, disclaimer or disavowal in the specification that requires the waiting time to be predetermined in advance. Further, even the passage at 6:62-7:8 merely states that wait times may be set, without requiring setting the time prior to the determination. Accordingly, the claim does not require that the period of time is \"set\" \"before\" the determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Huawei's primary argument is that Maxell's construction is intended to cover incidental waiting that may occur when moving, such incidental waiting that may be irrespective of the determination of the movement determination unit. The surrounding claim language, however, is instructive. The \"waits a long time\" is not just any wait but rather as claimed: \"said selection switching determination unit waits a longer time until switching of said physical interface\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     when said movement determination unit determines\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the moving speed being faster.\" '517 Patent claim 1 (emphasis added). The interaction of the different portions of this phrase requires the longer wait to be based on the determination. Thus, the claim itself requires the longer time to be based on the determination of the movement determination unit. This corresponds also to the specification passage cited by the parties in which the waiting time is dependent upon movement or non-movement. Some incidental change unrelated to the determination is not claimed nor described in the specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   At the oral hearing, the Court proposed a construction with a note that stated that the phrase \"when said movement determination unit determines\" requires the longer wait to be based on the determination. Maxell agreed to such an interpretation. H'rg Tr. at 83:23-84:6. Such an interpretation conforms to the plain and ordinary meaning of the term in context of the surrounding claim limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   The Court construes the term \" waits a longer time until switching\" to have its plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The '443 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The '443 Patent relates generally to power management, more specifically to techniques for conserving battery power by providing for a power saving state. The Abstract of the '443 Patent recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   An information processing apparatus can save an electric power when it is not in use and can be made active immediately after an operation medium such as a pen and a finger or the user approaches\n   or comes in contact with the apparatus, the arrangement being such that a housing portion of the apparatus includes therein a sensor for detecting the approach or contact of a user operation medium or user and a state display unit for informing the user that the apparatus is in the active state or in the standby state, a power saving control unit controls a controlled object concerning a power consumption in response to the approach, contact or separation of the operation medium or user, and a timer included in the electric power saving control unit determines whether or not the operation medium or user is separate from the apparatus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   '443 Patent Abstract. More particularly, the '443 Patent describes an information processing apparatus having detecting means (e.g., a sensor) for detecting the approach or contact of an operation medium (e.g., a pen, or a user's finger, voice, etc.), and control means (e.g., a power saving control unit) for controlling power consumption of the information processing apparatus in response to the detected approach or contact, or the lack thereof for a predetermined time period. In the '443 Patent, the information processing apparatus is set in a non-power saving state if the user approaches or comes in contact with the information processing apparatus. On the other hand, the information processing apparatus is set in a power saving state, if the user has been away from the apparatus (or has not touched the apparatus) for a predetermined time or more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , '443 Patent 2:1-24, 3:58-4:35, Figure 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <strong>\n    17. \"a detecting means for detecting whether a user associated medium at least approaches at least part of a housing of said apparatus\" ( '443 Patent claim 1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-236\"><strong>Maxell's Proposed Construction</strong> <strong>Defendants' Proposed Construction</strong> <strong>Function:</strong> detecting whether a user-associated This term is written as a means-plus-function medium at least approaches at least part of a housing of said apparatus <strong>Function:</strong> for detecting whether a user-associated medium at least approaches at least <strong>Structure:</strong> A sensor, a touch-sensitive a part of a housing of said apparatus surface, or a tablet configured to detect proximity andior contact using one or more of <strong>Structure:</strong> Electromagnetic induction an electromagnetic induction system, a systems, electrostatic coupling system. and capacitance system. a capacitive coupling Optical system, listed in Table 1; system, a pressure-sensitive resistance \"microphone\" (18:8): \"temperature sensor\" system, a transmission pen type ultrasonic (19:12); \"cameras\" (Figs. 14 and 15) system, a surface acoustic wave type ultrasonic system, an optical system, an image sensor, a camera, a microphone, or a temperature sensor, as well as equivalents thereof</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The parties dispute the corresponding structure for the means term, specifically whether approach detection techniques are required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Maxell contends that the '443 Patent associates a sensor with the function of \"detecting\" and lists several examples of structures for the sensor, including \"an image sensor, a microphone or a temperature sensor etc.\" Docket No. 95 at 7 (citing '443 Patent 4:2-6; 4:19-23 (describing the role of the sensor in the overall power-saving scheme) ).

Thus, Maxell contends, the patentee amended the claims to address this issue, not to narrow the scope of the claims to \"approach type.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The claim amendment in question is instructive:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-245\"><strong>1. (Amended) An information processing apparatus comprising:</strong> <strong><em>a housing</em></strong>: [a)] a detecting means for detecting whether [an operation medium operation by the user, such as a pen or finger or a medium accompanying with the user] <em>a user-associated medium at least</em> <strong>approaches [or comes in contact with a whole of or]</strong> <strong><em>at least a</em></strong> <strong>part of a housing of [the]</strong> <strong><em>said</em></strong> <strong>apparatus; and</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Docket No. 100-29at 2. Maxell contends that the \"intent\" of the amendment was only to remove the \"such as\" language objected to in the prior Office Action. The prosecution history \"often lacks the clarity of the specification and thus is less useful for claim construction purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/\">\n    415 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What is clear, however, is that the amendment, in addition to removing the \"such as\" language, also changed the claim language to remove \"or comes in contact with a whole of or.\" It is also clear that, as issued, the claim language requires the detecting means to detect whether \"a user-associated medium at least approaches said apparatus.\" As claimed, approach detection is required of the detecting means. The \"at least\" language allows for a detecting device that detects both approach and contact, but approach detection must be included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The corresponding structure must, therefore, be structure that meets this explicitly claimed function of including approach detection. That the dependent claims include the addition of other detection techniques does not change that claim 1 requires \"at least approach detection.\" Maxell's proposed inclusion of various detection schemes listed as \"and/or\" would allow the claimed structure to include only the contact based systems, which would be inconsistent with the claim language as explained above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Maxell's argument that the dependent claims mandate Maxell's construction is flawed. First, as noted above, as drafted the claim uses \"at least\" and thus does not mandate only use of approach detection. Thus, using both approach detection and contact detection, for example, would be encompassed with the claim scope. To the extent the dependent claims add additional detection mechanisms, such claims are not in conflict with the independent claim which recites \"at least approaches.\" Further, even if in conflict, the doctrine of claim differentiation, at most creates a rebuttable presumption and \"cannot broaden claims beyond their correct scope.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seachange Int'l, Inc. v.

In the navigation processing, the user enters data to select a menu and/or set retrieving conditions on the setup screen. At first, the user gets the location information of the portable terminal, represented by a latitude/longitude or coordinates and an altitude, for example. Then, the user gets the direction information of the portable terminal, which is the direction of the tip of the portable terminal as determined by a compass, a gyro, or a clinometer. The location information and the direction information are set as terminal information for the retrieving conditions. The system controls retrieving of the database and retrieves the information corresponding to the selected menu, such as route guidance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   '317 Patent Abstract. More particularly, the '317 Patent describes a portable terminal, which does not require a user to input their current location and which presents navigational information on a narrow screen of the portable terminal in a manner that is easily understood by the user/walker. '317 Patent 2:51-61. The portable terminal includes devices for obtaining a location and direction of the user's present place, so that the user does not have to input such information. '317 Patent 2:62-3:8. In addition, the portable terminal may compress the location and direction information, so as to display a direction of movement from the user's present place with simply an arrow.

More particularly, the '493 Patent and the '729 Patent describe an electric camera including an image sensing device (e.g., a CCD) having a number (e.g., 1200) of vertically arranged pixels and a number (e.g., 1600) of horizontally arranged pixels. '493 Patent 4:34-48. When taking still images, all of the effective pixels on the image sensing device are used to produce signals with as high a resolution as possible. '493 Patent 7:31-39. When taking moving video, a number (e.g., 1200/240 = 5) of the vertically arranged pixels are mixed or culled, so that the number of lines of output signals from the image sensing device match or conform to the number of effective scanning lines (e.g., 240) of a television monitor.

It is noted that the background of the specification references a variable amplitude amplifier in the prior art CDMA standard. '193 Patent 1:23-35, Figure 11. Further, the background of the specification references the use of a variable amplitude amplifier for controlling bias conditions of a FET according to transmission power, as described in a Japanese patent document. '193 Patent 1:60-2:1. Further, Maxell's expert points to two prior art patents which reference the term variable amplitude amplifier. Caloyannides Decl. A at \u00b6 42. Further, Maxell's expert identifies three of the cited patents on the face of the '193 Patent as providing example figures of variable amplitude amplifiers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.

The specification provides for two descriptions of the variable amplifier 230. ZTE points to the description of Figure 1 found at 5:16-44. However, the specification provides another description of variable amplitude amplifier 230 in Figure 2 and Figure 3 at 6:1-6, 6:55-7:20. ZTE's expert attempts to discount the disclosure of Figure 3 by stating that the specification is silent on how the control signal reaches the transistor Q31 or how it would control the output power if it did reach transistor Q31. Ding Decl. at \u00b6 44. However, the specification is clear: \"[a] control terminal Tc is connected to the base of the transistor Q31 through a resistor R31.\" '193 Patent 7:5-7 (referencing Figure 3). Though ZTE argued at the oral hearing that it was unclear where the signal on Tc is provided from, the specification is clear. Figure 2 clearly illustrates that controller 300 provides an input to the variable amplitude amplifier 230. Further, the specification explains that the CPU 310 (within controller 300) \"generates signals for controlling the variable amplitude amplifier 230\" (5:53-54 (referencing Figure 1) ), \"the controller 300 controls a gain of the variable amplitude amplifier 230\" (6:1-2 (referencing Figure 2) ), \"controller 300 controls the variable amplitude amplifier 230 (6:43-44 (referencing Figure 2) ), and \"the transistor Q31 controls the output power according to the control signal generated by the CPU 310\" (7:16-18 (referencing Figure 3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   The specification also more generally describes the operation of the variable amplitude amplifier 230 as amplifying the input signal for provision to an output.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:31-40 (referencing Figure 1). This amplification is done by controlling the gain of the amplifier by the control signal from controller 300 as shown in Figure 2: \"[t]he controller 300 controls a gain of the variable amplitude amplifier 230....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:1-2, 3:17-22, Abstract.

More specifically, the '491 Patent and the '695 Patent note that conventional digital signal processor (DSP) based audio decoders store decoding program codes within a built-in ROM, which consume considerable space and could not be easily changed to include new or additional encoding formats. '491 Patent 1:65-2:10. To improve flexibility, the '491 Patent and the '695 Patent store decoding program codes within an external ROM, which can be interchanged or updated with new decoding program codes. '491 Patent 2:11-51, 8:1-15, Figure 1. The '491 Patent and the '695 Patent also provide a controller (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a CPU) that detects a change in the encoding format and transfers appropriate decoding program codes stored within the external ROM to an internal RAM, so that the DSP can start the decoding process using the appropriate decoding program codes stored in the internal RAM. '491 Patent 2:38-45, 5:31-67, 6:66-7:54, Figures 1, 4, and 5.

ZTE has provided no evidence to support the notion that \"controller\" is merely a nonce word. ZTE also has not established that in context of the specification, the term does not connote structure. The specification refers to \"controller 50\" which elsewhere is referred to as \"external CPU 50,\" a clear reference to specific structure. '695 Patent Abstract, 4:41, Figure 1. The patent also references \"micro-controller\" in the context of a class of structure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:38-42. In this context, the specification makes clear that \"controller\" connotes structure. In light of the teaching of the specification, \"controller\" connotes sufficiently definite structure to avoid a means-plus-function term. Additionally, as noted by Maxell, the extrinsic evidence indicates that \"controller\" has a structural meaning. The Court finds this external evidence also supports the Court's conclusion that \"controller\" connotes a class of structures. Finally, the Court notes that this finding is consistent with multiple courts that have found that \"controller\" connotes structure that does not fall with the means-plus-function analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   The Court finds that the term \"a controller for receiving a method of compression and encoding from said demultiplexer, for detecting whether said method of compression and encoding changes to another method of compression and encoding or not, and if said method of compression and encoding changes, for downloading the decoding program code corresponding to said another method of compression and encoding, to said memory from outside of said memory\" has its plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-455\">\n    The Court consolidated the case against Huawei (Case No. 5:16-cv-178) with the case against ZTE (Case No. 5:16-cv-179) for pretrial purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-456\">\n    The term numbers used herein are consistent with the term numbers provided in the parties Joint Claim Construction chart and used in the oral hearing.
