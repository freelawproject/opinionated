In its motion, the Plaintiff requested the Court temporarily restrain and preliminarily enjoin Defendants from enforcing North Dakota Senate Bills 2258 and 2301. On July 27, 2017, the parties submitted a joint stipulation in which the Plaintiff withdrew its request for a temporary restraining\n   order, in order to give the Court additional time to address the merits of the request for preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 18. On July 28, 2017, the Court found as moot the Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19. On August 22, 2017, a hearing was held regarding the preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 24. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Plaintiff, Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), is a national trade association representing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), with its principal place of business in Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. PBMs are third-party health plan administrators which manage and administer prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurance plans. Retail pharmacies purchase prescription drugs from wholesalers or manufacturers to fill health plan participants' prescriptions. When a plan participant (a patient or consumer) fills a prescription, the pharmacy contacts the PBM to obtain the participant's coverage and copayment information. After the prescription is filled, the PBM reimburses the pharmacy at a contractually-agreed upon rate. The PBM then bills the health plan, which provides the participant's insurance, at a rate negotiated between the PBM and the health plan. This role renders the PBM a third-party health plan administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2017, North Dakota State Governor Doug Burgum signed into law S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301, which were to become effective August 1, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258, 2017 Leg., 65th Sess. (ND 2017); S.B. 2301, 2017 Leg., 65th Sess. (ND 2017). Among other things, these laws will regulate how PBMs categorize prescription drugs and also require PBMs to make certain cost disclosures to network pharmacies and plan participants.

PCMA argues the new laws, which were scheduled to go into effect on August 1, 2017, place restrictions and requirements on PBMs that impermissibly reference or are connected with health plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (\"Medicare Part D\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   As a result, PCMA seeks this Court's declaration that the North Dakota state laws are expressly preempted by federal legislation. The parties stipulated not to effectuate S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 as to ERISA and Medicare Part D plans, pending the resolution of this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   PCMA seeks to obtain a preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 65(b) directs the court to look to the specific facts shown by an affidavit to determine whether immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant.

PCMA argues S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 impermissibly regulate ERISA and Medicare Part D health plans by regulating third-party payers and PBMs. According to PCMA, North Dakota's statutory definitions of third-party payers and PBMs are broad enough to encompass ERISA and Medicare Part D health plans. Therefore, PCMA argues, any laws regulating third-party payers and PBMs, as they are statutorily defined, necessarily include ERISA and Medicare Part D health plans, and are therefore preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     ERISA PREEMPTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ERISA comprehensively regulates, among other things, employee welfare benefit plans that \"through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,\" provide medical, surgical, or hospital care, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, or death.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Nowhere in either bill's language is ERISA explicitly mentioned, discussed, defined, or excluded. Therefore, the Court finds no explicit \"reference to\" ERISA. PCMA argues, however, that both S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 contain\n   <em>\n    implicit\n   </em>\n   references to ERISA because, within each bill, PBMs, third party payers, and plan sponsors are defined broadly enough to implicate ERISA health plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Both S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 explicitly provide that \"pharmacy benefit manager,\" as used within each bill, has the same definition as in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1 (1)(a) and S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1 (1)(a);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 19-02.1-14.2(1)(d) and 19-02.1-16.1(1)(a). \"Pharmacy benefits manager\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Pharmacy benefits manger\" means a person that performs pharmacy benefits management and includes any other person\n   acting for such person under a contractual or employment relationship in the performance of pharmacy benefits management\n   <strong>\n    for a managed care company, nonprofit hospital or medical service organization, insurance company, third-party payer, or health program administered by a state agency.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01(4) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   PCMA argues S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 attempt to regulate PBMs, and some of these PBMs provide services for ERISA health plans. Therefore, PCMA argues, the bills both implicitly reference ERISA. However, the legislation defines PBMs as a \"person\" who has a contractual relationship with a \"managed care company, nonprofit hospital or medical service organization, insurance company, third-party payer, or health program administered by a state agency.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01(4). For purposes of S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301, it appears that a PBM is a distinct \"person,\" entering a contractual relationship with one of the listed entities. The PBM is a separate entity distinguishable from any health benefit plan, let alone an ERISA-covered employee health benefit plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is certainly conceivable that a \"pharmacy benefits manager\" could enter into a contractual relationship with an employer sponsored health benefit plan, and that such an employer sponsored health benefit plan would be subject to ERISA.

The insurance plans that they contract with may or may not be ERISA plans. North Dakota's regulation of these third party entities has little or nothing to do with who is the insurance plan carrier. ERISA regulates employer sponsored health benefit plans. It does not preempt a state from regulating independent entities entering contractual relationships with insurance plans, whether they be employer sponsored or not. An independent entity choosing to do business with an employee health benefit plan is not given a shield from state and local regulations; to find that ERISA's preemption clause did as much would be to \"extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy.\"\n   <em>\n    De Buono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653014\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/806/#p813\">\n    520 U.S. at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653014\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/806/#p813\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, in this case the Court finds no implicit reference to ERISA plans by way of regulating pharmacy benefit managers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Similarly, S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 explicitly provide that \"third party payer,\" as used within each bill, has the same definition as in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1 (1)(c) and S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1 (1)(d);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-02.1-16.1(1)(c). \"Third party payer\" is defined as \"an organization other than the patient or health\n   care provider involved in the financing of personal health services.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01(6). PCMA argues this is another impermissible, implicit reference to ERISA. The Court is unconvinced. While the statutory language\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be read to include the employer sponsored health benefit plans subject to ERISA, nowhere in either bill does it say as much. The definition clearly applies to a broad range of entities that have no relation to ERISA or employer sponsored health plans. As described above, to apply the preemption clause under this circumstance would result in \"uncritical literalism,\" for if \" 'relate to' were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course, for really, universally, relations stop nowhere.\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339053\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/645/#p654\">\n    514 U.S. at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339053\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/645/#p654\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 also explicitly provide that \"plan sponsors,\" as used within each bill, have the same definition as in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(1)(b) and S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1(1)(b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-02.1-16.1(1)(b). PCMA points to the definition of a \"plan sponsor\" as the mirror image of ERISA's definition of \"plan sponsor,\" and argues this constitutes an implicit and impermissible reference to health care benefit plans covered by ERISA. \"Plan sponsors\" are defined as \"the employer in the case of an employee benefit plan established or maintained by a single employer, or the employee organization in the case of a plan established or maintained by an employee organization.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Like the definitions of \"pharmacy benefits manager\" and \"third party payer,\" the definition of \"plan sponsors\" is referring to a person or entity separate and removed from the health plan itself. Unlike the definitions of \"pharmacy benefits manager\" and \"third party payer,\" however, the definition of \"plan sponsor,\" explicitly references an employer who provides an employee benefit plan and makes mention of an employee benefit plan. The Court finds PCMA's argument that the statutory definition of \"plan sponsor\" makes \"reference to\" ERISA to be its most convincing argument.

It was the intent of the North Dakota Legislature to impose regulations on PBMs and third party payers that prevent them from restricting local North Dakota pharmacies from dispensing the drugs they are licensed to dispense, by placing these drugs on \"specialty drug\" lists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, the North Dakota laws satisfy the McCarran-Ferguson factors.

It is clear the bills confer a benefit on insureds. By allowing pharmacists and pharmacies to resume a greater role in the dispensing of prescription drugs, including the mailing and shipping of prescription drugs, S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 essentially mandate greater coverage and treatment of conditions for the policyholder, which has the effect of spreading the policyholder's risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregoire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358823\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1039/#p1046\">\n    147 F.3d at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is irrelevant that the Act accomplishes its risk-spreading function in an unusual way.

In\n   <em>\n    Gregoire\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit rejected the argument that the Washington act regulated only the relationship between the carrier and the provider, rather than the relationship between the carrier\n   and the insured, because the Washington act \"confers a benefit on insureds by expanding the treatments that their health carriers must provide or pay for.\"\n   <em>\n    Gregoire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358823\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1039/#p1046\">\n    147 F.3d at 1046-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in this case, S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 confer a benefit on insureds by expanding the treatments available to them through their local pharmacies, and by mail, as opposed to ordering directly through PBMs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, the North Dakota laws are limited to entities within the insurance industry. S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 impose requirements on PBMs and third party payers, which are entities engaged in the business of health insurance, as discussed above. Neither S.B. 2258 nor S.B. 2301 contain regulations on entities outside the business of health insurance. Accordingly, the Court alternatively finds that even if S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 \"relate to\" ERISA, both bills \"regulate insurance\" within the common-sense meaning and are thus saved by ERISA's preemption clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In evaluating PCMA's likelihood of success on the merits, the Court considered its responsibility to \"flexibly weigh the case's particular circumstances to determine 'whether the balance of equities so favors the movant that justice requires the court to intervene....\"\n   <em>\n    Calvin Klein Cosmetics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519422\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/500/#p503\">\n    815 F.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (8th Cir. 1987).

PCMA alleges the State's bills impose \"significant administrative, operational, and financial burdens on PBMs and health plans,\" and that the enforcement of these laws \"may cause a loss of goodwill and injury to that PBM's reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 10-1, p. 24-25. The Defendants argue PCMA's alleged harm is overstated because PCMA will still have to comply with S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 as to non-ERISA and non-Medicare Part D plans, regardless of the outcome of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 22, pp. 7-8. Because PCMA will ultimately be forced to comply with the State's bills in some respects, the State argues, any harm is not as perilous as PCMA would lead the Court to believe. Both parties agree that ERISA and Medicare Part D preemption applies only as to ERISA and Medicare Part D plans, and that PCMA's members will be forced to comply with the laws in some capacity, however the Court must still make an independent finding regarding the potential for irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \"Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because its injuries cannot be fully compensated through an award of damages.\"\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp. v.

When the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the existence of the moving party's business, a preliminary injunction may be warranted.

PCMA does not offer any predictions or figures to demonstrate what its view of what a \"significant\" financial burden might mean. Neither does PCMA address how complying with the State's bills as they relate to non-ERISA and non-Medicare Part D plans might mitigate any financial burdens. PCMA also fails to explain the theory that enforcement of the State bills may result in a loss of reputation. It is not immediately clear why complying with state law would be viewed so negatively as to result in a loss of reputation. PCMA does not allege S.B. 2258 or S.B. 2301 threaten the existence of its members' business and PCMA admits its members will comply with the State's laws as to non-ERSA and non-Medicare Part D health plans. The Court is not willing to find that this factor weighs in favor of the Plaintiff, where Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence supporting its bare assertions that its members will experience a financial loss and may experience a loss of reputation. Accordingly, the Court finds this\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Balance of Harms\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \"Failure to show irreparable harm is an independently sufficient ground upon which to deny a preliminary injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins, Inc. v.

However, in the interest of a thorough and meaningful review, the Court next factors the balance between the movant's potential harm and any injury an injunction may inflict on other interested parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pottgen v.

Testimony before the North Dakota Senate Industry, Business and Labor Committee indicated PBMs increasingly engage in anticompetitive or deceptive conduct that harms consumers, health plans, and local pharmacies.\n   <em>\n    Testimony Before the S. Indus. Bus. &amp; Labor Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 65th Leg. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (N.D. 2017) (statement of Mike Schwab, Executive Vice President of the North Dakota Pharmacists Association).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For example, PBMs have the ability to prevent local pharmacies from dispensing any prescription drugs the PBM determines to be a \"specialty drug,\" irrespective of what federal, state, and local authorities have already determined. The PBM then directs consumers to purchase the specialty drug through PBM's own mail-order pharmacies. In addition to being anticompetitive, legislative history indicates this practice can be wasteful as patients have found their \"specialty drugs\" frozen on their doorstep or baking in their mailbox. In those instances, the PBM can provide an override code permitting the local pharmacists to provide an emergency refill or short-day supply of the medication.\n   <em>\n    Testimony Before the S. Indus. Bus. &amp; Labor Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 65th Leg. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (N.D. 2017) (statement of Mike Schwab,\n   Executive Vice President of the North Dakota Pharmacists Association). Such testimony is evidence of the harms faced by other interested parties, including consumers, who are limited by where they may obtain their prescription drugs and how they obtain them, and local pharmacies who are limited by what prescription drugs they may provide and how and when they provide them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court has reviewed the legislative history of both bills, including testimony from Howard Anderson Jr. of the North Dakota Pharmacists Association; Dr. Erik Christenson, Chief Professional Officer at Heart of America Medical Center; representatives from Workforce Safety; representatives from CVS health; local pharmacists; and a public interest antitrust attorney. The overwhelming majority of testimony to the Committees indicated that consumers, pharmacies, and plan sponsors all suffer when PBMs exercise their power to restrict consumers to the PBM's own captive mail order and specialty pharmacy operations by reducing the available choices for accessing prescription drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 seek to address these and the other issues presented to the North Dakota State Legislature. After completing its review, the Court finds that the potential harm other interested parties would experience by preempting these bills, outweighs any potential harm PCMA may experience due to their implementation. Accordingly, the Court finds that the third\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Public Interest\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The final\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor for the Court to consider is the public's interest in the outcome. For the same reasons enumerated in the Court's analysis of the third\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor, the public's interest in the outcome of this case requires a finding that this factor weighs in favor of the Defendants. The public interests served by the implementation of S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 are those of transparency, accessibility, and free and open markets for prescription drugs. More specifically, the public has an interest in a plan sponsor's ability to obtain information regarding the rate at which a PBM reimburses a pharmacy and the rate at which the PBM then bills the plan sponsor because this type of transparency allows pharmacies and plan sponsors, as well as PBMs, to\n   evaluate, compare, and determine fair values of the products and services for which they are contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The public also has an interest in encouraging as many prescription drug providers to enter the marketplace as federal, state, and local governments will allow because the public values increasing competition for products and services as a way to lower costs. Additionally, increasing the number of market participants serves the public interest by allowing consumers the choice to obtain their prescription drugs either over-the-phone, by mail, or in-person at their local pharmacy. The choice of how to obtain prescription drugs serves the public interest of accessibility and safety because consumers have more control of when and how to get their medications, as well as the method by which they will be taught to use them (either over the phone or in person).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   There is some evidence in the record that the public interest in keeping health care costs low might be injured by implementation of S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301.\n   <em>\n    Testimony Before the S. Indus. Bus. &amp; Labor Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 65th Leg. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (N.D. 2017) (\"They may tell you this bill is going to raise costs. To be honest, that might be true in some circumstances. However, if costs go up, overall there is a high probability that it is because of the PBM not the pharmacy.\" Statement of Mike Schwab, Executive Vice President of the North Dakota Pharmacists Association). However, in the aggregate, the Court finds that the potential injury to public interests caused by implementation of S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 pales in comparison to the actual injuries the legislation seeks to remedy. Therefore, the Court finds this\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Because the Court finds that all four\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in the Defendants' favor, PCMA's motion to preliminarily enjoin the State's enforcement of S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 as to ERISA health care plans is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     MEDICARE PART D PREEMPTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   PCMA also requests this Court preliminarily enjoin the State from enforcing S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 as they relate to Medicare Part D health plans because PCMA believes a provision contained in Medicare Part D preempts the State's bills. The Court will apply the same\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factors to PCMA's Medicare Part D claim to determine whether PCMA is entitled to a preliminary injunction on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In regards to Medicare, Congress has proclaimed that \"\n   <em>\n    [t]he standards established\n   </em>\n   under this part shall\n   <em>\n    supersede any State law or regulation\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    with respect to [Part D] plans\n   </em>\n   which are offered by [Part D] organizations under this part.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3) (incorporating Part C's preemption provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-112(g) ) (emphasis added).

PCMA left for the Court with the task of finding and then analyzing any relevant provisions within each cited C.F.R. regulation. This Court is unwilling to do this, particularly when the remedy sought by PCMA is one as \"extraordinary\" and \"drastic\" as a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    Munaf v.

In analyzing the first\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor, the Court cannot say there is clear proof PCMA is likely to succeed on the merits. PCMA failed to point to any specific text within its cited C.F.R. regulations, either in its briefing or in its oral arguments, that creates a preemption conflict with the State's bills. Pointing to a list of C.F.R. regulations, without any explanation of their relevance, is not enough. Plaintiff's conclusory statements are not adequate for the relief sought. Even if the Court was willing to guess which portions of the text Plaintiff finds relevant, Plaintiff offered no analysis for the Court to consider regarding what the text means, how the text is similar, its practical effects, or why preemption would exist in each scenario. Without more from the party seeking such \"extraordinary\" relief, the Court cannot find that PCMA is likely to succeed on the merits. Accordingly, the Court finds that this\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Irreparable Harm\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As with its argument regarding ERISA preemption, PCMA alleges it will experience irreparable harm if injunctive relief is not granted. PCMA alleges the state legislation ultimately imposes \"significant administrative, operational, and financial burdens on PBMs and health plans,\" and that the enforcement of these laws \"may cause a loss of goodwill and injury to that PBM's reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 10-1, p. 24-25. As previously discussed, \"[i]rreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because its injuries cannot be fully compensated through an award of damages.\"\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235904\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/312/#p319\">\n    563 F.3d at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the existence of the moving party's business, a preliminary injunction may be warranted. \"[L]oss of consumer goodwill can be irreparable harm,\" however, \"[e]conomic loss, on its own, is not an irreparable injury so long as the losses can be recovered.\"\n   <em>\n    DISH Network Service L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7342817,4071043\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/877/\">\n    725 F.3d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For the reasons enumerated in the Court's previous analysis of irreparable harm in considering the ERISA claim, the Court is not inclined to find that this factor weighs in favor of the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence supporting its bare assertions that it will experience a financial loss and may experience a loss of reputation. Such vague and unsubstantiated claims will not suffice for an \"extraordinary\" and \"drastic\" remedy. Accordingly, the Court finds that this\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Balance of Harms\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   While \"the absence of irreparable injury is by itself sufficient to defeat a motion for a preliminary injunction,\" the Court notes that it finds the third\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the Defendants as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DISH Network Service L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7342817,4071043\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/877/\">\n    725 F.3d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

PCMA's bare assertions of harm, without any supporting\n   evidence, are outweighed by testimony before the North Dakota State Legislature detailing the harms that North Dakota consumers, health plans, and local pharmacies experience when PBMs engage in anticompetitive or deceptive conduct.\n   <em>\n    Testimony Before the S.

The public interests served by the implementation of S.B. 2258 and S.B. 2301 are those of transparency, accessibility, and free and open markets for prescription drugs.
