Plaintiff is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   . In the interest of efficiency, the Court will address each of the pending motions in this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Timmy Dewayne Jester (\"Plaintiff\") filed his original\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Complaint in this matter on December 2, 2016, seeking relief against Defendants Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (together, \"Defendants\") for foreclosure fraud and unjust enrichment. (Dkt. 2). On July 26, 2017, after obtaining permission from the Court, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint, adding various causes of action against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint is rambling, repetitive, and difficult to decipher. However, it is plain from the pleading and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss that Plaintiff's claims stem from his attempts to prevent Defendants from enforcing their\n   Oklahoma State Court Foreclosure Judgment against him, in Wagoner County Case No. CJ-2012-308 (the \"2012 Foreclosure\"). The relevant proceedings are below described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The 2012 Foreclosure Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the 2012 Foreclosure, Defendants moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiff opposed Defendants' motion by questioning the validity of the indorsement from Washington Mutual Bank, FA, on his note and by alleging Mortgage Electronic Registration Services, Inc. (\"MERS\") mortgages are invalid in Oklahoma. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-3 (Jester's Response to Motion for Summary Judgment, June 16, 2014) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Shook of the Wagoner County District Court overruled Plaintiff's objections in that case and entered judgment in favor of Defendants on October 8, 2014. (Dkt. 41-4 (Journal Entry of Judgment) ). The Journal Entry of Judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure indicates the trial judge reviewed the original wet ink note and determined the indorsements were valid. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). The trial judge also specifically found that Defendants demonstrated standing to enforce the note. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The Journal Entry of Judgment was amended on January 13, 2015, to clarify the judgment was only\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   . (Dkt. 41-5 Amended Journal Entry of Judgment) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff sought to vacate the judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure. (Dkt. 41-6 (Jester's Amended Response for Motion to Vacate Summary Judgment, Feb. 20, 2015) ). In that motion, Plaintiff raised numerous allegations against Defendants, including: (1) the indorsement on the note was forged and invalid, (2) Plaintiff's mortgage payments had not been credited properly, in violation of various statutes including the Oklahoma Consumer Protection Act (\"OCPA\"), 15 Okl. St. \u00a7\u00a7 752\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (3) MERS mortgages cannot be valid in Oklahoma, (4) misconduct occurred during Plaintiff's Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in 2011, (5) Plaintiff's prior counsel during the 2012 Foreclosure acted negligently and incompetently, and (6) the loan was improperly serviced, in violation of the Real Estate Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2617. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Wagoner County District Court denied Plaintiff's motion to vacate on April 8, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-8 (Court of Civil Appeals Opinion), \u00b6 4). Plaintiff appealed, and on October 26, 2015, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals (\"COCA\") affirmed the judgment in favor of Defendants. (Dkt. 41-8 (COCA Opinion) ). On April 11, 2016, the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied Plaintiff's petition for certiorari. (Dkt. 41-9 (Oklahoma Supreme Court Order) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also pertinent to this matter is Plaintiff's 2011 bankruptcy proceeding, Case No. 11-80627-TRC, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma (the \"Bankruptcy Case\"). A Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge was entered in that case on July 27, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-1 (Discharge of Debtor) ). On October 28, 2014, Plaintiff sought to reopen his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy to pursue an adversary proceeding against Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-10 (Motion to Reopen Case for Purpose of Complaints) ). Plaintiff requested the Bankruptcy Court review the state court judgment against him in the 2012 Foreclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He alleged a litany\n   of violations of state and federal law committed by Defendants, including violation of the bankruptcy discharge injunction and automatic stay laws by foreclosing on his mortgage; fraud; robo-signing; misapplication of his payments; violation of RESPA; and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 30, 2014, following a hearing, Judge Cornish issued an order denying Plaintiff's request to reopen, finding the Bankruptcy Court had no authority to set aside the state court judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure. (Dkt. 41-11 (Order Denying Motion to Reopen) ). Judge Cornish concluded the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine prevented the Bankruptcy Court \"from acting as an appellate court to review a final, state court judgment or claims inextricably intertwined with them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Judge Cornish also found no violation of the automatic stay and no violation of the discharge injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff appealed Judge Cornish's ruling to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\"), which affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's order on October 22, 2015. (Dkt. 41-12 (Opinion, BAP Appeal No. EO-15-2) ). Plaintiff then appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the BAP's Opinion on July 25, 2016. (Dkt. 41-13 (Order in Tenth Circuit Case No. 15-7079) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Present Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the Tenth Circuit's Order and Judgment in the Bankruptcy Case, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in this matter. In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff again seeks review of the 2012 Foreclosure judgment, along with review of the judgment in the Bankruptcy Case. The Second Amended Complaint lists twenty causes of action against Defendants: (1) foreclosure fraud; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud upon the court; (4) misrepresentation; (5) breach of contract; (6) misapplication of payments; (7) deceit; (8) violation of RESPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2617 ; (9) violation of the OCPA, 15 Okl. St. \u00a7\u00a7 761(c)-(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (10) lack of standing; (11) dual tracking; (12) promissory fraud; (13) actual fraud (14) constructive fraud; (15) violation of the automatic stay laws under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (16) violation of the discharge injunction; (17) violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e, 1692f, 1692j, and 1692k\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (18) violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments; (19) forgery; and (20) infliction of emotional stress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38, at 1). Plaintiff seeks relief in the form of voiding the judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure, permanent injunction, reimbursement of fees and costs, reimbursement of payments paid on the loan plus interest, and civil monetary penalties available under Oklahoma and federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the allegations against them pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (Dkt. 41). Defendants simultaneously filed a Motion for Leave to File Judgment Rolls (Dkt. 42). Plaintiff has responded to the Defendants' motion. (Dkt. 43). Defendants have filed a Reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Dkt. 44). Plaintiff thereafter filed an unauthorized Surreply brief. (Dkt. 45).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to Amend the Second Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 46). Defendants filed an Objection and Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Amend. (Dkt. 47). On November 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed two motions: an \"Emergency Motion for a Evidentiary Hearing for a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction\" (Dkt. 48) and an \"Emergency Motion for a Order to Show Cause and Request an Evidentiary Hearing\" (Dkt. 49). Defendants filed an Objection and Response to each motion. (Dkts. 50, 51). The pending motions are now ripe for review by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Rule 12(b)(1) motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \"generally take one of two forms.\"\n   <em>\n    Stuart v. Colo.

When reviewing a factual attack on subject matter jurisdiction, \"a district court may not presume the truthfulness of the complaint's factual allegations,\" and a court's reference in such an instance \"to evidence outside the pleadings does not convert the motion to a Rule 56 motion\" for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413305\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/1000/#p1003\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). When ruling on a factual attack, a court \"has wide discretion to allow affidavits, other documents, and a limited evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts\" without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9467474\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/271/1221/#p1225\">\n    271 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, even\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs are required to comply\n   with the \"fundamental requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure,\" and the liberal construction to be afforded does not transform \"vague and conclusory arguments\" into valid claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ogden v.

Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Claims Challenging the State Court Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. State-Based Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts fifteen state law claims that were addressed in or intertwined with the 2012 Foreclosure judgment: (1) foreclosure fraud; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud on the court; (4) misrepresentation; (5) breach of contract; (6) misapplication of payments; (7) deceit; (8) violations of the OCPA for misapplication of payments; (9) lack of standing; (10) dual tracking; (11) promissory fraud; (12) actual fraud; (13) constructive fraud; (14) forgery; and (15) infliction of emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38, at 1). Defendants seek dismissal of these claims, because they are based on two allegations already rejected by the Wagoner County District Court in the 2012 Foreclosure-(1) that Defendants lack standing to enforce the promissory note because the Washington Mutual Bank indorsement is fraudulent, and (2) Defendants misapplied his payments. Defendants argue Plaintiff's claims amount to an improper request for this Court to invalidate the state court's rulings in the 2012 Foreclosure. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As Defendants correctly point out, Plaintiff's claims, as enumerated above, are subject to dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

Plaintiff further alleges throughout the Second Amended Complaint various grounds why the Wagoner County District Judge in the 2012 Foreclosure was wrong in granting judgment against him, and why Defendants, Defendants' attorneys, and Plaintiff's previous attorneys are to blame. These allegations center around claims that Defendants failed to credit his mortgage payments properly, Defendants lacked standing to foreclose on his property, and the Washington Mutual indorsement on the promissory note is fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although Plaintiff's rambling allegations make it difficult to parse out the facts underlying each of his numerous causes of action, it is clear that Plaintiff's state-based claims are all attacks on the judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure. Plaintiff already raised these challenges in the 2012 Foreclosure, and the Wagoner County District Court and Oklahoma COCA already rejected these arguments in that foreclosure proceeding. This Court could not find in Plaintiff's favor on his state-based claims, and grant his requested relief, without undermining the 2012 Foreclosure judgment. Moreover, the Tenth Circuit has clearly stated that allegations of fraud in the state court proceeding do not prevent application of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine to bar those fraud claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3337229\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1244/#p1256\">\n    453 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1256-57 ;\n   <em>\n    Bradshaw v.

Plaintiff did not do so, and the COCA's opinion became final. Therefore, the 2012 Foreclosure has been fully litigated and Plaintiff is bound by that state court result. Plaintiff invites this court to review and reject the state court judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure, but\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   bars this Court from entertaining such claims.

FDCPA and RESPA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff additionally alleges Defendants violated the FDCPA and RESPA. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges an FDCPA violation occurred when Defendants misapplied his mortgage payments (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38, at 25). Plaintiff fails to state any facts to support a RESPA claim, but such a claim would necessarily be based on the servicing\n   of Plaintiff's mortgage loan.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (setting requirements for servicing of federally related mortgage loans).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   These claims are also barred under\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   , because they present issues that are inextricably intertwined with the 2012 Foreclosure proceedings. A determination on the FDCPA and RESPA issues would necessarily require this Court to revisit the question of whether Defendants' foreclosure was proper. This question was already answered as part of the 2012 Foreclosure judgment, and the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine prohibits this Court from reviewing and rejecting that judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillard v.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's FDCPA and RESPA claims are subject to dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Constitutional Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the state courts in the 2012 Foreclosure violated his constitutional rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. However, as Defendants point out, Plaintiff filed these claims in the wrong court. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201257\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Plaintiff should have petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari to allege his constitutional rights were violated by the state courts in the 2012 Foreclosure. This is not the proper Court to make such a determination. Again,\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   squarely bars this Court from hearing these claims, because reviewing these claims would require review of the 2012 Foreclosure judgment.

Subject Matter Jurisdiction over Claims Decided in Bankruptcy Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts two claims that pertain to his federal Bankruptcy Case: (1) violation of the automatic stay laws, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (2) violation of the discharge injunction, codified at 11 U.S.C. 524(a)(2). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38, at 1). However, as Defendants point out, those claims were already decided in Plaintiff's Bankruptcy Case in Defendants' favor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-11 (Order Denying Motion to Reopen) ). That decision was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit BAP and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-12 (Opinion, BAP Appeal No. EO-15-2); Dkt. 41-13 (Order, Tenth Circuit Case No. 15-7079) ). Therefore, these two claims are barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Res judicata\n   </em>\n   , or claim preclusion, \"generally applies when there is a final judgment on the merits which precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating the issues that were decided or issues that could have been raised in the earlier action.\"\n   <em>\n    Driver Music Co., Inc. v.

To demonstrate\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , the defendant bears the burden to prove (1) the prior suit ended with a judgment on the merits; (2) the parties are identical or in privity; (3) the prior suit was based on the same cause of action; and (4) the plaintiff\n   had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim in the prior suit.\n   <em>\n    Nwosun v.

First, Plaintiff's federal Bankruptcy Case was fully adjudicated and ended with a judgment on the merits, which was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit BAP and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-11 (Order Denying Motion to Reopen); Dkt. 41-12 (Opinion, BAP Appeal No. EO-15-2); Dkt. 41-13 (Order, Tenth Circuit Case No. 15-7079) ). Second, Plaintiff and Defendants were parties to the prior Bankruptcy Case. Third, Plaintiff's claims for violation of the automatic stay and discharge injunction were addressed in the Bankruptcy Case, and Plaintiff's claims for those violations arise from the same set of facts in this case as in the Bankruptcy Case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nwosun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11909812\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/1255/#p1257\">\n    124 F.3d at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a cause of action for claim preclusion purposes \"includes all claims or legal theories of recovery that arise from the same transaction, event, or occurrence.\"). Fourth, Plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues of the automatic stay and discharge injunction in the Bankruptcy Case. Plaintiff briefed those issues before Judge Cornish, and Judge Cornish held a hearing on those issues before issuing a decision that rejected Plaintiff's arguments. Accordingly, claim preclusion applies, and Plaintiff is barred from raising those same arguments here. These claims are subject to dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38, at 38). To obtain a permanent injunction, a party must prove: \"(1) actual success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued; (3) the threatened injury outweighs the harm that the injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) the injunction, if issued, will not adversely affect the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation v.

In his Response brief, Plaintiff reiterates the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint and denies that he is seeking review of the 2012 Foreclosure judgment. However, Plaintiff also states in his Response that \"the Oklahoma State Court Foreclosure Judgment is not valid, it is void\" (Dkt. 43, at 2), and it is clear from the substance of his Response that he indeed seeks to reopen the 2012 Foreclosures proceedings. Plaintiff's adamant\n   denials in this regard do not change the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the Response, Plaintiff asserts he has a right to plead his case based on the United States Constitution,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and fraud on the court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). However, for the reasons explained above, Plaintiff's recourse in the 2012 Foreclosure proceeding was to the United States Supreme Court, not this Court. Plaintiff repeatedly insists that his allegation of fraud on the court in the 2012 Foreclosure proceeding permits this Court to set aside that judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43, at 8-11). However, as Defendants explain in their Reply brief, allegations of fraud perpetrated on the state court do not overcome the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   bar.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farris v.

If Plaintiff's counterclaims were not heard by the state court, the appropriate remedy was to petition the United States Supreme Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201257\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has no authority to hear those claims or decide whether Plaintiff's constitutional rights were violated by the state court's action or inaction in the 2012 Foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff states in his Response brief that he was unaware he could appeal to the United States Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court would have ruled against him anyway. (Dkt. 43, at 3-4). Whatever the reason, Plaintiff's failure to follow proper appellate procedure does not confer this Court jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff seeks leave to amend his Second Amended Complaint, to add several new defendants: (1) attorneys at Shapiro and Cejda L.L.C., (2) attorneys at Baer Timberlake Coulson &amp; Cates PC, and (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   attorney Mark Hardin with Pierce Couch Hendrickson Baysinger &amp; Green L.L.P. (together, the \"Attorneys\") (Dkt. 46). Plaintiff seeks to add these defendants to assert claims against them for allegedly providing false documentation to the state court in the 2012 Foreclosure proceeding. Plaintiff also asks for leave to amend to clarify the cause of action and the nature of the case. Plaintiff does not attach a proposed Third Amended Complaint, and he does not explain how he proposes to amend his existing claims. Defendants oppose Plaintiff's request to amend.

If during the trial the successful party urges forged instruments, or perjured testimony or fails to introduce witnesses of whom he has knowledge and whose testimony would help his adversary and impair his own case, he is guilty of fraud; but it is intrinsic fraud, for relief from which application must be made to the court having jurisdiction of the issues joined and tried.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Patel v.

Plaintiff already has had ample opportunity to state his claims and cure any deficiencies by previous amendment, and Plaintiff points to no proposed amendments to the Second Amended Complaint that would affect the outcome of this case. \"Where the party seeking amendment knows or should have known of the facts upon which the proposed amendment is based but fails to include them in the original complaint, the motion to amend is subject to denial.\"\n   <em>\n    Las Vegas Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. v.

Plaintiff's Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On November 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed an \"Emergency Motion for a Evidentiary Hearing for a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction.\" (Dkt. 48). In this motion, Plaintiff states his property was sold at foreclosure auction on October 17, 2017, by Sheriff's sale, and he is currently subject to eviction from the foreclosed property. Plaintiff reiterates many of the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, and he again asserts the 2012 Foreclosure judgment is void and should be vacated by this Court. Plaintiff requests a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from selling or attempting to sell the property. In addition, he requests a declaration that sale of the property to enforce the deed of trust/mortgage is improper and that Defendants do not legally hold the note or deed of trust or have the right to foreclose on the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 48, at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This Court previously denied Plaintiff's request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6 (Opinion and Order, Dec. 7, 2016) ). In that Opinion and Order, the Court concluded Plaintiff's attempt to enjoin the sale of the property was barred by the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, because it sought to undo the state court's order in the 2012 Foreclosure proceeding.

Plaintiff presents no facts or arguments that would alter the Court's conclusion in the December 7, 2016, Opinion and Order. Accordingly, Plaintiff's requests for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Moreover, the Court concludes above in Part I.D that Plaintiff is not entitled to a permanent injunction. Plaintiff's motion presents no arguments or facts to change\n   that conclusion. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request for a permanent injunction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Plaintiff's Emergency Motion for an Order to Show Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, on November 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed an \"Emergency Motion for a Order to Show Cause and Request an Evidentiary Hearing.\" (Dkt. 49). In this motion, Plaintiff asks the Court to set a hearing regarding cancellation of the sale of Plaintiff's property. Plaintiff further requests that the Court vacate/dismiss the 2012 Foreclosure judgment, that the assignment of mortgage to Wells Fargo Bank NA be removed from Plaintiff's land record, and that Defendants be forever barred from filing a claim on the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 49, at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In response, Defendants state the confirmation of the Sheriff's sale of the subject property has already occurred, which renders the hearing request moot. (Dkt. 51). Defendants further argue the Court lacks jurisdiction to vacate or dismiss the 2012 Foreclosure judgment pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine and this Court lacks jurisdiction to remove a recorded assignment of mortgage from the land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court agrees it lacks authority to grant Plaintiff's requested relief. A hearing on Plaintiff's motion is unnecessary. For the reasons explained above in Part I.B.1,\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   bars this Court from vacating or dismissing the judgment in the 2012 Foreclosure proceeding. Further, Plaintiff cites no authority that would permit this Court to remove an assignment of mortgage from the land records, particularly when this Court is prohibited from vacating the 2012 Foreclosure judgment, and the Court is unaware of any such authority. Finally, a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from filing a claim on Plaintiff's property is unavailable, for the reasons explained above in Part I.D. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 49) is denied in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, the Court concludes that dismissal of this action as to Defendants is warranted. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 41) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff's \"Motion for Leave to Amend Its Second Amended Complaint\" (Dkt. 46) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .
