MEANS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case, plaintiff Michael L. Malone has claims remaining against six police officers of the City of Fort Worth, Texas, individually, and against the City of Fort Worth itself (\"Fort Worth\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now before the Court is Fort Worth's motion for summary judgment. The motion is supported by a brief and an extensive appendix. Malone filed a response to the motion, which is also supported by a lengthy appendix. Fort Worth did not file a reply or challenge any of Malone's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Malone's claims arise from his forcible arrest on July 23, 2009, after he fled from Fort Worth police officers in a stolen truck for seven to eight minutes, only to be stopped on a dead-end street. Eleven Fort Worth police officers arrived at the arrest location either immediately or soon after Malone brought the truck to a stop. The issues to be resolved in this case arise primarily from what happened during the first two minutes or so after Malone pulled the stolen pick-up truck to a stop. But what took place during Malone's pre-stop flight is also relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Video evidence from the dashboard camera of Officer Davis's police cruiser shows that he was the lead car chasing the pick-up truck driven by Malone for the great majority of the pursuit. But seconds before the chase terminated, Officer Tidwell, a canine officer, inserted his vehicle immediately behind Malone's truck. Thus, Tidwell, accompanied by his dog, \"Rocky\", was the first officer to pull his police cruiser directly behind Malone's by-then-stopped truck. Tidwell was followed closely by Officer Davis and then the other officers. Tidwell allegedly injured Malone when he forcibly removed him from the truck through the driver's-side window, struck him with the muzzle end of his gun, struck him with his knee, and then either allowed or prompted the dog to attack Malone both before and after he was handcuffed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the Court's resolution of previous dispositive motions, Malone has remaining a cause of action against Fort Worth for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment (including any potential bystander liability). Malone also asserts state-law causes of action against Fort Worth under the Texas Tort Claims Act due to Officer Tidwell's alleged negligence in the use of the dog and in the use of his gun to strike Malone.(Pl.'s Fourth Am. Compl.(\"FAC\") (doc. 146) 56-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After review of all relevant materials on file, the Court concludes that no genuine\n   disputes of material fact remain as to some elements of Malone's claims under \u00a7 1983 against Fort Worth. Accordingly, Fort Worth's summary-judgment motion as to those claims must be granted. Regarding Malone's state-law claims against Fort Worth for Officer Tidwell's use of the gun and dog, the Court concludes that Fort Worth is entitled to sovereign immunity, and such claims must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Summary-Judgment Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Evidence Submitted by the Parties\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of the motion for summary judgment, Fort Worth filed an appendix containing 186 pages of exhibits and a copy of a compilation DVD. (Fort Worth App.(docs. 278-1 through 278-6).) That appendix includes the following items, with a corresponding reference to each item's identifying letter: an August 30, 2016 Affidavit of Assistant Fort Worth Chief of Police Abdul Pridgen, along with copies of several sections of the Fort Worth Police Department General Orders (Sections 306, 314, 323.03, 410, 702, and 703), and a copy of portions of the Fort Worth Police Department Canine Unit Standard Operating Procedures Manual (Ex. A); an August 30, 2016 Affidavit of Fort Worth Police Department custodian of records Justin Seabourn, along with Texas Commission on Law Enforcement training records for each of the individual defendants remaining in this case (Officers Tidwell, Davis, Fields, Gipson, Stroud, and Lehman), and training records for the police dog \"Rocky\" (Ex. B); and a DVD containing a recording of the dashboard camera video from Officer Davis's patrol vehicle (\"Dash Cam View\"), a recording of the camera video from a City of Fort Worth police helicopter hovering over the scene (\"Aerial View\"), a recording of portions of the radio communications between officers pursuing Malone in flight, and a compilation of both the aerial and dash-camera video angles onto one screen (\"Compilation View\") (Ex.C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to the summary judgment motion, Malone filed an appendix containing 311 pages of materials, numbered sequentially.(Pl.'s App. (doc. 283-1) 1-314.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the back of the appendix is the declaration of Malone's counsel (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (doc. 283) 315-17) listing that he had provided true and correct copies of the following documents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   *the Internal Affairs Investigation File produced by the City of Fort Worth (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1-188);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   *the deposition transcript of Justin Stroud taken on October 24, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   189-197);.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   *the deposition transcript of James Fields taken on October 7, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   198-206);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   *the deposition transcript of Jason Gipson taken on October 15, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   207-214);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   *the deposition transcript of John Davis taken on October 4, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   215-224);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   *the General Orders produced by the City of Fort Worth (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   225-252);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   *the incident report and use-of-force report relating to Officer Tidwell and Alan Christopher Keppler in September 2007 produced by the City of Fort Worth (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   253-272);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   *Plaintiff's Brief in Support of his Response to Adrian W.

Although that is not the case in the instant suit, the Court does have before it several videos in this case that provide objective facts that dramatically assist this Court, and that the Court has considered in resolving the Fort Worth summary-judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court previously issued an opinion and order resolving all of the individual defendants' motions for summary judgment, which were based on the affirmative defense of qualified immunity. (Nov. 6, 2014 Opinion and Order (doc. 247).) In that opinion, this Court included a detailed chronology of what the video evidence revealed as to each officer's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6-12.) That detailed chronology was necessary to the resolution of the qualified-immunity motions, but not to resolve the issues addressed here. The Court, however, takes judicial notice of this objective video record of what took place on the evening of July 23, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Malone does not claim any officially adopted policy. Rather, he relies on the latter category, attempting to demonstrate official policy through practice or custom. Malone must therefore demonstrate that there existed \"[a] persistent widespread practice of city officials or employees, which, although not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks-Fields,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276314\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/803/#p808\">\n    860 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   808 (citing\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

And\n   Fort Worth helpfully quotes a section of its General Orders providing that the \"canine officer has responsibility for the police service canine and determining when circumstances warrant using the canine off leash in ... situations involving dangerous suspects.\" (Fort Worth App. at 14 (Gen. Ords. 323.03(B)(5) &amp; (6) ).) There is ample evidence that, working in tandem with that General Order, it is the custom and training of regular police officers to defer to the actions of the canine officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The strongest evidence of this custom is the sworn testimony of several bystander officers that once a dog is deployed the canine officer is assumed to be in charge of the scene and all other officers must defer to him. Specifically, Officer Stroud testified under examination by Malone's counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A (by Stroud): \"Am I trained to judge whether the dog is appropriately being used or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q (by Counsel): \"Yes sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A: \"No sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Q: Are you trained to see a dog on a suspect, to observe and see if the use of that dog is excessive force?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A: \"No sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q: \"You're trained just to stand back and not interfere?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A: \"Yes sir, let the K-9 officer handle the situation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Pl.'s App. (doc. 283-1) 192.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Similarly, Officer Fields testified that \"if there is a dog on scene, the K-9 handler is the only person trained to use that dog, so therefore-in that case they're in charge of the scene at that point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   200-201.) And more specific to this arrest, Officer Fields testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q: \"When you pulled up at the termination of the vehicle pursuit, had Officer Tidwell deployed the dog?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A: \"Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q: \"And under your training that means it's [Tidwell's] scene at that point?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A: \"Right.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   201.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Officer Gipson swore that \"[d]uring field training we're instructed if there's a K-9 unit on scene of our call, that K-9 unit is in charge. They take primary, and we're just there to assist them in whatever it is they need on that call.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   209.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Also under examination by Malone's counsel, Officer Davis testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q: \"Were you trained to stay away from police dogs when they were deployed?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A: \"We were trained to defer control to the K-9 officer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q: \"What was ... that training? What were you told to do?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A: \"I really didn't have any training per se for K-9.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   219.) Thus, four of Fort Worth's police officers have sworn to facts from which it may be inferred that their employer, Fort Worth, adopted or maintained a custom of deference by regular police officers to canine officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   *Evidence that Fort Worth had actual or constructive knowledge of this custom?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Even if the evidentiary materials recited above demonstrate that there is a practice or custom of deference by regular police officers to canine officers, Malone must also establish \" 'actual or constructive knowledge of such custom' by the municipality or the official who had policymaking authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks-Fields,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276314\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/803/#p808\">\n    860 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   808 (citing\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

Other than providing the evidentiary materials recited above showing the practice or custom of deference, Malone has provided no evidence to show actual knowledge of the practice or custom by a Fort Worth policymaker. Malone presents no evidence that\n   the issue was considered at a Fort Worth council meeting or other official meeting, nor has he demonstrated a prior awareness of the practice through written information presented to Fort Worth officials. Thus, there is no evidence to show actual knowledge by Fort Worth of such practice or custom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Further, Malone has failed to provide evidence to show any persistent or widespread violations of citizen's rights arising from actions where regular police officers are present with canine officers. In this regard, Malone has presented no evidence of any prior arrest with use-of-force events involving canines. Malone has provided no evidence of any persistent or widespread instances of excessive force arising from improper regular police officer deference to a canine officer. Malone has therefore not raised any material fact dispute as to the requisite knowledge by Fort Worth officials of a custom or practice of regular police officers deferring to canine officers.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   *Evidence that the custom was adopted or maintained with deliberate indifference (to show culpability and moving force)?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Furthermore, in addition to having to show a policy, practice or custom of Fort Worth, Malone must present evidence demonstrating that the policy (or practice or custom in this case) is the moving force behind the violation of Malone's constitutional rights. Malone has cited nothing in his appendix or elsewhere that shows that Fort Worth's alleged custom of deference (a) itself violated Malone's constitutional rights or (b) authorized or directed such a violation. This leaves for analysis only (c) whether the practice or custom was adopted or maintained with deliberate indifference to its known consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180369\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/379/293/#p309\">\n    379 F.3d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, although Malone pleaded five instances where officers allegedly used excessive force on fleeing suspects, he has neither alleged nor presented evidence demonstrating that four of these events involved canine officers. The only one of these five incidents that allegedly involved the use of a canine was a 2007 incident involving Officer Tidwell and arrestee Alan Christopher Keppler, where Tidwell was alleged to have \"threatened a dog attack against an arrestee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537775\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/363/#p370\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Malone provided extensive information about that event in the appendix to his response, including Fort Worth investigative reports and documents from the resulting litigation in\n   <em>\n    Keppler v. City of Fort Worth\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:09-CV-631-A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   250-289.) None of those documents indicate, however, that the event actually involved use of a canine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In his appendix, Malone has also included evidence of five instances of citizen complaints about Fort Worth officer conduct and two written reprimands of officers for use of excessive force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   290-306.) None of this evidence includes any allegation of the use of a canine, however, or allegations of regular police officers interacting with a canine officer in a manner that resulted in an injury to a citizen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Thus, the evidence provided by Malone gives no support to a claim that similar\n   incidents regarding regular officer deference to canine officers have taken place, much less that there were a sufficient number of prior incidents to put Fort Worth officials on notice that its policy of requiring deference by regular officers to canine officers would result in violations of the constitutional rights of Fort Worth's residents or visitors. Therefore, although Malone has presented evidence demonstrating the presence of a custom or practice of regular police officers deferring to canine officers, he has not presented evidence showing Fort Worth's knowledge of that custom or practice, nor has he presented evidence demonstrating that any such practice or custom was maintained with deliberate indifference to the obvious consequence that Malone's rights would be violated.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Question (2): Did Fort Worth's Inadequate Training of Regular Police Officers as to Canine Officers Result in a Violation of Malone's rights?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In addition to the claim against Fort Worth based on a policy of improper deference by regular officers to canine officers, Malone next contends that Fort Worth failed to properly train its regular police officers as to their interaction with canine officers. (Pl's Resp.(doc. 283) at 9.) Malone points out that although Fort Worth claims in its summary-judgment motion that its regular police officers have a duty to intervene if they observe the use of excessive force, Fort Worth does not actually identify the content of any such training. Thus, Malone essentially contends that Fort Worth failed to train its regular officers to intervene when a canine officer deploys a canine to apply excessive force against a person in the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As noted above, a local government's decision not to train employees about the duty to avoid violating citizen's rights may rise to the level of an official government policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks-Fields,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276314\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/803/#p808\">\n    860 F.3d at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To succeed on such a claim, Malone must demonstrate that (1) Fort Worth's training policies were inadequate, (2) Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent in adopting the training policy, and (3) the inadequate training directly caused the constitutional violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trammell v.

With regard to the requisite element that this particular training was inadequate, the Court concludes that this same evidence raises material fact disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In a further effort to satisfy his burden to provide evidence of inadequate training of regular officers as to canine officers, Malone also presents the report of Captain G. Ghilespi prepared for Deputy Chief A. Pridgen as a part of the Internal Affairs review of the arrest of and use-of-force against Malone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s App. (doc. 283) 12-15.) In that document, Captain Ghilespie lists his conclusions and recommendations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   It is clear that several areas of concern in this incident shall be addressed by training. Felony Stops, and related tactics at pursuit termination, as well as the use of the K9 partner wherein the suspect\n   is still inside a running vehicle are areas at a minimum, which will be reviewed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   RECOMMENDATION\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   I agree with Sergeant Norris [Internal Affairs Investigator] that training be designed to enhance our Unit skills, in addressing persons who are seated in vehicles and that must be taken into custody after verbal commands have failed, (as well as related deployment of the K9 partner in such circumstances).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14, 15.) Although this document shows that Fort Worth acknowledges the need for more training, it arose after and as result of this event. This Internal Affairs review cannot show Fort Worth's knowledge of the need for more particular training of regular officers and their interaction with canine officers prior to the arrest of Malone. But even if the Court assumes this document raises a material dispute relating to Fort Worth's knowledge of the adequacy of its training policy regarding regular officer engagement with canine officers, Malone must also present evidence demonstrating that Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent in adopting the inadequate training and that such training directly caused Malone's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   * Evidence that Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent in adopting or maintaining an inadequate training policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \"Deliberate indifference\" is characterized as a \"stringent standard of fault requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\"\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    563 U.S. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bd of Cty.

Fort Worth has presented evidence demonstrating that its officers are required to meet the statutory requirements of training for peace officers set by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, and that the Fort Worth Police Department uses a training program to continually train its officers on its policies, such as arrest procedures and use of force. Assistant Chief Pridgen states in his affidavit that the \"Fort Worth Police Department requires officers to intervene if they believe the force being used against an individual is excessive.\" (Fort Worth's App. (doc. 278-1) at 6.) Fort Worth has also presented evidence that each of the regular police officers that are defendants in this suit received extensive training over the course of their many years of employment.(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (doc. 278-3) Ex. B Seabourn Affidavit; (doc. 278-4) at 8-12 (Davis), 13-18 (Stroud), 19-23 (Lehman), 24-30 (Fields), 31-36 (Gipson).) None of these regular police officers had any disciplinary history similar to that at issue in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   . Malone has not presented evidence in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Thus, Malone has presented no evidence of a pattern of similar constitutional violations resulting from inadequate training, nor has he satisfied the \"single-incident exception\" by showing that it should have been obvious to the policymakers that the risk of injury was a \"highly predictable consequence\" of the failure to train the regular officers regarding canine officers. Malone has thus failed to create a genuine dispute of material fact on his claim that Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent regarding its training of the regular police officers as to their engagement with canine officers.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Question (3): Is there Evidence of Deliberate Indifference in the Supervision of the Canine Officers resulting in Violation of Malone's rights?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Malone also alleges that Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent to the need to provide adequate supervision to its canine officers, and in particular to Officer Tidwell. Like the standards applicable to a failure to train, to hold a local government liable for failure to supervise a plaintiff must show \"(1) the municipality's supervision was inadequate, (2) the municipality's policymaker was deliberately indifferent in supervising the subordinates, and (3) the inadequate supervision directly caused the plaintiff's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Clyce v.

Again, for Fort Worth to be liable for failure to supervise on the basis of this single incident, \"it at least must have been obvious that the 'highly predictable consequence' of not supervising its officers was that they 'would apply force in such a way that the Fourth Amendment rights of [citizens] were at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

In his arguments regarding the failure to properly supervise Tidwell, Malone contends that there are inconsistencies between these canine unit procedures and the Fort Worth General Orders. For example, although the general orders do not contain directives as to when or how a canine officer should be involved in a vehicle pursuit, the Canine Unit's Standard Operating Procedure includes explicit language in that regard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Canine units will not normally be involved in vehicle pursuits.\n   </em>\n   However, if a canine unit initiates a vehicle pursuit, they may continue the pursuit until such time that a marked patrol unit can take over the pursuit. For officer safety, a canine unit may join or will remain in the pursuit as the second unit until another patrol unit can take that position. Once the canine unit releases the pursuit to patrol units,\n   <em>\n    the canine unit will not be involved in the pursuit in any manner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   If a canine officer is notified of a vehicle pursuit and is near the area where the pursuit terminates, they may proceed to the termination location to assist in the search for and apprehension of the suspects. However, the canine unit may only proceed at code one\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   unless directed by dispatch or a supervisor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   36 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Thus, under Fort Worth's existing canine procedures manual, Officer Tidwell, as a canine officer, should not have continued in pursuit of Malone's vehicle and should not have been the first officer to engage Malone at the termination of the pursuit. (Pl's App. (doc. 283-1) at 244-45 (General Orders Manual \u00a7 305.03(D)(7) &amp; (8)(officer initiating pursuit in charge of apprehension); 217 (Deposition of Davis (Davis initiated pursuit) ); 218 (Davis arrived as the second vehicle just seconds behind Tidwell) ). Malone contends that when coupled with the evidence that regular officers are trained to defer to canine officers, Tidwell's violation of canine officer policies left him essentially unsupervised at the scene: once Tidwell deployed his canine, Davis and all of the other officers apparently acted consistently with their training to not interfere with the use of that canine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Additionally, Malone contends that Fort Worth is liable for failing to supervise Tidwell because Tidwell had a prior excessive-force incident that ended in litigation, and because the Internal Affairs investigation of his conduct regarding this incident was inadequate. Malone suggests this inadequacy is consistent with other incidents of complaints of excessive force that resulted in Internal Affairs reviews. The Fifth Circuit has recognized that municipal liability may arise from a plaintiff's allegations that a city failed to properly discipline its employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski v. City of Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p581\">\n    237 F.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581 (5th Cir. 2001) (\"Self-evidently, a City policy of inadequate officer discipline could be unconstitutional if it was pursued with deliberate indifference toward the constitutional rights of citizens.\") There the court acknowledged that one way to support a finding of municipal liability in such contexts \"might be a purely formalistic investigation in which little evidence was taken, the file was bare, and the conclusions of\n   the investigator were perfunctory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p581\">\n    at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Malone appears to rely on this precedent, reciting five examples of citizen complaints of excessive force that resulted, in each case, in an Internal Affairs department review that exonerated the officer, and two other Internal Affairs cases where officers were given a \"written reprimand\" in their permanent file for the use of excessive force and informed of the potential for further disciplinary action. (Pl.'s App. (doc. 283-1) 293-309.) The Court must now turn to the question of whether any of this evidence is sufficient to show Fort Worth's deliberate indifference, and if so, whether that indifference caused Malone's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   * Evidence that inadequate supervision of canine officers was deliberately indifferent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Malone must raise a factual dispute as to whether Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent in the supervision of Officer Tidwell, and that such inadequate supervision of Tidwell caused Malone's injuries. The Fifth Circuit has recognized that \"a municipality is subject to \u00a7 1983 liability when the municipality's policies regarding employee ... supervision were obviously inadequate, and the resulting lack of ... supervision was likely to (and actually did) lead to a constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Drake v. City of Haltom City,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Fed.%20Appx.%20897\">\n    106 Fed.Appx. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (5th Cir. 2004). Malone has failed to meet that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In the Internal Affairs Report of this arrest incident, Captain Ghilespie provided this summary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   It is readily apparent in the overall scope of the incident that Officer Tidwell and perhaps other personnel at the scene allowed the excitement and adrenaline of the incident as instigated by the suspect's dangerous and criminal actions take precedence in the overall tactical outcome and arrest process. Specifically, a Felony Stop as described in General Orders policy was not attempted (at the final termination point) of the pursuit. Rather Tidwell ended-up [sic] immediately outside the driver's door with his K9 partner, and attempting to order the suspect out of the stolen vehicle from that physical position. While it may have become necessary to approach the vehicle at some point to make the physical apprehension, the Felony Stop was not attempted. The driver had indeed previously demonstrated that he would go to extreme and dangerous measures to elude the officers, however at the termination point the tactical choices that were selected were not ideal, and increased the level of physical danger to Tidwell and the involved Patrol personnel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   (Pl.'s App. (doc. 283-1) 12.) As implied in this report, at the immediate moment when the vehicle pursuit stopped, if Officer Tidwell had followed Fort Worth canine policy and waited just a few seconds to consult with Officer Davis, it is possible that the regular police officers may have first approached Malone's vehicle, and that the canine would not have been deployed or deployed in a different manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   But Malone has not demonstrated that Tidwell's actions in immediately pulling his gun, deploying the canine off-leash, and running towards the stolen truck in which Malone was sitting resulted from any lack of supervision of him. Rather, as indicated in the Internal Affairs report, Tidwell's actions were taken in the \"excitement and adrenaline of the incident.\" Tidwell's decision to take these actions was contrary to Fort Worth policy, thus negating any claim that Tidwell's conduct resulted from inadequate supervision. Tidwell's violation of Fort Worth policy cannot be the basis for imposing liability on Fort Worth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703791\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/536/#p541\">\n    613 F.3d at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \" '[w]hen an official's discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of\n   that official's making, those policies, rather than the subordinate's departures from them, are the act of the municipality' \")(quoting\n   <em>\n    City of St. Louis v.

In\n   <em>\n    Peterson v. City of Fort Worth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495782\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/838/#p850\">\n    588 F.3d at 851-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Fifth Circuit determined that twenty-seven complaints of excessive force by officers of the Fort Worth Police Department over three years-without further evidence placing that number in context-were insufficient to establish a pattern of excessive force. The court noted that the record did not indicate the size of the police department or how many arrests were made over the relevant time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495782\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/838/#p850\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Pineda v.

(Pl.'s App. (doc. 283-1) 293-309.) Malone has not shown that records of these prior Internal Affairs complaints and written reprimands establish a pattern of Fort Worth failing to supervise it officers related to excessive force; thus, they do not demonstrate Fort Worth's deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Moreover, with regard to the evidence presented by Malone of Tidwell's own prior excessive-force complaint that resulted in a lawsuit, this incident alone does not support municipal liability against Fort Worth for a failure to supervise Tidwell. The Court finds instructive a case where the Western District of Texas rejected a claim of municipal liability against the City of San Antonio. The case arose from excessive force employed by one of the city's officers, McDaniel, in twisting and breaking the plaintiff's arm during her arrest, and evidence existed that McDaniel had been the subject of two prior complaints of excessive force:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   While Officer McDaniel has previously been under suspicion for the use of excessive police force, the summary judgment evidence is insufficient to create a dispute of material fact about the existence of a widespread pattern of excessive force condoned by the City. Plaintiff has established only two complaints (other than the present lawsuit) against Officer McDaniel since 2002. Plaintiff has not established how long Officer McDaniel has been on the police force, how many arrests he has made over the course of his career, how often an average police officer has complaints filed against him or her, and the frequency of arm injuries during arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Villasana v.

Tex. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Similarly, here Malone relies upon only one prior incident of the use of excessive force by Tidwell. Malone has not provided any of the kinds of contextual evidence required for that one prior incident to support an inference that Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent. Fort Worth, however, has provided some information to put this prior incident in context, as it has provided Tidwell's Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education Report as of September 2013. (Fort Worth App.(doc. 278-4) at 1-7.) That\n   record shows that, as of that date, Tidwell had been an officer with the Forth Worth police department since April 2001, and had received (not including his pre-hire Police Academy training) over 660 hours of training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5. Thus, Malone's evidence of Tidwell's one prior incident of the use of excessive force in the context of Tidwell's many years of service, without more, is not sufficient to establish that Fort Worth was deliberately indifferent to its failure to adequately supervise Tidwell, thus causing Malone's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraire v.

Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code 101.021(2) (West 2011). Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, a governmental unit, such as the City of Fort Worth, is not liable for the torts of its officers in the absence of a constitutional or statutory provision creating such liability.\n   <em>\n    Dallas Cty.

(Pl.'s FAC (doc. 146) \u00b6\u00b6 134-135.) As noted in Section IV(B)(1) of this opinion, as none of these incidents involved the use of a canine, they provided no support for Malone's claim against Fort Worth based upon a policy of regular officer deference to canine officers. To the extent Malone relies upon these five prior incidents of excessive force in support of an additional theory of recovery against Fort worth under \u00a7 1983 based on a more general policy of deliberate indifference to the use of excessive force, Malone has also failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact. As noted in the text above, in\n    <em>\n     Peterson,\n    </em>\n    the Fifth Circuit, in affirming this Court, explained that \"[w]here prior incidents are used to prove a pattern, they 'must have occurred for so long or so frequently that the course of conduct warrant the attribution to the governing body of knowledge that the objectionable conduct is the expected, accepted practice of city employees.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495782\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/838/#p850\">\n     588 F.3d at 850\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Webster v.

The Fifth Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Peterson\n    </em>\n    concluded that twenty-seven incidents of police excessive force complaints between 2002 and 2005 would not establish a pattern of excessive force because the Fort Worth police department employed more than 1,500 officers and reported more than 67,000 instances of crime per year.\n    <em>\n     Peterson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495782\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/838/#p850\">\n     588 F.3d at 851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Likewise, in this case, Malone's general recitation of five separate incidents of excessive force over the course of thirteen years is not sufficient evidence to raise a genuine dispute of material fact that Fort Worth generally has a policy of deliberate indifference to excessive force.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
