(Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 8 n.1 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff does not respond to this request in his opposition memorandum of law. (Dkt. No. 30 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) An issue exists as to whether there is a justiciable case or controversy on the equitable relief claims against the current Commissioner pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1). However, the Court need not decide this issue due to the findings in Part III of this Decision and Order, which dismisses all of the claims in Plaintiff's Complaint.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   GLENN T. SUDDABY, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court, in this disability discrimination action pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"Section 504\"), and the New York Human Rights Law (\"NYHRL\") filed by Daniel Levy (\"Plaintiff\") against the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\"DEC\"), Marc Gerstman (in his capacity as Acting DEC Commissioner), Tom Martin, Kris Alberga, and Robert Daley (collectively \"Defendants\"), are the following two motions: (1) Defendants' motion for summary judgment; and (2) Defendants' motion for sanctions against Plaintiff pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) and 37(c)(1). (Dkt. Nos. 24, 32.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted, and Defendants' motion for sanctions is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Generally, Plaintiff's Complaint asserts six claims. (Dkt. No. 1 [Compl.].) First, Plaintiff claims that the DEC and Gerstman engaged in disability discrimination in\n   violation of the ADA by refusing to provide reasonable accommodations, taking adverse action against him because of his disabilities, refusing to promote him because of discrimination, and providing pretextual reasons for imposing disciplinary actions (\"First Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) Second, Plaintiff claims that the DEC and Gerstman retaliated against him in violation of the ADA for seeking accommodations by issuing disciplinary counseling and negative performance reviews and by rejecting him for promotion (\"Second Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Third, Plaintiff claims that the DEC engaged in disability discrimination in violation of Section 504 for the same reasons discussed in relation to his ADA claim (\"Third Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.) Fourth, Plaintiff claims that the DEC retaliated against him in violation of Section 504 for the same reasons discussed in relation to his ADA claim (\"Fourth Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) Fifth, Plaintiff claims that Martin, Alberga, and Daley engaged in disability discrimination in violation of the NYHRL for the same reasons discussed in relation to his ADA claim (\"Fifth Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.) Sixth, Plaintiff claims that Martin, Alberga, and Daley retaliated against him in violation of the NYHRL for the same reasons discussed in relation to his ADA claim (\"Sixth Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.) As relief for these claims, Plaintiff seeks an injunction requiring that he be provided with the reasonable accommodations to which he is entitled, compensatory and punitive damages, lost wages and benefits, attorneys' fees, and any other appropriate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Undisputed Material Facts on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts were asserted and supported with accurate record citations by Defendants in their Statement of Material Facts and expressly admitted by Plaintiff in his response thereto or denied without appropriate record citations. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 2 [Defs.' Rule 7.1 Statement]\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 2 [Pl.'s Rule 7.1 Resp.].) As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that, in response to numerous facts, Plaintiff expressly admits the facts while asserting additional facts; these facts asserted by Defendants are therefore deemed admitted, notwithstanding the additional facts, which belong in a separately numbered statement of additional material facts in dispute under N.D.N.Y. L.R. 7.1(a)(3). (Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 2, at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 43, 45, 53, 60, 74, 88, 90, 105, 106 [Pl.'s Rule 7.1 Resp.].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. In the Summer of 1999, Plaintiff was hired by the DEC as a forest health inventory technician in a position that was expected to (and did) last until the Fall of 1999.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. After finishing college, Plaintiff took the Forester I civil service examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3. In 2000, Plaintiff was hired by the DEC as a Forester 1 Trainee in its sub-office located in Lowville, New York, after receiving a canvass letter and interviewing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4. The Forester 1 Trainee position in Lowville was available because of federal funding that was given to the DEC to address damage from a major ice storm in 1998.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. When the federal funding for ice storm positions ended, staff hired under that funding were offered other positions within the DEC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   6. Among several choices, Plaintiff chose to take the Forester 1 position available in Ray Brook in the Division of Lands and Forests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   7. In February 2016, Plaintiff admitted that his choice to take the Forester 1 position in Ray Brook \"might have been not\" the best choice for him because it requires him to use his \"weakest abilities\" instead of his strengths.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   8. When Plaintiff took the Forester 1 position in Ray Brook, his direct supervisor was Peter Grupe (a Forester 2), and Mr. Grupe's supervisor was Tom Martin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   9. Shortly after starting as a Forester 1 in Ray Brook, Plaintiff was assigned to develop unit management plans (\"UMP\") for two planning units: Lake Champlain Islands and Taylor Pond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   10. Developing a unit management plan is a step-by-step process guided by the Adirondack Park state land master plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   11. Pursuant to the master plan, UMP development by a Forester involves, among other things, the following steps: (1) inventoring the land unit in the field; (2) getting public comment on the planning of the land unit; (3) reviewing the public comment with other members of the interdisciplinary planning team; and (4) developing a written document that analyzes the data collected and outlines the current use of the land and proposed changes based on the analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   12. The amount of time that it takes to complete a UMP from start to finish varies depending on the complexity of the lands and management needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   13. Plaintiff's work schedule is 7:00 am to 3:00 pm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   14. After Plaintiff's workday ends, he engages in exercise including hiking, biking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, yard work, housecleaning, firewood cutting, volleyball, and running on an elliptical machine at the gym.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   15. Plaintiff generally gets more than four hours of exercise every day after his work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   16. It is rare that Plaintiff cannot get any exercise at all after work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   17. To manage his diabetes, Plaintiff eats when his blood sugar is low.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   18. To manage his diabetes, Plaintiff exercises if his blood glucose level is rising above 170mg/dl, but, if it is above 250mg/dl, he does not do intense exercise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   19. When his blood glucose levels are too high to exercise, Plaintiff can use only insulin to manage his diabetes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   20. Plaintiff is always able to test his blood sugar at work when needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   21. When Plaintiff was first assigned to work on the Taylor Pond and Lake Champlain Island land units, little to no planning had previously been done on those units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   22. Plaintiff was responsible for managing the Taylor Pond land unit from approximately 2003 until 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   23. After Plaintiff's involvement with writing the Taylor Pond UMP ended, he continued to manage that land until \"after [the UMP] was approved, after [he] began some implementation projects.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   24. Kris Alberga became Plaintiff's direct supervisor in approximately 2003.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   25. At some time between 2004 and 2007, Plaintiff made a request to the DEC for a reasonable accommodation to address his diabetic condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   26. Plaintiff sought this accommodation because he experienced resistence when he tried to modify his work schedule as he deemed necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   27. Plaintiff's inability to modify his work schedule was due to his supervisor, Kris Alberga, directing\n   him to work only on completing the writing of a UMP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   28. Goal dates for completing team drafts of UMPs change continuously based on the time it takes to accomplish the tasks necessary in the development phase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   29. Plaintiff was always aware of the set goal dates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   30. After a Forester 1 completes a team draft of a UMP, it must be reviewed by his direct supervisor, the Regional Forester, the Natural Resources Supervisor, the Regional Director, the Adirondack Park Agency, and the DEC Commissioner's Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   31. A UMP can be sent back to the authoring Forester at any time along the review process for edits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   32. After Plaintiff's direct supervisor reviews Plaintiff's team draft on a UMP, that supervisor either (1) makes comments on it and sends it to the Regional Forester for comment and then the document comes back to Plaintiff to incorporate the comments, or (2) sends it back to Plaintiff to make changes before it gets sent to the Regional Forester for review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   33. The Taylor Pond UMP and Lake Champlain Islands UMP were sent back to Plaintiff many times for changes to be made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   34. Any time that Kris Alberga told Plaintiff to work at his desk (rather than outside) was in order for Plaintiff to complete something in a UMP document.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   35. On July 31, 2013, Robert Daley met with Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff's assertion that he needs to be able to adjust his schedule and work outside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   36. During the July 13, 2013, meeting, Plaintiff said, \"[I]f there was a gym in the office, I could use the gym\" to get his necessary physical activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   37. To get guidance and understanding about the requirements of Plaintiff's\n   2007 accommodations, Robert Daley suggested that he and Plaintiff schedule a meeting with Juan Abadia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   38. Plaintiff met with Juan Abadia in August 2013 and complained that the following three accommodations were not being made by Robert Daley: (a) providing Plaintiff assignments in writing; (b) permitting Plaintiff to adjust his schedule on a daily basis (i.e., come in late or leave early and make up time instead of using sick leave); and (c) allowing Plaintiff to work on a variety of assignments to get physical activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   39. DEC offered to provide a treadmill for Plaintiff to use in the workplace when he needed physical activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   40. Plaintiff rejected the offer of making a treadmill available for his use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   41. DEC offered to transfer Plaintiff to a Forester 1 position in the Saratoga Tree Nursery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   42. Plaintiff rejected the offered transfer to the Forester 1 position in the Saratoga Tree Nursery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   43. After Robert Daley took over as Plaintiff's direct supervisor, Plaintiff had little contact with Kris Alberga.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   44. Plaintiff interviewed for at least three Forester 2 positions while Kris Alberga was his direct supervisor, and was not offered any of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   45. Plaintiff interviewed for at least three Forester 2 positions while Robert Daley was his direct supervisor, and was not offered any of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   46. After Robert Daley became Plaintiff's direct supervisor, Plaintiff's attorney requested that Plaintiff be provided with direct access to an editorial assistant as an accommodation for Plaintiff's written work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   47. The request for an editorial assistant was made because Kris Alberga and Tom Martin were no longer serving as Plaintiff's editorial assistant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   48. During Plaintiff's November 5, 2013, interview for a Forester 2 position, Kris Alberga advised Plaintiff that the position required\n   that the employee be in the office most of the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   49. During the November 5, 2013, interview for a Forester 2 position, Tom Martin asked Plaintiff if he thought he would be able to do an office-based job, and Plaintiff said that he thought the job would provide him with enough opportunity to get his requisite physical activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   50. Plaintiff recorded the November 5, 2013, interview without the knowledge of Tom Martin or Kris Alberga.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   51. During the February 25, 2016, interview for a Forester 2 position, Kris Alberga informed Plaintiff that the position would be primarily an in-office position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   52. With Plaintiff's knowledge and consent, Tom Martin and Kris Alberga recorded the February 25, 2016, interview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   53. In 2013, when an editorial assistant was briefly available for use by Forester 1s in the Ray Brook office, more than 1,900 necessary grammatical changes were identified by that assistant, Kris Alberga, and Tom Martin in one of Plaintiff's UMP drafts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   54. Plaintiff alleges that he has the following disabling conditions: (a) hearing loss; (b) diabetes ; and (c) a learning disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   55. In 2007, the DEC granted Plaintiff the following reasonable accommodations to address these conditions: (a) work breaks with walking within the DEC's time and attendance rules; (b) eating when needed; (c) blood testing when needed; (d) insulin injections when needed; (e) a food storage area; (f) using the bathroom as needed; (g) varied work assignments depending on blood glucose levels through consultation with Plaintiff; (h) flexible scheduling through work schedule adjustments; (i) minimized stress in interaction; (j) outdoor assignments as permitted by weather and the existing DEC mission; (k) clear and precise instruction whenever possible, with clarifying feedback; (l) written confirmation of verbal assignments; (m) permission to take notes during assignments; (n) a telephone with volume control and clear reception; and (o) a work environment that allows Plaintiff to preserve his dignity while accomplishing the DEC's mission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   56. Plaintiff's specific complaint in August 2013 was that supervisors required him to complete office-based work instead of permitting him to determine when he needed to work outside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   57. Plaintiff also complained about the imposition of short deadlines, which caused him to have to cancel previously scheduled meetings or field work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   58. Juan Abadia scheduled a meeting with Plaintiff and Plaintiff's supervisors, Robert Daley and Kris Alberga, to discuss the issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   59. That meeting took place on August 16, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   60. During that meeting, Mr. Abadia offered to obtain a treadmill for Plaintiff to use in his workplace if he felt that physical activity was necessary when he was assigned work that needed to be completed in the office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   61. Plaintiff refused that accommodation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   62. In September 2013, Plaintiff requested a further accommodation to address his diabetic condition in the form of \"long periods of large muscle exercise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   63. In a September 4, 2013, letter written on Plaintiff's behalf, the following accommodation request was made to the DEC for the first time: \"direct access to the administrative support staff person in the Warrensberg office who now provides editorial assistance to the Ray Brook office.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   64. As a result, in September 2013, the DEC's Office of Administrative Action requested medical documentation to support both of the requests for long periods of large muscle activity and editorial assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   65. On September 24, 2013, Plaintiff provided Juan Abadia with a report from endocrinologist Dr. Mary Luidens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   66. On January 8, 2014, Plaintiff provided Juan Abadia with a report from Dr. Alan Barnett dated December 12, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   67. The only writing-related accommodation recommended by Dr. Barnett in that report was for \"use of [a] word processing program with spell-check and grammar check.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   68. It was learned that a Forester 1 position would soon become available at the Saratoga Tree Nursery, which is a working tree farm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   69. Juan Abadia obtained the necessary internal concurrence from management to offer and reassign Plaintiff to that position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   70. That transfer was offered to Plaintiff on March 10, 2014, and rejected by him on March 11, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   71. In an attempt to accommodate Plaintiff's alleged needs to take leave to manage his diabetic condition, Juan Abadia inquired of the DEC whether Plaintiff would be eligible for benefits under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   72. Such benefits would include Plaintiff being able to choose between\n   using accrued leave time with pay or taking FMLA leave without pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   73. On April 1, 2014, Juan Abadia and the DEC FMLA representative Lauri Beliguard had a lengthy telephone conversation with Plaintiff about FMLA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   74. The DEC supplied Plaintiff with the FMLA certification form to be completed by a physician; but, despite sending several reminders, Plaintiff never submitted the certification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   75. Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") dated March 20, 2014, which was received by the EEOC on March 31, 2014; the DEC learned of this charge on April 21, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   76. On May 2, 2014, Juan Abadia, DEC attorney Phil Lodico, and Robert Daley met with Plaintiff and his advocate to discuss Plaintiff's claims regarding the 2007 accommodations of varied work assignments and opportunity for outdoor activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   77. By letter dated December 9, 2014, Juan Abadia informed Plaintiff that the reports provided by Dr. Luidens and Dr. Barnett were \"clinical descriptions of your conditions, but do not link these conditions to accommodations you need to fulfill your DEC duties as a Forester 1.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   78. By letter dated December 19, 2014, Plaintiff's attorney disagreed with Juan Abadia's December 9, 2014, letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   79. Additionally, by letter dated January 13, 2015, the DEC informed Plaintiff that the reports provided by Dr. Barnett and Dr. Luidens did not support Plaintiff's new requests for reasonable accommodations in the form of (a) a minimum of two days of outdoor work each week, and (b) use of an editorial assistant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   80. Specifically, the DEC's January 13, 2015, letter stated that \"Dr. Luidens does not call for DEC to incorporate physical exercise into [Plaintiff's] work duties, nor does she specify what physical exercise [Pliantiff] can do during the work day to control his disabling condition.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   81. That letter also states as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   With respect to your request for an[ ] \"editorial assistant,\" Dr. Barnett only recommend[ed] that [Plaintiff] have \"a word processing program with spell-check and grammar check.\" I note that the word processing program installed on [Plaintiff's] work computer has those features (Your December 19 letter appears to acknowledge that the request for an \"editorial assistant\" goes beyond Dr. Barnett's recommendation.) In addition, it is unclear what specific \"editorial\" services [Plaintiff] requires to perform his duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   82. Finally, the DEC's January 13, 2015, letter states as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   More information is needed to evaluate whether the requested additional accommodations are necessary to address [Plaintiff's] disabling conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   If additional accommodations are found to be necessary, we will then determine through the interactive process what accommodations are reasonable to effectively address those conditions and fulfill the Department's mission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   83. On March 25, 2015, Plaintiff provided the DEC with a March 17, 2015, letter from Dr. Luidens, which stated, inter alia,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   I am requesting that [two-to-four] hours of large muscle activity [two-to-four] days per week be incorporated into [Plaintiff's] regular work schedule. This would include such activities as hiking in the woods, snow-shoeing, cross-country skiing, mountain biking, and other similar activities, all of which I understand are included in the duties of his job. This would be in addition to the exercise he is already doing outside of regular work hours. Large muscle activity is essential for him to help stabilize his fluctuating blood glucose levels caused by his Type 1 diabetes, and also helps to address the increased stress levels that he has due to the writing activities that are required of him at work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   84. Plaintiff, Tom Martin, Kris Alberga, and Robert Daley all completed required Equal Employment Opportunity Rights and Responsibility training from 2013 through 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   85.

Parties' Briefing on the Pending Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Defendants' Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In their motion for summary judgment, Defendants assert four arguments. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 8-45 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) First, Defendants argue that any claims based on conduct occurring before June 4, 2013, are untimely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17.) More specifically, Defendants argue that, because Plaintiff was required to file his EEOC charge within 300 days of the alleged discrimination, any incidents occurring before June 4, 2013, would be time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.) Defendants further argue that incidents occurring before June 4, 2013, cannot be considered as part of a continuing violation because Plaintiff testified that the failure to accommodate his disabilities worsened after Daley became his supervisor in May 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is unable to establish a claim of disability discrimination because the ADA, Section 504, and NYHRL require only the provision of accommodations that allow an individual to perform his or her job, not accommodations that would improve the individual's health or require revision of the job descriptions of other employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Specifically, Defendants argue as follows: (a) Plaintiff has failed to show he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA because he has not shown that his diabetes impacts his ability to work rather than merely that his job interferes with his ability to manage his diabetes; (b) the accommodations offered and/or provided were reasonable, including the offer to put a treadmill in the office, to allow Plaintiff to transfer to a different position of an equivalent rank, and the provision of spelling and grammar tools; (c) further accommodations requested by Plaintiff were both an undue burden and unsupported by medical or other evidence; (d) Plaintiff is not qualified to perform all the essential functions of his job; and (e) Plaintiff has failed to show that he suffered an adverse action because of his disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is unable to establish a claim of retaliation against the DEC and the DEC Commissioner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-43.) More specifically, Defendants argue that it is not clear what retaliatory adverse actions Plaintiff is alleging, other than a denial of requests for accommodations after he complained about the denial of his requests for accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant also argues that some of the actions Plaintiff alleges to be retaliatory occurred before he made complaints about his accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Fourth, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is unable to establish violations of the NYHRL because none of the Defendants directly and purposefully participated in acts of discrimination or retaliation against Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-45.) Specifically, Defendants argue that (a) none of them were involved in decisions regarding accommodations, (b) Daley was not involved in any interviews or decisions related to Plaintiff's attempts to be promoted to Forester 2, (c) Martin and Alberga did not write counseling memorada or negative evaluations during the relevant time period, and (d) none of them set the work priorities for the DEC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Generally, in opposition to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff makes five arguments. (Dkt. No. 36, Attach. 2, at 16-32 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) First, in opposition to Defendants' second argument, Plaintiff argues that he qualifies as a person with a disability under the ADA, Section 504, and NYHRL because (a) his diabetes substantially impairs the function of his endocrine system and affects his ability to perform job tasks, (b) his hearing impairment impairs his abilities to hear and communicate, and (c) his learning disability impairs his ability to communicate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Second, also in opposition to Defendants' second argument, Plaintiff argues that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, noting that he has been working as a forester since 2000 and has always been in good standing with no unsatisfactory evaluations until this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Third, in opposition to Defendants' third and fourth arguments, Plaintiff argues that the denial of fieldwork assignments was a refusal of a reasonable accommodation in retaliation for Plaintiff's efforts to obtain accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-28.) Specifically, Plaintiff argues that fieldwork is medically necessary to successfully manage his blood glucose level, citing to a declaration from his endocrinologist Dr. Leinung, that\n   supports his assertion of medical necessity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-28.) Plaintiff also argues that he was required to do more UMP work than other colleagues, that other foresters often performed fieldwork throughout the winter contrary to assertions that there was less fieldwork during that time of year, and that the accusations that he failed to perform his job duties and follow instructions are false and in retaliation for his pursuit of accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Fourth, in opposition to Defendants' second argument, Plaintiff argues that use of an editorial assistant was a reasonable accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the request was based on his learning disability, and that the request was reasonable and would not cause undue hardship because he would be able to use existing administrative staff for this function. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Fifth, in opposition to Defendants' fifth argument, Plaintiff argues that Defendants retaliated against him in violation of the NYHRL by sabotaging his opportunities for promotion to a Forester 2 position, noting in particular that, regarding the eight positions he has interviewed for, he had a higher civil service examination score than four of the successful candidates and more forestry experience than all but one of the successful candidates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Generally, in reply to Plaintiff's opposition memorandum of law, Defendants make three arguments. (Dkt. No. 31, at 5-11 [Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law].) First, Defendants argue that, in his opposition memorandum, Plaintiff admitted he did not require accommodations for writing beyond those provided to other Forester 1s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Defendants also argue that there are discrepancies in Plaintiff's testimony and allegations about whether his previous supervisors had acted as editorial assistants on his UMP drafts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's discussion of the facts misrepresents the evidence, arguing in particular that there is evidence of Plaintiff's poor writing skills throughout the record that contradict his assertion that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of his job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Defendants also argue that the fact that Plaintiff has had more UMPs is not by itself evidence of discrimination, and that there is no evidence that his hearing impairment has not been reasonably accommodated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Defendants also note that Plaintiff's arguments rely on facts post-dating the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that the statements in Plaintiff's post-deposition declaration that contradict or elaborate on his deposition testimony should be disregarded because they were submitted for the sole purpose of opposing Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Defendants' Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In their motion for sanctions, Defendants argue that they are entitled to sanctions pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) and 37(c)(1) and N.D.N.Y. L.R. 26.3 based on Plaintiff's failure to obey the scheduling order regarding expert witness disclosures. (Dkt. No. 32, Attach. 2, at 4-11 [Defs' Mem. of Law].) Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiff violated the above-mentioned rules by using a declaration from treating physician Dr. Leinung in his opposition memorandum because Plaintiff did not disclose Dr. Leinung during the discovery period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-11.) Defendants therefore request that Dr. Leinung's testimony be excluded when considering the motion for summary judgment\n   and struck from the record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Generally, in opposition to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff asserts five arguments. (Dkt. No. 38, at 3-11 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) First, Plaintiff argues that the authority cited by Defendants related to expert witnesses is not applicable to a treating physician. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Plaintiff argues that Defendants were aware that Dr. Leinung was a treating physician rather than an expert witness based on previous discovery documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that using Dr. Leinung's declaration did not violate N.D.N.Y. L.R. 26.3 because Dr. Leinung was identified in an interrogatory in April 2016, well before the November 2016 expert disclosures deadline; Plaintiff argues that there was no requirement to submit a supplemental disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Third, Plaintiff argues that exclusion is an extreme remedy and should not be applied here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiff argues that there is no basis for sanctions because he was not obligated to disclose Dr. Leinung as an expert witness and Defendants were not harmed by the failure to disclose because they had the opportunity to respond to that declaration in their reply memorandum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) Plaintiff additionally argues that Defendants were not denied the opportunity to depose Dr. Leinung because it was evident from the medical records and evidence from April 2016 that Dr. Leinung was a treating physician. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Fifth, Plaintiff argues that an opportunity to depose Dr. Leinung would have no bearing on the motion for summary judgment, and so the Court should first decide Defendants' motion for summary judgment before granting Defendants the ability to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Generally, in reply to Plaintiff's opposition memorandum of law, Defendants assert two arguments. (Dkt. No. 39, at 4-12 [Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law].) First, Defendants argue that, as a treating physician, Dr. Leinung is an expert witness who is not required to provide a report as defined by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 ; Defendants note also that, under the rules, a treating physician who is not serving as an expert witness is permitted to testify only about matters within their personal knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.) Defendants argue that, because Plaintiff did not properly disclose Dr. Leinung pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, Dr. Leinung would be permitted to testify only about the treatment he personally provided; however, the declaration he provided goes well beyond that personal knowledge and therefore should be struck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that the prejudice from Plaintiff's failure to disclose cannot be remedied because it prevented them from timely objecting to use of Dr. Leinung as a witness and from obtaining deposition testimony clarifying portions of his opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Defendants argue that, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, mentioning Dr. Leinung on a list of 14 other medical providers did not provide sufficient notice to Defendants that they would need to depose Dr. Leinung or that Dr. Leinung would be called to testify, particularly because Dr. Leinung treated Plaintiff only once (after the current litigation had already been filed).

Whether Dr. Leinung's Declaration Should Be Stricken and Plaintiff Be Subject to Sanctions Based on Violations of Federal and Local Rules of Civil Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   After careful consideration, the Court finds that motion for sanctions (namely, to strike Dr. Leinung's declaration) should be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court notes that it would render the same decision on the issues raised in Defendants' motion for summary judgment even if it denied in its entirety Defendants' motion for sanctions for two reasons. First, regardless of whether Dr. Leinung's declaration (and, specifically, his opinion regarding Plaintiff's need for large muscle activity during the workday) were to be stricken from the record, another physician, Plaintiff's treating endocrinologist, Dr. Ludens, also opined on the same limitation for two to four hours of large muscle activity two to four days per week as part of Plaintiff's work schedule. (Dkt. No. 25, at \u00b6 12 [Graziadei Decl.]; Dkt No. 25, Attach. 1, at 52; Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 489 \u00b6 13 [Leinung Decl.].) Because Plaintiff relies on these opined limitations to support his argument that (a) large muscle activity was a reasonable accommodation and (b) medically necessary to manage his blood glucose levels, Plaintiff's arguments do not depend entirely on Dr. Leinung's declaration. Second, even if there are portions of Dr. Leinung's declaration that are not the same as or similar to Dr. Ludens' opinion or other evidence in the record, Dr. Leinung's declaration and opinion as a whole would not alter the Court's findings outlined in Part III.B of this Decision and Order because those findings are based on considerations other than the medical evidence related to Plaintiff's diabetes. The Court therefore denies Defendants' motion for sanctions as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Plaintiff's Claims Arising Before June 4, 2013, Are Barred by the Applicable Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   After carefully considering the matter, the Court answers this question in the affirmative for the reasons stated in Defendants' memorandum of law. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 13-17 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) To those reasons, the Court adds the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff, in his opposition memorandum of law, failed to oppose or respond to Defendants' argument regarding the statute of limitations. As a result, Defendants' burden with respect to this argument is \"lightened such that, in order to succeed, the argument need only have facial merit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

This finding is particularly warranted when considering the lightened burden on Defendants due to Plaintiff's failure to respond to this argument.

(Dkt. No. 30, at 16-17 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) To those reasons, the Court adds the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Pursuant to the ADA, the term \"disability\" means, with respect to an individual, the following: (a) \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [the] individual;\" (b) \"a record of such impairment;\" or (c) \"being regarded as having such an impairment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

City of Utica\n   </em>\n   , 15-CV-0374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201069673\">\n    2016 WL 1069673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2016) (Kahn, J.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff's diabetes does not constitute a disability under the ADA because, rather than alleging that his diabetes interferes with his ability to perform work, Plaintiff alleges that his work schedule interferes with his diabetes-care regimen. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 20-21 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendants argument misses the mark. Whether or not Plaintiff's diabetes substantially interferes with his specific ability to work is not the relevant inquiry, but rather whether it substantially interferes with any major life activity. The admissible evidence of record establishes that Type I diabetes substantially limits Plaintiff's endocrine functioning, resulting in the need to check his glucose levels and take insulin multiple times per day and the need to adopt other maintenance methods such as exercise and food regulation in order to ensure his blood glucose levels do not become dangerously or life-threateningly high or low. Plaintiff has therefore met his burden to show that his diabetes qualifies as a disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, as noted previously, the definition of disability in the NYHRL is even broader that the aforementioned definition in the ADA and Defendants do not specifically argue that Plaintiff does not have a disability under the NYHRL. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has met his burden to show the existence of disabilities under both the ADA and the NYHRL standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether DEC Had Notice of Plaintiff's Disabilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Because Defendants do not appear to contest this element, the Court will discuss it only briefly. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 18-30 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) As noted above in Part I.B of this Decision and Order, it is undisputed that Plaintiff requested and was granted accommodations related to his diabetes and hearing impairment in 2007, and that he requested accommodations related to his learning disorder (as that impairment affected his writing abilities) some time after Daley became his supervisor in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 35, 37-39, 46, 55-57, 65-67. The evidence therefore establishes that Defendants had notice of Plaintiff's disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether, with Reasonable Accommodations, Plaintiff Was Able to Perform the Essential Functions of His Job as a Forester 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   After careful consideration, the Court answers this question in the negative for the reasons stated in Defendants' memorandum of law. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 26-27, 31-33 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) To those reasons, the Court adds the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff is not qualified to perform the essential job function of writing in particular, with or without\n   a reasonable accommodation, and therefore is not a \"qualified person\" for the purposes of the discrimination analysis. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 4, at 26-27, 31-33 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff opposes this argument by arguing that his ability to perform the essential job functions is evident from the fact that he has been employed as a Forester 1 since 2000 without any unsatisfactory evaluations until recently. (Dkt. No. 30, at 18 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Notably, neither party explicitly clarifies what they believe to be the essential job functions for a Forester 1 in their memoranda. However, it is apparent from statements made by Plaintiff in his deposition and other evidence that the preparation of UMPs was a facet of the work of a Forester 1 in the type of position Plaintiff held at Ray Brook,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   a task that included significant writing. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 1, at 41:2-8, 50:21-25, 51:10-52:4 [Pl.'s Dep.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at 4 \u00b6 12 [Alberga Decl.]; Dkt. No. 25, Attach. 1, at 47; Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 495 \u00b6 8 [O'Connor Decl.].) The Court therefore finds that, based on the admissible record evidence, the ability to write was an essential function of the Forester 1 job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805377\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/120/#p125\">\n    711 F.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, when determining the essential functions of a position, \"a court must conduct 'a fact-specific inquiry into both the employer's description of the job and how the job is actually performed in practice' \"). The Second Circuit has stated that the burden for demonstrating that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions with or without reasonable accommodations is \"not heavy: '[i]t is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits.' \"\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805377\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/120/#p125\">\n    711 F.3d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff suggested a number of possible accommodations, including a spelling and grammar check program and access to an editorial assistant to review and edit the sentence structure, punctuation, and grammar of his writing. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 1, at 180:2-182:18, 185:4-186:21, 262:4-265:3 [Pl.'s Dep.]; Dkt. No. 30, at 27-30 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) However, the admissible record evidence does not create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether these accommodations, even if reasonable, would allow Plaintiff to perform the essential writing functions of a Forester 1. Plaintiff admits in his deposition testimony that Alberga and Martin (as well as other DEC staff members on occasion) served as his editorial assistants during the time period that Alberga was his supervisor. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 1, at 180:11-184:5 [Pl.'s Dep.].) Both Alberga and Martin corroborate having performed extensive edits on Plaintiff's work. Notably, both testified at their depositions that Plaintiff's drafts needed significantly more corrections than those drafted by other Forester 1s, a sentiment later echoed by Daley in his April 13, 2017, affidavit (although Daley stated he refused to perform the same extensive editing that Alberga and Martin had performed). (Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 119:6-10, 121:1-2 [Alberga Dep.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at 7 \u00b6 18 [Alberga Decl.]; Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 441:1-16, 442:17-19 &amp; 23-24 [Martin Dep.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 5-8 \u00b6\u00b6 21-28, 38 [Daley Aff.].) The testimony and other statements from Alberga, Martin, and Daley also establish that Alberga and\n   Martin's review went beyond mere grammatical editing and involved them personally rewriting large portions of Plaintiff's UMP drafts. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 7 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32 [Daley Aff.]; Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 444:10-11 &amp; 17-21 [Martin Dep.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at 14-15 \u00b6 39 &amp; n.1 [Alberga Decl.].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In addition to Plaintiff's supervisors' concerns and interventions related to grammar and other basic issues, those supervisors stated that Plaintiff had difficulties with other writing tasks including internal consistency of words and ideas and his ability to deal with the less concrete aspects of planning and writing a UMP, such as organizing and processing information collected during the planning process. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at 7 \u00b6 18-19 [Alberga Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 5 \u00b6 21, 23 [Daley Aff.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 7, at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46 [Martin Decl.]; Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 132:8-19 [Alberga Dep.]; Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 366:20-367:6 [Daley Dep.].) At his deposition and in his affidavit, Daley testified that Plaintiff also displayed issues with basic sentence structure, formatting, properly referencing or introducing graphs and tables, and misquoting or failing to cite information. (Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 366:20-367:6 [Daley Dep.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 5 \u00b6 21 [Daley Aff.].) Daley also stated that, even when given edits on his written work, Plaintiff \"consistently fails to properly incorporate\" those edits in future drafts. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 6 \u00b6 26, 7 \u00b6 28 [Daley Aff.].) Because the record establishes that Plaintiff's difficulties went beyond grammar and other basic writing skills, it is not apparent that access to an editorial assistant (even if reasonable) would enable Plaintiff to perform the essential writing functions of the job. Notably, Daley stated in his affidavit that, when there had been an administrative assistant available for a time to proofread documents for foresters at the Ray Brook office, that assistant had not been expected to edit documents for \"substance, organization, or consistency.\" (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 8 \u00b6 34 [Daley Aff.].) The evidence presented by both Plaintiff and Defendants therefore establishes that Plaintiff's difficulties with writing included deeper issues with the substantive content of the UMPs that would not be solved by review from an editorial assistant. Plaintiff does not identify any plausible accommodations that would address his need for substantial additional assistance not only with spelling, grammar, and punctuation, but with substantive analysis and consistency. Notably, to place that burden on another DEC employee (whether it be Plaintiff's supervisor or an assistant) would come dangerously close to eliminating one of the essential functions of Plaintiff's job; this is particularly true based on the evidence that Alberga and Martin had to personally rewrite substantial portions of Plaintiff's UMP drafts to make them of acceptable quality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

(Dkt. No. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 140-142, 157-59, 174-76, 178-79 [Compl.].) In his opposition memorandum of law, Plaintiff argues more specifically that (a) Daley issued a counseling memo in July 2013 restricting Plaintiff from using chainsaws and other motorized equipment a week after Plaintiff reminded Daley that failure to allow him more outdoor work assignments was a violation of the accommodations granted in 2007, (b) Daley \"falsely accused\" Plaintiff of insubordination in December 2013, which resulted in further restriction of Plaintiff's outdoor activities, and (c) Defendants failed to promote Plaintiff.

The Court need not decide whether the actions identified in Plaintiff's opposition memorandum of law\n   are adverse actions causally connected to Plaintiff's requests for accommodations, because, even if Plaintiff can establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation, the evidence establishes that there were legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for those actions that Plaintiff has not shown to be merely a pretext for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Regarding the July 2013 counseling memorandum and Plaintiff's subsequent loss of chainsaw and motorized equipment privileges, the evidence as a whole establishes that these actions occurred as a result of concerns that Daley had about Plaintiff's conduct and safety. In his declaration, Daley stated that, in July 2013, he learned that Plaintiff had been cutting standing tress on two occasions while alone and without DEC dispatch knowing his whereabouts, noting that Foresters are required to inform DEC dispatch when they are doing fieldwork as part of safety protocol; he stated that this violation of safety protocol was the reason for prohibiting Plaintiff from using chainsaws. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at \u00b6\u00b6 45-48, 81 [Daley Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 41-42, 48, 70, 72.) Plaintiff stated in both his EEOC charge and his declaration that the reason provided to him by Daley for restricting his chainsaw use was that \"it was unsafe, especially since [Plaintiff is] a diabetic,\" and that Daley used Plaintiff's arguing with Daley about his chainsaw use as the basis for restricting him from using motorized equipment. (Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1, at 483 \u00b6\u00b6 54-56 [Pl.'s Decl.]; Dkt. No. 25, Attach. 2, at 52-53 [EEOC Charge].) Although Plaintiff alleges that Daley was incorrect in stating he had been alone or that no one had known where he was while he was using the chainsaw,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   he does not provide any evidence that Daley's reasons related to safety were a pretext for a retaliatory motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, Plaintiff has produced no evidence showing that (a) the safety protocol referenced by Daley does not exist, or (b) that Plaintiff in fact complied with that protocol. The mere fact that the counseling memorandum was issued approximately a week after Plaintiff discussed his outdoor-work accommodations with Daley does not by itself establish a retaliatory motive. Plaintiff has not shown a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants' reasons for limiting chainsaw and motorized equipment use was merely a pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

Namely, Daley stated that Plaintiff suffered an accident while scouting potential facilities in deep snow, despite the fact that Daley had \"specifically told him not to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 10 \u00b6 49 [Daley Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 236, 245-46.) Due to Daley's concerns about Plaintiff's failure to \"understand directions and use proper judgment,\" Daley directed him to refrain from any fieldwork unless approved by Daley. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at \u00b6\u00b6 50-52, 61, 81 [Daley Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 50, 53, 61-63.) In his deposition, Plaintiff testified that, from the end of 2013 to June 2016, he was not able to leave the office without Daley's permission. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 1, at 148:25-149:7 [Pl.'s Dep.].) Plaintiff argues that Daley's assertion that he violated orders was false, and asserts that Daley had changed the substance of his directions when justifying imposing activity restrictions on Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the relevant emails show that, although Daley's response email was less clear than it could have been, Plaintiff acknowledged that Daley had told him not to inventory the lands or the facilities on the lands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff therefore has not shown that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Daley's use of Plaintiff's failure to follow instructions as a basis for restricting his independent outdoor activities was merely a pretext for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Regarding Plaintiff's allegations that Defendants failed to promote him to Forester 2 in retaliation for seeking compliance with his granted accommodations, various sources have provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the failure to promote. In his declaration, Alberga listed multiple factors that he considers when determining whether to promote a Forester 1 and stated that \"[a] candidate's score on a civil service examination or the amount of years employed by the [DEC] are not determinative factors when hiring a Forester 2.\" (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at \u00b6\u00b6 43-46 [Alberga Decl.].) In his declaration, Martin stated that, while the DEC is required to offer interviews to the three applicants with the highest civil service examination scores, those scores are not determinative for any other purpose in the interview and hiring process. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 7, at \u00b6 52 [Martin Decl.].) Martin stated that the candidates who ultimately received the positions Plaintiff applied and interviewed for were chosen based on factors including more relevant experience, better answers to the standard interview questions, better ideas, or better qualifications and/or relevant skills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 59, 61, 63.) Defendants Alberga, Martin, and Daley have also all stated that they have never been consulted or asked about their opinions of Plaintiff's qualifications or other aspects of his performance in relation to interviews in which they did not personally participate. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at \u00b6 48 [Alberga Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at \u00b6 121 [Daley Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 7, at \u00b6\u00b6 67-69 [Martin Decl.].) Indeed, individuals who conducted interviews for Forester 2 positions outside of Region 5 (where Plaintiff's Ray Brook\n   job is located) stated in declarations that they did not recall having any communication with Martin, Alberga, or Daley about Plaintiff; they also stated that Plaintiff was not chosen because the successful candidates had more extensive and/or relevant experience. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 9, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-8 [Schongar Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 11, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-8 [Smith Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 12, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-8 [Sinclair Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 13, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-8 [Messenger Decl.].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Sherri Montross, Assistant Director of Personnel for the DEC, stated in her declaration that \"[n]o one outside an employee's chain of command and Human Resources staff has access to their performance evaluations for any purpose\" and that \"this information was not available to interviewers\" considering Plaintiff for Forester 2 promotions in other DEC regions. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 6, at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19 [Montross Decl.].) Given this evidence, Plaintiff's conclusory assertions that Martin, Alberga, and Daley sabotaged his promotion efforts do not create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants' reasons for failing to promote him were merely a pretext for retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , 475 U.S. at 585-86,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Additionally, to the extent that Plaintiff argues that Daley reduced his outdoor work assignments in general as an act of retaliation for seeking compliance with his granted accommodations, evidence from multiple sources establishes that Plaintiff was required to spend more time working on certain UMPs due to changing priorities in the mission of DEC that were unrelated to Plaintiff, namely an increase in the priority to get those specific UMPs completed based on policy considerations made by the DEC. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 3, at \u00b6 41 [Alberga Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at \u00b6 59, 81 [Daley Decl.]; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 39, 44; Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 7, at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35 [Martin Decl.].) Additionally, Daley stated that, as Plaintiff's supervisor, he had found that Plaintiff engaged in unsafe work practices and poor judgment and had a limited understanding of basic forestry principles; these observations contributed to Daley's decision to decrease Plaintiff's ability to work with motorized equipment or to leave the office to do fieldwork without first seeking permission. (Dkt. No. 24, Attach. 5, at 4 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 39, 41, 45-47, 50, 54 [Daley Decl.].) Plaintiff's arguments that Defendants' reasons for decreasing his outdoor work were pretexts for retaliation because other Forester 1s completed outdoor work in the winter and because he was assigned more UMPs with more stringent deadlines than other Forester 1s are not persuasive because they do not refute Defendants' legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons related to Plaintiff's failure to follow instructions (which had resulted in an injury when Plaintiff was out in deep snow in December 2013) and the changing priorities of the DEC related to which UMPs needed\n   to be given priority; because the reasons proffered by Defendants were related to Plaintiff's actions and the specific UMPs Plaintiff was assigned (in some cases, he had been assigned these UMPs a significant amount of time before further reductions in outdoor work occurred in 2013), whether other Forester 1s were able to do fieldwork in the winter and whether they had less strict deadlines on UMPs does not create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants' proffered reasons were merely a pretext for retaliation. (Dkt. No. 30, at 19-22, 30-31 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   For all of the above reasons, Plaintiff cannot establish a genuine dispute of material fact about whether Defendants' legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for reducing Plaintiff's outdoor work and failing to promote him to Forester 2 were merely pretexts for retaliation.

Given the evidence from Daley especially that Plaintiff's drafts were significantly deficient once that assistance had been taken away, Plaintiff has not adduced evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was capable of performing the essential writing functions of a Forester 1 with reasonable accommodations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    Because an ability to perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation is also an element for adverse-action disability discrimination claims, the same rationale as set forth above applies to the portion of Plaintiff's discrimination claim based on discrimination in the form of \"adverse action against him in regard to the terms, conditions, or privileges of his employment.\" (Dkt.

Therefore, even if Plaintiff is correct that the landowner was there when he was using the chainsaw and that he informed Daley of his intended activity before going out, such statements do not address Daley's specific concern with Plaintiff's failure to inform DEC dispatch as required by safety protocol.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    Even if Daley did tell Plaintiff that chainsaw use was unsafe \"especially because [he is] diabetic,\" this statement does not establish or even suggest retaliatory motive, and Plaintiff's claims of adverse-action disability discrimination have been dismissed on other grounds as discussed above in Part III.C of this Decision and Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    Plaintiff argues that Daley had instructed him not to scout new trail locations in his initial email, and subsequently changed it to an instruction not to scout proposed facility locations in an email after Plaintiff had gone out to inventory an existing logging road and tent site.

No. 30, Attach. 1, at 503.) Plaintiff's statements indicate that, although Daley specifically addressed only scouting trail locations in his response email to Plaintiff, there had been a conversation between Daley and Plaintiff in which Daley instructed Plaintiff not to conduct field visits or inventory the lands or facilities in the deep snow, and Plaintiff was aware of those instructions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 501-03.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"38\">\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    Plaintiff states that, \"[a]s a matter of course, managers speak with at least one current or former manager of a job applicant for a professional position, especially when a manager holds a parallel position as the applicant's supervisor in the same agency.\" (Dkt. No. 30, at 32 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) However, Plaintiff fails to cite any authority or evidence to support this statement. Without evidence to establish that any of the interviewers outside of Region 5 spoke with or otherwise received information about Plaintiff from Martin, Alberga, or Daley, Plaintiff argument that those interviewers were influenced by negative comments from Plaintiff's supervisors must fail. A notation in the Smith Declaration that the successful candidate for one position had been highly recommended by his supervisors does not establish that Smith spoke to Plaintiff's supervisors, particularly because Smith also stated he did not recall having any communication with Plaintiff's supervisors.
