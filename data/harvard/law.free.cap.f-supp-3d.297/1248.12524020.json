ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    As noted previously, this is a garnishment action in which AMICO claims that, under the Policy, Scottsdale must indemnify Phifer, the Phifer Trust, and Phoenix in connection with the default judgment entered against them in the state court case. This is the only basis for AMICO's claim that Scottsdale is indebted to Phifer, the Phifer Trust, and Phoenix, and thus, subject to garnishment. Scottsdale argues that either the Policy's \"Mobile Equipment\" exclusion, or its \"Damage to Property\" exclusion, or both, exclude coverage in this case, and, therefore, it is not indebted to Phifer, the Phifer Trust, and Phoenix. Accordingly, as with a typical declaratory judgment action, the Court must determine whether there is coverage. If there is not, there is nothing to garnish. The Court will examine each of the cited exclusions in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      The Mobile Equipment Exclusion\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Alabama Supreme Court has stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    Policy exclusions are to be narrowly interpreted, and, when an ambiguity exists in the language of an exclusion, \" ' \"the exclusion will be construed so as to limit the exclusion to the narrowest application reasonable under the wording.\" ' \"\n    <em>\n     Porterfield v.

However, the terms \"property,\" and \"personal property\" are not defined in the Policy.

The declaration, schedule of locations, and supplemental declarations pages of the Policy all clearly state that the insured is a \"Blasting Operation.\" (Doc. 10-4 at 3, 5, 7). Blasting is a form of \"demolition.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2037-15-2\">\n      Ala.

That being said, the Court does not agree that the exclusion at issue would render the coverage illusory, as AMIC suggests. (Doc. 21 at 5-7). \"When limitations or exclusions completely contradict the insuring provisions, insurance coverage becomes illusory. Alabama law does not \" 'countenance such illusory \"coverage.\"\n     <em>\n      Shrader v. Employers Mut. Cas.

In the instant case, even if the exclusion applies as Scottsdale suggests, there would still be coverage for demolition, just not demolition involving mobile equipment. Accordingly, the coverage would be just \"limited\" not \"completely contradicted\" by the exclusion.\n     <em>\n      See,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Nautilus Ins. Co. v.
