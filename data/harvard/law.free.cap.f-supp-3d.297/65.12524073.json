Cir. 1994).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      The Department has provided such an affidavit here. Katherine Myrick, the Chief of the FOIA Management Section at the DEA's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia submitted a sworn affidavit on behalf of the Department.\n      <em>\n       See generally\n      </em>\n      Myrick Decl. According to Myrick, she performed a search of the DEA's Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (\"NADDIS\"), the data index system for the\n     DEA's Investigative Reporting and Filing System (\"IRFS\").\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 7, 15-16. The IRFS contains \"all administrative, general, and criminal investigative files compiled by DEA.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 6. Myrick attests that she performed multiple queries on NADDIS, including variations of Vizcarra Calderon's name and identifying numbers such as her date of birth.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. The Myrick Declaration is sufficiently detailed to carry the Department's burden of demonstrating it conducted a search reasonably calculated to turn up any responsive records.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Vizcarra Calderon raises two main arguments in response, but neither is persuasive. First, she argues the search was inadequate because the Department did not search the DEA's Tijuana and Guadalajara, Mexico field offices despite a reasonable inference that any responsive records might be found there. Citing the decision in\n      <em>\n       McLaughlin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5542930\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/530/210/#p213\">\n       530 F.Supp.2d 210\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 213 (D.D.C 2008), she argues that this failure to search every location where records might be reasonably found makes the search deficient. But unlike in\n      <em>\n       McLaughlin\n      </em>\n      , where the government did not \"refute[ ] [plaintiffs'] suggestion that it failed to search an obvious location,\"\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5542930\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/530/210/#p213\">\n       530 F.Supp.2d at 213\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , here the Department has provided assurances that it did in fact search the Tijuana and Guadalajara field offices. According to a supplemental declaration filed by Myrick, \"[a] search of IRFS using NADDIS is a worldwide search for DEA records, including records maintained at field offices.\" Myrick First Supplemental Decl. \u00b6 8. In other words, Myrick has attested that any information that existed at the Tijuana and Guadalajara field offices would have been located via her search of NADDIS. Vizcarra Calderon provides no basis upon which to conclude that the Supplemental Myrick Declaration does not accurately describe the scope of NADDIS. Thus, the Department has justified that it searched in all the logical places where responsive records would have been found.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      Second, Vizcarra Calderon suggests that the search was inadequate because it yielded no records even though she was informed by a government official that a \"case\" related to drug trafficking allegations against her exists. But \"it is long settled that the failure of an agency to turn up one specific document in its search does not alone render a search inadequate.\"\n      <em>\n       Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n       315 F.3d 311\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Nor is it even certain that any existing \"case\" against Vizcarra Calderon is one involving the DEA. As the Department aptly points out, many agencies-including state agencies-have authority to investigate drug trafficking. It is certainly possible that any investigation into alleged drug trafficking involves a different law enforcement agency. At this juncture, Vizcarra Calderon does little more than speculate that the DEA had an open investigation into her alleged involvement in drug trafficking. \"Mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency conducted a reasonable search for them.\"\n      <em>\n       SafeCard Services\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n       926 F.2d at 1201\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      In light of the Myrick Declarations, the Court concludes that the Department has carried its burden to demonstrate it conducted an adequate search. The Court will therefore grant the Department's Motion for Summary Judgment. A separate Order shall accompany this memorandum opinion.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
