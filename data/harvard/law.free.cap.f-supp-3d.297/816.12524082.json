To that end, in December 2016 they served Boeing, a corporation headquartered in Chicago, with a citation to discover assets pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69 and 735 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/2-1402, as well as discovery requests under Rule 45 seeking to identify Iranian assets \"which are or may be held by Boeing.\" (R. 233, Pls.' Mem. at 2.) Specifically, Plaintiffs seek information about a contract-which has been widely reported in the media-between Boeing and the Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran (\"Iran Air\"), under which Boeing is to provide Iran Air with 80 commercial airplanes worth approximately $16 billion over a period of years. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 234-7, News Article.) This deal was made possible by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\"), commonly referred to as the \"Iran Nuclear Deal,\" which was brokered in July 2015 among the E3/EU+3 nations\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Iran. (R. 245-3, Iran Nuclear Deal at 4.) The goal of the Iran Nuclear Deal was to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is \"exclusively peaceful.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As part of the deal, the United States (through former President Barack Obama) agreed to lift various commercial sanctions against Iran and to \"allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services to Iran[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Consistent with this\n   obligation, in September 2016 the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\") licensed Boeing's future sale of commercial airplanes to Iran Air. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 7; R. 247-1, Larson Decl. \u00b6 12.) Boeing thereafter entered into an agreement with Iran Air, dated December 11, 2016, to sell 80 commercial airplanes to Iran Air. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 8; R. 247-1, Larson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) This deal was the first major commercial transaction between American and Iranian companies in four decades. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 8; R. 247-2, Bentrott Decl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The present motions stem from Plaintiffs' efforts to learn the details of the airplane deal. Plaintiffs seek \"information about assets of the judgment debtors against which they can enforce their judgments, either in the United States or elsewhere.\" (R. 233, Pls.' Mem. at 4-5.) Their Rule 45 document subpoena contains eight separate document requests. They ask for a copy of the contract itself, as well as all \"ancillary documents ... that would identify [ ] the parties and their obligations as well as documents concerning the financial institutions involved in the transaction, the financing arrangements, [and the manner of] payment and delivery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 234-3, Doc. Subpoena.) Plaintiffs further request \"all correspondence, notices, written inquiries, letters, or writings of any nature ... between Boeing, Iran Air and/or the Islamic Republic of Iran, in respect to the Contract and the parties' respective obligations and payments under the Contract.\" (R. 243-4, Doc. Subpoena \u00b6 6.) They also seek production of \"[a]ny and all correspondence\" between Boeing and OFAC, or any other department or agency of the U.S. government, \"relating to assets or property of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including without limitation the Contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiffs also served Boeing with a Rule 45 deposition subpoena, requiring Boeing to designate a corporate representative pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) to testify on a variety of matters, including the details of the contract and the details of any communications between Boeing and Iran Air, or Boeing and the U.S. government, broadly relating to the contract or any asset of Iran. (R. 234-4, Dep. Subpoena \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, Boeing has not produced any documents or designated a corporate representative pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Boeing moves to quash the subpoenas and dismiss the citation in its entirety. (R. 245, Boeing's Mot.) In Boeing's view, ordering the requested relief would require the Court to resolve \"nonjusticiable political questions\" and violate principles of international comity; Boeing believes that granting these discovery requests would cause \"significant harm to the goals of the United States and its European allies\" and \"risk destabilizing the purpose of the JCPOA to provide for regional and international peace and security.\" (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 12-13 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Boeing also argues that Plaintiffs' discovery requests \"seek irrelevant information and are disproportionate to the needs of the case,\" because the contract, as currently drafted, will not result in any Iranian assets being subject to attachment in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs argue in reply that their discovery requests do not raise any non-justiciable political questions or trigger international comity concerns. (R. 252, Pls.' Reply at 2-6.) In their view, Boeing is essentially asking this Court \"to afford Iran and Iran Air, and by extension their business partner Boeing, protections and immunities that are not mentioned in either [the Iran Nuclear Deal] or the [FSIA].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Plaintiffs believe that the Iran Nuclear Deal \"did nothing to prohibit the victims of terror from continuing to exercise their rights under the FSIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) In response to Boeing's relevancy and proportionately argument, Plaintiffs argue that Boeing has skewed the inquiry by suggesting that Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are able to execute on specific assets before they are permitted any discovery related to those assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After reviewing the parties' submissions, the Court found it prudent to obtain a statement from the U.S. government as to whether, in its view, \"permitting the discovery sought by Plaintiffs will, as Boeing argues, interfere with U.S. foreign policy toward Iran by obstructing a key component of the international nuclear deal.\" (R. 258, Min. Entry (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).) The government, through the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Executive Branch, has now filed a statement of interest, and represents that \"the United States does not take a position on whether the Court should order the requested discovery.\" (R. 265, Gov't's Statement at 3.) According to the statement, the United States is \"implementing its JCPOA commitments,\" and \"those commitments do not require the Executive Branch to take any specific action with respect to efforts by judgment creditors of Iran to pursue post-judgment discovery or other enforcement proceedings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The government urges only that if discovery is ordered, the Court \"supervise such discovery carefully, taking into account the sensitive nature of discovery into the property of foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[F]oreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity on the part of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Rubin v.

There is also no doubt that the United States has an interest in providing a post-judgment remedy for victims of terrorism, like Plaintiffs, holding a valid judgment obtained under the FSIA. The request for information is specific, and any concerns about overbreadth can be addressed by the Court in tailoring the order. There is nothing to suggest that Plaintiffs have some other remedy available outside the United States to obtain\n   this information, which seems unlikely given that Boeing is an American corporation and the other party to the contract, Iran Air, is an instrumentality of a country with no formal diplomatic ties to the United States. The Court also considers that the government has filed a statement of interest in this case and, although it urges caution, it has not identified any international comity concerns that would warrant abstention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 265, Gov't's Statement at 5-6.) Under these circumstances, the Court declines to abstain from deciding Plaintiffs' discovery motions on grounds of international comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Relevance and Proportionality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Boeing next argues that the discovery requests should be quashed in their entirety because they are \"irrelevant to [Plaintiffs'] efforts to satisfy their judgment and disproportionate to the needs of the case.\" (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 16.) Without revealing too much about the contract, Boeing believes the discovery requests are improper-or at least premature-because at present it is unclear if the contract will result in any Iranian assets being located in the United States (or some other jurisdiction) where they would be subject to attachment by Plaintiffs. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 16-17.) In support, Boeing provides extensive documentation describing the legal difficulties posed by attaching the assets of Iran, particularly an airplane as it travels in international airspace. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 247-3, Affaki Decl.; R. 247-5, Hess Decl.; R. 247-7, Layton Decl.; R. 247-9, Stephan Decl.) At bottom, Boeing's argument appears to be that, because it will be difficult or impossible for Plaintiffs to actually collect any money as a result of these discovery requests, the Court should simply deny them as futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Boeing misunderstands the nature of this proceeding. It is true that there are limitations on attaching the property of a foreign state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616888\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/816/#p821\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 822-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20987348\">\n    2018 WL 987348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Bank Markazi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595688\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1310/#p1317\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Plaintiffs are not actually\n   <em>\n    attaching\n   </em>\n   any assets at present; they are only seeking to discover information about potential assets of Iran that\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   attachable. In\n   <em>\n    NML Capital\n   </em>\n   , the defendant, Argentina, raised an argument similar to Boeing's that \"if a judgment creditor could not ultimately execute a judgment against certain property, then it has no business pursuing discovery of information pertaining to that property.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581252\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2250/#p2257\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court expressly rejected this argument, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [T]he reason for these subpoenas is that NML\n   <em>\n    does not yet know\n   </em>\n   what property Argentina has and where it is, let alone whether it is executable under the relevant jurisdiction's law. If, bizarrely, NML's subpoenas had sought only information that could not lead to executable assets in the United States or abroad, then Argentina likely would be correct to say that the subpoenas were unenforceable-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   because information about nonexecutable assets enjoys a penumbral discovery immunity under the Act, but because information that could not possibly lead to executable assets is simply not relevant to execution in the first place[.] But of course that is not what the subpoenas seek. They ask for information about Argentina's worldwide assets generally, so that NML can identify where Argentina may be holding property that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   subject to execution. To be sure, that request is bound to turn up information about property that Argentina regards as immune. But NML may think the same property\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   immune. In which case, Argentina's self-serving legal assertion will not automatically prevail; the District Court will have to settle the matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581252\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2250/#p2257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581252\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2250/#p2257\">\n    at 2257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The same reasoning applies here.

But Plaintiffs' discovery requests cannot be denied outright simply because Plaintiffs may have difficulty collecting on their judgment at a later stage. In short, the Court is unpersuaded by Boeing's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Citation Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Boeing also raises a number of objections that are specific to the citation to discover assets. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 21-25.) As a preliminary matter, Boeing argues that a citation can only be used to obtain information about assets and income of \"the debtor,\" and neither Boeing nor Iran Air is the \"debtor\" in this case. (R. 247-1, Boeing's Mem. at 21.) The Court is unpersuaded by this argument. Boeing's own submission suggests that Iran Air has a very direct link to the government of Iran. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 247-3, Affaki Decl. \u00b6 10.) Thus, its property may be subject to attachment as an \"instrumentality\" of Iran.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (providing that \"any property in the United States of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity in the United States shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution\" if certain circumstances are met);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (defining \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign state as a separate legal entity, \"corporate or otherwise, ... which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comet Enter.

Again, the Court is not deciding whether Plaintiffs can execute on any particular asset at this stage, but only that Plaintiffs are entitled to conduct discovery reasonably calculated to locating assets that may be subject to attachment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NML Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581252\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2250/#p2257\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They have met that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Boeing also argues that the Illinois citation statute cannot be used to restrain property outside of Illinois. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 21.) Boeing is correct that there are specific rules regarding what property is subject to attachment under the Illinois statute. A citation generally serves to restrain tangible property of the debtor located within Illinois and intangible property located anywhere, as long as the Illinois court has personal jurisdiction over the owner of the debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park v.

Ill. Mar. 29, 2013)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (observing that under Illinois law, intangible property is generally considered to be \"located\" in the domicile of its owner). There is an added wrinkle here because under the FSIA, this Court can only restrain assets of a foreign sovereign that are \"within [its] territorial jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5927380\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/470/#p475\">\n    830 F.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, as a practical matter, the citation could not restrain-for example-real property belonging to Iran that is located in Iran.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Autotech Techs. LP v. Integral Research &amp; Dev.

If and when Plaintiffs do discover such assets, they will have to litigate whether such assets are subject to attachment. The restraining provision of the citation is merely intended to preserve the status quo until the debtor's assets can be discovered.\n   <em>\n    Shales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788054\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/1102/#p1111\">\n    847 F.Supp.2d at 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unless and until the Court orders turnover of a particular piece of property, the restraint imposed by the Illinois statute remains \"subject to attack and modification.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Marino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6436762\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/201/234/#p248\">\n    201 B.R. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1996). But without knowing what property exists and where it is located, this Court cannot determine whether such property is subject to attachment, or whether it is exempt under the FSIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubin v.

Instead, Plaintiffs should be permitted to examine the available documents for themselves, and to inquire of an appropriate Boeing employee under oath, to learn the details of the airplane deal and the potential whereabouts of any Iranian assets linked to the deal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581252\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2250/#p2257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If Plaintiffs are able to locate any such assets, they will still have to convince this Court-or some other court of competent jurisdiction-that the asset is attachable under the FSIA. But this is not a reason to dismiss the citation outright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Boeing further argues that using a state statute to \"restrain[ ]the sale of aircraft\" to Iran violates \"basic principles of federalism\" and the Dormant Commerce Clause. (R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 22-24.) This argument appears to be based on Boeing's interpretation of the JCPOA as requiring the U.S. government to actively prevent terror victims holding judgments against Iran from hindering the airplane deal in any manner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 253, Boeing's Reply at 18.) Notably, the Executive Branch does not share this reading of the JCPOA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 265, Gov't's Statement at 5 (\"[T]he JCPOA does not require the United States to take any specific action with respect to efforts by judgment creditors of Iran to pursue post-judgment discovery or other enforcement proceedings[.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ]\"). But regardless, this Court is not restraining the sale of an aircraft or ordering the turnover of any asset in this order. The Court is only ordering discovery. If and when the case proceeds to the execution stage, Boeing is free to renew its arguments about the propriety of restraining any particular asset identified by Plaintiffs. However, to the extent Boeing is arguing that a state statute must yield whenever a foreign sovereign is involved, the Seventh Circuit recently held to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baylay v. Etihad Airways P.J.S.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275368\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1032/#p1038\">\n    881 F.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038 (7th Cir. 2018) (\"[T]he [FSIA] preempts any other state or federal law that accords immunity from suit. But it is not intended-and has not been construed-to affect the governing substantive law. Instead, the Act imposes liability on the foreign state in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" (citations, internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted) ). For these reasons, Boeing's arguments do not warrant dismissal of the citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Scope of Discovery Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With all that said, the Court does agree with Boeing that Plaintiffs' discovery requests are very broad. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 234-6, Boeing's Disc. Objs.) In their document subpoena, for instance, Plaintiffs broadly seek turnover of any and all communications between Boeing and Iran Air \"in respect to the Contract.\" (R. 234-3, Doc. Subpoena \u00b6 6.) They also seek any and all \"correspondence, notices, written inquires, letters of direction, reports to monitor compliance with reporting requirements, legal processes or writings of any nature and kind whatsoever\" between Boeing and OFAC or other agencies of the federal government broadly relating to the contract or other Iranian assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiffs also request that they be allowed to ask questions of a Rule 30(b)(6) witness designated by Boeing on these same broadly defined subjects. (R. 234-4, Dep. Subpoena \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These requests must be viewed in context: Plaintiffs are seeking information about a multi-million dollar agreement between two sophisticated companies. Their requests, as drafted, are likely to encompass a vast array of information beyond what is needed for them to trace potential assets of Iran.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NML Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581252\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2250/#p2257\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(R. 234-3, Doc. Subpoena \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.) This includes the contract itself and other documents that will reveal the existence of any escrow accounts, the details of payment and delivery, and other matters that could potentially lead Plaintiffs to Iranian assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court makes one minor alteration to Paragraph 1, in which\n   Plaintiffs request \"[a] copy of the final signed contract\n   <em>\n    and all ancillary or supporting documents.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1 (emphasis added).) The Court finds the highlighted language unduly vague. Instead, Boeing will be ordered to produce the final signed contract and\n   <em>\n    all exhibits or appendices thereto, if any.\n   </em>\n   As to Paragraph 7, the Court finds the request as drafted extremely broad in subject matter and temporal scope and will limit it as follows: Boeing is ordered to produce any and all written communications between Boeing and OFAC relating to the airplane contract with Iran Air. The Court declines to order production of the documents listed in Paragraph 8 as unduly broad, disproportionate to the needs of this case, and duplicative of other requests that are more narrowly tailored to tracing Iran's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court further orders Boeing to designate a Rule 30(b)(6) witness to address the matters designated in Paragraphs 1-5 of Schedule A to Plaintiffs' deposition subpoena, which correspond to the documents the Court has ordered Boeing to disclose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 234-4, Dep. Subpoena \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.) The Court finds Paragraph 6 overly broad, disproportionate to the needs of the case, and duplicative of other requests that are more narrowly tailored to tracing potential assets of Iran. As to Paragraph 7, consistent with the modification made above, Plaintiffs shall only be permitted to inquire into the details of communications between Boeing and OFAC relating to the airplane contract with Iran Air. Any other relief requested in Plaintiffs' motion to compel is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion to compel (R. 232) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as stated herein. The Boeing Company's cross-motion to quash and to dismiss the citation to discover assets (R. 245) is DENIED. Boeing shall disclose all responsive documents as outlined in this order on or before April 2, 2018, and shall submit to a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition on or before May 2, 2018. The citation to discover assets shall remain in effect until further order of the Court. The parties shall appear for a status hearing on May 10, 2018, at 9:45 a.m. They are directed to reconsider their respective positions in light of this order and to exhaust all efforts to reach an agreed resolution of any remaining discovery disputes.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    With the Court's permission, a number of documents related to the present dispute have been filed under seal. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 246, Order; R. 251, Min. Entry.) Although Boeing submitted a number of supporting declarations under seal, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    R. 247), it referenced and quoted from those sealed declarations in its publicly filed memorandum. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , R. 245-1, Boeing's Mem. at 7 (citing R. 247-1, Larson Decl.);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780104\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/153/#p177\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 8 (citing R. 247-2, Bentrott Decl.).) Where that occurred, the Court has referenced the information contained in the declarations. Additionally, Plaintiffs filed their entire reply brief under seal without submitting a public, redacted version as required by the Local Rules.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    N.D. Ill. L.R. 26.2. Much of the material contained in Plaintiffs' reply brief is not sensitive or has already been disclosed in other publicly filed documents.

Plaintiffs here are not challenging the structure of the JCPOA, nor is this Court being called to reprimand a foreign nation or command another nation to dismantle an international agreement.

The Court is unpersuaded by this argument. If Plaintiffs are entitled to the discovery they seek, the subjective motivations of their counsel are irrelevant. Additionally, by signing the discovery requests, Plaintiffs' lead counsel implicitly certified that the requests were not made \"for any improper purpose,\" such as to \"harass\" or \"cause unnecessary delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g). The Court has no reason to doubt that counsel is complying with his obligations as a member of the bar. The Court must consider additionally that although Boeing purports to be advocating in support of such goals as international comity and respect among coordinate branches of government, it also has a strong financial motivation for ensuring that the airplane deal is consummated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Under the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law, \"great weight\" is to be given to the Executive Branch's interpretation of an international agreement.
