(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 227-C (listing \"Assessment Results\" as \"No risk for sexually aggressive behavior\" (Doc. 227-C at 1, 4); \"Low risk of sexual victimization\" (Doc. 227-C at 2, 3, 5); \"Low risk sexually aggressive behavior\" (Doc. 227-C at 6) ).) There are no notes on these screening results that discuss whether Plaintiff meets the criteria for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's diagnoses and requests for treatment, her mental health treatment records are largely unremarkable. She consistently reports some anxiety and depression, but her providers observe that she is generally stable and does not have thoughts of harming herself or others. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 226-1 at 146, 148, 151, 153, 175, 179, 186, 191, 194.) The record is sprinkled with several notable exceptions to this trend. The first was in July 2013, when Plaintiff shared with E. Royer, LMSW, that she \"has had thoughts of self-harm but ... is able to stay busy when [these] thoughts come.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-16 at 8.) The second was reported at a February 2014 Clinical Assessment, when Plaintiff told Ms. Ibrahim that she had \"thoughts of self-mutilation to genital area; however, he has never attempted or currently has any desire to do [sic] as he 'does not like pain.' \" (Doc. 226-1 at 142.) Next, on December 8, 2014, Ms. Ibrahim reported that she met with Plaintiff based on a \"report of inmate possibly engaging in self infliction/castration attempt. Inmate denied and states incentive not to remove penis for future surgical goals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160.) Finally, in November 2015, Plaintiff was placed in temporary restrictive housing on \"suicide watch\" because she had verbalized thoughts of self-harm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    at 170-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiff has stated that she has \"thoughts of harming [herself] by removing [her] testicles nearly every day\" and \"thoughts of committing suicide nearly every day[,]\" but she does not regularly share these thoughts with health care staff because she does not want to be placed in solitary confinement. (Doc. 234 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit in 2015 to challenge \"Defendants' systemic denial of treatment for her gender dysphoria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Oakleaf v.

Dr. Ettner has \"determined that [Plaintiff] is losing her will to live due to the denial of health care for her severe gender dysphoria [,]\" and \"[t]he continued withholding of treatment consistent with scientific and medical protocols will almost inevitably cause the worsening of symptoms and possible self-harm and death ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. 211 \u00b6\u00b6 65-67, 72).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Dr. Ettner's opinion, \"[a]n appropriate treatment plan ... consistent with the WPATH SOC consists of ongoing treatment by a clinician qualified to treat gender dysphoria, hormone therapy, access to items and clothing available to female inmates, all of which are medically necessary and none of which are contraindicated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (citing Doc. 211 \u00b6\u00b6 69-71).) Dr. Ettner warns that \"[c]ounseling alone or the provision of psychotropic medications to a severely gender dysphoric patient like [Plaintiff] is not a substitute for actual treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing Doc. 211 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25).) Dr. Ettner believes that \"Defendants' continued denial of treatment will lead to an irremediable course of psychological decompensation and potential death for\" Plaintiff.

The most striking examples include Chris Pascale's declaration that Plaintiff arrived to OCPF \"as a male and during his stay at this facility, will remain as such\" (Doc. 212-1); an unidentified provider's statement that \"The state of NM will not authorize [a] referral\" for a transgender specialist (Doc. 10-3 at 3); and Dr. Lose's explanation that \"the policy and procedure for hormone replacement within NMCD [is that the inmate] (had to have come into prison with that status)\" (Doc. 226-1 at 193).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On the other hand, Defendants have come forward with evidence that a Behavioral Health Treatment Team met to assess Plaintiff for gender dysphoria in December 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161.) The team reviewed the DSM-V criteria for gender dysphoria, \"along with [Plaintiff's] evaluations,\n   history, and other relevant documentation in [the] psychological file to determine appropriate level of care[,]\" and ultimately determined that Plaintiff did not meet the criteria for a gender dysphoria diagnosis at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff argues that \"Defendants cannot discharge their constitutional obligations by providing some treatment for gender dysphoria and calling it a day.\" (Doc. 209 at 14.) However, Defendants have not diagnosed Plaintiff with gender dysphoria. The only record available that shows the Defendants exercised individualized judgment on this issue reflects that they did not find Plaintiff to have met the criteria for a gender dysphoria diagnosis. Moreover, Defendants have continued to provide counseling, medication management, and clinical support to meet Plaintiff's psychological needs since that date. Accordingly, under Tenth Circuit precedent, Defendants have met their burden to make \"an informed judgment as to the appropriate form of treatment and did not deliberately ignore plaintiff's medical needs.\"\n   <em>\n    Supre v.

(Doc. 230 at 8.) As counsel for Defendants reported at the hearing, however, Plaintiff refused to share Dr. Ettner's reports or diagnosis during discovery or in response to a motion to compel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 117 (motion to compel); 173 (order denying motion to compel).) Defendants received a draft report during settlement negotiations, but it wasn't until Plaintiff filed this Motion that Defendants had access to Dr. Ettner's actual report. As Defendants were not obligated to take Plaintiff at her word that she received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a qualified provider, they were under no obligation to treat her for the condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even if Defendants believed that Dr. Ettner diagnosed Plaintiff with gender dysphoria, Defendants did not have access to Dr. Ettner's rationale and were not required to blindly accept Dr. Ettner's opinion over the opinion of their own medical providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's thoughts of self-harm, she admitted that she has not regularly shared these thoughts with her providers, because she does not want to be placed in solitary confinement. (Doc. 234 \u00b6 15.) Defendants argue there can be no deliberate indifference to a known medical need where Plaintiff refuses to share her thoughts of self-harm. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because Plaintiff failed to share Dr. Ettner's report results with Defendants earlier, and because Plaintiff has not made her\n   symptoms clear to her providers, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendants have been deliberately indifferent to her medical needs. Consequently, Plaintiff cannot show at this time that she is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim, and this factor weighs in Defendants' favor. \"This is especially true in light of the heightened burden on [Plaintiff] to demonstrate [her] entitlement to a preliminary injunction that upends the status quo.\"\n   <em>\n    O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9150911\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/973/#p975\">\n    389 F.3d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because Plaintiff had not given Defendants Dr. Ettner's reports until recently, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that, without an injunction, Defendants will violate her constitutional rights. However, the Court agrees that the self-harm Plaintiff contemplates is irreparable. This factor tips in Plaintiff's favor because of the serious risk of self-injury she has reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Balance of Harms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff must demonstrate that \"the threatened injury ... outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party ....\"\n   <em>\n    Schrier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241096\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1253/#p1258\">\n    427 F.3d at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). Plaintiff argues that the risk of harm (suicide or self-castration) to her is more serious than any risk of harm to Defendants (potentially the expenditure of money to treat Plaintiff, or the time and energy to institute new policy re: transgender prisoners). (Doc. 209 at 20.) Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Edmisten v.

The\n   <em>\n    Edmisten\n   </em>\n   Court found that imposing a financial burden \"would not be misplaced or undue\n   <em>\n    if in fact one or more of the defendants is legally obligated to provide the treatment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Edmisten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20Fed.%20Appx.%20728\">\n    287 Fed.Appx. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Defendants-until the point in time when she shared Dr. Ettner's report-have been \"legally obligated to provide [any] treatment\" for gender dysphoria, because her medical providers ruled out that diagnosis in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20Fed.%20Appx.%20728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, Defendants have been consistently treating Plaintiff for the diagnoses their medical and mental health providers have assessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The prison's financial burden is not the only interest at stake.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (citing Doc. 210 \u00b6 4).) The Court notes that the record evidence tends to refute Plaintiff's assertions. Not only are there no treatment notes before 2012 to support the assertion that Plaintiff sought treatment for gender dysphoria, but also her booking photo upon her arrest shows that she was wearing a full beard, in contravention of her claim that she was presenting herself publicly as a woman.
