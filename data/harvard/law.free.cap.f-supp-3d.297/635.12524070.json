McGlothin. The parties have fully briefed the Motions. After reviewing the submissions of the parties, the record in this matter, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed by McGlothin should be granted. The Court further finds that State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment as to coverage should be denied, but its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Extra-contractual and Punitive Damages should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 15, 2016, McGlothin's vehicle was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Andrew W. Mason, while he was in the course and scope of his employment with the Biloxi Fire Department. McGlothin filed a lawsuit against Mason, the City of Biloxi, and the Biloxi Fire Department in the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi. Alternatively, in the event that Mason, the City and the Fire Department may be entitled to sovereign immunity under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, she sued State Farm, seeking uninsured motorist coverage. State Farm removed the case to this Court. This Court entered an [16] Order dismissing McGlothin's claims against Mason, the City, and the Fire Department, because McGlothin failed to demonstrate that she timely served these defendants with process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   McGlothin pursued her claims against Mason, Biloxi, and the Fire Department in the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi. The Circuit Court held that those defendants were entitled to summary judgment, because \"Mason was not acting with reckless disregard as required for a governmental entity or governmental employee to be held liable under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act ( Miss. Code Ann. [\u00a7] 11-46-1 ).\" (Def.'s Mot., Ex. J at 2, ECF No. 31-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the federal lawsuit, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment concerning whether McGlothin is entitled to\n   uninsured motorist coverage. In the alternative, State Farm argues that it is entitled to summary judgment as to McGlothin's claims for punitive and extra-contractual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A motion for summary judgment may be filed by any party asserting that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law on any claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The movant bears the initial burden of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery on file, together with any affidavits, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Once the movant carries its burden, the burden shifts to the non-movant to show that summary judgment should not be granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    at 324-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256-57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   State Farm argues that McGlothin's claim for uninsured motorist benefits is barred by the following statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   No automobile liability insurance policy or contract shall be issued or delivered after January 1, 1967, unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums which he shall be\n   <em>\n    legally entitled to recover\n   </em>\n   as damages for bodily injury or death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 83-11-101(1) (emphasis added). Pursuant to this statute, the policy State Farm issued to McGlothin contains the following provision: \"Under Uninsured Motorist Vehicle Coverage (Bodily Injury), we will pay compensatory damages for bodily injury an insured is\n   <em>\n    legally entitled to collect\n   </em>\n   from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.\" (Def.'s Mot., Ex. K, ECF No. 31-11) (emphasis added). State Farm argues that McGlothin is not entitled to uninsured motorist coverage, because she is not legally entitled to recover or collect any damages from Mason due to his immunity under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McGlothin counters that she is entitled to coverage, because the Mississippi Legislature amended the definition of \"uninsured motor vehicle\" in 2009 to include: \"[a] motor vehicle owned or operated by a person protected by immunity under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Title 11, Chapter 46, Mississippi Code of 1972, if the insured has exhausted all administrative remedies under that chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2083-11-103\">\n    Miss.

State Farm concedes that \"the legislature intended for an individual referenced in section (vi) to be considered an uninsured motorist.\" (Def.'s Reply at 2, ECF No. 41). State Farm also concedes that Mason was \"an uninsured motorist,\" but it argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2083-11-103\">\n    Miss.

The Mississippi Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the rules of statutory construction, repeal of statutes by implication is not favored. In order for a subsequent act to repeal a former one expressly, it must point out the statute repealed with sufficient certainty .... And where in a subsequent statute there is no express repeal of a former, the court will not hold the former to be repealed by implication, unless there is a plain and unavoidable repugnancy between them. If the subsequent statute does not repeal the former, each statute cited must be given effect. We have said that statutes on the same subject, although in apparent conflict, should if possible be construed in harmony with each other to give effect to each. This Court has stated that in construing statutes, all statutes in pari materia are taken in consideration, and a legislative intent deduced from a consideration as a whole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059634\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/27/1128/#p1133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059634\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/27/1128/#p1133\">\n    at 1133-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
