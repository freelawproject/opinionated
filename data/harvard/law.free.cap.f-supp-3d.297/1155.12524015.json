Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Defendants' Motion to Void Search Warrant For DNA Sample or For Return of DNA Sample Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 41(g), filed July 6, 2017 (Doc. 29)(\"Motion\"); and (ii) Defendant Sedillo's Opposed Motion to Join in Defendant Sabaquie's Motion to Void Search Warrant for DNA Sample or For Return of DNA Sample Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 41(g), filed July 31, 2017 (Doc. 35)(\"Motion to Join\"). The Court held a hearing on August 3, 2017. The primary issue is whether Plaintiff United States of America, pursuant to two search warrants, unlawfully seized DNA samples from Defendants Bruce Sedillo and Loren Sabaquie to test against DNA collected from clothing identified as theirs that appeared similar to clothing worn by masked robbers, when the clothing has yet to be tested for viable DNA samples. The Court grants the Motion to Join and concludes that the United States did not unlawfully seize the DNA, because probable cause supports the warrants. Specifically, probable cause exists, because facts tie the robbers' getaway vehicle to Sedillo and Sabaquie, and facts tie the robbers' descriptions and clothing to Sedillo's and Sabaquie's descriptions and clothing associated with them. Moreover, based on an FBI agent's sworn statement and existing precedent, it is sufficiently reasonable to infer that the clothing will yield relevant evidence to survive constitutional scrutiny. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court draws its facts from the Criminal Complaint, filed May 5, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\").

The Honorable Steven C. Yarbrough, United States Magistrate Judge, issued the Search Warrant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Search Warrant at 1, and issued almost identical search warrants for Sedillo and Gallardo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   No. 17-0541, Application for a Search Warrant (Gallardo) at 1, filed June 23, 2017 (Doc. 1); Application for a Search Warrant (Sedillo) at 1, filed June 23, 2017 (Government Exhibit No. 2). Sabaquie's counsel did not learn of the Search Warrant until Sabaquie called and informed him that \"an agent was at the Sandoval County Jail, seeking his DNA.\" Motion \u00b6 2, at 2. After speaking with Sandoval, Sabaquie's counsel learned that \"no evidence from any of the alleged crime scenes ha[d] been submitted for DNA testing yet, but she wanted to submit Mr. Sabaquie's sample at the same time\" as the DNA from the items collected to move the case quicker.

Sabaquie argues broadly that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America bars a DNA sample collection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 5, at 2. According to Sabaquie, the Fourth Amendment precludes buccal DNA swabs, unless \"there is probable cause to believe that the defendant's DNA will yield evidence of wrongdoing, not simply probable cause that a crime occurred.\" Motion \u00b6 5, at 2-3 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Biglow\n   </em>\n   , 562, F.3d 1272, 1278 (10th Cir. 2009) ). From that legal principle, Sabaquie argues that, \"[a]t this stage, the government cannot say with any degree of certainty, whether any DNA evidence will be developed from items that were taken pursuant to their investigation.\" Motion \u00b6 6, at 3. Sabaquie, thus, concludes that, because DNA has not yet been developed from the items collected in the car and the apartment, there is no DNA profile to which Sabaquie's DNA can be compared, and, accordingly, there is no connection \"between the alleged criminal behavior, and the [United States'] intended search.\" Motion \u00b6 6, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Sabaquie adds that, if the United States has already extracted Sabaquie's DNA, the Court should order the United States to return the sample pursuant to rule 41(g).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 8, 3-4. Sabaquie asserts that the Court should order the DNA's return, because, if it does not, it \"would encourage rather than deter the unlawful extraction of DNA,\" and \"it would leave Mr. Sabaquie with no adequate remedy in law.\" Motion \u00b6 8 at 3-4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Floyd v.

First, the United States asserts that there is a sufficient connection between the Sabaquie buccal swab it requests and the clothing it intends to test, because a person with knowledge, Sedillo's girlfriend, identified the clothing to be tested as Sabaquie's, and the clothing appears substantially similar to the robber's clothing as \"can be seen in the surveillance video of the robberies.\" Response at 4. It further argues that a DNA comparison is needed, \"because the nature of the crime involves suspects who concealed their identities.\" Response at 5. The United States adds that, because Sandoval provided \"her assessment that DNA will be discovered\" on the clothing, there is a sufficient factual connection between the robbery and Sabaquie to overcome any Fourth Amendment problems.

It also asserts that, \"[b]ased on the strong deference given to a magistrate's determination of probable cause, the Court should deny the defendant's motion.\" Response at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Second, the United States argues that the Fourth Amendment allows searches that serve a practical purpose, such as in this case, where the United States needs to identify masked robbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5-6. Specifically, the United States avers that it gave a \"detailed account[ ] of its investigation\" into \"robberies perpetrated\n   by individuals who concealed their identities,\" and that the Search Warrant, thus, serves a practical and \"common-sense\" purpose of identifying the robbers.

Reply \u00b6 3, at 2-3 (quoting Search Warrant at 6). According to Sabaquie, because the Search Warrant did not specify that Sabaquie's DNA would be compared with DNA from items retrieved from the apartment, the United States factual arguments vis-\u00e0-vis the apartment items are \"misleading.\" Reply \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, at 2-3.

Sabaquie explained that, in that case, the Supreme Court held that \" 'the interests in human dig[nity] and privacy, which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any such intrusions on the mere chance that [the] desired evidence might be obtained.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:17-20 (Fernandez)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Schmerber v.

Sabaquie expanded that the Supreme Court ruled that \" '[i]n the absence of a clear indication that in fact such evidence will be found, these fundamental human interests require law officers to [suffer the] risk that such evidence may disappear unless there is an immediate search.' \" Tr. at 2:20-24 (Fernandez)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Schmerber v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n    384 U.S. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). From that Supreme Court holding, Sabaquie contended that Sabaquie's and Sedillo's DNA should be returned, because: (i) there is no chance that Sedillo's or Sabaquie's DNA will disappear between now and the time that the United States develops the DNA samples from the items; and (ii) there is insufficient probable cause to collect DNA where the United States has not yet developed the DNA from the other items.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:2-22 (Fernandez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When the Court probed that Sabaquie and Sedillo were asking the Court to expand the Fourth Amendment \"further than any Federal Court has ever gone before,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:4-6 (Court), Sabaquie conceded that he is seeking to expand the Fourth Amendment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:25-11:1 (Fernandez), but also responded that the question presented rarely arises, because the United States typically motions to collect DNA under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135A,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   not pursuant to a search warrant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:7-16 (Fernandez). Sabaquie also argued that\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/\">\n    569 U.S. 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) is inapposite, because \"the rationale in [that case] was that [the DNA] was used for identification and classification,\" which is \"very different from what [the United States is] seeking to use it [for here.]\" Tr. at 6:18-21 (Fernandez). He added that the Supreme Court was not concerned in\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. King\n   </em>\n   with \"contamination and development of evidence at the same time as [a] suspect's DNA,\" which is at issue here. Tr. at 10:3-6 (Fernandez). The Court responded, however, that it was \"skeptical that when [DNA] ends up in law enforcement['s hands]\" that the Constitution of the United States of America bars law enforcement from using the DNA in more than one way-its experience had been that law enforcement can \"give [the DNA] to other people, use it to investigate this crime, that crime. It's not usually cabin[ed] the way\" that Sabaquie proposed. Tr. 8:5-12 (Court). Sabaquie countered that \"practical concerns\" dictate a distinction in this case, because, when developing a DNA profile \"at the time of book and classification,\" the DNA is presumably developed \"so that it is useful for classification and identification.\" Tr. at 8:22-9:4 (Fernandez). Sabaquie argued that, in contrast here, the\n   DNA is being developed \"side by side with evidence,\" which risks contamination. Tr. at 9:3 (Fernandez). He added that collecting the DNA sample differs from routine collections of fingerprints, because \"you cannot contaminate a fingerprint the same way you can contaminate DNA.\" Tr. at 9:16-18 (Fernandez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Drawing on state authority, Sabaquie added to his argument that developing DNA side-by-side risks contamination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:25-11:22 (Fernandez). He noted that several state cases construing the Constitution of the United States have determined that using the side-by-side development process increases \"the possibility of contamination.\" Tr. at 11:21-22 (Fernandez). Sabaquie argued that, in discussing contamination, his major concern is that \"the same lab technician or DNA examiner [will] touch both samples and inadvertently [ ] transfer DNA from a suspect's sample to the evidence.\" Tr. at 13:12-15 (Fernandez). Sabaquie added that, if technicians develop the DNA separately at different times, the danger that \"the same lab examiner touch[es] both samples is eliminated.\" Tr. at 14:1-2 (Fernandez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Turning to policy arguments, Sabaquie averred that there is a good deal of subjectivity that is introduced in analyzing DNA from evidence, because DNA from evidence is often \"mixtures,\" not \"pure samples.\" Tr. at 15:14-17 (Fernandez). He contended that \"the scientific community is in full agreement that anything beyond a two person mixture is virtually impossible to untangle,\" that \"[t]here is great evidence to show that most examiners can't even reliably distinguish a mixture where there is 3 or 4 [known contributors],\" and that \"the task of untangling is really impossible when you get complex enough.\" Tr. at 16:8-24 (Fernandez). Based on those considerations, Sabaquie argued that the way to test the samples \"with integrity is you first decide whether or not this is a sample that can first be analyzed.\" Tr. at 17:6-7 (Fernandez). He argued that with the items collected-a sweater on the bedroom floor and a cellular telephone-there is going to be a mixture of DNA, so the best way to ward against error is to test the DNA only after determining whether there was a collectable sample from the items.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:3-12 (Fernandez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Sedillo then took the podium and argued that his case \"is substantially identical\" to Sabaquie's, but that there are a couple points he wanted to add. Tr. at 25:25 (Tallon). First, he argued that, unlike Sabaquie, \"Mr. Sedillo did not acknowledge or concede probable cause.\" Tr. at 26:1-3 (Tallon). Second, he noted that the United States has brought to his attention nine items that it believes are associated with Sedillo: two bags, two pairs of shoes, three guns, and two cellular telephones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30:11-21 (Tallon). Sedillo argued that there is an insufficient nexus between those nine items and the robberies to support probable cause to collect his DNA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:6-10 (Tallon). He added that, at the preliminary hearing, \"Judge Yarbrough indicated that the evidence against Mr. Sedillo, which we are challenging, was fairly slender.\" Tr. 32:9-13 (Tallon). Sedillo also emphasized that the evidence's nature-DNA-is important, because jurors hold DNA evidence in higher esteem then other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:11-17 (Tallon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Regarding the risk of evidence contamination, the Court noted that it seemed unlikely that a constitutional rule could ever prevent all laboratory mistakes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 34:1-5 (Court). Sedillo rejoined that a DNA contamination risk was heightened when taking swabs outside of the booking context, because the evidence here remains in an area that can be contaminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 34:23-35:13 (Tallon). He added that a DNA mixture is highly likely here\n   given that Sedillo had been living in the apartment with other people for months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:2-14 (Tallon). He argued that, given that cohabitation, Sedillo's DNA appearing on some of the items six weeks after the last robbery \"must be factored into the reasonableness analysis.\" Tr. at 36:2-14 (Tallon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Sedillo concluded by attacking several loose ends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 38:16-41:6. First, Sedillo argued that the United States' argument that gathering the buccal swabs now serves a practical purpose of expediting the case is unpersuasive, because \"almost any kind of investigative technique could be characterized as having a practical purpose[ ].\" Tr. at 38:16-18 (Tallon). Second, Sedillo emphasized that ruling in their favor would not affect thousands of cases, but affects only this one, because the case has distinct factual elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 39:10-17 (Tallon). Finally, Sedillo argued that Sandoval's inexperience should also sway the Court to return Sedillo's DNA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 40:25-41:6 (Tallon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The United States countered by broadly arguing that ruling in the Defendants' favor was impractical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 48:19-52:24 (Torrez). It contended that a contamination concern \"is an issue that arises in every case\" that DNA is used. Tr. at 48:19-20 (Torrez). The United States also argued that requiring the United States to wait to collect DNA is akin to requiring the United States to wait to test a defendant's fingerprints until fingerprints collected from a crime scene are developed, but it noted that this is impractical, because developing fingerprints can take up to six months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 52:18-24 (Torrez). Although it admitted that DNA contamination might be a hurdle in terms of evidence admissibility, the United States argued that the contamination risk does not implicate the search warrant's constitutionality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53:6-17 (Torrez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   It also argued that there is a sufficient connection between Sabaquie and Sedillo, and the items in the car, to establish probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53:19-25 (Torrez). First, it contended that Sabaquie was arrested blocks from the car soon after the robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53:19-21 (Torrez). Second, it averred that agents found a cellular telephone with photographs that tied Sedillo to that telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53:24-54:2 (Torrez). It also argued that there is a sufficient nexus between the apartment and the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 54:4-5 (Torrez). The United States contended that Sedillo lived at the apartment and that a witness identified clothing at the apartment that belonged to Sabaquie.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 54:5-8 (Torrez). The United States concluded that, \"once we establish the nexus\" between the crime and the Defendants, \"common sense tells us that if there is a possibility of DNA ... we don't have to wait until the[re] is a determination that DNA exists.\" Tr. at 55:7-12 (Torrez). Regarding the proper inquiry, the United States argued that the Court must \"look at the four corners of the warrant to determine whether or not probable cause exists,\" but that it does not know whether the Court is \"allowed to go and look at the transcript of a preliminary hearing to see what the magistrate thought about probable cause.\" Tr. at 54:16-23 (Torrez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The United States also responded to several contentions that the Defendants raised previously.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 55:23-56:18 (Torrez). First, the United States contended that, although the Search Warrant states that it would compare the Defendants' DNA profiles with only items found in the car, the limitation to the car does not preclude the United States from comparing the Defendants' DNA sample with items found in the apartment, because \"what we're trying to do is ... compare [the DNA profiles] to items of relevant evidence.\" Tr. at 55:23-56:7 (Torrez). Regarding\n   whether Sandoval has proper credentials to draw an opinion about DNA evidence, the United States argued that \"she has a Ph.D. in biochemistry\" and that \"the education that she does have would certainly be relevant.\" Tr. at 56:16-18 (Torrez).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Sabaquie rejoined that, \"until the[ United States] can show that [it] can develop DNA from [the evidence collected,] there is no ground upon which to say that [Sabaquie's] DNA will be evidence of anything.\" Tr. at 63:5-7 (Fernandez). He also conceded: \"I think [the Court is] right [that] you don't create Fourth Amendment precedents on the risk [that] there [is] intentional mis[handling],\" but that the Fourth Amendment can speak to \"unintentional mishandling\" of DNA samples. Tr. at 64:14-20 (Fernandez). Sabaquie also contended that, if the United States' only practical concern is that testing DNA at different times will slow the investigation down, \"additional time is worth it\" if \"the risk is finding an innocent person guilty.\" Tr. at 65:16-20 (Fernandez). He added that \"it would actually save [the United States] resources ... if they only sought DNA from suspects when they knew they could compare it to something.\" Tr. at 65:20-23 (Fernandez). Sedillo concluded by arguing that the preliminary hearing gives the Court an opportunity to look at Sandoval's cross-examination, and that her cross-examination demonstrates why the Court should return Sedillo's and Sabaquie's DNA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 67:14-22 (Tallon);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:16-21 (Tallon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW REGARDING THE FOURTH AMENDMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Thus, the manner in which information\n   is obtained through this investigative technique is much less intrusive than a typical search. Moreover, the sniff discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics, a contraband item. Thus, despite the fact that the sniff tells the authorities something about the contents of the luggage, the information obtained is limited.

Superior Court considered whether the Fourth Amendment barred the United States from collecting a buccal swab from a defendant where the United States had swabbed a firearm from the crime scene for DNA, but had yet to determine whether the firearm had yielded a testable DNA sample.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Addendum at 52-53; Ferrell Tr. at 48:7-49:8 (Ambrosino, Court).

After further colloquy concerning the statistics for testing firearms, the defendant established that the prosecution could develop a relevant DNA sample from a gun \"29% of the time.\" Case Addendum at 58; Ferrell Tr. at 54:16-17 (Knight). Judge Burgess concluded that a twenty-nine percent chance of recovering relevant evidence did not amount to probable cause and denied the United States' request for a buccal swab.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Addendum at 61, 64; Ferrell Tr. at 57:24 (Court);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:3-8 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Assuming that the Court can and should consider the evidence from the hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court is unpersuaded that the DNA-from-gun yield rate applies with equal force to clothing. Clothing has more direct and constant contact with the human body than a gun does. Moreover, gun handles are often slick metal unlike sweater fibers, which can catch hairs in addition to skin cells from all parts of the body. The Court concludes, accordingly, that the DNA yield rate from clothing would likely be greater than twenty-nine percent. Even if, however, the Court accepts twenty-nine percent as the same yield rate for clothing, it would still conclude that probable cause exists to swab Sedillo and Sabaquie for DNA. As the Tenth Circuit has explained, \"[m]ore than percentages, precedent and common sense rules ... ought to inform the probable cause analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The first factor, thus, whether the intrusion threatens the individual's safety or health, weighs toward reasonableness. The second factor, the extent that the intrusion has upon the individual's dignitary interests in personal privacy and bodily integrity, similarly counsels towards reasonableness. While a buccal swab is an intrusion, \"a swab of this nature does not increase the indignity already attendant to normal incidents of arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

The final factor, the public's interest in a fair and accurate determination of guilt or innocence, is ambivalent. On the one hand, the United States has represented that it needs the DNA swab to aid it in determining the masked robber's identities-the\n   DNA evidence could be important in determining who might be guilty or who might be innocent. On the other hand, the Defendants contend that a DNA swab at this juncture jeopardizes the DNA test's accuracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply \u00b6\u00b6 1-7, at 8-11. The Court has no reason to doubt the Defendant's social science articles arguing that a cognitive bias or DNA contamination risk exists, but the Court is unpersuaded that the risk is so great in this case that it counsels toward overriding-on Fourth Amendment grounds-the United States' interest in the swab. If anything, the articles do not counsel against the swab itself, but instead counsel against carelessly testing DNA. Moreover, the Court has already afforded the Defendants some relief in accord with the counsel to carefully test the DNA by ordering the United States to separate the swab samples from the sweater samples, and to not test the DNA swabs until the Court issues an opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 72:16-74:10 (Court, Fernandez, Torrez).

The Court concludes, however, that the narrow circumstances required for such searches are not present here. There is no evidence of an immediate threat to officers or to public safety-or some other emergency-triggering the buccal-swab search. The Court, in fact, is hard pressed to conceive of a circumstance where an immediate need to protect the lives or safety of others would reasonably prompt an officer to swab someone for DNA.

Code Ann. \u00a7 2-504, was reasonable, because the search involved no discretion on part of law enforcement officers-the Maryland DNA Collection Act required officers to swab all arrestees charged with serious crimes (as long as the arrest was supported by probable cause)-and because the government's interest in identifying arrestees outweighed the minimal privacy interests implicated by a buccal swab.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Maryland v.

While probable cause was needed to support the arrest, the Supreme Court concluded that the Fourth Amendment does not require, in that context, probable cause, or \"individualized suspicion,\" to connect the buccal-swab search with a crime to justify the search.\n    <em>\n     Maryland v.

The Supreme Court reasoned that the Fourth Amendment allows a search absent the usual nexus between the place or person to be searched and a crime, because the Maryland DNA Collection Act was non-discretionary; officers did not choose when to swab for DNA, they did it for every arrestee charged with a serious offense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20S.%20Ct.%201970\">\n     133 S.Ct. 1970\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

That exception diverges from the administrative or booking search exception, because it justifies a targeted search for relevant evidence. In\n    <em>\n     Birchfield v.

North Dakota\n    </em>\n    , but not necessarily searches absent a nexus between the search and the crime of arrest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Birchfield v.

The two searches are too temporally separated from the arrest to constitute a search incident to arrest.

As the Tenth Circuit has recognized, \"the proper analysis\" for the temporal aspect of a search incident to arrest \"is not a minute-by-minute comparison of the 'time of arrest' with the 'time of search,' but rather, '[t]he relevant distinction turns ... upon whether the arrest and search are so separated in time or by intervening events that the latter cannot fairly be said to have been incident to the former.' \"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The month between the swab searches and the arrests coupled with various intervening actions before the swabs-e.g., counsel had been assigned, a discovery order had been entered, arraignments had either occurred or had been set-indicate that the search-incident-to-arrest period had ended.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    The Court notes that, in the distinct, but similar, traffic-stop context, officers may constitutionally extend a traffic-stop seizure for various reasons not linked to the stop's initial purpose. The Court has criticized the jurisprudence allowing officers to extend such traffic stops.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

June 9, 2017) (Browning, J.). For example, when an officer pulls a motorist over for speeding, why may the officer inspect the car's VIN number without independent reasonable suspicion or consent to do so? The VIN number provides no information related to the vehicle's speed. Once again, however, those extensions of time usually amount to minutes, not months. The Court concludes, accordingly, that the swab searches of Sabaquie and Sedillo cannot fall under the search-incident-to-arrest exception.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
