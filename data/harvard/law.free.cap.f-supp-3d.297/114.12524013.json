On behalf of a putative class of similarly-situated past and present employees of Whole Foods, they bring this action against Defendants Whole Foods Market, Inc. (\"WFMI\"), and Whole Foods Market Group, Inc. (\"WFM Group\"), to recover all wages and damages owed to them as a result of the allegedly unlawful manner in which Whole Foods conducted its \"Gainsharing\" program, a bonus program designed to incentivize individual Whole Foods grocery store departments to operate under budget by sharing cost savings with employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Class Action Complaint.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each of the seven named Plaintiffs in this action are or were employed in Whole Foods grocery stores throughout the United States. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 28 [hereinafter 2d Am. Compl.], \u00b6\u00b6 32-99. Beginning in 1986 and throughout Plaintiffs' employment, Whole Foods stores nationwide used a profit-sharing program-what Whole Foods referred to as its \"Gainsharing\" program-to incentivize department productivity and revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Under the program, as part of the employee compensation package, Whole Foods awarded bonuses to employees whose departments performed under budget by automatically distributing the surplus savings among the employees in that department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the hiring and orientation process for new Whole Foods stores employees, Defendants provided Plaintiffs with information about the Gainsharing program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (Benefits Orientation Training illustrations). Plaintiffs assert that Whole Foods store managers, department team leaders, and human resources employees provided each of them with materials explaining Gainsharing bonuses and expressly represented during their interviews and throughout their employment that mandatory Gainsharing bonuses were part of the employee compensation package.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-99. Plaintiffs also assert that throughout their employment, Defendants posted Gainsharing reports listing guaranteed wages for employees to view each month, at least once a month.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs relied on these representations to accept offers of employment, and once employed, to work to increase the productivity of their departments\n   in order to create a surplus.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once Plaintiffs accepted employment and became Team Members-thereby vesting in the Gainsharing program-they worked to create a surplus in their departments and therefore were entitled to Gainsharing bonuses.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   However, each Plaintiff alleges that he or she was denied these bonuses throughout his or her entire employment at Whole Foods stores, because Defendants intentionally manipulated and undermined the Gainsharing program in two ways: (1) by imposing a nationwide scheme of \"shifting\" labor costs, and (2) by establishing \"Fast Teams.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-25. Under the practice of \"shifting\" labor costs, if a department came in over budget, Defendants instructed store leadership to \"shift\" the labor costs of that department to a department that had a budget surplus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-31. Payroll/Benefits Specialists at each Whole Foods grocery store then effectuated labor cost shifting by manually altering employee time records otherwise automatically recorded in a Kronos computer system and then submitting the manipulated records to WFMI corporate headquarters for payroll processing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. As a result of this practice, the Gainsharing bonuses owed to employees of departments that performed under budget-including Plaintiffs-were reduced by the costs unlawfully \"shifted\" to those departments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. The decision to \"shift\" labor costs was authorized, made, and ratified at the executive level by Defendants in order to steal bonuses earned by employees nationwide and pad company profits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Additionally, the use of \"Fast Teams\" allowed employees to float from one department to another, purportedly to help departments out as needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. According to Plaintiffs, however, Defendants used Fast Teams to shift labor costs among departments without properly accounting for their work, thereby failing to administer and pay the appropriate bonuses required by the Gainsharing program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants admitted to misconduct publicly, but claimed that manipulation of the Gainsharing program was an isolated problem, not one that plagued stores nationwide. In public statements, Defendants asserted that the malfeasance occurred in only nine of the 457 Whole Foods stores and was perpetrated by nine store managers who \"engaged in a policy infraction that allowed the managers to benefit from a profit-sharing program at the expense of store employees.\" Defs.'

Compl. \u00b6 26. Defendants subsequently sent Whole Foods executives to the nine stores, where they spoke to store employees-including Plaintiffs-and admitted to misconduct related to the Gainsharing program. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants attempted to pay small sums to employees at these nine stores to \"buy peace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Long-Arm Jurisdiction over WFMI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court turns to consider whether it can exercise long-arm jurisdiction over WFMI. WFMI is a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas. Defs.' Mot., Ex. B, ECF No. 30-4 [hereinafter Yost Decl.], \u00b6 2. According to a declaration submitted by Patricia D. Yost, the Global Tax Director for the \"administrative arm\" of the Whole Foods Market family of companies, \"WFMI is ... a holding company that owns shares of other operating companies, which in turn own and operate the individual Whole Foods market stores.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Yost attests that WFMI does not own or operate any store in the District of Columbia; nor does it conduct or transact any business in any state other than Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Yost further states that WFMI does not operate, manage, or control the operation of any store's payroll or the Kronos computer system used to track and manage payroll.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. WFMI also does not, according to Yost, set policies for Whole Foods stores and does not regulate or assure uniformity of policies in the stores.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To counter these assertions, Plaintiffs submit that this court has personal jurisdiction over WFMI for two reasons: first, because Plaintiffs' claims arise out of WFMI's operation of Whole Foods grocery stores in the District of Columbia; and second, because WFMI is the alter ego of WFM Group. In support of their first theory, Plaintiffs point to three pieces of evidence that they assert establishes WFMI's ownership and operation of stores in the District. First, they offer WFMI's Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ending September 2016, which states that, \"As of September 25, 2016,\n   <em>\n    we operated\n   </em>\n   456 stores: 436 stores in 42 U.S. states and the District of Columbia,\" and identifies four such stores in the District. Pls.' Opp'n, Ex. 1, ECF No. 32-2 [hereinafter 10-K filing], at 14 (emphasis added). Second, Plaintiffs point to a comment made by WFMI CEO John Mackey in a news article referring to Whole Foods stores as \"our\" stores, as well as additional statement by Mackey that \"\n   <em>\n    we operated\n   </em>\n   ... 276 stores ... with locations in 37 states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and the U.K.\" in a 2007 Letter to Stakeholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Washington Post Article; Pls.'

But this case is not like\n   <em>\n    Skripchenko\n   </em>\n   .

Specifically, Plaintiffs' allegations pertaining to Defendants' misrepresentations regarding automatic payment under the Gainsharing program throughout their employment merely reiterate Plaintiffs' disappointment in not receiving the benefits bargained for in their oral contract with Defendants.
