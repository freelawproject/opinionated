(\n   <em>\n    Am.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Additionally, Plaintiff directly owns approximately $16 million in bonds issued by PRHTA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Plaintiff alleges that PRHTA Revenue Bondholders, which include Plaintiff, \"purchased their bonds, and [Plaintiff] insured the bonds, based on ironclad contractual agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PRHTA was created in 1965 pursuant to Act No. 74-1965 (the \"Enabling Act\") to, among other things, oversee and manage the development of roads and various means of transportation in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Commonwealth\" or \"Puerto Rico\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   9 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 2002.) PRHTA issued several series of bonds (the \"PRHTA Bonds\") pursuant to Resolution No. 68-18 (docket entry no. 51-4, the \"1968 Resolution\") and Resolution No. 98-06 (docket entry no. 51-5, the \"1998 Resolution\" and, together with the 1968 Resolution, the \"Resolutions\"). Plaintiff asserts that the PRHTA Bonds are secured by liens on (i) the revenues derived from PRHTA's toll facilities (the \"Pledged Toll Revenues\"); (ii) gasoline, diesel, crude oil, and other special excise taxes levied by the Commonwealth (the \"PRHTA Pledged Tax Revenues\"); and (iii) special excise taxes\n   consisting of motor vehicle license fees collected by the Commonwealth (the \"Vehicle Fees,\" together with the PRHTA Pledged Tax Revenues, the \"PRHTA Pledged Special Excise Taxes\" and, collectively, the \"Pledged Special Revenues\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The PRHTA Resolutions establish sinking funds (collectively, the \"Sinking Funds\"). (Resolutions \u00a7 401.) Each Sinking Fund includes three separate accounts (the \"Accounts\"): (i) a bond service account, (ii) a redemption account, and (iii) a reserve account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pursuant to the Resolutions, PRHTA is required to deposit Pledged Special Revenues on a monthly basis with the fiscal agent. (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 208; Resolutions \u00a7 401.) Once the revenues are received, the fiscal agent is required to deposit the funds in the Accounts based on a protocol set forth in the Resolutions. (Resolutions \u00a7 401.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 6, 2016, the Governor of the Commonwealth\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   signed into law the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act (Act No. 21-2016, the \"Moratorium Act\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) The Moratorium Act recited that it was enacted to address the \"desperate\" fiscal emergency facing the Commonwealth and to avoid the \"potential catastrophic effects of allowing creditors to exercise their enforcement remedies,\" which \"would undeniably harm the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Commonwealth.\" (Moratorium Act \u00a7 102.) The Moratorium Act authorized the Governor to declare a \"state of emergency\" over any governmental entity of the Commonwealth. (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85 (citing Moratorium Act \u00a7 201(a) ).) Upon the declaration of a state of emergency, the Moratorium Act authorized the Governor to, among other things, \"prioritize payment of 'essential services' over 'covered obligations.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) A \"[c]overed obligation\" included, in relevant part, \"any interest obligation [or] principal obligation ... of a government entity\" that became due before the Moratorium Act expired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88 (citing Moratorium Act \u00a7 103(l) ).) If a state of emergency was declared with respect to a government entity, the Covered Obligations of such government entity could be suspended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Moratorium Act \u00a7\u00a7 103(l), 201(b) ).) Section 201(b) of the Moratorium Act granted the Governor the power to impose a stay on creditor remedies during the covered period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the enactment of the Moratorium Act, the Governor issued a series of executive orders (collectively, the \"Moratorium Orders\") that Plaintiff asserts declared moratoriums on the PRHTA Bonds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 96.) Specifically, on May 17, 2016, the Governor issued an executive order (docket entry no. 35-3, \"Executive Order 18\") declaring a state of emergency over PRHTA until June 30, 2016, stopped the flow of certain revenues to the PRHTA Revenue Bonds, and stayed all litigation arising from nonpayment of the PRHTA covered obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) On June 30, 2016, the Governor issued an executive order (docket entry no. 35-4, \"Executive Order 30\") that, among other things, extended the PRHTA state of emergency\n   until January 31, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also, on June 30, 2016, the Governor issued another executive order (docket entry no. 35-5, \"Executive Order 31\") that, among other things, suspended the Commonwealth's obligation to transfer certain revenues to PRHTA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2016, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (\"PROMESA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to address a \"fiscal emergency\" that had been created in Puerto Rico as a result of \"a combination of severe economic decline, and, at times, accumulated operating deficits, lack of financial transparency, management inefficiencies and excessive borrowing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202194\">\n    48 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1) (LexisNexis 2017).

Among other things, PROMESA establishes (i) a process for the Oversight Board to approve fiscal plans and budgets of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, including PRHTA; (ii) a process for the Oversight Board to file bankruptcy-type petitions on behalf of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, including PRHTA; and (iii) an alternative mechanism for adjusting the Commonwealth's bond debt or the bond debt of its instrumentalities outside of a bankruptcy proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Am.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98, 100-101, 152.) The Oversight Board has thus far certified, as relevant here, a fiscal plan for the Commonwealth (attached as \"\n   <em>\n    Exhibit A\n   </em>\n   \" to the Amended Complaint, the \"Fiscal Plan\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160.) Following the enactment of PROMESA, Puerto Rico's Amended Moratorium Act imposed measures \"functionally\" identical to the provisions of the Moratorium Act and continued the Moratorium Orders in full force and effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 28, 2017, the Governor's administration and the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (\"AAFAF\") submitted an initial fiscal plan (the \"February 28 Fiscal Plan\") to the Oversight Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) On March 9, 2017, the Oversight Board rejected the February 28 Fiscal Plan on the ground that it understated the Commonwealth's expenditures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157.) On March 11, 2017, the Governor's administration and AAFAF submitted a revised fiscal plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158.) The Oversight Board certified the revised Fiscal Plan on March 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160.) On or about April 28, 2017, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly enacted the \"Fiscal Plan Compliance Act\" (attached as \"\n   <em>\n    Exhibit B\n   </em>\n   \" to the Amended Complaint). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The Fiscal Plan Compliance Act \"adjust[s] the existing legal and juridical framework [of Puerto Rico] to ensure full compliance with the Fiscal Plan ....\" (Fiscal Plan Compliance Act at 1.) The Oversight Board commenced Title III proceedings with respect to the Commonwealth on May 3, 2017, and with respect to PRHTA on May 21, 2017. (Am.

Specifically, Defendants assert that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action because Plaintiff has not suffered a concrete injury, as its rights, and any impairment of those rights, will not be determined until a plan of adjustment is proposed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Br. at 17-18.) In support of that assertion, Defendants contend that (i) the Fiscal Plan and the Fiscal Plan Compliance Law do not discharge debt or eliminate liens, (ii) the Fiscal Plan serves merely as a \"blueprint\" or \"business plan,\" and (iii) Plaintiff has not and cannot plead any distinct injury due to the Moratorium Legislation and Moratorium Orders because Plaintiff admits that it was being paid from reserve accounts at the time it commenced this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Reply Br. at 6-9.) Plaintiff asserts that it has standing and has suffered a concrete, particularized injury because the Fiscal Plan and the Fiscal Plan Compliance Act mandate that funds that were previously earmarked for payment of PRHTA bonds or that would otherwise service PRHTA's debts have been used for other, legally subordinate, purposes or diverted to the Commonwealth's General Funds and that, on July 3, 2017, PRHTA defaulted on a $219 million bond payment, causing Plaintiff to pay $52 million in claims on certain financial guaranty insurance policies, as a result of the clawbacks effected through the Moratorium Orders and Moratorium Legislation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 17-18.)

To the extent, however, its claim of rights in the account is limited to a lien on property of PRHTA, Ambac has neither alleged facts nor proffered a legal theory that would entitle it to a determination that the parties' respective property interests are such as to preclude PRHTA from preventing disbursement of the funds. A determination of the nature or extent of any PRHTA lien interest would therefore be merely advisory, requiring further facts and litigation to ascertain its impact, if any, on rights to control disbursements from the Reserve Account. The Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the Seventh Claim for Relief to the extent that claim is premised solely on Plaintiff's assertion of a lien interest in the Reserve Account funds. A determination of the lien interest, standing alone, will not resolve conclusively the question of whether, when and from what, if any, funds the PRHTA bondholders are entitled to be paid. Such lien-related issues may ripen in other respects in the future in connection, for instance, with claims and objections to claims, and litigation concerning confirmation of a plan of adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Ripeness Requirement\n   </em>\n   (Second Claim for Relief)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the Second Claim for Relief, Plaintiff asserts that the Fiscal Plan, Fiscal Plan Compliance Act, Moratorium Legislation and Moratorium Orders (each a \"Challenged Action,\" and collectively, the \"Challenged Actions\") violate the Takings and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution of the United States by depriving Plaintiff and the PRHTA Revenue Bondholders of their senior secured property interests in the PRHTA Pledged Special Revenues without providing Plaintiff and the PRHTA Bondholders with due process or just compensation.

Defendants assert that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of Plaintiff's First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claims for Relief insofar as they explicitly or implicitly seek invalidation of the certification of the Fiscal Plan, arguing that Section 106(e) of PROMESA divests the Court of jurisdiction \"because those claims challenge the [Oversight Board's] decision to certify the Fiscal Plan.\" (Mot. at 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   FOMB Reply at 3.) Plaintiff argues that Section 106(e) should be narrowly construed to apply only to claims against the Oversight Board that constitute direct challenges of the Oversight Board's certification decisions and contends that, \"[a]t most, [the] limitation on subject matter jurisdiction applies only to a narrow slice of the claims-that portion of the Fourth Claim for Relief that seeks invalidation of the Oversight Board's certification of the Fiscal Plan.\" (Opp'n at 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section 201(b) of PROMESA identifies fourteen specific objectives and requirements that a fiscal plan, whose development is overseen by the Oversight Board, must satisfy. The Oversight Board, pursuant to Section 201(c)(3) of PROMESA, is specifically tasked with reviewing and approving proposed fiscal plans and is granted \"sole discretion\" to determine in connection with such certification whether such fiscal plans satisfy the Section 201(b) requirements. PROMESA not only grants the Oversight Board exclusive authority to certify fiscal plans, but it also insulates the Oversight Board's certification determinations, which necessarily rest on determinations that the Section 201(b) requirements have been met, from challenge by denying all federal district courts jurisdiction to review such challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROMESA \u00a7 106(e). To be meaningful, denial of jurisdiction to review the certification of the Fiscal Plan thus must be understood preclude the review of claims that particular aspects of the Fiscal Plan are noncompliant with Section 201(b) requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The First, Second, and Fourth Claims for Relief of the Amended Complaint expressly seek invalidation of the Oversight Board's certification of the Fiscal Plan and injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from taking or causing to be taken any action pursuant to the Fiscal Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 215, 218, 223, 226, 236, 239.) To the extent these claims rest on contentions that the Fiscal Plan violates Section 201(b) specifications, such as the requirement that a fiscal plan respect lawful priorities or lawful liens under territorial law, this requested relief necessarily implicates review of the Fiscal Plan's certification and therefore the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Congress has entrusted the ultimate decision to certify a fiscal plan to the sole discretion of the Oversight Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROMESA \u00a7 201(c)(3). PROMESA creates a statutory structure that is protective of the Oversight Board's authority under Section 312(a) of PROMESA, which grants the Oversight Board the exclusive right to propose a Title III plan of adjustment that must be consistent with the applicable certified Fiscal Plan to be eligible for confirmation. Together, these provisions underscore\n   the central, discretionary role that Congress has assigned to the Oversight Board in the Title III debt adjustment process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROMESA \u00a7 314(b)(7). Under PROMESA's statutory framework, it is only at the plan confirmation stage that the Court determines whether a proposed plan of adjustment complies with, among other things, the provisions of Title 11 of the United States Code which have been made applicable to these cases by Section 301 of PROMESA and the relevant provisions of PROMESA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROMESA \u00a7 314.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Therefore, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the First, Second and Fourth Claims for Relief to the extent they, implicitly or explicitly, seek invalidation of the certification of the Fiscal Plan and prohibition of actions that could not be taken under PROMESA absent such certification, for non-compliance with PROMESA requirements that constitute predicates to certification, and those claims for relief are dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) to that extent. Section 106(e) does not, however, deprive the Court of jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiff's claims that the Fiscal Plan is invalid or unenforceable as violative of the Contracts, Takings and Due Process Clauses of the federal Constitution. The Fifth and Sixth Claims for Relief are not implicated by Section 106(e) because they do not challenge the Oversight Board's certification of the Fiscal Plan or claim that PROMESA Fiscal Plan certification predicates have not been met.

They assert that \"the Fiscal Plan and [Fiscal Plan Compliance Act] do not effectuate any impairment, discharge, or taking, and [thus] no constitutional claims exist,\" and further argue that, \"[e]ven if they did, Ambac fails to state a claim as to the Fiscal Plan\" and the Moratorium Orders \"because the Contract[s] Clause applies only to state (or Commonwealth) legislation; it does not apply to non-legislative acts such as the Executive Orders or the [Oversight Board]'s certification of the Fiscal Plan or its commencement of the Title III case.\" (Mot. at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Constitution provides that \"[n]o State shall ... pass any ...

Mass. 1992) (stating that, as \"some exercise of legislative power is essential to implicate the Contracts Clause ..., actions solely by executive officers affecting contractual rights would not, unless constituting the exercise of a delegated legislative function, involve a potential violation of the Contracts Clause\" (citations omitted) ) and cases cited therein. Defendants contend that the Fiscal Plan and the Moratorium Orders are executive actions not constituting any exercise of delegated legislative functions, and that Plaintiff thus cannot state a Contracts Clause claim with respect to those measures. Plaintiff's allegations with respect to the Fiscal Plan in this regard fail to identify any delegation or exercise of state legislative authority-the Amended Complaint alleges that the Oversight Board exercised powers \"delegated to it by Section 201 of PROMESA,\" which is federal legislation and thus cannot have constituted a delegation by the Commonwealth's legislature, and that Commonwealth executive branch officials \"submitted\" the Fiscal Plan to the Oversight Board in some manner that constituted a delegated exercise of legislative power. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 177.) Aside from the conclusory assertion that the executive branch actions were an exercise of powers delegated by certain Commonwealth legislation, the Amended Complaint proffers no facts from which it could reasonably be inferred that submission of the Fiscal Plan to the Oversight Board constituted a lawmaking function. The Amended Complaint thus fails to allege plausibly that the Fiscal Plan is a state law within the meaning of the Contracts Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff does, however, allege plausibly that the Moratorium Orders constitute exercises\n   of delegated state legislative power and are therefore laws. The Amended Complaint includes allegations, consistent with the text of the Moratorium Law, that the legislation purported to \"confer the Legislative Assembly's police power on the Governor, and when issuing the Moratorium Orders, the Governor purported to be exercising that police power.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 113.) The Court will therefore turn to an analysis of whether the Amended Complaint states a cause of action for which relief may be granted pursuant to the Contracts Clause as to the Moratorium Orders, the Moratorium Laws, and the Fiscal Plan Compliance Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Though the language of the Contracts Clause is \"unequivocal,\" it \"does not make unlawful every state law that conflicts with any contract,\" and in considering claims brought under the Contracts Clause, courts must \"reconcile the strictures of the Contract[s] Clause with the essential attributes of sovereign power necessarily reserved by the States to safeguard the welfare of their citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    United Auto., Aero., Agric.

Amended Moratorium Act \u00a7 203(a). The Moratorium Orders, among other things, declared a state of emergency over the Commonwealth and certain governmental entities, including PRHTA, and suspended the payment of certain debt obligations. As such, the combined effect of the Amended Moratorium Act and the Moratorium Orders is to authorize a postponement of the deadline for payment of principal and interest on a debt. Thus, the question of whether the Moratorium Legislation and Moratorium Orders are subject to Section 303(1) of PROMESA turns on whether they prohibit the payment of principal or interest. The language of the Moratorium Legislation and Moratorium Orders does not prohibit the ultimate payment of principal and interest on the Commonwealth's debt obligations, nor do they prohibit the accrual of interest during the emergency period. As stated in Part F of the Legislative Assembly's preface to the Moratorium Law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   the Act does not provide for a composition or discharge of debts; instead, all claims and priorities are preserved, and any unpaid amounts on the obligations of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities are not forgiven and instead are payable, as set forth in the Act at the end of any moratorium period to the extent permitted by any applicable law....

It only declares that prohibitions of interest or principal payments do not have binding effects on creditors. To read the statute as precluding even temporary suspensions or extensions that do not reduce the ultimate legal liability of the debtor would fundamentally cripple a territorial debtor's ability to benefit from the breathing space afforded by Title III of PROMESA as the debtor proceeds toward adjustment of its debt obligations under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   When considered in the context of PROMESA and in light of Section 903 of Bankruptcy Code, it is evident that Section 303(1) of PROMESA was enacted to bar territories from establishing their own bankruptcy-like debt restructuring processes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 903.01 (16th ed. 2017) (stating that \" Section 903 is little more than Congress's attempt to proclaim the propriety of establishing a national, uniform procedure for adjusting municipal debts.\") The Moratorium Legislation and Moratorium Orders only authorize temporary extensions of Plaintiff's obligations.

The Moratorium Legislation and Moratorium Orders\n   neither prohibit the payment of principal and interest nor purport to bind creditors to any reduction of the outstanding obligations; they are therefore outside the scope of Section 303(1), and the Fourth Claim for Relief fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted to the extent it is premised on PROMESA Section 303(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Section 303(3)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that the Fiscal Plan and Moratorium Orders are preempted by Section 303(3) as unlawful executive orders.

Alternatively, to the extent that the claim is not barred by the automatic stay, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim because it has failed to allege a violation of a law that either (i) gives rise to a valid security interest, or (ii) assures a transfer of assets to PRHTA for the benefit of the PRHTA Bondholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Section 407(a) of PROMESA provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   While an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico is in existence, if any property of any territorial instrumentality of Puerto Rico is transferred in violation of applicable law under which any creditor has a valid pledge of, security interest in, or lien on such property, or which deprives any such territorial instrumentality of property in violation of applicable law assuring the transfer of such property to such territorial instrumentality for the benefit of its creditors, then the transferee shall be liable for the value of such property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202195\">\n    48 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (LexisNexis 2017). Section 407(b), in turn, provides creditors with a mechanism to enforce rights under Section 407. Specifically, it provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   A creditor may enforce rights under this section by bringing an action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico after the expiration or lifting of the stay of section 405, unless a stay under title III is in effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202195\">\n    48 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (LexisNexis 2017). On its face, Section 407(b) of PROMESA expressly bars creditor enforcement actions when, as here, a stay is in effect under Title III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   It is undisputed that a stay is currently in effect pursuant to Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, as made applicable to these Title III proceedings pursuant to Section 301 of PROMESA. In an attempt to circumvent this express limitation on the availability of the Section 407 cause of action, Plaintiff asserts that the PRHTA Pledged Special Revenues are exempt from the automatic stay and thus are exempt from Section 407(b)'s enforcement restrictions. (Opp'n at 54.) As explained in\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   , Section 922(d) of the Bankruptcy Code is a permissive statutory provision that merely excepts the \"application\" of special revenues from the automatic stay and does not grant relief from the stay for enforcement of claims of right to such revenues.\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 16-24. Section 922(d) does not provide relief from the Title III automatic stay that would affect the availability of the Section 407 cause of action, which is by its terms simply unavailable when \"a stay under title III is in effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff's alternative argument that Section 407(b) does not bar a \"request for declaratory relief\" equally lacks merit. Section 407(b) creates a specific liability and a specific, limited cause of action to enforce such a liability. The liability is \"for the value\" of the improperly transferred property and, as explained above, the cause of action is not available when a stay is in effect under Title III. Recognition of a cause of action for declaratory relief based on Section 407 when the Section 407 cause of action is precluded would be facially inconsistent with the statute. Accordingly, the Fifth Claim for Relief is hereby dismissed in its entirety, without prejudice, because the automatic stay is currently in effect and renders unavailable any cause of action pursuant to Section 407 of PROMESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Sixth Claim for Relief: Sections 922 and 928 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In the Sixth Claim for Relief, Plaintiff requests: (i) a declaratory judgment stating that application of the PRHTA Pledged Special Revenues does not violate the automatic stay and that Defendants' failure to remit post-petition payments to the PRHTA Bondholders violates Sections 922(d) and 928(a) of the Bankruptcy Code ; and (ii) an injunction ordering Defendants to remit the PRHTA Pledged Special Revenues to the PRHTA Bondholders and to not take any action that could impair the transfer of such revenues to the PRHTA Bondholders. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 250-52.) Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief regarding Defendants' alleged obligation pursuant to Sections 922(d) and 928(a) to remit payments to PRHTA Bondholders during the pendency of these Title III proceedings, arguing that those Bankruptcy Code sections, which are incorporated into Title III by Section 301 of PROMESA, do not require PRHTA to make payments during the pendency of the Title III proceeding. (Opp'n at 47-50). Because the viability of Plaintiff's claims turns on whether the cited Bankruptcy Code sections mandate current payments, the Court leaves aside for the moment the question of whether Plaintiff has a valid security interest in pledged special revenue and examines in the first instance the parties' contentions concerning Sections 928 and 922(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Section 928(a) of the Bankruptcy Code not only overrides the general rule of Bankruptcy Code Section 552(a) (which provides that property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding is not subject to liens resulting from pre-petition security agreements), by providing for attachment of liens post-petition to the extent they secure certain special revenue bonds, but also requires, either alone or in concert with Section 922(d), continuity of payments on such bonds during the Title III proceeding. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 199-204.) Section 928 reads in its entirety as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (a) Notwithstanding section 552(a) of [the Bankruptcy Code] and subject to subsection (b) of this section, special revenues acquired by the debtor after the commencement of the case shall remain subject to any lien resulting from any security agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (b) Any such lien on special revenues, other than municipal betterment assessments, derived from a project or system shall be subject to the necessary operating expenses of such project or system, as the case may be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20928\">\n    11 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2010). As explained in\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   , Section 928 of the Bankruptcy Code does not mandate the turnover of special revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 19. Rather, \"[t]he statute clearly and simply provides that certain pre-petition liens will remain in place after the filing of the petition, notwithstanding Section 552(a)'s general protection of after-acquired property from pre-petition liens.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiff's assertions that Section 922(d) of the Bankruptcy Code requires Defendants to turn over the revenues allegedly securing the PRHTA Bonds, and that Section 922(d) exempts bondholder enforcement actions from the automatic stays otherwise in effect pursuant to Sections 362(a) and 922(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, are also unavailing. Section 922(d) does not require \"debtors, or third parties holding special revenues, to apply the revenues to outstanding obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 20. Moreover, Section 922(d) only excepts the \"application\" of special revenues from\n   the automatic stay, and does not address other types of enforcement actions that are stayed by Sections 362(a) and 922(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 23. Therefore, Section 922(d) does not except actions to enforce special revenue liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Because neither Section 922(d) nor Section 928 requires or empowers the Court to order the payment of the pledged special revenues to the PRHTA Bondholders, the Sixth Claim for Relief fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and is therefore dismissed in its entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Seventh Claim for Relief: Reserve Revenues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In Seventh Claim for Relief, Plaintiff seeks orders declaring that (i) all funds held in the Reserve Accounts are property of the PRHTA Bondholders and (ii) PRHTA lacks an interest sufficient to prevent funds held in the Reserve Accounts from flowing to the PRHTA Bondholders, unless and until all outstanding PRHTA Bonds have been fully retired or defeased. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 259-60.) The structure of the allegations in the Seventh Claim for Relief, particularly in paragraph 255 of the Amended Complaint, suggests that Plaintiff is proceeding on three theories of entitlement to the reserve funds-first, that the PRHTA Bondholders own outright the funds in the Reserve Account (See Am. Comp. \u00b6 118 (\"all funds in the Reserve Accounts are property of the [PR]HTA Bondholders\"), second, that the PRHTA Bondholders are beneficiaries of a trust that holds the funds in the Reserve Account (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20928\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"all funds in the Reserve Accounts are ... held in trust for their benefit\") and, third, that the PRHTA Bondholders hold a lien on the funds in the Reserve Account (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"all funds in the Reserve Accounts are ... subject to a lien in their favor\").) As explained above, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the Seventh Claim for Relief to the extent it is premised solely on the existence of a lien. The Court will now address the viability of Plaintiff's ownership- and trust-based theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Bondholders as Reserve Account Owners\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it (or its subrogors) own the Reserve Account funds, and, on the basis of such alleged ownership, assert that neither the automatic stay nor Section 305 of PROMESA presents a barrier to collection of the funds because they are not the property of any Title III debtor. Indeed, Plaintiff asserts that the \"funds held in the Reserve Accounts are the exclusive property of the [PR]HTA Bondholders\" and not of the Commonwealth. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 209.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Section 401 of the 1968 Resolution provides, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   The moneys in [the Reserve] Account[ ] shall be held by the Fiscal Agent in trust and applied as hereinafter provided with regard to ... such ... Account and, pending such application, shall be subject to a lien and charge in favor of the holders of the bonds issued and outstanding under this Resolution and for the further security of such holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 51-4 at 41.) Section 401 of the 1998 Resolution includes language that is substantially similar. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket\n   Entry No. 51-5 at 47.) As explained in\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   , the provisions of the Resolutions are devoid of language that could plausibly support an inference that PRHTA has conferred a full and exclusive ownership interest in Reserve Account funds on the PRHTA Bondholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to plead plausibly that the PRHTA Bondholders hold an outright ownership interest in the Reserve Accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Bondholders as Beneficiaries of a Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court now turns to Plaintiff's assertion that the funds held in the Reserve Accounts are \"held in trust\" by the fiscal agent, BNYM, for the benefit of the PRHTA Bondholders. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 207, 255.) Plaintiff relies on Sections 401 and 501 of the 1968 Resolution, as well as Sections 401 and 410 of the 1998 Resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 501 of the 1968 Resolution is titled \"\n   <strong>\n    Deposits Constitute Trust Funds\n   </strong>\n   ; Security for Deposits\" and provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]ll moneys deposited with the Fiscal Agent under the provisions of [the] Resolution\n   <strong>\n    shall be held in trust\n   </strong>\n   ... and shall not be subject to lien or attachment by any creditor of [PRHTA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20928\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 501 (emphasis added) (Docket Entry No. 51-4). The Section goes on to state that \"[a]ll moneys deposited with the Fiscal Agent [ ] shall be continuously secured, for the benefit of the Authority and the holders of the bonds ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20928\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 410 of the 1998 Resolution provides that \"moneys held for the credit\" of the relevant Reserve Account \"shall be held in trust and disbursed by the Fiscal Agent.\" 1998 Resolution \u00a7 410 (Docket Entry No. 51-5). Sections 207 and 711 of the 1998 Resolution also make reference to \"trusts [ ] created\" by the resolution. 1998 Resolution \u00a7\u00a7 207, 711.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Defendants argue that the use of the word \"trust\" in the resolutions is not, alone, sufficient to create a trust under the law of Puerto Rico, and that the full nature of the contemplated transaction should be considered. Defendants assert that the funds in the Reserve Accounts are only \"held in trust first for the 'further security' of the [PRHTA] [B]ondholders and then to be disbursed to PRHTA once the bondholders are fully paid\" and that, consequently, the funds are \"not held in trust for the sole purpose of paying the bondholders.\" (Mot. at 52-53 (citing 1968 Resolution \u00a7 401; 1998 Resolution \u00a7 401).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As explained in\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   , while \"multiple interpretations could plausibly be supported by the documentation and the allegations of the [ ] Complaint, each contemplates that PRHTA has title or at minimum some contingent reversionary beneficial interest in the trust corpus.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 28.) As such, \"PROMESA Section 305's prohibitions on interference with Debtor property interests, revenues and use and enjoyment of income-producing property deprive this Court of power to interfere with the Debtors' dealings with the Reserve Fund property.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assured\n   </em>\n   at 28.) The Seventh Claim for Relief therefore fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted to the extent it is premised on the contention that the Reserve Fund assets are held in trust for bondholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Claims for Relief asserted in the Amended Complaint is granted. Plaintiff's Second Claim for Relief is dismissed pursuant to\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). The First and Fourth Claims for Relief are dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) to the extent they seek to invalidate the Fiscal Plan on the basis of noncompliance with certification-related provisions of PROMESA or challenge the Oversight Board's certification decision, and are dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in all other respects. Plaintiff's Fifth and Sixth Claims for Relief are dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The Seventh Claim for Relief is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to the extent that Claim for Relief is premised on a claim of outright PRHTA Bondholder ownership or trust beneficiary status as to the funds in the Reserve Accounts and is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) to the extent it is premised on a lien on the Reserve Accounts. The Third Claim for Relief has been withdrawn. In light of the foregoing disposition of Plaintiff's claims, the evidentiary objections that were asserted by the parties are moot and need not be addressed.
