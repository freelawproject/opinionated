Since the decision by the.learned surrogate, we think that the question has been settled by the court of appeals adversely to the view taken by him. In the case of <em>Thorn </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>113 N. Y. 202, 21 N. E. Rep. 149, the court of appeals have decided that, except in some peculiar cases, legacies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>only draw interest from the time they become due and payable. The decree of the surrogate should therefore be reversed so far as appealed from, and the case sent back to the surrogate\u2019s court for further action. -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
