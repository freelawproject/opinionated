Defendants demurred to the complaint, and the special term rendered judgment in their favor. From that judgment plaintiff appealed to the general term, which affirmed the judgment of the special term. From this judgment of affirmance, plaintiff again appealed to the court of appeals, which affirmed the judgment as to defendants Duggin and Slaybaek, without costs, but reversed it as to all the other-defendants. 24 Y.

Defendants Duggin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>and Slayback then served their bill of costs on plaintiff, but the clerk refused to tax them because of the action of the court of appeals in affirming the judgment as to them without costs. Defendants Duggin and Slayback then moved the special term that the clerk be compelled t&lt;, tax the costs in their favor. From an order denying their motion, they appeal. Code Civil Proc. N.

In thisaffirmance it was directed to be without costs. But these two defendants-claim their costs notwithstanding this direction, for the reason that the action was to enforce what is known as \u201ca legal liability;\u201d but the judgment from which the appeal was taken was affirmed only in part. It previously did include other defendants, and that part only was affirmed which included these two defendants, and, on a partial affirmance by subdivision 2, \u00a7 3238; the costs have been subjected to the discretion of the court. The language of therein ittance shows that this view was acted upon in making its decision by the court of appeals, and that it exercised this discretion. The case is very clearly against these defendants, and the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and - the disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
