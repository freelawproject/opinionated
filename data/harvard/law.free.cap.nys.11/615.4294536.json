J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">There are circumstances disclosed by the papers herein which might very well lead the court to impose heavy conditions to the granting of a favor, but we think that perhaps the terms were rather severe. We think that the plaintiff was entitled to costs of motion, trial fee, term fee, and disbursements of the term, and to the stipulation ordered. The order appealed from should be modified to this extent, and, as modified, affirmed without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
