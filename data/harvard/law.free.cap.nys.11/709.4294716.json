About March 8, 1890, the defendant moved out, and securely closed the premises against the intrusion of persons without his consent. Within a few days thereafter the plumbing work was cut out and stolen by persons unknown. When plaintiff again became possessed of the demised premises he caused the plumbing work to be replaced, and thereupon brought this action to recover the sum claimed to-have been necessarily expended by him for that purpose. On the trial there was no dispute as to the fact of letting, and the removal of the plumbing work in the manner above stated, and, after being duly charged by the trial justice, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Judgment was thereupon duly entered, from which defendant appealed. The only alleged errors assigned by defendant as grounds for reversal are to be found in the-charge to the jury and the justice\u2019s refusal to charge as requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The alleged error in the charge is that portion thereof where the justice says, \u201cIf you believe the evidence of the plaintiff your verdict will be for the-plaintiff.\u201d To this defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, and the trial justice thereupon corrected his charge by stating that he desired to be understood as saying that, if the jury believed the evidence as adduced by the plaintiff, the verdict should be for the plaintiff, to which correction the defendant\u2019s counsel again excepted. Defendant\u2019s counsel also requested the court to charge that,. in respect to the property stolen, the defendant'was bound only for ordinary diligence, and that it was sufficient to exonerate the defendant from liability for the stolen property \u201cif the defendant used as much care and diligence for the safety of the property as is usual with the common run of men, or with, men of ordinary discretion, in managing their property,\u201d and \u201cthat the defendant is not responsible for the condition of the house unless it was put in that condition by his own fault or negligence.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel further-requested the trial justice to charge that if the defendant \u201cleft the house in the same condition as the owner of the property would have left it, and while-in that condition the property was stolen, the defendant was not liable.\u201d All of these requests were refused, and to such refusals the defendant\u2019s counsel-also duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">It is apparent from the exceptions and the requests that the defense proceeded upon the theory that the facts adduced to substantiate plaintiff\u2019s claim constituted what is termed \u201cpermissive waste, \u201d and that therefore negligence of the defendant in. permitting the injury to plaintiff\u2019s property complained of, being the gist of the action, must be proved, and that without such proof the: defendant is not answerable; and, indeed, the brief for.the defendant upon this-appeal is almost entirely devoted to substantiate that view. In this, however, the counsel for the defendant is mistaken. Permissive waste consists in the negligent or willful omission to do what is required to prevent an injury to demised premises,\u2014as to suffer the demised premises or a part thereof to go-to decay for the want of repairs. Voluntary or commissive waste consists of injury to the demised premises or some part thereof, when occasioned by some deliberate or voluntary act, as, for instance, the pulling down of a house, or the removal of wainscots, floors, benches, furnaces, windows, doors, shelves, \u25a0or other things fixed to and constituting a material part of the freehold. See 1 Washb. Real Prop. p. 125, par. 2; 2 Bouv. Law Dict. p. 654, \u201cWaste.\u201d Thorn ere statement of these definitions will be sufficient to make it clear that the injury to the freehold complained of in this action falls within the class known to the law as \u201ccommissive waste.\u201d I apprehend, however, that defendant\u2019s-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>counsel will contend that because it does not appear that the injury for the recovery of damages for which this action was brought was shown to have been committed by the defendant, or by his direction, or by his agents or servants, commissive waste was not established. But it was not essential to the recovery that such proof should have been made, for, though the acts complained of were committed by strangers, the defendant was none the less liable. 1 Washb. Real Prop. p. 135, pars. 34, 35; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Transportation Co., </em>1 Denio, 104. And being so liable the fact that he was a tenant for one year, or from year to year only, does not deprive the plaintiff of his right of redress against him. There appears to be some doubt as to whether a tenant at will, or from year to year, may be liable for permissive waste, and, in support of his claim that such an action is not maintainable against that class of tenants, defendant\u2019s counsel cites <em>Herne </em>v. <em>Bembow, </em>4 Taunt. 764. \u201c The English law in that respect does not appear to have been followed in this country, at least not in the states of New Jersey and New York. \u201d See <em>Newbold </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>44 N. J. Law, 266; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Covert, </em>7 Johns, 4. The facts in this case, however, constituting, as above stated, commissive waste, there can be no question as to the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain this action, since in such a case all tenants are alike answerable. See Wood, Landl. &amp; Ten. p. 710, \u00a7 425, and cases cited. It would therefore have been proper upon the evidence for the trial justice to have directed a verdict for the plaintiff, leaving the damages only to be assessed by the jury. <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>10 N. Y. 117. Eor the reasons above stated, the defendant\u2019s exceptions taken upon the trial in the court below are insufficient to warrant a reversal. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
