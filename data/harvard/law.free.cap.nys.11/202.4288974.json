Judge Truax, at special term, filed the following opinion: \u201cThe Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1723,- authorizes a defendant in an action for a chattel to defend on the ground that a third person was entitled to the chattel without connecting himself with the latter\u2019s title. Section 1704 says that the affidavit required by that section must contain * an allegation,\u2019 etc. There is such an allegation in the affidavit delivered to the sheriff. That it is made on information and belief is immaterial, for. he is authorized to defend on information and belief. Motion denied, with costs to abide event. \u201d Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1704, provides that, in order for defendant in replevin to reclaim the goods, he must, among other things, deliver to the sheriff \u201can affidavit containing an allegation either that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the defendant is the owner of the chattel or that he is lawfully entitled to the possession thereof, by virtue of a special property therein, the facts with respect to which must be set forth.\u201d Defendant made affidavit that he was a warehouseman; that the goods were deposited with him, as such, by one <em>A.i </em>that he issued his receipt therefor; and that, to the best of his information, and belief, A. was the owner, and entitled to the possession thereof.

It appears that the defendant is a warehouseman; that he received the goods in question from one Alexander Agar on storage, and issued his receipt therefor; and that he prevented a delivery to the plaintiff by delivering to the sheriff the notice, affidavit, and undertaking required by section 1704 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The-affidavit was sufficient, for the reasons stated by the learned judge below, and we can see no merit in any of the points raised by the appellant. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
