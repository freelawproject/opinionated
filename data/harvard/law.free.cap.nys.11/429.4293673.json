From a judgment dismissing her complaint the plaintiff appeals. Dissenting opinion of Judge VanHoesen is as follows: \u201cThe evidence shows-that on an evening in January, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, an old man of sixty-seven, started to cross Grand street, from the north side to the south side.. Between the sidewalk on the southerly side of Grand street, and the railway track next to it, there was a snow-bank two feet or more in height. The intestate, whose name was Henry Friedman, saw the defendant\u2019s car when it was about fifteen or twenty feet distant from him, and he called to the driver \u2022Stop! Stop!\u2019 Friedman at that time was in the middle of the track-upon which the car was approaching. There was another car coming on the other track, in an opposite direction. The car, to the driver of which Friedman-called, did not stop, but Friedman got safely across the track, and probably would have escaped all injury had it not been for the snow-bank which-blocked his way. Between the snovy-bankand the car Friedman was caught* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>and he fell down, or was knocked down, so close to the rail that, as he lay on ihis side, one of the fore-wheels of the car ran over his leg, and produced a wound that resulted in his death. Upon this state of facts, the judge dismissed the complaint. In this I think he erred. While it is not clear that the defendant\u2019s driver was to blame, and while it is possible that a jury would have found that he was not negligent, the judge could not, as matter of law, \u2022say that the driver did all that a prudent man should have done. Whether the driver should have driven on a smart trot when he saw the aged Friedman attempting to scale the snow-bank, or standing on the narrow strip between the snow-bank and the track, is a question of fact that should have been submitted to the jury. I can see no reason for holding, as matter of law, that Friedman was negligent. Perhaps the jury might have found that he \u2022was, but, if I had been sitting as a juror, perhaps I should have found that he was not. It would have been easy for a vigorous man to leap to the top of the snow-bank and get away. If the bank had been only eighteen inches in height, it is possible that Friedman could have reached its top. If the bank were of soft snow, Friedman might have been saved, for he could easily have stepped in it and got away; and there is nothing in the evidence to show that Friedman knew, or ought to have known, that the bank was of ice, or of snow frozen so hard that he could not wade through it. It is plain that Friedman had ample time to get across the track, but whether it was careless of him to venture across in front of the approaching car, in view of the fact that the snow-bank obstructed the way to the sidewalk to which he was going, is a matter as to which different conclusions will be drawn by different men. The \u25a0case ought, therefore, to have been submitted to the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b458-5\">Argued before Larremore, C.

The facts relied upon for such recovery, briefly stated, are as follows: On January 25,1881, between about 6 o\u2019clock and 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a man about 67 years of age, and who was in vigorous health, \u2022excepting the usual feebleness accompanying advanced years, attempted to cross Grand street, in the neighborhood of Goerick street, from the north side to the south side. At this point on Grand street there were three separate tracks used in the operation of horse ears, and between the southern track, and the curb on the south side of Grand street, there was at the time a snowbank between 2 and 3 feet high, and about 15 feet in length. When plaintiff\u2019s intestate was attempting to cross, one of defendant\u2019s cars was approaching on a down grade from the west, and in an easterly direction, at an unusually rapid rate of speed. It was a cold and clear night, and the car was plainly visible at a distance of 100 feet or more, and, excepting the snowbank and car mentioned, there was nothing to obstruct either view or passage. Plaintiff\u2019s intestate had reached the southern track upon which defendant\u2019s car was approaching, and when it was within 10 or 15 feet of him, he called to it to stop, and proceeded to cross the track. Having crossed the track he attempted to wade through, or leap over, the snow-bank, and, in so'doing, fell between the latter and the ear, and in that way sustained the injuries of which he died four days later. Upon this state of facts, the case is no longer \u2022open for original consideration by this court. The first trial ended in the dismissal of the complaint, and upon appeal to the general term the action of the trial judge was sustained; Mr. Justice Van Hoesen, however, dissenting from the opinion of his associates, and writing an opinion for reversal. <em>Freidman </em>v. <em>Railroad, Co., </em>3 N. Y. St. Rep. 557. The learned justice, writing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>-dissenting opinion, held that it was not contributory negligence as matter of law for plaintiff\u2019s intestate to proceed to cross the track, and <em>to </em>attempt <em>to </em>wade through or leap over the snow-bank, upon seeing the approaching car, And that whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was himself negligent was an inference to be drawn from the facts, and that the facts would sustain a finding to the effect that he was not negligent. The dissenting justice also held that the testimony would sustain a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant, resulting in the injuries to plaintiff\u2019s intestate. These views were Adopted by the court of appeals, and the j udgment was reversed, and a new trial ordered. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>110 N. Y. 676, 18 N. E. Rep. 482. . Upon the second trial, at which the judgment now appealed fro'm was rendered, Messrs. Skill man and Roll were the chief witnesses on whose testimony the plaintiff relied to make out her case. This testimony I have carefully compared with the facts as shown in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Van Hoesen, and there does not appear to me to be any appreciable variance between the alleged facts as testified to by the witnesses named, and the facts mentioned in such opinion. This court is bound, therefore, to accept the views of the court of appeals, and, under the circumstances, it was error for the learned judge presiding at the second trial to withdraw the consideration of the question of defendant\u2019s negligence, and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate\u2019s -contributory negligence, from the jury. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
