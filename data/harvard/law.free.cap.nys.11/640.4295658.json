Taylor against Eobert B. MacLea. The complaint alleges that on or about the 10th day of September, 1890, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a written contract for the hiring by defendant from plaintiff of the dwelling-house Ho. 65 West ninetieth street, in the city of Hew York, \u201ca copy of which is hereto annexed, and forms part of this complaint;\u201d that, in pursuance thereof, the defendant became indebted to the plaintiff on the 1st day of October, 1890, in the sum of $120.83, for rent of said premises, payable on that day; that payment thereof was- demanded and refused. Defendant demurred, upon the ground that the complaint did not state facts constituting a cause of action, the argument being that the contents of the lease should have been set out in the complaint according to their legal effect. Plaintiff had judgment on the demurrer, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b668-13\">Argued before McAdam, C.

Pl. 306, 307; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 Barn. &amp; C. 358; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Earl of Plymouth, </em>3 Barn &amp; Ald. 66,69, 70. Judge Duer, in <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>2 Duer., at page 353, went further. He said: \u201cThe safest course, under the Code, where the action is founded on an instrument in writing, is to annex a copy and refer to it as part of the complaint.\u201d This we hold is good practice. It was followed in the present instance. The contract annexed is clear and explicit, and, by its terms, the money sued for became due and payable as stated in the declaration. The demurrer interposed was clearly frivolous, and was properly overruled. The defendant, instead of appealing from the interlocutory judgment, has appealed from the order only, and, in consequence, we will, instead of affirming the order, dismiss the appeal, with costs. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>76 N. Y. 514; <em>Pardee </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>83 N. Y. 624; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Rathburn, </em>88 N. Y. 660.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
