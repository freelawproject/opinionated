On a discontinuance of the proceeding, an order was entered awarding costs to one of the respondents, Edwin H. Crampton, from which the petitioner appealed to the general term, which affirmed the order; and on such affirmance, a judgment in favor of said respondent was entered on his motion. A motion by the petitioner to vacate the judgment was denied; and from the order denying this motion the petitioner appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b808-11\">Code Civil Proc. E.

Therefore we think the order of the general term affirming the special term order, in this proceeding was final, and that it was irregular to enter judgment upon such order. The costs should have been taxed by the clerk, and then inserted in the general term order. Sections 3262-3266. We think the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>tian to vacate such judgment should have \"been granted. Therefore the order denying the motion should be reversed, with $10 costs of appeal, and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
