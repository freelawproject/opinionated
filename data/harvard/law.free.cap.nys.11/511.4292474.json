If the attorney intended to state, as a reason, rthe one because of which he states that the complaint was verified by him, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>was entirely insufficient. These affidavits should be made by the party, he or she being the only one who can asseverate -as to his or her own knowledge or intention, material allegations. There is nothing in the affidavit under consideration to show that the attorney had any peculiar knowledge as to any of the facts necessary to be established; and, as to those as to which he swears he has no knowledge, it may well be that the plaintiff was fully informed. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the order for examination vacated, with leave to the plaintiff upon payment of these costs, and $10 costs of the motion below, to apply Upon additional papers for a new order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
