Y. Supp. 370, we think that the motion to vacate the order of August 30, 1889, should have been granted, and the order in that respect should be reversed, and said order of August 30th vacated. The balance of the order, we think, however, should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
