The answer was a general denial. There was a verdict for plaintiff. The question of title was gone into exhaustively, and a motion for a certificate to the effect that the title of real property came in question was granted. Defendant thereupon moved at special term to vacate the certificate, and now appeals from an order denying the motion. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 3228, subd. 1, provides for allowance to plaintiff of costs, of course, upon the rendering of a final judgment in his favor in \u201can action triable by a jury * * * in which a claim of title to real property arises upon the pleadings, or is certified to have come in question upon the trial.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b30-11\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
