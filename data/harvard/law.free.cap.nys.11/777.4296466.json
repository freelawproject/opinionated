Mills for personal injuries to plaintiff while in the employ of defendants, helping to unload broken stone from a scow. The rope with which he was hauling the stone, raised from the scow by a derrick to railroad cars, broke, causing him to fall from a car backward on a heap of stone, whereby he was injured. The rope was furnished by defendants for the purpose, and was alleged by plaintiff to have been unsafe and unfit for use when given to him. The evidence as to its quality and condition was conflicting. At the close of the charge to the jury, defendants presented requests for instructions, as follows: \u201cTo render the defendants liable, it must appear that they knew, or, from the nature of the case, ought to have known, of the unfitness of the tag-rope furnished to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff did, not know, or could not reasonably be held to have known, of the defect. Knowledge on the part of the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>ployer, and ignorance on the p\u00e1rt of the employe, are of the essence of the action.\u201d \u201cIf the plaintiff knew that the rope was worn, and- neglected to procure a new one from the defendants\u2019 store-house, and continued to .work with the old one, he cannot recover in this action.\u201d \u201cIt was the plaintiff\u2019s duty, as soon as he discovered that the rope was worn, to inform the defendants or their foreman, and he had no right to continue to work with the rope in this condition and expose himself to danger because of it.\u201d Bach of these the court refused to charge, further than already charged, and to these refusals exceptions were taken, which are the exceptions mentioned in the opinion. The jury found a verdict for plaintiff, and a motion by defendants for a new trial was denied. Brom the judgment, and the order denying their motion for a new trial, defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b806-3\">Argued before Clement, C.

As to the quality and condition of the rope, the testimony was conflicting, and the verdict of the jury was conclusive that the defendants failed to perform the duty which the law placed upon them, and that the plaintiff was injured .through the neglect of the defendants, and without carelessness on his part. This case is similar to that of <em>Mikkelsen </em>v. <em>Transportation Co., </em>9 N. Y. Supp. 741, and our opinion in that case is in point.' Judgment and order denying new trial affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
