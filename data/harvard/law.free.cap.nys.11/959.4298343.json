The defense of defendant was twofold: <em>First. </em>That defendant did not accept such offer; <em>second, </em>that he was not to be liable for commissions until the exchange should be actually consummated by delivery of deeds. There was a conflict of evidence on both of these questions, which were submitted to a jury. They decided both in favor of plaintiff. After careful examination of the testimony, we think these questions were properly submitted to the jury, and see no reason for disturbing the verdict. Judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
