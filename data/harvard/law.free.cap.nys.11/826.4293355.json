Y. 1870, c. 291, \u2022 tit. 3, \u00a7 3, as amended by Laws 1878, c. 281) giving power to make ordinances to restrain and prevent hawking and peddling in the streets, and to grant licenses to-peddlers, and fix the amount to be paid therefor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b854-16\">Appeal from Saratoga county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b854-17\">Plaintiff village sued defendant, Charles A. Markham, in a justice\u2019s court, to recover three penalties of $10 each, alleged to have been incurred by the-' defendant because that, on three different days, he peddled meat in the village of Ballston Spa, without having obtained a-license therefor. Plaintiff is-incorporated under the general act for the incorporation of villages; (Chap-1 ter 291, Laws 1870,) and the acts amendatory thereof. Its board of trustees; passed and promulgated the following ordinances: \u201cSec. 34. All persons-within the corporate limits of this village, who shall hawk or peddle meat, * . * * in any of the streets of this village shall pay a license\u201d of $30 therefor. \u201cLicenses here mentioned when issued shall continue in force one year.\u201d . Section 35 prescribes a penalty of $10 for selling without a license. Various other licenses are in like manner provided for. The evidence showed that defendant violated the ordinance, and plaintiff recovered judgment for $30,, and costs, before the justice, which judgment upon appeal was reversed by the county court. From the judgment of reversal plaintiff appeals. ;</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Argued before Learned, P.

We think the statute authorized the board of trustees to pass the ordinances in question establishing the price of the license, prohibiting peddling meat without a license, and fixing the penalty for each violation. Section 3 of title 3 of the village general act (2 Rev. St., 8th Ed., p. 967; chapter 291, Laws 1870) provides that \u201cthetrustees shall have power, as to acts and matters within the corporate limits, to make, publish, amend, and repeal rules, ordinances, and by-laws for the following purposes: * * * (subdivision 22) To restrain and prevent hawking and peddling in the streets, to regulate, restrain, or prohibit sales by auction, and grant licenses to peddlers and auctionegrs, and fix the amount to be paid thereior,\u201d\u2014amended by chapter 281, Laws 1878. Subdivision 27: \u201cThe board of trustees shall have power to make and establish all legal by-laws, rules, and ordinances necessary to carry out the purposes of this act, * <em>* * </em>and to enforce such by-laws, rules, and ordinances. * * * The trustees shall also have power to prescribe penalties for a violation thereof, not exceeding $100 for each offense.\u201d Section 9, art. 8, of the constitution provides: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the legislature to provide for the organization of cities and incorporated villages, and to restrict their power of taxation, * * * so as to prevent abuses in assessments and contracting debts.\u201d It is plain that the above legislative grants of power are within the constitution^ and are ample in their terms to embrace the ordinances of the village of Ballston Spa above cited. Undoubtedly the ordinance must be within the legislative grant of power, or it is void. Here the power is \u201cto restrain and prevent hawking and peddling in the streets,\u201d and \u201cto grant licenses to peddlers, * * * and fix the amount to be paid therefor. \u201d Any one could peddle meat upon paying for the license. In <em>City of Brooklyn </em>v. <em>Nodine, </em>26 Hun, 512, it was said that the power to regulate and license does not carry the power to tax. We need not question this. Here the power with respect to peddlers is to restrain and prevent, and to license. The license fee exacted tends to restrain and prevent. It is also a tax, but it is not, therefore, prohibited. It is competent for the law to provide that a peddler who enjoys the benefits of the trade of a village shall contribute something in discharge of its burdens. Cases are cited in which ordinances designed to confer arbitrary power upon the authorities to do injustice to a class because of race or religious prejudices have been condemned. In <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U. S. 356, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064, the Chinese were discriminated against; in <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>16 Pick. 121, the Roman Catholics. These have no application. Cases cited in which, under a false pretense of promoting health, or good order, oppressive burdens have been imposed, do not apply. Nor do th&amp; cases cited from the supreme court of the United States in which it has been held that a license imposed by state authority upon a non-resident trader of the state, because he was a non-resident, was void, \u00f3r upon a trader because he dealt in the productions of other states; or upon merchandise because it was imported from other states. These were attempts by the state to invade-the exclusive power of congress to regulate commerce among the states, or to prevent interstate commerce from being free. The matter here is purely of a domestic character, and the power exercised is valid because authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>by the legislature within its constitutional competency. <em>Village of Carthage </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>25 N. E. Rep. 480; <em>Village of Deposit </em>v. <em>Pitts, </em>18 Hun, 475; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thacher, </em>42 Hun, 349; <em>City of Brooklyn </em>v. <em>Breslin, </em>57 N. Y. 591; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mulholland, </em>82 N. Y. 324. The answer raises no issue \u2022as to the incorporation of the village. The judgment of the county court should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
