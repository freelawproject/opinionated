The district court imposed sentence and the defendant did not pursue a direct appeal. Garcia filed a pro se motion to vacate his conviction and sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the grounds that (1) the guilty plea had been involuntary, (2) the trial court failed to inform him of his right to appeal his sentence; (3) the sentencing court misapplied the guidelines; (4) Garcia\u2019s attorney failed to object to the perceived sentencing errors. The magistrate recommended that Garcia\u2019s habeas corpus petition be denied and the district court adopted this recommendation. Garcia now appeals. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny habeas- corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">Right to Appeal Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"AXBA\">Garcia has abandoned three of the four issues that he raised below, <em>see United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 110 S.Ct. 321, 107 L.Ed.2d 312 (1989) and the only issue he now urges before this Court is that the sentencing court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a) by failing to apprise him of his right to appeal his sentence when sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a) states \u201cThere shall be no duty on the court to advise the defendant of any right of appeal after sentence is imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, except that the court shall advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.\u201d <em>No </em>such warning was given at sentencing but the sentencing court did mention \u201cshould appeals be filed, then the [pre-sentence] report will be made available for review for appellate purposes only.\u201d Two months prior to sentencing, at rearraignment, the following exchange occurred between the sentencing court and Garcia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-19\">THE COURT: A sentence imposed pursuant to the sentencing guidelines may be subject to appellate review. That means that if I sentence you and I don\u2019t follow the guidelines, and I give you less sentence than the Government consents \u2014 or the guidelines require, the Government may appeal that. And if I give you more than the sentencing guidelines require, you have the right to appeal. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi\">GARCIA-FLORES: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-20\">Garcia concedes that he was informed of his right to appeal the sentence but argues that the warning was deficient for two reasons: (1) he was not informed of his right at sentencing but prior thereto at rearraignment; and (2) the language of the warning was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-21\">(1) Our cases have never required a strict compliance with Rule 32(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Godin v. United States, </em>495 F.2d 560 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 995, 95 S.Ct. 308, 42 L.Ed.2d 268 (1974), for example, the court sent a letter informing the defendant of his right to appeal. We held that the defendant need not be informed in open court of this right but must merely be \u201capprised of his right to appeal in substantial compliance with the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561. In <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>469 F.2d 634 (5th Cir.1972), the defendant was not appraised of this right by the sentencing court. The government argued that this was harmless error because the defendant was notified by his attorney. We agreed and remanded so that it could be determined whether the attorney actually informed the defendant of his right. <em>Go-din </em>and <em>Chapman </em>teach us, therefore, that a violation of Rule 32(a)(2) in the form of notice of right to appeal before rather than after imposition of sentence is harmless so long as the defendant is fully informed of this right. The sentencing court\u2019s explanation of defendant\u2019s right of appeal given at rearraignment satisfies the rule\u2019s dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">(2) Nor does the language used by the court violate Rule 32(a)(2). The purpose of the rule is to require the court to notify a defendant of his right to appeal. The language of the court, while not as clear as might be desired, sufficed to inform Garcia of this right. Further, he acknowledged that he understood his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-13\">. Prior to November 1, 1987, Rule 32(a)(2) did not require a court to inform a defendant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>pled guilty of his right to appeal the sentence. <em>See Marrow v. United States, </em>772 F.2d 525, 528-29 (9th Cir.1985). Rule 32(a)(2) has long required, however, the sentencing court to inform a defendant who did not plead guilty of his right to appeal the conviction and sentence. Our cases construing 32(a)(2)\u2019s requirement that the sentencing court inform a defendant who does not plead guilty of his right to appeal are authoritative on the rule\u2019s new requirement. What constitutes adequate notice of the right to appeal is the same regardless of whether the defendant pleads guilty or not guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
