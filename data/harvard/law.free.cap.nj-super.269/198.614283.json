Johnson. The judge concluded, based on the motion papers, that plaintiff, who sustained soft tissue injuries, had made an inadequate showing of objective criteria to warrant a jury trial. We disagree and consequently remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">At the time of the accident plaintiff, then 25 years old, had just completed her graduate training in master printmaking, having obtained both a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in printmaking as well as a certification as a master printmaker. Having completed her studies in New Mexico, she had just come to New Brunswick, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>New Jersey, where she had obtained employment at Rutgers University as its master printmaker. The accident occurred in New Brunswick on January 5, 1989, as the alleged result of defendant\u2019s having passed through a stop sign on Livingston Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">According to the motion papers, the consequences of the accident, in which plaintiff suffered a low-back injury, have been professionally devastating. She asserts that she is no longer able to manipulate the heavy limestones that constitute the surface for a large proportion of prints. Although she can still manipulate the metal plates which provide an alternative surface, the plates are regarded as a less acceptable surface and are not utilizable at all for some techniques. Beyond that, she experiences severe and constant pain whenever she works despite beginning and ending each day with exercises and taking breaks from her work in order to perform exercises designed to relax her back muscles. In sum, it is her assertion that as a result of the accident she is unable to pursue the profession for which she arduously trained. The report of plaintiff\u2019s examining physician confirms that plaintiff \u201cis young and she should be able to find a different job in the future, even if it requires retraining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The trial judge suggested that the so-called subjective criteria for meeting the verbal threshold as explicated by <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 609 A.2d 415 (1992), were not the problem here. This is plainly so. The substantial effect of plaintiffs back injury on her life was poignantly asserted. The judge\u2019s concern rather was with the so-called objective criteria, which, he concluded, had not been demonstrated by the motion papers. We do not share his appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The experts for both parties agreed that plaintiff suffered from a pre-existing spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis at L5-S1. Spondylolisthesis is defined as the \u201cforward movement of the body of one of the lower lumbar vertebrae on the vertebra below it, or upon the sacrum.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary, Third Unabridged Lawyers\u2019 Edition </em>(1972). Spondylolysis is defined as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201cbreaking down or dissolution of the body of a vertebra,\u201d or \u201ca cleft formation in the vertebral body,\u201d or a \u201cloosening of the firm attachment of the contiguous vertebrae.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to plaintiffs medical history, these conditions were caused by a fall when she was a child and confirmed by x-ray when she was fourteen. These physical conditions had, however, been functionally quiescent until this accident. She had had no episodes of pain or other problem until then. It is plaintiffs theory that the accident aggravated the pre-existing condition, resulting in her present disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Although plaintiffs treating physician noted that there had been no appreciable movement of the spondylolisthesis since the 1977 x-rays, it was nevertheless his opinion that the accident had aggravated that condition. His report suggests that that opinion was based on plaintiffs continuing back spasms and pain. In addition, plaintiffs examining physician, while also noting the absence of any appreciable x-ray change, diagnosed aggravation of the preexisting condition as well, relying on findings of \u201cmildly spastic\u201d musculature, \u201ca few scattered trigger points,\u201d discomfort of palpation of the right sciatic nerve, a \u201cquestionable positive straight leg raising on the right,\u201d an absent right ankle jerk, and \u201ca sensory deficit in the right SI distribution.\u201d At least some of these, including the absent ankle jerk and the spasm, are obviously objective findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Defendant\u2019s examining physician did not dispute the preexisting condition, although his report notes that since he had not reviewed any of the x-rays, he was unable to determine the grade of spondylolisthesis. He also expressed the opinion that these preexisting conditions are usually asymptomatic and therefore probably not the cause of plaintiffs present complaints, although he did note that these conditions at L5-S1 could cause pain in some people. He found no other objective basis for plaintiffs continuing pain and present disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We think it clear that demonstrable aggravation of a demonstrated pre-existing condition meets the <em>Oswin </em>requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>objective findings to explain the symptomatology from which a plaintiff suffers. <em>Compare Polk v. Daconceicao, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 634 A.2d 135 (App.Div.1993), in which we recognized that principle but concluded that the record there had failed to provide a sufficiently adequate showing of a demonstrable aggravation to survive defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. Here plaintiff\u2019s experts expressed the medical opinion that spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis can be aggravated without appreciable x-ray change. It is, as we understand it, inherent in the original condition itself that a new traumatic involvement of the affected area can trigger symptomatology not previously experienced even without a demonstrable deterioration in the condition itself. It then becomes a question of fact as to whether plaintiffs physical problems are to be attributed to the new trauma to the L5-S1 area because it aggravated the pre-existing condition, resulting in the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In our view, that theory of plaintiffs symptoms meets both the prescription of <em>Oswin </em>and the legislative policy implicit in the verbal threshold legislation. The legislative purpose was to weed out of the judicial system those causes of action arising out of automobile negligence involving injuries that are not serious. It did so by specifying nine categories of injury that meet the verbal threshold, three of which cover serious soft tissue injuries. The point of the categorization is to define those injuries that are sufficiently serious to warrant an action for non-economie damages in the courts. As Justice Clifford explained in <em>Oswin, supra, </em>at 318, 609 A.2d 415, plaintiff, particularly where soft tissue injuries are involved, \u201cmust show a nexus between the injury and the disability.\u201d The nexus is ordinarily proved by \u201cobjective evidence of injury and disability that fit the statutory definition of \u2018serious injury\u2019....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318-319, 609 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">As we understand the principles of <em>Oswin </em>as applied to this situation, objective evidence of a pre-existing condition will suffice to meet the objective evidence test provided that as a matter of medical opinion, aggravation of the original condition by the new trauma has actually produced the disability now complained of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>provided further that the pre-existing condition, by its nature, has the capacity to have produced the disability without further objective deterioration. If those qualifications are medically supported, then the requisite nexus between injury and disability will have been proved and the desideratum of an objectively-based medical opinion that the disability is fairly attributable to the injury suffered in the accident will have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We do not, of course, intend to suggest that plaintiff must prevail. She is, however, clearly entitled to put her proofs, including her medical proofs, before the jury just as defendant is entitled to the opportunity to counter those proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The summary judgment dismissing the complaint is reversed and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
