The bullet was fired from within an automobile as it drove past a crowd, which included Lindstrom, attending an outdoor party. At oral argument, each party conceded that the firing of the weapon was an intentional criminal act and that the perpetrator was apprehended and successfully prosecuted. Kurt Lindstrom now appeals from a judgment denying him personal injury protection benefits under an automobile insurance policy issued by defendant Hanover Insurance Company. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4 defines eligibility for personal injury protection (PIP) benefits. It provides for benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any land, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, <em>or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, </em>to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with the permission of the named insured, and to pedestrians, sustaining bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>injury caused by the named insured\u2019s automobile or struck by an object propelled by or from such automobile. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">As an insured under defendant\u2019s policy, Lindstrom was a covered pedestrian. Thus, he is entitled to benefits if his gunshot injuries were \u201ccaused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile,\u201d within the meaning of the PIP statute. The trial court ruled that the nexus between the injury and the automobile was insufficient to bring the loss within PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">We have addressed the application of PIP coverage to injuries caused by criminal acts in several cases arising before and after the 1983 amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>89:6A-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In <em>Morgan v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>638, 577 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 122 N.J. </em>370, 585 A.2d 377 (1990), decedent\u2019s husband shot her to death as she sat in the driver\u2019s seat of her car. We affirmed the denial of PIP <em>coverage </em>because we concluded \u201cthat there was no legal nexus between the shooting and the kind of risk\u201d covered by an automobile policy. <em>Id. </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 641, 577 A.2d 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Similarly, <em>Vasil v. Zullo, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 570 A.2d 464 (App.Div.1990), involved the stabbing death of a passenger who had left the automobile in which he was riding to confront the occupants of another vehicle regarding a traffic dispute. We affirmed the denial of PIP benefits and uninsured motorist coverage. We concluded that the \u201cstabbing did not occur while he was \u2018occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, non-pedestrian PIP coverage did not apply. We also concluded that pedestrian coverage was not applicable because the injury was not caused by an automobile. We further observed that there was no evidence that decedent was killed by an object propelled from an automobile. <em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 570 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">We also denied PIP coverage to the plaintiff in <em>Uzcatequi-Gaymon v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>71, 472 A.2d 163 (App.Div.1984). Plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was shot and killed during an attempted robbery of his car keys and car. At the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>shooting, decedent was in a phone booth with his ear keys in his hand and his ear parked nearby. We ruled that \u201cwhile theft of the automobile may have been the ultimate object of the attack, from a legal viewpoint the automobile was not the cause of decedent\u2019s injuries and death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 472 A.2d 163. We observed that the automobile \u201cwas merely an attending circumstance.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In <em>Sciascia v. American Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 443 A.2d 1118 (Law Div.1982), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 459 A.2d 1198 (App.Div.1983), Judge Stein, sitting in the Law Division, denied uninsured motorist benefits for a death arising out of a drive-by shooting, ruling that \u201c[tjhere was no substantial connection between the insured\u2019s death and the use of the uninsured automobile\u201d by the perpetrators. <em>Id. </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 359, 443 A.2d 1118. Judge Stein stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">More specifically, this unfortunate occurrence, although unforeseen and unexpected by decedent insured, was not one which, in the contemplation of the parties to the UM contract, was a natural and probable incident or consequence of the use of an automobile by an uninsured motorist. It was not a risk against which the insurer and the insured might reasonably expect that protection would be afforded under a policy providing uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>See also Cerullo v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>372, 565 A.2d 1125 (App.Div.1989) (uninsured motorist benefits not available for injuries resulting from an assault on insured by another motorist).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u201cCentral\u201d to the coverage issue in this case \u201cis the concept that the act that causes the injury, although not foreseen or expected, nevertheless be, in the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract, a \u2018natural or reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the automobile, and thus a risk against which they might reasonably expect those insured under the policy would be protected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smaul v. Irvington General Hosp., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>474, 478, 530 A.2d 1251 (1987) (quoting <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 38, 312 A.2d 664 (App. Div.1973), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152, 319 A.2d 732 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The plaintiff in <em>Smaul </em>was injured when he stopped his automobile to ask for directions. While seated in the vehicle, two men approached him. The men dragged Smaul out of his car, stole his cash and tried to take the vehicle. When Smaul resisted, one of the assailants cut Smaul with a knife and broke his ring finger. <em>Id. </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 475-76, 530 A.2d 1251. In affirming this court\u2019s determination that Smaul was entitled to PIP benefits, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Although the fact that Smaul stopped for directions and remained seated in his ear, hence directly involving the use of his automobile, serves to distinguish this ease from <em>Uzcatequi-Gaymon, </em>we need not rest on that feature alone to find liability for PIP benefits in this case. Here there was direct involvement of the automobile in the accident: plaintiff sought directions so that he could drive his car to his destination, he was sitting in his car when the assault occurred, and a purpose of the assailants\u2014not emphasized by either court below but acknowledged in Allstate\u2019s Statement of Facts\u2014was to steal the ear after yanking plaintiff out of the driver\u2019s seat. The effort to take the automobile removes, for us, any doubt about this case falling within the statutory requirement of an \u201caccident involving an automobile.\u201d Surely the automobile was not merely coincidental to the critical events or a mere \u201cattending circumstance\u201d: its role was central to the incident. We see no reason rooted in either public policy or statutory interpretation why the fact that a criminal act was involved in the accident should deprive this plaintiff of PIP benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 478-79, 530 A.2d 1251.]</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\"><em>Smaul </em>is distinguishable from the present case. <em>Smaul </em>did not involve pedestrian coverage. The PIP coverage at issue was that of the named insured under statutory language which preceded the 1983 amendments. In <em>Smaul, </em>plaintiff was covered for injuries resulting from \u201can accident involving an automobile.\u201d <em>L. </em>1972, c. 203, \u00a7 4; <em>Smaul, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 476, 530 A.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">In the present case, pedestrian <em>coverage </em>is at issue and coverage applies if plaintiff sustained injuries \u201ccaused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. Lindstrom\u2019s injury was not caused by an automobile, and it was not caused by an object propelled <em>by </em>an automobile. The contention that the bullet was propelled <em>from </em>the automobile has a surface appeal, but it is a flawed contention. The flaw is the fact that the offending instrument was a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>from which the bullet was propelled. That central fact attenuates the connection' between the automobile and the injury. The gunman could just as well have been on foot, or on a motorcycle or a bicycle. Thus, unlike <em>Smaul, </em>the automobile\u2019s role was not \u201ccentral to the incident.\u201d <em>Smaul, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 478, 530 A.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Moreover, we are persuaded that coverage for a deliberate shooting of a pedestrian was not \u201cin the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Ibid. We </em>are also persuaded that the Legislature did not intend to burden payees of automobile insurance premiums with the costs of criminal acts in the absence of a substantial nexus between the automobile and the criminal act, as occurred in <em>Smaul.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\"> The connection between an attempted auto theft and plaintiffs injuries resulted in PIP coverage in <em>Smaul. </em>We note that a common element of auto insurance policies is indemnity for loss sustained as a result of the theft of a covered auto.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
