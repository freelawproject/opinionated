Defendant, who is a Trenton police officer and the natural father of the child, went to the day care center to see the child and to pay the child\u2019s day care tuition. Defendant apparently was concerned with the child\u2019s well-being because he had heard that plaintiffs boyfriend had been disciplining the child by removing her clothing and beating her. While defendant was either sitting near or talking to the child at the day care center, plaintiff appeared and demanded that defendant leave. According to plaintiff, she told defendant to leave the child alone and let her eat, and defendant responded, \u201cMe leave her alone? Tell R. [plaintiffs boyfriend] to leave her alone because I kick his ass if he pull her pants down and beat her again. And I kick your ass too.\u201d Defendant testified, however, that when plaintiff told him to leave he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave, but you tell R. that if he pull my daughter\u2019s pants down again, I\u2019m going to put my foot up his butt.\u201d He denied making any threatening remarks towards plaintiff, and his testimony was substantially corroborated by his sister, who was present and worked at the day care center.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Approximately two weeks after the incident, plaintiff instituted this action pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:25-28 of the Domestic Violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Act. She complained that defendant had made terroristic threats and had endangered her life, health and well-being by threatening to do bodily harm to her in front of the children at the day care center. She further claimed that defendant had used foul and abusive language and had made harassing phone calls to her. Plaintiff sought a restraint against future acts of domestic violence, future contacts at her residence and place of employment, including phone calls, and future harassing communications to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial court specifically found that defendant did not commit acts of terroristic threats and did not threaten to do bodily harm to plaintiff. The trial court also found that defendant\u2019s telephone calls to plaintiff were not harassing. Equally as important, the trial court did not make any finding that defendant made the complained of statement for the purpose of harassing the victim. Despite these findings, however, the trial court found that defendant had committed an act of domestic violence by harassing plaintiff. The trial court, in part, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">In part, she may have brought it on herself and in part perhaps not, part of the situation. But this was a harassing incident of domestic violence. I do not find that these threats were terroristic threats. I merely find that the mother of your child, Mr. H[J, was harassed at the job. I don\u2019t find the telephone calls to be harassing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">I also didn\u2019t find, I can\u2019t find from these facts, that you threatened to do bodily harm to her. That\u2019s something\u2014I heard both sides. I don\u2019t know where the truth lies. But I do find that even if you just said loudly that you were going to put your foot up his butt, that that is foul and that is abusive language, and it is directed to her. You\u2019re asking her, in effect, to be a conduit or a communicator to R[.], and that\u2019s inappropriate, particularly in front of the children, particularly in a day care center. But it\u2019s inappropriate at any time to her, in the circumstance that you find yourself in with her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Defendant seeks a reversal of the order, contending that the trial court erred in finding that his conduct constituted harassment within the meaning of the Domestic Violence Act. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>N.J.S A </em>2C:25-19 of the Domestic Violence Act defines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">the occurrence of one or more of the following acts inflicted upon a person protected under this act by an adult or an emancipated minor:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:83-4, governing harassment, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">Except as provided in subsection d., a person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">b.

A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if in committing an offense under this section, he acted, at least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward, and with a purpose to intimidate, an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">We are satisfied from our review of the record in light of the explicit language of the Domestic Violence Act and the legislative purpose thereof, as stated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:25-18, that the proofs do not justify a finding that defendant\u2019s conduct in this case constituted domestic violence within the meaning and intendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:33-4. First, the trial court did not make the finding required to find defendant guilty of harassment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4a that defendant made the statement concerning plaintiffs boyfriend\u2019s allegedly inappropriate discipline of his child for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>purpose of harassing plaintiff. The proofs would not support such a finding in any event. Rather, defendant\u2019s evident purpose in making the statement was to dissuade plaintiff\u2019s boyfriend from inflicting further corporal punishment upon his child. Certainly defendant, as the natural father of the child, had a right to express disapproval of plaintiffs boyfriend\u2019s allegedly inappropriate manner of punishing the child. Although defendant might have chosen different words, his conduct did not rise to the level of harassment. Second, the proofs do not establish or even suggest that defendant was engaged in a course of alarming conduct or repeatedly committed any acts with the purpose to alarm or seriously annoy plaintiff in order to be found guilty of harassment under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-4c.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In our view, the proofs were insufficient to warrant a finding that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted harassment and therefore constituted domestic violence within the meaning of the Domestic Violence Act. <em>See E.K. v. G.K, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 570, 575 A.2d 883 (App.Div.1990); <em>Grant v. Wright, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 196, 536 A.2d 319 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>562, 546 A.2d 493 (1988). Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred in finding good cause to believe that plaintiff\u2019s life and health had been and are endangered by defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Accordingly, the final restraining order under review is reversed and the restraints contained therein are dissolved.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\"> The initials have been used to protect the privacy of the parties, especially their child. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-33; <em>Pepe v.
