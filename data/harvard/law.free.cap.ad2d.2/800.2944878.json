Memorandum: In this contested probate proceeding the jury has found that the execution of the purported will was procured by undue influence, fraud or restraint upon the testatrix. Upon motions duly made the Surrogate has made an order setting aside the verdict of the jury on the question of undue influence and directed that a new trial be had upon that question. Upon our review of the evidence we find it wholly insufficient in point of law to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict upon the question of undue influence. Accordingly, there is no question of fact requiring a new trial and the motion to direct a verdict in favor of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>penents should therefore be granted (see <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Fresh Grown Preserve Corp., </em>292 N. Y. 241, 245\u2014246) and the probate of the will directed. All concur. (Cross appeals from an order of Genesee Surrogate\u2019s Court, setting aside the verdict of a jury in favor of contestant as to Question 5, and granting a new trial, in a proceeding for probate of a will.)
