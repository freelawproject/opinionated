Isador Lubin, as Industrial Commissioner, Appellant.</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b944-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AF_p\">In pursuance of subehapter XV of the Social Security Act of the United States (U. S. Code, tit. 42, \u00a7 1361 <em>et seq.), </em>the Secretary of Labor is authorized to enter into an agreement with any State under which the State will provide unemployment insurance benefits to Federal employees and such an agreement was effected in 1954 with the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The Federal statute provides, among other things, that the \u201c findings \u201d of all Federal employing departments or agencies on the \u201creasons for termination of * * * service\u201d of a Federal employee where the findings are made in accordance with \u201c the regulations \u201d prescribed by the Secretary of Labor \u201c shall be final and conclusive\u201d for the purpose of determining rights of Federal employees to unemployment insurance benefits. (U. S. Code, tit. 42, \u00a7 1367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Claimant was employed in the United States Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, as an examiner of permits. On August 12, 1955 he was discharged from service and filed a claim for unemployment insurance. The Industrial Commissioner made initial determinations suspending claimant\u2019s benefits on the ground he had lost his employment because of misconduct, and in the alternative disqualifying him for benefits through a stated period because he had voluntarily left employment without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The claimant requested a hearing on these initial determinations; the unemployment insurance referee, after a hearing in which claimant\u2019s testimony tended to justify his conduct, overruled the initial determinations of the commissioner; and on the latter\u2019s appeal, the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board affirmed the referee\u2019s determination and overruled the commissioner\u2019s determinations and sustained the claimant\u2019s right to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The appeal board\u2019s determination is based on its view that no findings conforming with the Federal statute or the regulations of the Secretary of Labor showing the reasons for the termination of claimant\u2019s Federal employment were before the Industrial Commissioner, the referee or the appeal board. This conclusion seems to us to be consistent with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">When the State Department of Labor sent its form entitled \u201cRequest for Wage and Separation Information\u201d to the Internal Revenue Service the answer to the question in the form \u201c Reason for separation \u201d was given merely in the equivocal word \u201c Removal \u201d. The department then requested the Internal Revenue Service to furnish \u201c all attending circumstances of claimant\u2019s removal \u201d. The Internal Revenue Service sent a copy of a letter which had been sent claimant stating the grounds for his removal. With the copy of this letter was a letter addressed to the State Department of Labor indicating that the removal was then being reviewed by the United States Civil Service Commission and was then undecided and might result in a different determination on claimant\u2019s status in the Federal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">This informal and equivocal information did not conform with the requirements of the Federal statute and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor to show upon the basis of definite findings either misconduct or a voluntary separation by claimant from his employment. Findings which will indicate one way or another the cause of claimant\u2019s separation and which will conform with the requirements of the Federal statute should be readily available and should be before the appeal board or the referee; or adequate ground shown in the record why it is not furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>The determination should be reversed and the claim remitted to the board for further proceedings, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Foster, P. J., Bergan, Coon, Zeller and Gibson, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board reversed and the matter remitted to the board for further proceedings, without costs.
