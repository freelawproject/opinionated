Due to a dispute over the validity of certain absentee ballots in connection with the election of a town supervisor it appears that the Board of Elections of Greene County failed to certify an official canvass or to issue certificates of elections for any town offices in the town of Hunter after the election of <em>1955. No </em>definitive legal proceeding was ever carried through to compel an official canvass or the issuance of election certificates. The time for such action has long since passed, and hence it must be held that the incumbent town officers were holdovers, and vacancies exist which should be filled at the coming election. Both the Republican and Democratic parties have regularly nominated candidates for the town offices involved. Order unanimously affirmed, without costs. Present \u2014 Foster, P. J., Bergan, Coon, Zeller and Gibson, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
