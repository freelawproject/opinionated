E. Converse, or order, the sam of three thousand dollars in specie or bills of then specie paying banks ; and I herein pledge myself to pay this when due, notwithstanding any Act of Congress or Legislature that might excuse me from so doing, either as to time or otherwise, for value received; as witness my hand and seal, this 17th day of October, 1863. \u201cS.

The intestate had the use of them during the war, and for three years after. By that contract that difference, in his favor, was, in the judgment of the intestate, full compensation for him to risk the result of the war \u2014 had it been successful \u2014 then he would have got eight per cent, in the way of interest for five years and his. money back, and the plaintiff prefered to let him have it \u2014 hence the trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-14\">This Court has recognized investments in these <em>bonds. </em>\u2014 Hinton vs. <em>Eenneday, </em>3 S. C., 457, 490 ; <em>'Cureton </em>vs. <em>Watson, 3 </em>S. C., 451.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-15\">Confederate notes were given for the bonds without stint, and such investments were actually sought. It has not been denied but that they were a good consideration \u2014 both emanated from the same authority. The United States and Confederate States were at war. The latter, for the time being, were independent, and had a lawful right to do anything that they deemed necessary to carry on the war and to sustain their people. \u2014 Vattel, 425-7, \u00a7\u00a7 293-5 ; <em>Morgan </em>vs. <em>Keenan, </em>1 S. C., 327. The cases of <em>Texas </em>vs. <em>White </em>and <em>Thorington </em>vs. <em>Smith </em>sustained this view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-16\"><em>Hananer </em>vs. <em>Woodruff </em>decided that <em>a State </em>in rebellion could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>not issue bonds. The <em>State </em>never stood in an independent relation to the United States, and their bonds were issued expressly in aid of the war. Bills issued by the Bank of the State, during the war, are held good for payment of taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-5\">This, we insist, sustains the right of the Confederate States to issue the bonds. But suppose we should be mistaken in this, and that the bonds were illegally issued, does that prove that this contract was in aid of the war, and, therefore, void ? The bonds were in actual being. Neither of these parties issued them, they found them in circulation. It did not aid the war to change them out of the hands of Converse and put them in the hands of Evins; they were in circulation, and were the legitimate subjects of traffic.\u2014 <em>Random </em>vs. <em>Toly, </em>11 How., 398; <em>Naffa </em>vs. <em>Crawford, </em>3 Law Times, 301, and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">The contract was entered into with care and precision, to be paid in specie, and with a pledge to pay, notwithstanding any Act of Congress or Legislature that would excuse him. There was no pretence that both powers should continue to exist; on the contrary, it provides for a treaty of peace or <em>cessation of </em>hostilities\u2014 had it stopped with \u201c treaty of peace,\u201d the argument may have been worth something, but the other contingency was certain to happen, and did happen, and was, we contend, inserted to avoid any contingency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">The paper sued on is sealed and payable in specie. The seal implies a consideration, and the word <em>specie </em>indicates what kind of dollars were <em>meant. </em>\u2014 Bobo vs. <em>Goss, </em>1 S. C., 162; <em>Browson </em>vs. <em>Rhodes, </em>7 Wallace, 229; <em>Briten </em>vs. <em>Marwite, </em>7 Wallace, 258.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b62-8\">Jan. 28, 1874.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AJX\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b62-9\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">The decision in <em>Hananer </em>vs. <em>Woodruff, </em>15 Wallace, 439, is so conclusive of the case before us that our own convictions must yield to its authority. It declares that a consideration formed on Confederate bonds is illegal and void under the Constitution and laws of the United States. On a question involving these, the authority of the Supreme Court is binding, not only on every Court, but on every department of the General Government and the several States. Our duty is to follow its judgment whenever rendered in cases which, in its view, are to be controlled and determined by that instrument, or the laws of Congress made in conformity with it. So holding, we have no alternative but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>grant the motion, as the appeal proceeds upon the same principle which governed the Supreme Court of the United States in the case referred to.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-5\"><em>Wright, </em>A.
