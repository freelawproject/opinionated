Because the said Referee has failed to report, on facts of this case, that the advertisement under which the sale was made was altered after the first insertion of the same, and did not appear three times after such alterations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-10\">And, on the law, on the ground :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-11\">That the said plaintiffs are entitled to recover the said plantation from the defendant, W.

Because said judgment is inconsistent with itself) inconclusive, uncertain, indefinite, and remitted the parties to new law suits to determine its meaning,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-15\">2d. Because, before the confirmation of the report of the Referee in this case, the plat was produced in Court, showing the boundaries of that portion of the tract described in the testimony as that portion given to James B. Richardson : and His Honor Judge Green was requested to recommit the cause to the Referee, in order that the boundaries might be defined to which the respondents might be entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Which request His Honor refused to grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">3d.

Because His Honor held that it was the duty of the Referee to report upon only such facts as he deemed material, and, in this case, the Court regarded it as immaterial whether the advertisement was changed or not,- under which the respondents purchased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">5th. Because the seventh clause of the report of the Referee, confirmed by the Court, is inconsistent with the eighth clause of the said report, and is illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-8\">6th. Because the Referee failed to report upon the absence of the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>in the case under which the land was supposed to be sold, also upon the prior sale to M. S. Moore, trustee ; also, upon the agreement between respondents and appellant, prior to said sale. Wherefore such report should have been recommitted, and should not have been confirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-9\"><em>Moise, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-10\"><em>Blanding, Richardson &amp; Rhame, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b153-11\">March 20, 1874.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ATz\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b153-12\">Weight, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">The ease must be remanded to the Circuit Court. The judgment does not follow the conclusion of fact as found and reported by the Referee. The action was against W. H. B. Richardson and J. B. Richardson, for the recovery of real estate. It was clearly established by the evidence, and so held by the Referee, that the title to a portion of the land set out in the complaint, and sought to be recovered by the respondents, was defined by the proof as lying north of a certain creek, was vested in the said J. B. Richardson, and that he had committed no trespass on any of the land sued for outside of his own boundaries. The Referee, while dismissing the complaint as to the said J. B. Richardson, nevertheless adjudges \u201cthat the plaintiff recover of the said W. H. B. Richardson the possession of the whole plantation and one hundred dollars for the withholding of the same.\u201d The judgment seems to be inconsistent with itself, for while it dismisses the complaint as to J. B. Richardson, it in fact not only establishes the right to his land in respondents, but requires the appellant, W. H. B. Richardson, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>pay to the respondents \u201cone hundred dollars for -withholding the same,\u201d thus compensating them for the withholding of land, to which the report finds they had no title, and which had not been in the possession of the said W. H. B. Richardson. While the error thus charged by the appellant, W. H. B. Richardson, is good ground for his motion, notwithstanding no appeal by the said J. B. Richardson, it may not be out of place to refer to the consequences which would follow from the judgment as it stands. It adjudges to the respondents a recovery of the whole plantation, not excepting the portion to which it is found they have no title. Under -a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>the Sheriff would be bound to put the respondents in possession of the premises, and, also, to turn out all who are in <em>possession.</em>\u2014Ex <em>Parte Black, 2 </em>Bail., 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Thus, although J. B. Richardson was found to be the lawful owner of a portion of the very plantation, he would be liable to be ejected from the possession of his own property, and turned over to new and further litigation to obtain the very right which the judgment in his favor establishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The judgment, as against the said W. H. B. Richardson, is set aside, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-7\"><em>Moses, </em>C. J., and <em>Willard, </em>A.
