E. Jenkins, and south on lands of Benjamin Bailey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">That the deed of conveyance contained a clause of general warranty, in the usual words, and was duly recorded. That the cash portion of the purchase money, to wit, $1,666 i6/ioo&gt; was paid by the 'defendants to the plaintiff, and that, for the credit portion of the purchase money, the defendants executed and delivered to the plaintiff their bond, described in the complaint, and which bond con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tained, as a part of the condition, these words : \u201cThis bond subject to an apportionment, if, on a survey, there proves a deficiency of the land for purchase of which this bond is given.\u201d That on January 1,1873, the defendants were ready to pay the first instalment of their bond, but that the plaintiff had neglected or delayed to have a survey made, although requested so to do by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">That, some time thereafter, <em>Wm. </em>liume, surveyor, made a survey and plat of said lands, and on said plat certified : \u201c Plat of a tract of land known as Martin\u2019s Point, situated on Wadmalaw Island, Charleston County, State of South Carolina, containing 189 acres of highland, and 257 <em>7S/lm </em>acres of marsh land \u2014 total 446 75/ioo acres.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">That, from the survey, there appeared a deficiency of more than one-half of the quantity of land sold and conveyed by the plaintiff to the defendants, and warranted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">The defendants then offered to the plaintiff to deduct one thousand dollars from the whole amount of the purchase money, and estimated, at such, to pay the instalment which should, upon such estimate, appear to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">This offer of defendants, made \u201cin a desire to avoid litigation,\u201d was rejected by plaintiff, and the defendants then prayed that the deficiency in the quantity of the land might be estimated by a jury, and claimed costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">All the facts above narrated were either proved or admitted at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\">The evidence tended to show that there was a wharf, store and steamboat landing at Martin\u2019s Point, which made it a valuable place, and that the rest of the plantation was worth very little, and that the marsh land, especially, was of very little, if any, value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">His Honor Judge Graham charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-12\">\u201c <em>Gentlemen of the Jury </em>\u2014 I shall instruct you to \u2018 hold these parties to the bond and the deed.\u2019 You are to decide this case according to the \u2018bond and the deed.\u2019 The deed conveys twelve hundred acres of land; the bond says \u2018if, upon a survey, there prove to be a deficiency, there shall be an apportionment;\u2019 you are to make that apportionment. If you should conclude to apportion \u2018the land according to the deficiency,\u2019 your problem would be this: If you pay $5,000 for 1,200 acres of land, how much would you pay for 446 ? If that be your calculation, then you must find for the defendants, because they have already overpaid the portion that is due \u2014 they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>have paid $1,666, when the agreement was to pay one-third cash, the balance in one aud two years. Yon cannot find for the defendants so much money, because they have paid their money, and cannot claim it back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">\u201cIn case you conclude that the value of the Bluff is something greater than the rest of the lan^l, you must regulate that according to the testimony, and what was meant by that clause in the bond \u2018 if, upon a survey, there proves to be a deficiency of land, there shall be an apportionment.\u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">Here plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked that the jury be instructed, in making the apportionment, to discriminate between the value of the different lauds. This was refused, and exception taken to such refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">The jury found for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">A motion for a new trial was made and overruled, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-9\"><em>Campbell &amp; Whaley, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-10\"><em>DeSaussure &amp; Son, Miiehell, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b511-11\">Feb. 26, 1875.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Afq\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b511-12\">Willard, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqpD\">This case is distinguishable from the class of cases that have received so much consideration in the Courts of this State on the question of the right of a purchaser to rescind, wholly or in part, the contract of purchase, when there has been a material failure in value, as it regards .the quanity or quality of the property sold, as in the present case the bond for the purchase money of the land sold contained a clause designed to cover the very case made by the defendants. The clause in question is as follows: \u201cthis bond, subject to an apportionment, if, on a survey, there proves a deficiency of the land for purchase of which this bond is given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">It is clear that a Court of Equity could take jurisdiction of the specific enforcement of this contract to the extent of making such apportionment on just and equitable principles. The defendant\u2019s answer was such as to entitle him to claim the interposition of the equitable powers of the Court, where the most complete relief would result from the application of .the principles and rules of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">The question then remains to be considered whether the rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>apportionment submitted by the Court to the jury was conformable to the rules of equity. It clearly was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The contract of sale was for a tract of land of an assumed number of acres, valued at a gross sum. The required number of acres failed. The tract consisted, in part, of land fitted for cultivation, and, in part, of land unfit for that use. The tract was sold as a <em>\u201c </em>plantation,\u201d and, of course, fitness for culture was a chief element of value. The rule of apportionment, as laid down by. the Court, omitted the consideration of the two descriptions of land embraced in this tract. It submitted to the jury a mere arithmetical calculation, based on the number of acres and the price called for by the deed, and required the reduction of the contract price in the ratio of the diminution of quantity, according to actual measurement, without regard to the character of the land as to which the failure had occurred, whether of the class of the most valuable or of the least valuable land.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">No illustration is required to make clear the practical defect of the rule applied by the Court. It certainly is not justified by the terms of the contract which the Court was called upon to enforce. The object and intent of that contract was to conform the sum paid to the actual.value of the property sold, taking for the elements of that value the gross price agreed upon, the \u2022 total quantity of land in acres assumed at the making of the contract, and the relative quantities of the two kinds of land assumed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A new trial should be ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-8\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
