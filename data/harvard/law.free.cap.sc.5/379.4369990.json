Magwood against the South Carolina Railroad Company and the South-western Railroad Bank and H. M. Magwood, for an account of the proceeds of certain stock of the plaintiff, alleged to have been sold without authority. The summons and complaint were afterwards amended, by order of the Court, made on the motion of defendants\u2019 counsel, by making the South Carolina Loan and Trust Company, Branch Sons &amp; Co. and A. J. White <em>&amp; </em>Son, the alleged purchasers of the stock, parties defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">The facts were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">On and for some time previous to the 24th November, 1866, H. M. Magwood held 232 whole shares of the capital stock of the South Carolina Railroad Company and. the South-western Railroad Bank, and 232 shares of the South Carolina Railroad Company, \u201c in trust for the sole and separate use of\u201d Elizabeth C. Magwood, \u201cand not to be subject to the control, the contracts, the debts, or the agreements of any husband of\u201d hers \u2014 she being then of full age and unmarried. The certificates for the stock stood on the books of the bank in the name of \u201c H. M. Magwood, in trust for Elizabeth C. Mag-wood,\u201d and a trust, in the same terms, appeared on the face of each certificate, which also stated that \u201c this stock is not transferable, except at the South-western Railroad Bank in Charleston, by the stockholder in person, or by attorney.\u201d On the day named H. M. Magwood sold to John E. Phillips 137 of the whole and the same number of the half shares, and the transfer was entered on the books of the bank and new certificates issued to Phillips. This sale, it was admitted, was made with the oral consent of the plaintiff, and no claim upon the railroad company and bank was made by this action because of that transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">After the sale above mentioned there remained, in the hands of H. M. Magwood, 95 whole shares of the railroad company and bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and as many half shares of the railroad company, and these were all sold by him without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, at the times, to the parties, and in manner following: On the 4th June, 1869, he sold 60 whole shares to the South Carolina Loan and Trust Company, on the 12th November, of the same year, he sold 35 whole shares to Branch Sons <em>&amp; </em>Co., and on the 3d October, 1870, he sold the 95 half shares to A. J. White <em>&amp; </em>Son. The transfers were made at the bank, through attorneys \u2014 the power in each case being written at the foot of the certificate, and signed \u201c H. M. Magwood, in trust for E. C. Magwood.\u201d At each transfer the original certificate was surrendered to the bank and cancelled, the transfer entered on the books of the bank, and a new certificate issued to the purchasers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">It further appeared that of the proceeds of the sale of 35 whole shares On the 12th November, 1869, $1,203.75 were on the same day applied by the trustee to the payment of a bond of the plaintiff\u2019s, given for the purchase of a house and lot, but there was no evidence that the plaintiff knew of the application or directed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APG\">His Honor held that the South Carolina Railroad Company and the South-western Railroad Bank were liable to the plaintiff, as for a breach of trust, for the proceeds of the sales of the 95 whole shares and 95 half shares of stock, with interest, less the sum paid by the trustee on the plaintiff\u2019s bond, given for the purchase of a house and lot; and after reference to ascertain the amount, a judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the defendants last named, for $5,865.49. He further held that the South Carolina Loan &amp; Trust Company, Branch Sons &amp; Co. and A. J. White &amp; Son were not liable, and dismissed the amended complaint by which they were made parties defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-7\">The South Carolina Railroad Company and the South-western Railroad Bank appealed, on the grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-8\">1. That the Court erred in holding that the <em>cestui que trust </em>is the actual stockholder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-9\">2. That even if the corporation is the trustee for its stockholders, the Court erred iu eliminating H. M. Magwood, and making the corporation the trustee of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">3. That on the facts established by the evidence the corporation could not refuse to transfer the stock, and the Court should have so held.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-11\">4. That the negligence of the plaintiff contributed directly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>breach of trust by Magwood, and estops plaintiff from remedy against any one but H. M. Magwood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">5. That the Court permits the plaintiff to set aside the sale as illegal, and yet retain part of the proceeds of sale, whereas the Court should have held that the acceptance by the plaintiff of part of the proceeds of sale was an acquiescence in the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">6. That the rule requiring transfer on the books of the corporation is for the protection of the corporation only, and does not affect the legal or equitable rights of vendor and vendee ; and when the legal owner of stock requests the transfer of the same, the corporation cannot, in the absence of circumstances exciting suspicion of bad faith, look behind the legal title or adjudicate the equities between the parties, and the Court should have so held.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\">7. That the property in stock is -in the stockholder, not in the corporation, and the latter cannot, by its act, vest or divest the ownership. When it permits a transfer on its \"books from vendor to vendee, it simply recognizes and records the transaction, without affecting the rights of parties or their liabilities to third persons, and the Court should have so ruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\">8. That while it is the duty of the bank to know the legal title, and ascertain the genuineness of the signature of the legal owner, it is the duty of the purchaser to investigate the title to the thing purchased, and if from a trustee, to ascertain the authority of the trustee to sell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">9. That if the sale by the trustee was valid the purchaser was entitled to a transfer, and no responsibility attaches to the corporation. If the sale was illegal, invalid, then no title passed, and the purchaser holds the property affected with the trust and is bound to account to the true owner for its value, or to restore the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-10\">10. That when the Court decided that the sale was illegal, the decree should have been that the purchasers from the trustee restore to the plaintiff the shares of which she had been illegally dispossessed, or account to her for the value thereof; whereas the decree decides that the sale was illegal, yet the title of the purchasers good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-11\">11. That under no circumstances could the decree against the corporat^n be for more than the restoration of the stock, with the dividends accrued thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Porter &amp; Conner, </em>for appellant :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">No <em>mala fides </em>or collusion between bank and trustee is alleged, and the question submitted is whether, on the ease made, the bank is liable for having permitted the transfer of the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">Corporations have been held liable :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">1. Where the power of attorney or assignment was forged, for a corporation is bound to know the signature of its stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">2. Where the corporation issued or transferred spurious stock, because it is estopped from denying its own seal or the acts of its transfer agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">3. Where it transferred stock to itself as purchaser or holder of a lien or interest in the stock to the prejudice of other creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">4. Where the corporation has assumed to decide between conflicting claims who was the legal owner of the stock, and has erred in its decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-11\">Under one or the other of these heads all the cases will, it is believed, be classed. Under the last head comes a large class of cases, <em>e. g., </em>where A. delivers to B. certificate properly endorsed, but before transfer on books of corporation C. attaches the interest of A. by process served on the corporation. If the bank then transfers, it is liable if it errs. But the question involved in that class of cases is not the transfer by corporation, but the fact of ownership. If the bank errs the transfer is not by the true owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-12\">The plaintiff, the <em>eestui que trust, </em>alleges the liability of the bank. If the bank is liable, it must be from breach of contract or breach of duty <em>ex contractu </em>or <em>ex delicto; </em>but\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-13\">I. There is no contract with <em>cestui que trust, </em>and, therefore, no breach. Whatever contract exists is with the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-14\">II. Is there any breach of duty ? What is the duty of the bank? The Act (1836, 19th \u00a7,) says \u201cthe stock shall be assignable and transferable according to such regulations and upon such terms as may be prescribed and fixed by the said bank corporation, or the Directors thereof;\u201d and the scrip says \u201cthis stock is not transferable, except at the bank, by the stockholder in person or by attorney.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-15\">Who is the stockholder ? Who holds the stock ? Clearly not the <em>cestui que trust. </em>She has the beneficial interest, it is true, but she does not hold the stock \u2014 is not the owner of the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-16\">The very interposition of trustee is because she is <em>not </em>to hold the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>How can she be regarded as holder, or owner, or proper party to transfer, when the very object of creating the trustee is to prevent her holding, or owning, or transferring the stock ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">In <em>Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank </em>vs. <em>Wayman &amp; Stockett&gt; </em>5 Gill., 356, the Court held that as the stock stood on the books of the bank in the name of Wayman &amp; Stockett, trusteees for A. Jones, wife of the bank had notice of the trust, that Wayman &amp; Stockett were the legal proprietors of the stock, and that the bank could not allow the title to the stock to pass by a transfer, by any other person than the trustee, without becoming responsible. The bank permitted the transfer to be made by the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and was held responsible therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">So clear is the inability of the <em>cestui que trust </em>to transfer or meddle with the stock, that when the trustee dies or moves away, she cannot even draw the dividends, but must wait until new trustee is appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">The trustee is the stockholder; he holds the stock; the legal title is in him ; he votes.- \u2014 Angel\u00ed on Corp., \u00a7 131.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">He receives the dividends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\">In case of sale, he delivers certificate and makes the order, and to him the purchase money is paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\">In many cases he is the only party the bank can know. Stock is frequently registered \u201cJohn Smith, Trustee,\u201d or \u201cTrustee for A. B.,\u201d initials only being used and merely to distinguish the individual stock of John Smith from that which he holds for another, or as broker or agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-12\">The only safe rule the corporation can adopt is to see that the transfer is made by the legal owner, and that is all the law requires. To go beyond that is to involve the corporation in complexity and depreciate the value of the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-13\">There is no peculiar sanctity about stock. It is property, bought and sold as property, and the same law which governs sales of other property governs sales of stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-14\">The vendor sells, the vendee purchases. The bank can neither give title, nor divest title, nor determine the question of title. The two first appertain to the'parties, the third to the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-15\">But it is said the bank transfers. This is a confusion of terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-16\">The bank does not transfer. It only records the transfer and gives certificates of the fact. The stock is not transferred <em>hy </em>the bank, but <em>at </em>the bank by the stockholder. The title to the stock is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>not in the bank but in the stockholder, and the transfer must necessarily be by the party in whom the title is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">The entry or record of the transfer on the books of the corporation is for the benefit of the corporation and its protection.\u2014 <em>Union Bank </em>vs. <em>Laird, </em>2 Wheat., 390; <em>Black </em>vs. <em>Zacharie, </em>3 How., 513; <em>State Bank </em>vs. <em>Cox, </em>11 Rich.

What more can it require? The title in vendee is complete, and if the bank does not permit transfer when it should, it is liable for all damages accruing.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnY\">The leading question is, whether a corporation is liable to a <em>cestui que trust </em>under a trust of corporate stock declared on its books, where it transfers such stock upon the authority of a trustee without power to alienate or the consent of the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The plaintiff, to maintain her judgment, must show that she has a remedy, either at law or in equity, against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">In equity the corporation is bound to protect the title of a <em>cestui que trust, </em>under a trust of its stock declared upon its books, against the exercise of powers forbidden by or inconsistent with the nature and terms of such trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">It is not necessary here to affirm, as a general proposition, that, from the very nature of the legal relation subsisting between a corporation and its stockholder, a trust arises charging the corporation with the responsibilities of a trustee towards the stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">A more limited view of the equities springing from the relations of the parties will be sufficient for the purposes of the present case. The validity of a trust of corporate stock is not and cannot be questioned. To such a trust, when declared on the books of the corporation, such corporation cannot be a stranger, from the nature of the trust itself. The declaration upon its books carries at tl\u00f1N ^ame time the force of notice of the trust and of an acceptance of a certain undefined responsibility connected with it. To define that responsibility recourse must be had to the nature of the legal duties incident to its relation to its stockholders. The legal duty of th^ \u25a0Corporation to assure the title of its stockholder is moulded to conform to the state of relations between the trustee of stock and the <em>cestui que trust. </em>The corporation is not simply the custodian of the technical title of the stockholder, but of the subsistence of what the stock represents for the purpose of beneficial enjoyment by the stockholder. As the duty of the corporation is commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>surate with the right of the stockholder to the full beneficial enjoyment of that which is represented by the stock, it would follow that, where the legal title and the beneficial right to the stock are in different persons, the duty of the corporation would extend to the protection of both. The legal duty of the corporation having thus become moulded to conform to the state of relations between the parties to a trust of stock, it is manifest that the corporation is to be regarded as so far a privy to the trust that any act on its part, tending to defeat the object of trust, will subject it to proceedings undertaken for the administration of the trust. <em>J</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The line of reasoning adopted in <em>Bayard </em>vs. <em>Bank, </em>(52 Penn., 232,) goes beyond that already presented, developing the characteristics of a trust in the general relation of the corporation to its stockholder. If the reasoning in that case is fully supported, it would necessarily substantiate the view already presented, and, on the other hand, if the discussion in that case should be regarded as taking a range wider than that essential to the decision of the case, the conclusion of the Court would still give authoritative support to the views here advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">It is not essential to the views here presented to consider the liabilities of the corporation as of the same nature and extent as those of the trustee. While the trustee is bound to activity in enforcing the powers lodged in him for attaining the object of the trust, the duty of the corporation must be regarded as circumscribed by the nature of its general legal duties springing from its relation to its stockholders: Thus limited, the evil of exacting from the corporation an undue attention to the particulars of the administration of the trust, as commented upon in <em>Hortgo </em>vs. <em>Bank, </em>(3 Ves., 55,) could not arise. Inasmuch as the trust in the present case was^ declared on the books and face of the scrip to th.e extent of naming the <em>cestui que trust, </em>it follows that if the action of the trustee in disposing of the stock was without authority, and tended to defeat the object of the trust, the corporation is liable in equity to the extent of any damage sustained by reason of its co-operation with the/ ytrustee to that end^&gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">It is not contended that the trustee had any express power to alienate the stock. Can a power to that end be implied ? If so, it must be upon the ground that such a power was within the intention of the trust, as a means of obtaining its object. The object of the trust in the present case was limited to a provision against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>contingency that had not arisen at the time the trustee assumed to alienate the stock. The trust was for the benefit of an unmarried female. Its object was that in the event of her marriage the property in question should not be subject to the marital rights of her husband. She remained unmarried to the time of the alienation of the stock. \u25a0 Whatever might be the powers of the trustee in the event of the contingency on which the whole life and force of the trust depended, it is clear that while the <em>cestui que trust </em>remained unmarried, <em>sui juris, </em>the trustee had no duty to perform to which power to alienate was essential, and, therefore, there is no ground to imply a power to sell and transfer the stock. Unless the defendants assumed the existence of consent on the part of the <em>cestui que trust </em>to the disposition of the stock they could regard the transaction in no other light than as an assumption by the trustee of a right of control that he did not possess, nor had they the right to assume the consent of the <em>cestui que trust </em>without clear evidence of the fact of such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It must, therefore, be concluded that the defendants are liable for the transfer of the stock, it appearing that such transfer occasioned the loss of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The conclusion of the Circuit Judge, that the purchasers of stock were not necessary parties, would seem to follow from the view already taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">If the only ground in equity for the plaintiff\u2019s action against the defendants was their complicity in a breach of trust, as strangers to the trust, it might well be that the purchasers should be made parties with the defendants, as they, with the trustee and the corporation, without whose assistance the breach of trust could not be made effectual, would have to be regarded as privies, as it regards such breach of, trust. Here, however, the plaintiff stands upon equities of a different nature, to which the purchasers are strangers, and she is not bound to make them parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The Circuit decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-9\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
