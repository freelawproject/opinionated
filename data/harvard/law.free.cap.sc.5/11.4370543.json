Keller obtained judgment, and on the next day entered execution thereon in the office of the Sheriff of Orangeburg County, against Ann Myers, Levi Myers and Capers Myers. The judgment was for $5,436.60, on a bond given in 1863. On the 10th day of the same month and year' the Sheriff levied, under the execution, upon two separate tracts of land as the property of Levi Myers, one containing 205 acres and the other 103 acres. Levi Myers claimed his homestead, and appraisers were appointed to assign and set it off, who, on the 22d day of February, 1872, did assign and set off as his homestead the tract containing 205 acres, valued at $500. The tract of 103 acres was not appurtenant to the dwelling house and outbuildings of Levi Myers, but was entirely separate therefrom, and on the 1st day of April, 1872, the Sheriff sold this tract for $350. He also sold, at the same time, the remainder in the homestead tract for $55. The net proceeds of both sales amounted to $389.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-12\">Levi Myers claimed the sum in the Sheriff\u2019s hands on the ground that he was entitled to it under the Act \u201c to reduce all Acts and parts of Acts to determine and perpetuate the homestead into one Act, and to amend the same,\u201d approved March 13th, 1872, and this was a rule upon the Sheriff to compel him to apply the money to the execution of Keller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The decision of His Honor the Circuit Judge is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-5\">Graham, J. This was a motion made by the plaintiff for an order to direct the Sheriff of Orangeburg to pay over to the plaintiff the sum of three hundred and eighty-nine (389) dollars, which are in his hands, under the following state of facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-6\">An execution was lodged in the case the 9th of February, 1872; levy was made on the 10th (the day on which the General Statutes were enacted,) upon two tracts, one containing 205 acres, and the other 103. On the 22d of February the 205 acre tract was set off to the defendant, Levi Myers, one of the defendants in the cause, valued at $500. On the 13th of March, 1872, the Act to consolidate the homestead law was approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-7\">On the 1st of April, 1872, the 103 acre tract of Levi Myers was sold for $350, and the remainder in homestead in the 205 acre tract for $55, making $405. The affidavit of the Sheriff's deputy shows that the costs of sale reduces the amount to $389.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-8\">The defendant, Levi Myers, claims that sum as an addition to the homestead, under the Act of 13th March, 1872, and the plaintiff claims it by his motion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-9\">1. Because he says the Act of 13th March is unconstitutional in this particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-10\">2.

In order to authorize the Sheriff to pay the defendant, Levi Myers, the proceeds of sale in his hands, it is necessary to decide that the homestead of Levi Myers was assigned under Section 1 of the Act of March 13, which is not the fact; or to decide that Section 3 of said Act divests a vested right, a construction which can only be supported in rare instances, when the words of the statute leave it beyond doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-12\">5. <em>Gunn </em>vs. <em>Barry, </em>U.

That the 3d Section of said Act is applicable to the case made in the statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-10\">I. The appellee contends that the ruling below on the constitutional question is right\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-11\">1. That the 1st Section of third Article of the Constitution gives <em>all </em>the legislative power of the State to the General Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-12\">2. That under this wide grant the General Assembly has no limit as to the enactment of homestead laws, save as it is restricted by the 32d Section of Article II.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-13\">3. That the restrictions of that Section are five only, to wit : 1. That the value of land assigned shall not exceed $1,000. 2. That of the personalty $500. 3. That the exemption shall not avail against the purchase money, nor the money expended in improvements. 4. Nor to taxes. 5. Nor to the yearly proceeds, so far as the debts were incurred in the production thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-14\">4. That the 3d Section of A. A. 1872 does not violate any of these restrictions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-15\">II.- And the provisions of the 3d Section of the A. A. 13th March, applied to the sale made in April, 1872\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-16\">1. The 1st Section of that Act only continues of force the same Section of the Acts of 1868, and of the 10th February, 1872, and the 3d Section is as if it was written : \u201c That if the homestead <em>hitherto provided </em>\u201d shall not amount to the value of $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-17\">2. When the sale took place, and the Sheriff received the money, it was subject to the operation of this Act, by which he was bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>to pay it to the person claiming the homestead, <em>in preference to all other </em>claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">3. It was a <em>constitutional </em>enactment that the homestead, whenever the land was of sufficient value, should only be limited by the first constitutional restriction ; and it came in time to affect this case, notwithstanding the levy and set-off of homestead were made prior to the Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">4. Was the fact that the homestead had already been set off any better reason why the Legislature could not make this subsequent provision than that a judgment entered up, long before the war and the adoption of the Constitution, is no bar to a claim of homestead ? The judgment creditor\u2019s lien on the property, over and above what had been set off, was of no greater force than it had been before. If the Legislature had the power and the intention to grant a homestead against the vested rights of a judgment creditor, (and this Court has so decided,) why should they not have the power and intention of taking the money arising from the sale of land, on which he had no higher claim than he originally had on the whole of the land ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">5. That the Legislature intend that the homestead in land shall only be restricted by the constitutional limit is evident from the last Act, for while it leaves of force the 3d Section of the A. A. 13th March, (for it is neither inconsistent with, nor. supplied by it,) it provides, in every case of excess of value and a sale, that $1,000 shall be applied to the p'urchase of a homestead, without reference to the size of the family or leaving it to appraisers to fix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">For these reasons the appellee submits that the appeal should be dismissed.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b23-9\">Jan. 7, 1874.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AAl\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b23-10\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATS\">Joseph A. ICeller, the appellant, on the eighth February, 1872, obtained in the Circuit Court for Orangeburg County a judgment against Levi Myers and others, which was duly entered on the same day, and, on the next, execution thereon was lodged in the Sheriff\u2019s office, on which, on the tenth, a levy was made of two several tracts of land \u2014 -the one containing two hundred and five acres (more or less), and the other one hundred and three acres (more or less), as the property of the said Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">Proceedings under the Homestead Act were instituted by Myers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and on the 23d of February, 1872, the appraisers, duly appointed for the purpose, assigned and set off to him as a homestead the tract containing two hundred and five acres, valued at $500. The other tract, not appurtenant to the dwelling house aud out-buildings, but entirely separate therefrom, was sold by the Sheriff, under the said levy, on 1st of April, 1872, for the sum of $350, and the remainder in the homestead tract for $55. Myers claiming the said proceeds under the Ac't of the General Assembly \u201cto reduce all Acts and parts of Acts to determine and perpetuate the homestead into one Act, and to amend the same,\u201d approved March 13, 1872, (15 Stat., 229), Keller, the appellant, sought, by proceedings below, to have the money in the hands of the Sheriff applied in satisfaction of his judgment; the Circuit Judge refusing, he asks, by appeal to this Court, to reverse his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">When Myers claimed his homestead it was by virtue of the provision of the Constitution and the Act of 1868 \u201cto determine and pepetuate the homestead,\u201d (14 Stat., <em>19). He </em>acquired no further nor more extended rights in regard to it than were thereunder given, and if any succeeding Legislature in any manner changed or varied the laws in respect to the homestead privilege, either by increasing or diminishing its extent, his rights, as established and confirmed, could not be thereby affected. His claim of homestead had been administered; there was nothing further to be adjudicated, and subsequent change in the law could not operate on a transaction which had been consummated through judicial proceedings.\u2014See <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Miller, </em>13 How., 293; <em>Frierson </em>vs. Westb<em>erry, </em>11 Rich., 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">It seems to have been the express intention of the Act of March 13, 1872, to extend the provisions, under its third Section, only to cases of homestead assigned under it. Its language admits of no other conclusion, and Myers having already accepted the 205 acres of land as his homestead under the Act of 1868, although it was assessed at only five hundred dollars, has no right to any further extension under the Act of March, 1872, for, by its own avowal, the benefit which he now seeks applies only to assignments of homestead through the force of its first Section.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">In the consideration of the case below it would seem that the Constitution and the Act of 1868 were construed as securing a right of homestead in real estate to the full value of one thousand dollars. A reference to both will, however, show that it is not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>exceed that value, and, in the view of the Constitution, \u201c is to consist of dwelling house, outbuildings and lands appurtenant.\u201d The Act of 1868 declares that when the homestead is set off <em>\u201c </em>no further proceedings shall be had against it, but the residue of the lands and tenements of the head of the family, if any more or other he shall have, shall be liable to levy, attachment and sale.\u201d The third Section of the Act of March, 1872, only makes further provision where the real estate assigned as a homestead under it was in value less than one thousand dollars, and, in that event, the difference was. to be paid to the claimant, out of sales of any other land, in preference to the creditor. How far it may involve a constitutional objection, by including in the homestead exemption lands other than \u201cthe dwelling house, outbuildings and lands appurtenant,\u201d it is not necessary for us now to consider or determine. Por the other reasons expressed we hold the judgment of the Circuit Court erroneous, and the motion'to reverse it is granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b25-5\"><em>Wright, </em>A.
