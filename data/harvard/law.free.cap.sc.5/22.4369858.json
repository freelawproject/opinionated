The plaintiffs paid the amounts charged under protest, and brought this action to recover back the excess, if any, over and above such amounts as the defendants were entitled to charge by the provisions of their charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-13\">By the terms of the charter the defendants were entitled to charge \u201c for the transportation of goods by weight, not exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>fifty cents per one hundred pounds per one hundred miles,\u201d and the question was whether the defendants, as they contended, had the right to charge 50 cents per 100 pounds for any distance less than 100 miles, or whether, as plaintiffs contended, the rate should be in proportion to the actual distance, but not to exceed 50 cents per 100 pounds per 100 miles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">The case was tried by the Judge without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">His Honor sustained the construction of the charter contended for by the plaintiffs, and referred it to a Referee to ascertain the amounts paid by plaintiffs in excess of the amounts the defendants were entitled to charge according to his construction of the charter. The Referee reported the amount due to plaintiffs, inclusive of costs, at $955.71, and the report having been confirmed, judgment was entered thereon for plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-7\">The defendants appealed on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-8\">I. Because, it is' respectfully submitted, that His Honor erred in deciding that \u201c the statutes prescribe a rate of freight to which defendants are limited per hundred pounds per hundred miles, (fifty cents,) and at the same rate for any greater or less distance,\u201d when, in fact, such restriction was only imposed by the original charter, which has been repealed in this behalf, and <em>appears </em>in none of the amendments thereof. \u2014 8 Stat., 380, 384, 484.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-9\">II. Because His Honor erred in deciding that the charge of fifty cents per hundred pounds per hundred miles \u201c applies to distances under 100 miles, as was explicitly enacted in the original charter, (8 Stat. 354,) above recited,\u201d which is \u201c nowhere explicitly repealed in that particular,\u201d since the A. A. 1828, Sec. 11, (8 Stat., 360,) establishes a different tariff of charges, and expressly repeals the original charter in this behalf, \u201c so far as the provisions thereof are in anywise repugnant to this Act.\u201d' \u2014 Sec. 20, 363.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-10\">III. Because, therefore, His Honor erred in deciding that the original charter is still of force, as to the <em>pro rata </em>charges established thereby.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-11\"><em>Shannon, </em>for appellants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-12\">His Honor the Circuit Judge finds, as matter of law, \u201c that the statutes prescribe a rate of freight per hundred pounds per hundred miles, and at the same rate for any greater or less distance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Having before found the fact that the appellants had exceeded these rates in their dealings with respondents, and that respondents had paid those charges under protest, his natural conclusion was the further finding that the amount in excess so paid should be refunded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">Is it true that the statutes prescribe such a rate of freight? His Honor admits that the question \u201cis not free from difficulty,\u201d but proceeds, thereupon, to solve it by two propositions, neither of which, it is respectfully submitted, are tenable. He says \u201c the reason of the thing would seem to apply to distances under one hundred miles.\u201d I entirely dissent; all the difference exists in full force \u2014 universally recognized \u2014 between wholesale and retail business. The original charter (A. A. 1827, 8 Stat., 354) was a hurried, short and imperfect statute, so much so that in forty days the same Legislature substituted another Act (8 Stat., 360) for this Act \u2014 repeals everything in the prior Act repugnant to this Act. The freight clause is re-enacted almost <em>totidem verbis </em>\u2014 markedly omitting the words \u201cand at the above fate for any greater or less distance.\u201d Now, in the construction of this clause, it is important to remember that the same Legislature passed both Acts ; that they meant to express something, when they used these words, and, when they were re-enacting the same clause, meant to withdraw that expression when they omitted them ; and they make that more clear when they declared the repeal of the first mentioned statute. And for what reason ? Because, in the hurried preparation of the original charter, the mind of the Legislature was directed to the towns of Hamburg, Columbia and Camden, the three termini, then the three important towns of the interior of the State, at the head of navigation, respectively, of the Savannah, Congaree and Wateree, and distant from Charleston 135, 125 and 140 miles, and not expecting the important increase of way-side towns and way-side freights. When reflection suggests these things, the restriction is omitted, and is never again repeated in all the subsequent changes of freight charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">Kingsville was then, and for many years, a wilderness. It could not be anticipated that a railroad from Baltimore would pour its freights out there, and demand of these appellants that they should load and run cars at an enormous expense, to carry freight at a loss to the company, for the benefit of cities and railroad corporations out of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Is there no reason that the rate of charges should be higher for expense of loading and unloading cars, getting up steam, and the countless items of expense, which are but little increased by a little additional distance?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">But, however unreasonable it might be to say so, if these appellants live, move and have their being under the original charter, (8 Stat., 354,) which says \u201c at the same rates for any greater or less distance,\u201d reason would be silent, for the law would compel obedience.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">It is recognized in English law that, under their statutes which limit tonnage for railway trains <em>pro rata, </em>according to distance, the company may still charge something reasonable, in addition, for loading and unloading goods, when they perform that service. <em>{Parker </em>vs. <em>Western Railroad, </em>note 151, Red. on Rail., Yol. 2, p. 70.) It is universal with railroad companies to charge higher rates for shorter distances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">It was proved at the trial that the schedule of through rates conformed to the statutory requirements, and that the way rates were published by the appellants, and it is evident that respondents were informed of them, for they were protesting against them all the while.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">Even now a railroad, running to this capital, advertises to carry cord-wood at $3 for the first ten (10) miles, and 25 cents for every additional ten miles. The respondents could have carried their goods and wares to and from Baltimore <em>via. </em>Charleston as cheaply and expeditiously for themselves, and with convenience to appellants ; but they unreasonably demand that appellants shall load and unload for them at Kingsville, and receive an insignificant portion of compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\">His Honor holds that the provision prescribing the same rates of freight \u201c for any greater or less distance \u201d is \u201c nowhere explicitly repealed in that particular.\u201d The \u201c <em>difficulty,\u201d </em>just alluded to, does not seem to be avoided ; why all these qualifying words accompanying a negation of repeal ? If repealed at all, it answers our purpose, whether done generally or particularly. It is certain that \u201c an Act to amend \u201d the Act of December, 1827, (8 Stat., 354,) was passed on the 30th January, 1828 ; that in Section 11, (8 Stat., 360,) the charges allowed were re-enacted, and the restricting words omitted, and in Section 20 (8 Stat., 363,) the former Act was repealed, so far as repugnant, and such words of restriction are never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>again introduced in any of the changes of freight tariffs, (8 Stat., 380, 384, 484.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-5\">Section 11, 8 Stat., 360, the additional charge for loading, storage, &amp;c., is recognized clearly and explicitly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-6\"><em>Rion, </em>for appellants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-7\">The points involved in the appeal are of great importance to many of the railroads in the State, so much so that it is thought by many that an adverse decision on one of the points raised would cause the local business of railroads to become a <em>heavy expense </em>instead of a revenue to them. As the Charlotte, Columbia &amp; Augusta Railroad Company is one of the corporations especially affected, their interest constitutes the motive of my participation in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-8\">I.I would suggest to the Court that the construction of the Section of the charter ought to be made in the light of the usage of the commercial world, and of the carrying business that obtained at the time of its enactment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-9\">In this case the Court has not this light.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-10\">To explain my meaning, and to illustrate the importance of the suggestion, I would state that at the trial of another case, involving precisely the same issues as this, certain issues of fact were submitted, and the following were the findings, based on the testimony of witnesses, one of whom had been engaged in the carrying trade for some thirty years in different parts of the world, another for some twenty years in the United States, and a third had been President of railroads for years. I call attention especially to the 12th and 13th findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-11\">1. \u201cThat a cotton bale is an article easily capable of being measured in cubic feet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-12\">2. \u201c That eighteen bales of cotton, averaging 417 pounds_, were measured at the Chester depot, in April, 1871, and averaged 29 2-10 cubic feet measurement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-13\">3. \u201c That the cotton shipped at Chester, of the crop of 1870, would average at least 27 cubic feet measurement, certainly over 24 cubic feet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-14\">4. \u201c That cotton is not safely transported, on railroads, except in box cars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>5. \u201cThat a box car will only contain from 26 to 28 bales, which, at an average of 433J pounds, would weigh from 11,267 to 12,133 pounds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">6. \u201c That the weight capacity of a box car is, 16,000 pounds; and 18,000 pounds not an unusual load.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">7. \u201cThat cotton not in \u2018compressed bales' is, by commercial usages, regarded rather as an article of bulky freight than heavy freight.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-7\">8. \u201c That the usage of the Charlotte, Columbia &amp; Augusta Railroad, and of connecting railroads and steamer lines, is to charge on all freights, with a few exceptions, (such as lumber, livestock, brick, coal, tan bark, wheeled vehicles, \u00e1nd a few other articles,) by weight, but assigning different articles to different classes, for which different rates are charged, according to the bulk or measurement of said articles; and this classification is almost identical on said railroads and steamers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">9. \u201c That the usage last mentioned has virtually obtained before and since the year 1847.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-9\">10. \u201c That this usage obtains -generally throughout the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-10\">11. \u201c That the defendant\u2019s road and its predecessor, the Charlotte &amp; South Carolina Railroad, has always charged on cotton with reference to its bulk or measurement, the practice having been at first, to charge so much per bale, without regard to weight, and afterwards, when it was found that the bales were being increased in weight and bulk, to adopt 425 pounds as the standard weight of a bale, and to charge for excess of weight proportionally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-12\">12. \u201c That the cost in transporting freight is <em>not in proportion to the distance, </em>but dep ends chiefly upon the receiving, storage, loading and unloading, provision of adequate motive power, rolling stock, train hands, depot agents, laborers, clerical force, and blanks and books, which are <em>nearly as great for distances under a hundred miles as for a hundred miles; </em>the commercial usage being for connecting roads to allow for the transfers of freight the compensation of from <em>forty to sixty miles </em>transportation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-13\">13. \u201c That the cost of transportation by the Charlotte, Columbia &amp; Augusta Railroad from Chesterville to Charlotte, N. C., a distance of 45 miles, is <em>not much less </em>than the cost of transporting the same article from Columbia to Charlotte, a distance of 110 miles.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>14. \u201c That at the time of the shipment of the cotton, the subject-matter of these actions, one dollar of gold was worth at Chester-ville one dollar and twelve cents paper currency.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-5\">That the Court should have had this light.in the construction of the Statute, <em>vide </em>Sedge wick on- Stat. and Cons.

The Section of the Act presented for construction is as follows, (8 Stats., 36C):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">\u201cAnd be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, That the said South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company shall at all times have the exclusive right of transportation or conveyance of persons, merchandise and produce over the railroad and railroads and canals to be by them constructed, while they see fit to exercise the exclusive right: Provided, That the charge of transportation or conveyance shall not exceed thirty-five cents per hundred pounds on heavy articles, and ten cents per cubic foot on articles of measurement, for every one hundred miles, and five cents per mile for every passenger.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">This Act (p. 363) repeals provisions of former Act \u201c so far as the provisions thereof are <em>in any wise repugnant </em>to this Act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-10\">The former Act provides (8 Stats., 354) :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-11\">\u201c The said company shall, at all times, have the exclusive right of transportation on all the several railroads to be by them constructed : <em>Provided, </em>The charge for the transportation of goods, produce, &amp;c., shall not exceed thirty-five cents per hundred pounds on heavy articles, and ten cents per cubic foot on articles by measurement, for every one hundred miles, and five cents per mile on every passenger, and at the above rates for <em>any greater or less distance.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-12\">The omission of the words \u201cand at the above rates for any greater or less distance,\u201d is clearly significant of the intention of the Legislature to relieve the company from the duty of <em>prorating.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-13\">This omission operates as a <em>repeal </em>of the words <em>omitted. </em>\u2014 Moore vs. <em>Mausert et. al., </em>4 Sickles, (49 N. Y.,) 335 ; 1 Pickering, 45 ; 31 Maine, 34.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-14\">III. The construction contended for by the respondents is not <em>reasonable.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-15\">This would only allow about one-third of a cent for 100 pounds for one mile for transportation, stoppage of car, loading, unloading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>clerical labor, &amp;e., or about 55 cents for a <em>full car </em>load. Many stations are from four to ten miles apart. This construction would become more glaringly unreasonable when the weight would be less than 100 pounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">IV. The words of the Section do not plainly express that a prorating for each mile is required as to freights, while they do as to passengers. <em>Expressio unius est exelusio alterius.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">The reason of the difference is obvious, for the passenger loads and unloads himself, and requires no weighing or listing; and, yet, on many railroads, (as in 11 Stats., 536,) \u201c an extra charge of fifty cents for taking up and putting down each person\u201d is allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">V. If the construction contended for by the respondents be correct, then the Legislature would be guilty of the gross injustice of providing rates for the South Carolina, and some other railroads, that would make their local business a <em>ruinous </em>one, while other railroads are allowed reasonable compensation, and some <em>expressly </em>from <em>four </em>to <em>twenty-five </em>times as much as the South Carolina Rail* road Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">If the Court will look at the Sections in the different Acts providing rates, this will be very striking.

Charges for transportation are called rates, because they are fixed according to certain proportions between quantity and distance. They are charged according to a certain <em>ratio </em>between quantity and distance. That <em>ratio </em>or <em>rate </em>becomes a standard whereby to ascertain the price to be paid for transportation of any given quantity to any given distance \u2014 a rate or proportion required to be observed by the railroad company in ascertaining the amount to be charged for such service in any given case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-10\">This is further evidenced by the consideration that the Act of 1827, the first railroad charter ever granted, laid the foundation of a system, and established for the first time the principle by which railroads should be governed in their charges for freights. That principle necessarily required to be stated in the most exact and plain terms, because it was a new subject, and could not be interpreted by reference to any thing that had preceded it in the legislation or usage of the State. The principle established was, that the charges for freight should be according to a certain proportion or ratio of weight and distance \u2014 a price <em>per centum </em>of pounds, <em>per centum </em>of miles, and it was distinctly declared that the same proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tion should be observed in assessing the price of freight for a greater or less distance. The principle having been thus clearly defined in 1827, in the following year, in an Act amendatory of the former,amplifying and defining the powers and duties of the company, the Legislature re-enacted the clause granting exclusive rights of conveyance, and the <em>proviso </em>limiting the charges for freight, in the same language as before, but omitting the words, <em>\u201cand at the above rates for any greater or less distance.\u201d </em>If the word <em>rate </em>means what we have assumed to be its original and proper signification, (and there is nothing to show that it was used in any other sense,) then the words contained in the former and omitted in the latter were surplusage, and properly omitted, without any purpose of changing the sense of the language employed to define the rate. The language is, \u201cthirty-five cents <em>per </em>hundred pounds for every hundred miles.\u201d If, in the first Act, there had been nothing else, the meaning of the expression might have admitted of argument, but when the Legislature went on to define exactly their meaning by adding the words \u201cat the same rates for any greater or less distance,\u201d they left no room for doubt. In the next year they simply omitted the words last quoted, and repealed the former Act only so far as the same was repugnant to this. Were the words last quoted repugnant to the sentence that preceded them, and which it was their office more distinctly to define? Clearly not. The Legislature, in the first Act, using a new form of expression in relation to a subject, thought it best to add a note, as it were, clearly defining the meaning of the form of expression used. Is it to be held, that in their subsequent use of the same language, in relation to the same subject-matter, they used them in an entirely different sense, because they omitted the note of explanation added in the former instance?

In this there is no repealing clause, and the former statutes stand with this, unless repealed by necessary implication, and none such arises; but, on the contrary, the language employed shows that the Legislature understood that they had established a <em>pro rata </em>system of charges adapted to all distances and all weights, with which they propose to interfere merely by increasing the compensation, leaving the mode of assessing the charges unchanged. A statute can be\u2019 repealed only by an express provision of a subsequent law, or by necessary implication; the two must be so repugnant that they cannot stand together or be consistently reconciled. \u2014 See Brightly\u2019s Dig., Tit.

Without admitting the statement, it is sufficient to say, that if the construction be clear, the Court cannot control it by any considerations of expediency. Moreover, the Legislature furnished the company ample powers to protect itself against the supposed inadequacy of bompensation for loading and unloading, by giving them power in the same Section of the Act of 1828 (8 Stat., 360,) to \u201c charge such just and reasonable terms of compensation for storage and labor as they may by rule establish (which they shall cause to be published,) or as may be fixed by agreement,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-8\">As to the point that the company may have charged cotton by measurement instead of by weight, there is no such point in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>case at all, and the Court cannot assume facts and supply the omission, but it is sufficient to say the company did choose to classify cotton otherwise, and must stand to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">Having established that the amount of freight exacted of him for the services rendered by the company were in excess of the limits imposed by law, and that they were paid under protest, the plaintiff is entitled to the <em>.judgment. </em>\u2014 Kenneth <em>&amp; Gibson </em>vs. <em>8.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgL\">It is conceded that the authority of the appellants to charge as common carriers for the conveyance of merchandise is limited by statute. The limitation stood under the Act of 1828, (8 Stat., 355, Sec. 11,) as follows: <em>\u201cProvided, </em>That the charges of transportation or conveyance shall not exceed thirty-five cents per hundred pounds on heavy articles, and ten cents per cubic foot on articles of measurement, for every hundred miles, and five cents per mile for every passenger.\u201d These provisions were substantially re-enacted in 1835, (8 Stat., 412, Sec. 20,) but were modified in 1838, (8 Stat., 484, See. 1,) as follows: \u201c That the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company be, and they are hereby, authorized to charge for the transportation of passengers at a rate not exceeding seven and one-half (7i) cents per mile, and for the transportation of goods, by weight, not exceeding fifty cents per hundred pounds per hundred miles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The appellants claim that these provisions authorize them to charge the rate fixed by law for one hundred miles for any distance less than one hundred miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The Circuit Court held the contrary, placing its decision on the ground that the statute intended that the rate should be applied to the actual number of miles of carriage, a portion of one hundred miles entitling them to a corresponding portion of the statute allowance. The force of the appellants\u2019 argument rests on the idea that the design of the statute was to fix a fair price for the carriage of goods and passengers. If such was the intent of the statute there would be some force in their argument as to the inequality of applying the same rate of charge to short distances that is applicable to long, for it is evident that whatever may be the distance carried, the cost of shipment and discharge must be deducted from the sum chargeable for carriage, before the actual compensation for carriage can be ascertained, and as the cost of shipment and discharge may be assumed to be the same for all distances, the net result shows a less amount per mile for short distances than for long, and a consequent diminution of profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">But, evidently' it was not the intent of the statute to fix the charge for <em>carriage </em>as between the carrier and shipper, but merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>to prescribe a limit beyond which the carrier should not go in making a contract of carriage. There is nothing in the statute in question to distinguish it from a large class of statutes limiting the amount chargeable by persons exercising callings subject to legislative regulations, and the policy of such statutes is to prevent excessive charges, but to leave the actual sums charged to be affected within the prescribed limits by the economic rule of supply and demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">It must be assumed that the Legislature took into consideration, in fixing the limit of charge, all that properly appertains to the nature of such an inquiry. It must, therefore, be assumed that they fixed the rate in question in full view of, and with full allowance for, the fact that exigences would arise, either as affecting the carrier peculiarly or the community at large, rendering it necessary and proper that charges should be made at such times in excess of what would be reasonable in ordinary times, and the further fact that cases would arise where the carrier would not make his calculated profit, but might realize a loss, owing to the small quantity of freight carried, the shortness of the carriage, or some other unfavorable circumstances. In a word, it must be assumed that the rate fixed was considered, at the adoption of the statute, as in excess of the rate that under ordinary circumstances should be paid for such services. If it could be shown that since the adoption of the statute the cost of carrying merchandise had increased, that fact would not affect the construction of the statute, but would be a matter for legislative consideration solely.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">It is evident, therefore, that, in construing the statute, in any case that may arise under it, we need not consider whether its operation iu the given case works favorably or unfavorably for the parties concerned, but we must assume the rule to be arbitrary, and confine our inquiries to the question whether it has been violated in respect of the terms in which it is laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">What we have to consider in the present case is, what is the unit to which the statute intended the rate should be applied ? . Is it, in the case of freight, the mile, or the one hundred miles ? In the case of passengers, the mile is made the unit by the terms of the statute. Was there, then, a different intention as it regards merchandise. It is true that the rate as to merchandise is fixed relatively to one hundred miles, but it does not necessarily follow that one hundred miles is to be regarded as the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The natural and ordinary conclusion from the terms, apart from any particular intent that would control such conclusion, would be that the mile was intended as the unit. We are accustomed to refer in all matters involving transportation, whether of passengers or merchandise, to the mile as the unit or standard of measure. It is both a legal standard and convenient in a commercial point of view. A rate per mile is intelligible and convenient, and at once suggests the result of carrying for a greater distance. Fractions of a mile are of so little importance that they do not give rise to controversies. On the other hand, making one hundred miles the unit at once makes the questions arising out of fractions of that distance of sufficient pecuniary importance to give rise to legal questions, as illustrated by the present case. The object of a rate, in such cases, is to proportion charges according to distance. As the distance between any two of the <em>termini </em>of the defendants\u2019 road is less than two hundred miles, the assumed unit will only enter once into any of those distances, having a variable fraction. It so happens, on that assumption, that there are. but two possible charges on one hundred pounds of merchandise, on that road, for any distance carried, namely, fifty cents and one dollar. If one hundred miles, or a less distance, is traversed, it is fifty cents; if that distance is exceeded, it is one dollar, and cannot exceed that sum. Now, when it is considered that the defendants\u2019 road connects cities, villages and stations varying in distance from each other from a few rSiles to upwards of a hundred, it is obvious that, if the intention of the statute was to proportion charges for carriage according to the distance carried, that object is wholly defeated by a construction that adopts one hundred miles as the unit to which to apply the rates. On the other hand, assuming a mile to be the unit, the object of the statute is completely attained, and the charge of the defendants is measured by the distance carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The reference to one hundred miles may be readily accounted for without assuming that that distance was intended as the unit to which the rate was to be applied. If the rate for merchandise, of one hundred pounds weight, had been stated in terms of one mile instead of one hundred miles, it would have amounted to a fraction of a cent, and in a form far less convenient for readily computing the cost of carriage. The statute, in this respect, follows a very common method suggested by commercial convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">That such was the sense intended is evident from the mode in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>which the rate as to quantity is stated. It would not be contended that because a rate is given in terms of one hundred pounds that the unit was not a pound. Such a construction would be impracticable and unmeaning. It is obvious that, in the last named instance, the quantity indicated for the purpose of stating the rate was not intended to ascertain the unit for applying the rate. It is clear that the same intention guided the Legislature in the employment of the terms by which they express that rate relative to distance that influenced them in stating it relative to pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Such being the direct meaning of the statute, it is not necessary for us to consider the effect of the omission of certain words contained in a previous statute on the same subject, which, if retained, would have obviated the necessity of a resort to construction, for such an omission cannot weigh against the clear language and intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">It is evident, by a reference to other parts of the statutes above referred to, that the Legislature regarded the sums allowed by way of charge for transportation as indicating a rate of charge. The title of the Act of 1858, which increased the rate on heavy merchandise from thirty-five to fifty cents, expresses this idea by declaring the purpose of the Act to be \u201c to increase the rates of transportation on the Charleston and Hamburg Railroad in certain cases.\u201d Section 1 of that Act assumes in terms to establish a rate in the very provisions increasing the charge to fifty cents ; the same intention is made apparent by the following clause of the eleventh Section of the Act of 1828, (8 Stat., 360): \u201c And it shall be lawful for the said company to use or employ any section of their intended railroad, subject to the rates before mentioned, before the whole shall be completed.\u201d It also authorizes certain branch roads, \u201c subject to the aforesaid rates of transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">It is there evident that the provisions in question were intended to establish a rate of charge, and as that rate is based on distance, it must afford means of proportioning charges according to distances. It is evident, therefore, that these provisions cannot support the constructions attempted to be put upon them by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The construction of the Circuit Court was free from error, and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-9\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
