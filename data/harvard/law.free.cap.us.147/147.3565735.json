It made an arrangement with most of its- bondholders for an extension of two years. Jennings was asked to agree to this arrangement, but refused, threatening foreclosure unless the interest due him were fully and promptly paid. The company thereupon tendered him $570, being the interest due, less $30, which the treasurer of the company proposed to deduct for state tax alleged to be due, at the rate of three mills per annum upon the nominal or par value of the bond. Jennings agreed to submit to the deduction of a tax based upon the actual value of the bonds, which did not exceed 75 per centum of par, but the treasurer of the company insisting that he was compelled by law to assess them'at par, regardless of actual value, refused to make any concession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-4\">\u201c The decision of the trial court' being in favor of Jennings, the Coal Eidge Company carried the case to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, assigning as error the affirmance of the above and other points by the trial court.
