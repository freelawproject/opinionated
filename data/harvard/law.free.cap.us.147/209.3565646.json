The patent in question is void because it issued in the usual form to James Boyle, who was dead at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>granting of said letters patent, and the Circuit Court was right in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">All rights and remedies of inventors are based upon the constitution and statutes, which must be followed in order to obtain a valid patent. <em>Gayler </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>10 How. 477, 493; <em>Wilson </em>v. Rousseau, 4 How. 646, 674.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">The statutes of the United States recognize only three classes of persons to whom letters patent for an invention may issue: (1) the inventor himself, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4886 ; (2) an assignee of the inventor, where an assignment is made before the issuing of the letters patent, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4895; and (3) the personal representatives of the inventor, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4896.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">It may be claimed that this grant to <em>\u201c </em>James Boyle, his heirs or assigns,\u201d should be construed as a grant to the' personal representative of James Boyle, James Boyle having died pending the application. This cannot be. <em>Eagleton Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>West, </em>111 U. S. 490, 499. One cannot obtain by a so-called equitable construction of a grant what he could not legally obtain by direct grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoy9\">Letters patent for an invention are a grant from the sovereign. power, creating a monopoly for a limited period. The word was originally used in England to describe written instruments, emanating from the king, whereby lands, honors or franchises were conferred upon individuals. In this respect the grant of letters patent for inventions are not distinguished from other grants under the royal prerogative. To be sure, the property in such letters patent is . regarded as personal prop-' erty. But it is an \u201c incorporeal \u201d property, and differs from most other personal property in that it \u201c lies in grant and not in livery\u201d\u2014it is created by grant, under the great seal of state, and can be created in no other way, as is the case with all grants under the royal prerogative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">When created, this property can be transferred only by grant, <em>i.e., </em>by deed of assignment, and not by delivery of possession, as is the case with other personal property. While, therefore, the property right is \u201c personal property \u201d rather than \u201c real estate,\u201d under one of which two heads all property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>is somewhat artificially classed, yet this property more nearly resembles the so-called \u201c incorporeal hereditaments \u201d of, the law. than the tangible things generally classed as personal property; the great difference being that one is incorporeal, the other corporeal; the one can be. created and transferred only'by deed or grant in writing, the other can be transferred by mere delivery of possession. Indeed, it was because of the fact that personal property could be transferred by mere delivery of possession and carried away by the grantee, whose person it followed, that the old rules of common law as to the word \u201c heirs \u201d became inapplicable to the transfer of corporeal personal property. But in the case of property in a patent, \u25a0which can be created and transferred only by grant and deed of assignment, a kind of property is found which comes in its nature really between \u201c land \u201d or \u201c real estate \u201d and corporeal personal property, and which more closely resembles, as we have said, the \u201c incorporeal hereditaments \u201d of the common law than it does the tangible things of which personal property was originally made up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\">Coming back, then, to a consideration of this proposition, we insist that a patent for an invention is \u00e1 grant by the State of the exclusive privilege of making, using and vending it, and authorizing others to make, use and vend it. It' differs from other letters patent only in the nature of the subject-matter of the grant. See <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch, 137, 141, and <em>Butterworth </em>v. <em>Hoe, </em>112 U. S. 50, where the court considered letters patent for inventions and letters'patent for lands together, as being grants of similar nature, and subject to the same rules and' laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">Now it is, and always has been, requisite to a grant <em>in yorcesenti </em>(which letters patent for inventions are) that there should be a grantee <em>in esse, </em>to take at' the time of the grant. It is absolutely essential to the validity of a grant or deed that there should be a grantor and a grantee \u2014- a person capable of granting and a person capable of taking. A grant <em>in prcesenti </em>must be to a person <em>in esse </em>at the time of the grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">Following this- old rule of law, the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the United States, in the case of <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>12 Pet. 264, held that a patent of land to a dead man and his heirs was void. In the case of <em>Galt </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>4 Pet. 332, the Supreme Court of the United States, pp. 344, 345, held that under the laws of the United States the location of land in the name of a man deceased at the time of the location was absolutely void. The same ruling was made in the case of <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Smalley, </em>6 Pet. 261. Under the principles which we contend for, if a grant of land to a person not <em>in esse </em>at the time of the grant is void, the grant of letters patent to a man not <em>in esse </em>at the time of their issue is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-3\">It appears from the bill that James Boyle was dead at the time of the grant of the\u2019letters patent in question; he was therefore not <em>in esse, </em>and under the decisions we submit that if the letters patent are to be considered'a grant to James Boyle, there can be no possible doubt but that the patent in question is absolutely void <em>ab </em>initio. Indeed this does not seem to be seriously questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-4\">The controversy in this case, so far as this point goes, then turns upon the word \u201c heirs \u201d in the statute and in the letters patent.. What does the word \u201c heirs \u201d mean ? Is it descriptive of a class of persons to whom in the alternative the right shall go, or is .it a\u2019word which defines the nature of the estate which the grantee shall take? Is it a .word of \u201cpurchase\u201d or a word in \u201climitation <em>(i.e., </em>definition) of the estate?\u201d If the first position be the correct one, then the patent might be, were it not for the statutes above considered, valid; if the second, then it is void because the word adds no new class to take as a \u201cpurchaser,\u201d or grantee. We maintain that the 'second is the true construction to place upon the statute and upon the letters patent; that the words \u201c his heirs \u201d name no new class to take as grantees in case of the inability, from death or otherwise, of th\u00e9 patentee to take; that they are words of \u201c limitation of the estate and not words of purchase.\u201d See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>4 How. 646, 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">The sole purpose of using the word \u201c heirs \u201d in the statute and the letters patent is, to prevent the grant from being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>determined by the death of the patentee. Upon no other construction of the statute can the word \u201c heirs \u201d be given any meaning, and it is a settled principle of statutory construction that a statute must be construed so as to give effect to every word, if possible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-4\">Again, that the word \u201cheirs,\u201d as used in the Bevised Statutes, \u00a7 4884, and in letters patent themselves, is a word of \u201c limitation of an estate \u201d and not a word of \u201c purchase,\u201d is evident from the long line of decisions which hold that upon the death of the patentee the title to the patent goes not to the heirs themselves, but to the personal representative of the deceased, in trust for his heirs or devisees. If the word \u201cheirs\u201d were to be construed as a word of purchase, then, being \u201cpurchasers,\u201d they would be the ones who would take the title; and yet it has been universally held by all the courts that the title goes to the personal representative in trust for the heirs, and not to the heirs directly. <em>Shaw Relief Valve Co. </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>19 Fed. Rep. 753; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Dull, </em>19 Fed. Rep. 913; <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>North Missouri Railroad, </em>4 Fish. 161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">It seems clear, therefore, that the patent must be construed as reading to \u201cJames Boyle <em>and </em>his heirs or assigns\u201d \u2014 to \u201cJames Boyle and his heirs,\u201d if he dies without assigning, or to his assigns when he shall assign it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">II. The certificate recites an agreement between. T. L. Bankin and Theresa Boyle, dated December 2, 1875. James Boyle died November 27, 1875, and at the date of this contract there was no administrator. Bankin was appointed temporary administrator March 9,1876, and M\u00a1rs. Boyle full administratrix July 5, 1876. The second question upon which instruction is desired is, \u201c Whether the above quoted instrument should, under the above facts, be construed as an assignment to Thomas L. Bankin.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">This does not appear to be a difficult question, if the court' is called to pass upon the contract alone.. But it was contended, and doubtless will \u25a0 be again, that \u25a0 under this paper Bankin was entitled to the patent when it issued, as the assignee of James Boyle. W\u00e9 do not see how this contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>can be made available by appellant, because if Rankin was the assignee, the patent should have issued under section 4895, which is special to assignees, instead of under the general clause, section 4884, as it was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-3\">There is no sense in which this paper can be classed or treated as an assignment, and there is no allegation in the bill that Rankin ever paid Mrs. Boyle five thousand dollars; and therefore, upon the showing of the bill itself, this, paper is null and void; and has never been so far operative as to enable Rankin to demand an assignment of the patent under it. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. Trimble, 10 Wall. 367, 382.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-4\">As to what constitutes an assignment see <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Mackenzie, </em>138 U. S. 255. That the Rankin agreement is not an assignment of that kind is fully supported by that case and by <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Boss, </em>46 Fed. Rep. 195.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">III. The patent sued on is void, because the application was amended in the Patent Office, pending allowance, after the death of James Boyle, without authority, and without any new application or oath by his personal representatives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">We contend that the patent so issued is void, for the following reasons: (1) Because it was not issued upon any petition or oath of the personal representative. <em>Eagleton Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>West Manufacturing Co., </em>111 U. S. 490; (2) Because the application was changed without authority after the death of the applicant. <em>Hid.; </em>(3) Because Alexander &amp; \u2022Mason acted as attorneys in the application without right or authority. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmanier, </em>8 Wheat. 174 to 232; (4) Because acting as attorneys for a dead man is a manifest absurdity. <em>Hid. </em>p. 203; (5) Because it does not change matters by reason of the fact that Alexander <em>&amp; </em>Mason signed their own names instead of Boyle\u2019s to the amendment, as their act, how-, ever signed, must be the act of the principal, and having no principal, the act was void. <em>Hid. </em>p. 204; (6) Because a changed or varied specification cannot be related back to the original specification. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>97 U.

Chief Justice Fullee,</author>\n<p id=\"AQk\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The grant was to \u201c J ames Boyle, his heirs or assigns,\u201d and in this followed the language of section 4884 of the Revised Statutes. But although Boyle made the application, he was dead at the time the patent issued, and it was therefore held by the Circuit Court that the patent was utterly void for want of a grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The reasoning of the court was that all the rights and remedies of inventors to the exclusive property in' their inventions . come from the statute, and that under sections 4886, 4895 and 4896 only three classes of persons are recognized to whom a patent for an invention can issue, namely: The inventor himself; the assignee of the inventor, when the assignment is made before the issue of the patent; and the executor or administrator of the inventor if he dies before the patent is granted; that a patent for an invention is a grant for the exclusive privilege of making, using and vending, and authorizing others to make, use and vend,' an invention; and that j ust as the term was originally used in England, to describe written instruments emanating from the King, sealed with the great seal, whereby lands, honors or franchises were conferred upon individuals, so it is used in this. country as descriptive of an instrument whereby some exclusive right is granted by the sovereign power to the person named therein. Hence, continued the court, a patent for an invention is a grant and must' have a grantor and a grantee. It must grant0 the franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>or monopoly to a person named and who is capable of taking, and in this respect a patent does not differ from a patent or deed for lands. And as a deed to a person not then living and his heirs would be void, since, the word heirs being one of limitation and not of purchase, there is no person to take under it, so a patent for an invention to a dead man is wholly inoperative, and such must be the construction of a patent issued under section 4884 to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, when the patentee thus named is dead' at the date of the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The conclusion reached resits upon the assumption that the form of grant specified in section 4884 can only be pursued when the inventor is living, and that the intention of Congress was that the personal representatives of the inventor could not be treated as grantees under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We are to remember that it is to be assumed that James Boyle had made a useful invention and taken all the necessary steps to secure the benefits to be derived therefrom, and that in view of the policy of the government to encourage, genius and promote the progress of the useful arts, by securing to the inventor a fair and reasonable remuneration, a liberal construction in favor of those who claim under him must be adopted in the solution of the principal question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">It is also to be observed that, under the practice of the Patent Office, a considerable time necessarily elapses after a patent for an invention is allowed before it actually issues; that the applicants often reside at a great distance; that the cases when an- inventor dies between the date of the application and the allowance, and the allowance and the issue, must be of frequent occurrence; and that this may happen when neither the office nor the inventor\u2019s solicitors are aware Of the death. The reflection is a natural one that Congress, which, in framing the provisions of the patent laws, must be presumed to have had these possible occurrences in mind, did not contemplate that all patents issued under such circumstances should be invalidated by the death of the inventor.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">What, then, was the intention of Congress in providing for a grant to the \u201c patentee, his heirs or assigns ? \u201d Must it be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>construed as merely a personal grant to the individual, or may his personal representatives be treated as grantees ?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u201c The words \u00a3 heirs,\u2019 and \u00a3 heirs of his body,\u2019 \u201d says Mr. Williams, \u00a3\u00a3 are quite inapplicable to personal estate; the heir, as heir, has nothing to do with the. personal property of his ancestor. Such property has nothing hereditary in its nature, but simply belongs to its owner for the time being. Hence, a gift of personal property to A. simply, without more, is sufficient to vest in him the absolute interest. Whilst, under the very same words, he would acquire a life interest only in real' estate, he will become absolutely entitled to personal property.\u201d Williams\u2019 Pers. Prop. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The privileges granted by letters patent are plainly an instance of an incorporeal kind of personal property, which, as personalty, in. the absence of context to the contrary, would go to the executor or administrator in trust for the next of kin. Williams\u2019 Executors, 817; Schouler\u2019s Executors, \u00a7 200; Williams\u2019 Pers. Prop. 271; <em>Patterson v. Kentucky, </em>97 U. S. 501; <em>Millar v. Taylor, </em>4 Burrow, 2303; <em>Shaw Relief Valve Co. v. New Bedford, </em>19 Fed. Rep. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case </em>was that when an estate of freehold is limited to a person for life, and the same instrument contains a limitation either mediate or immediate to his heirs or the heirs of his body, the word heirs is a. word of limitation, and the grantee takes the whole estate either in fee tad or fee simple. This is a rule of law, and not a rule, of construction. <em>Evans s. Evans, </em>[1892], 2 Ch. 173, 184, 188. It applies to nothing-but real estate, and if resorted to in connection with personal estate, it is only by way of analogy, and as a rule of construction in order to promote the intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We do not perceive any sound reason for holding that the word \u201c heirs \u201d in a patent for an invention should be regarded as a definition of the extent of the patentee\u2019s own-interest in the patent. There is nothing technical in the word as used. It indicates persons who are to have the benefit in the event of death, but the absolute character of the interest of the patentee is not attributable to it. The words .in the statute, \u201c the patentee, his heirs or assigns,\u201d whether construed accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ing' to the rules of grammar, or to the evident intent of Congress, mean \u201cthe patentee or his heirs or assigns.\u201d They comprehend the legal representatives, assignees in law and assignees in fact, and the phraseology raises no limitation in the sense of the strict common-law rule applied, to realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">It is said that if the word \u201cheirs\u201d were not used in the grant, the patent would-end with the life of the patentee, and would have no descendible or inheritable quality, but we are not persuaded that this would be so, any more than' that the omission of the word from any transfer of personal - property would have that effect. The exercise of the right vested is not in its nature dependent upon the continued existence of the person whose merit earned the reward., The statute has long been that'\u201cthe patentee\u201d may obtain an extension in certain cases, without adding that his executors or administrators may do this, (Act 1836, 5 Stat. 117, 124, c. 357, \u00a7 18; Act 1870, 16 Stat. 198, 208, c. 230, \u00a7 63; Kev. Stat. \u00a7 4924;) yet it was decided that an executor or administrator can obtain an extension, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>4 How. 646; and that the extended term is assignable, although not expressly so' provided. <em>Nicolson Pavement Co. </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>14 Wall. 452; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Trimble, </em>10 Wall. 367. And so, that a patent issued to an inventor after an assignment of his entire interest has been entered of record, immediately and by operation law enures to the benefit of his assignee. <em>Gayler </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>10 How. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">If the patent had issued to Boyle when living, although an assignment of his entire interest had been recorded before, the patent would have enured to the benefit of the assignee, and -it is difficult to see why, if Boyle died prior to. the issue of the patent and after he had made the application and assigned his interest, the assignee should lose the benefit of the assignment because of the death.</p>\n<p id=\"Amo\">' Under section 4896, when the inventor dies before the patent is granted, the right of applying for and obtaining the patent devolves upon his executor or administrator in trust for his heirs at law or legatees, and doubt has been, suggested as to the applicability of the section when the death transpires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>after the application has been filed, but the rulings and practice of the Patent Office are to the effect that in the latter contingency no new application need be made or new fee be paid, but the executor or administrator may file his letters and the case be disposed of as if the applicant had not died. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>Dec. Com. Pat. 1879, p. 291; <em>Ex parte Smith, </em>Dec. Com. Pat. 1888, p. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u25a0 Neither this section nor section 4895, providing that patents may be granted and issued, or reissued, to the assignee of the inventor or discoverer, prescribe any form of grant, which is alone to be found in section 4884. The statute does not require the patent to issue under section 4896 to the executor or administrator, and inasmuch as a patent is1 personal property, and as such goes to the executor or administrator, in trust for the next of .kin, it would appear that this result would follow where the grant is to the patentee, his heirs or assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Sections 4895 and 4896 cover cases where the application is madefy the legal representatives or assignees, but where the application is made by the inventor, and he dies, a grant in the terms stated apparently accomplishes all the objects aimed at by both these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Section 1 of the act of 1790 provided for a grant to \u201cthe petitioner or petitioners, his, her or their heirs, administrators or assigns,\u201d (1 Stat. 109, 110,) and the act of February 21, 1793, was in the same language. (1 Stat. 318, 321.) Section 5 of the act of 1836 read that the patent should \u201c in its terms grant to' the applicant or applicants, his or their heirs, administrators, executors, or assigns,\u201d etc. (5\u2018 Stat. 117, 119.) The statute of 1870 required the patent to contain \u201c a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns,\u201d (16 Stat. 198, 201,) which is carried forward into section 4884 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">As remarked by Judge Lowell in <em>Shaw Relief Valve Co. </em>v. <em>New Bedford, ubi supra, </em>the omission of \u2022 the word \u201c executors\u201d prior to 1836' did not affect the title of the executors, nor did the omission of \u201cadministrators and executors\u201d from the act of 1870 make any difference. \u201cThe law was not changed by it.\u201d Taking the sections together, the legislative intent seems to have been that a grant to the. patent\u00e9\u00e9,. his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>heirs or assigns, should vest title in the executor or administrator where the death occurred pending the application. If there he no executor or administrator, or letters of such are not recorded, still the general form of grant prescribed in section 4884 is applicable, and the patent may run to <em>\u201c </em>the patentee, his heirs or assigns.\u201d The statute does not make it imperative that the patent shall issue in the name of the executor or administrator, the grant under section 4884 being sufficient to vest title in the patentee\u2019s- legal representative, whether he be administrator, executor or assignee. If there are adverse claims of heirs and legatees, they may be left to be determined by the courts in whose jurisdiction they arise, rather than h.y the Patent'Office. It is enough if it is found that the patent is proper to be granted, and it is so granted to\u2019the personal representatives of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Sections 4895 and 4896 designate who should make the oath in case of death or assignment, but where the application has been made in the lifetime of the inventor, and remains in effect unchanged, there is no necessity for a new application or oath, except, of .course, in the case of a reissue; and, as we have seen, a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, sufficiently designates in whom the title to the patent shall vest in case of assignment or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In view of these considerations, as the language of the statute admits of a construction which, in sustaining the grant, effectuates the settled policy of -the government in favor of inventors', our judgment is that that construction should be adopted, and that the statute should be read in the alternative, -and the grant be treated as made to the patentee or his heirs or assigns.' This conclusion is supported by the practice advisedly adopted in the Land Office, (another branch of the Executive department known as that of the Interior,) of using disjunctive terms for .the purpose of preventing the defeat of grants by the death of the original grantee-. 'In <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Page, </em>2 Wall. 605, 607, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Nelson,\u2019said:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u201c A difficulty had occurred at the Land Office, at an early day, in respect to the form of patent certificates and .of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>patents, arising out of applications to have them issued in the name of the assignee, or present claimant, thereby imposing, upon the office the burden of inquiring into the derivative title presented by the applicant. This difficulty, also, existed in respect to the boards of commissioners under the acts of Congress for the settlement of French and Spanish claims. The result seems to have been, after consulting the Attorney General, that the Commissioner of the Land Office recommended a formula that has since been very generally observed, namely, the issuing of the patent certificate, and even the patent, to the original grantee, or <em>his legal </em>representatives, and the same has been adopted by the several boards of commissioners. \u25a0 This formula, <em>\u2018 </em>or his legal representatives;5 embraces representatives of the original grantee in the land, by contract, such as assignees or grantees, as well as by operation of law, and leaves the question open to inquiry in a court of \u2022 justice as to the party to whom the certificate, patent or confirmation should enure.55</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">And see <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Rannels, </em>19 Wall. 138; <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Long, </em>89 Illinois, 19; <em>Warnecke </em>v. <em>Lembca, 71 </em>Illinois, 91; <em>Read </em>v. <em>Kearsley, </em>14 Michigan, 215, 225; <em>Grand Gulf Railroad </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>8 Sm. <em>&amp; </em>Marsh. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The action spoken of by Mr. Justice Nelson was evidently taken in order to prevent hardships occurring under the old form of land grants, as indicated in <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>12 Pet. 264, and other cases; but no such action was considered necessary in reference to invention patents, although the same reason might have existed if the same form had originally been prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u25a0 It appears from the certificate that James Boyle died on November <em>21, </em>1875, and that the application was thereafter prosecuted- by, the attorneys who had been previously appointed by him for that purpose, under the direction* of Thomas X. Rankin, who had been appointed temporary administrator of Boyle\u2019s estate, March &gt;9,1876, and who obtained the patent and paid all the Patent Office and solicitors\u2019 fees therefor. It is also stated, that prior to Boyle\u2019s application he had made a contract with Rankin, by which it was agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>that the latter should advance the money to apply for and obtain the patent, and Boyle should assign to Nankin a one-half interest in the invention and patent; and that 'on December 2, 1875, Nankin made an agreement with Theresa Boyle, the widow of James'Boyle, \u201c then acting as executrix <em>cle son </em>tort,\u201d by virtue of which Nankin was to acquire the right to the whole patent. Under the statutes of Texas a temporary administrator possesses the rights and powers of a general administrator so far as expressly confided to him by the order of appointment. 1 Sayles\u2019 Tex. Civ. Stat. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The failure to record the title papers in the Patent Office, it appearing that the administrator and equitable- owner in part obtained the patent, cannot, in the view we take of the case, make the patent void. The identity of the grantee might be determined by extrinsic testimony. If the grant be construed as made directly to the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of Boyle, there can be no doubt as to its validity, even though when the patent issued it was not made to appear who they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The case of <em>Eagleton Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>West, </em>111 U. S. 490, is cited' to the proposition that, where the inventor dies, a patent is invalid when not issued upon the application and oath of his personal representative, but in that case the application was so amended after the inventor\u2019s death that it was equivalent to a new application, yet none such had been made, nor had the administratrix made the oath rendered necessary under such circumstances. In the case at bar the application remained in substance unchanged and no new application or oath was essential to jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">We ought, perhaps, to add that in our opinion the patent would not be absolutely void, even if the objections taken by appellees were better founded than we hold they are. If the proceedings in the Patent Office may be considered as analogous to the condition of a pending suit at law upon the death of the plaintiff, the great weight of authority in this country is to the effect that where the court has acquired jurisdiction of' the subject-matter and the person during the lifetime of a party, a judgment for or against a dead man is not wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>void or open to collateral attack. It is very rarely that proceedings are wholly void and without force or effect as to all persons^and for all purposes, and therefore incapable of being or being made otherwise; and we are entirely clear that this patent cannot be treated as falling within that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The record shows, as we have said, the -existence, of a con-. -tract between Rankin and Boyle, by which the latter was toad vanee the money to apply for .and obtain the patent for a-half interest, and that Rankin' carried, out the contract on hrs part. The agreement between -Rankin and the widow, then acting as' having a Colorable right, to administer; is -also set out, under which Mrs. Boyle agreed-that as soon as she should-receive five thousand 'dollars in the way .specified she would \u201crelease any further interest in said patents, to be obtained and the machines then in use.\u201d Rankin w\u00e1s appointed 'tem-porary- administrator, March 9, 1876,-and on duly 18, 1876;. the temporary .letters of administration issued to Rankin \u201cwere superseded by the appointment of the said^ Theresa Boyle as permanent administratrix. She thereafter Hiedan inventory, of her husband\u2019s estate, in which she,included the patent in question as held and owned-jointly with Thomas L. Rankin. Neither Theresa -Boyle, nor her children^ nor Thomas L. Rankin ever repudiated the proceedings whereby saidpatent was obtained, but enjoyed the beneficial ownership thereof, and sold their interest therein for a valuable consideration.\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">When Mrs. Boyle -took out the letters of adniinistration, her prior acts, presumably upon this record beneficial to the estate and certainly not such as appellees have any right to complain of, should be viewed in the same light as though she had been made administratrix upon the death of her husband. And upon the facts stated, without discussing the particular nature of the instrument of December 2, 1875, we conclude that Rankin acquired under the two contracts the equitable title to the patent; and the circumstance that there was no record evidence of the transaction in the Patent Office made no difference, in the absence of question as to the rights of third parties. The patent, therefore, enured to his benefit. <em>Hartshorn </em>v. Day, 19 How. 211; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>India Rubber Co., </em>20 How. 216; <em>Gayler </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>10 How. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">Boyle made the oath to the application, filed -in his lifetime in accordance with section 4892 of the Bevised Statutes, and the certificate states that after his death \u201c the specification originally filed with said application for a patent was amended within the scope of the original oath and the invention described in said original specification, and by way of limitation of the claims, but without the filing of any new oath or power of attorney.\u201d In <em>Eagleton Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>West Manufacturing Co., </em>111 U. S. 490, 498, before referred to, the patent was held invalid because the authority given to Eagleton\u2019s attorneys ended at his death, and the patent was granted upon amendments made by the attorneys without any new oath by the administratrix. And Mr. Justice Blatchford; speaking \u25a0for the court, said that the file wrapper showed, \u201cbeyond doubt, that there was no suggestion, in the specification signed and sworn to by Eagleton, of the invention described in the amendment,\u201d and that \u201c in view of the entire change in the specification, as to: the invention described, the patent, to be valid, should have been granted on an application made and sworn to by the administratrix. The specification, as issued, bears the signature of Eagleton and not of the administratrix, and it is sufficiently shown that the patent was granted on the application and oath of Eagleton, and for an invention which, he never made.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">. In the case at bar, there was not only no amplification of the original application by the-' amendment, but it was within the scope of the original specification and a limitation and narrowing of the original claim, so- that it was the identical invention sworn to by Boyle, and there was no more reason for requiring a new oath from his administratrix than there would have been for requiring it from Boyle himself. The attorneys who had acted for Boyle continued to act under Bankin\u2019s direction, and although it is not shown that their authority was conferred in writing by a power of attorney executed and filed in accordance --with the rules of the office, that is not a fatal objection, since -the attorneys had authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in fact, and their acts were subsequently ratified by Eankin and by Mrs. Boyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We are of opinion that the grant was not void because of the death of Boyle before the patent was issued, and that it should be construed in the alternative as a grant to James Boyle; or his heirs, or assigns, which would include a grantee -or grantees in being, capable of taking the patent and to whose benefit the grant would enure; that the patent should bd construed as a grant to Thomas L. Eankin as assignee,-and held to have been obtained by the authority of Mrs. Boyle as administratrix, as well as of Eankin; and that the amendment did not render the patent absolutely void, nor did the fact that-no oath was filed after Boyle5s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>These conclusions answer the questions propounded, a/ndwill he certified accordi/ngly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
