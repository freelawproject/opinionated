The'property so received and the proceeds of sales thereof were afterwards invested so that, besides paying $10,000 in 1859 for a tract of sixteen acres of land\u2019 as a site for a building, they amounted in May, 1884, (including $11,500 received froto other persons,) to $92,000. . The building was actually begun a few months after the filing of this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">Wells died in 1876, never having done anything about the real estate in New Jersey, although he knew of its existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">There was in the city of Newark an institution called the Hospital of St. Barnabas, incorporated by an act of the legislature of New Jersey of February 13, 1867, c. 32, which provided that the object of the corporation should be \u201cthe care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>nurture and maintenance of sick, infirm, aged and indigent persons, and of orphan, half orphan and destitute children, the providing for their temporal and spiritual welfare, and the procuring or erecting a suitable building or buildings; \u201d and that its members and trustees should be members of the Protestant' Episcopal Church, and the moral and religious instruction of the inmates should be in conformity with the doctrine, discipline and worship of that church' New Jersey Acts of 1867, p. 51. Its by-laws and rules provided that patients in a condition to be discharged, or whose disease was incurable, should not remain in the <em>hospital; </em>and that all persons able to pay for their maintenance should do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">Jabez <em>W. </em>Hayes often told his sons' that he intended to devote the principal and income of the testator\u2019s property in Newark to the support of this hospital, and in 1870, and again in 1876, obtained the opinion of counsel that, under the provisions of the will of George Hayes, the executors would be authorized in their discretion to provide a permanent bed in this hospital for disabled or aged and infirm and deserving American mechanics. But he took no other steps in \u25a0 that direction, and died in January, 1882, without having rendered any account of his administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\">On December 12, 1882, the orphans\u2019 court of .the county of Essex and State of New Jersey passed an order, reciting the probate of the will of George Hayes in that court, and that \u201c Jabez <em>W. </em>Hayes, after having taken upon himself the execution of said will in this State, .has departed this life, that -due notice has been given of this application to Dundas Pratt, the only other surviving executor named in said will, and to all other parties in interest; \u201d and appointing \u201c Henry Hayes administrator of all and singular the goods, chattels \u25a0 and credits of the said George Hayes, deceased, in the State of New Jersey, left unadministered by Jabez <em>W. </em>Have's, deceased, who is duly authorized to administer the same agreeably to said will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-7\">Before this \u2022 appointment, and after Pratt had received notice of the application therefor, a correspondence took place between him and Henry Hayes, in which Pratt, while acqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>escing in the appointment, insisted that the testator\u2019s interest in the land in New Jersey (the\u2019existence of which had become known to him only since the death of Jabez W. Hayes,) should go to the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home; and Henry Hayes expressed a wish that it should be applied, as his father had hoped, to a bed for mechanics in the hospital at Newark. On June 25, 1883, Henry Hayes, in answer to a letter from Pratt about the sale of this interest of the testator,, wrote to him that he would not, of course, make any disposition of the money but a legal one, and that he would not dispose of it in any way without giving Pratt an opportunity to show- that the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home was the only institution entitled to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\">Henry Hayes soon afterwards sold this property, and received money from the sale and from previous income thereof; and in October, 1881, made an offer to the Hospital of St. Barnabas, which that corporation accepted, to appropriate to its use the greater part of this moneys and on January 8, 1881, settled his account in said orphans\u2019 court, showing a balance in his hands of $5153.27; and declined to pay it to Pratt, as executor of George Hayes, or as treasurer of the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home; and in March, 1881, without any order of court, and without Pratt\u2019s knowledge or consent, paid this balance to the Hospital of St. Barnabas, informing it of Pratt\u2019s claim, and taking from it a bond of indemnity, secured by a mortgage on real estate; and the board of trustees of that corporation, on March 17, 1881, \u201c resolved, that the Hospital of St. Barnabas consents to receive said fund, and it hereby agrees to use such fund solely for the purpose, of furnishing a retreat and home for disabled or aged and infirm and deserving American mechanics, in accordance with . the will of the late George Hayes; \u201d and, on. July 1, 1885, having meanwhile completed a new hospital building, \u201cresolved, that a suitable part of the building be fitted up Avith tAVO beds to be devoted especially to the purposes mentioned by the testator, and that a tablet be placed upon the Avails as an indication of these uses and a memorial of the donor of the fund.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>On May 10, 1884, in the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia, (as appeared by an exemplified copy of the record of the appointment, filed with the bill in this case,) \u201c Jabez W. Hayes and Lewis E. Wells, two of the executors named in said will, being dead, letters testamentary were duly granted unto Hundas T. Pratt, surviving executor; \u201d and Pratt was duly qualified \u201c as the succeeding executor of the foregoing last will and testament of George Hayes, deceased.\u201d At that time, there was no estate of the testator, which had not^been duly administered, except so far as the property in New Jersey could be so considered; and Pratt testified that his only object in being appointed was to sue for and recover that, property, that he supposed that the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home could itself pursue that fund, but was advised that he, as executor, should claim it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">The Circuit Court \u201c ordered, adjudged and decreed that the respondent, Henry Hayes, administrator of the estate of George Hayes, in the State of New Jersey, pay to the complainant, Dundas T. Pratt, treasurer of the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home, a corporation of the State of Pennsylvania, and for and in behalf of said corporation, the sum of $5153.27, with interest from January 10,1884, being the balance in his hands, as administrator aforesaid, on settlement of his account in the orphans\u2019 court of Essex county, New Jers\u00f3y,\u201d with posts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-6\"><em>Mr. A. Q. Keasbey </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">I. The Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home had no legal or equitable claim upon the defendant in this suit. He had assumed no trust relation with that corporation. Therefore that home had no standing in New Jersey to demand by suit anything from the defendant, as administrator of the estate of George Hayes in New Jersey, and the decree enforcing such demand directly in its favor should be reversed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-8\">II. Dundas T. Pratt, in his capacity of succeeding executor in Pennsylvania, had no right to make any such claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-9\">The granting of letters testamentary to. him twenty years after the estate had been- settled and all the functions of the executor ended in Pennsylvania, was a work of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>erogation. There was nothing in Pennsylvania for him to administer sand could not be, for by the records of the orphans\u2019 court, it appears that the whole of the Pennsylvania property was administered and applied according to the will of the Pennsylvania executor in the discharge of his trust. In like manner all the New Jersey property had before his appointment been applied by the New Jersey executor in discharge of the same trust, so far as it was imposed upon him. The Pennsylvania executor took no title to the New Jersey real estate and acquired no right as to the disposition of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-4\">III. But even if the Pennsylvania executor was authorized to obtain the New Jersey fund by transmission from this jurisdiction, or to dispose of it at his own discretion, he had no power to bring suit in the New Jersey jurisdiction against the representatives of the estate there, but his only remedy was to apply to the orphans\u2019 court in New Jersey for such direction as to such transmission as that court at its discretion under the circumstances of the case might see fit to make. <em>Stacey </em>v. Thrasher, 6 How. 44; <em>Noonan </em>v. Bradley, 9 Wall. 394; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>139 U. S. 156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">This foreign executor cannot demand as a right by a suit in the Court of Chancery, that the New Jersey executor shall account to him for the proceeds of the property in New Jersey devised to him by the will, or for the manner in which he has in his discretion disposed of that property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">IT. But even if the Pennsylvania executor had a right to sue the New Jersey administrator, or if he had applied to the probate court of New Jersey for an order directing its administrator to transmit the residue in his hands to Pennsylvania for administration there, he could mot have recovered in a suit, nor would the orphans\u2019 court have been bound to make any order for such transmission. \u25a0 There is no obligation to make such transmission. It is only a matter of comity, and depends wholly upon the circumstances of the case, and in this case there are no circumstances which call for the exercise of such comity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">There is nothing left for the new executor, appointed in Pennsylvania, to do with respect to the subject matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>George Hayes\u2019 estate. The executor appointed in Pennsylvania is <em>functus oficio, </em>and all his duties were closed twenty years ago. No considerations of comity and no principles of equity require that the acts done in New Jersey by the executor appointed there in the exercise of his discretion should be undone at the instance of a new executor in Pennsylvania, in order that he may have the privilege of exercising the discretion over again and applying the fund to a different purpose. <em>Dent\u2019s Appeal, </em>22 Penn.

(2 Green,) 425; <em>Mahnken\u2019s Case, </em>36 N. J. Eq. (9 Stewart,) 518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">It follows'that the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home, which has no interest in the estate itself, except that part of it which the Philadelphia executor has already chosen to give it, has no standing whatever in the Court of Chancery of New Jersey to recover another part of the estate which has already been bestowed UpOn another charitable corporation, nor has the Pennsylvania executor such an interest in the property in this State as to enable him to maintain such an action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">' <em>V. </em>The property in dispute in this case is the proceeds of the sale of real estate. The disposition of real estate is governed by the law of the place where it is situated. This law would govern the descent of land undisposed of by will, and by this law the question of the due execution of a will would be decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">It is the general rule that the disposition of real estate is governed by the law of the place where it is situated; and when a testator appoints an executor in that place, and gives him power to sell real estate, the presumption is that he in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tends him to have power over his real estate there, and that he may sell it according to the laws of the place where it is, and may also dispose of the proceeds as well as of the land itself, under the directions of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-4\">Even with respect to personal property there is a tendency to limit the rule that it is governed by the law of the domicil. \u25a0The distribution of. personal property in cases of intestacy is according to the law of the domicil, but yet so far as it concerns creditors it depends on the law of the- country where it is situated. <em>Milne </em>v. Moreton, 6 Binney, 353; <em>S. C. </em>6 Am. Dec. 466; <em>Farmers' &amp; Mechanics' Bank </em>v. Loftus, 133 Penn. St. 97.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">YI. It is the general result of the cases that the disposition of the residue of an estate in the hands of an ancillary executor or administrator is wholly a matter of discretion, and that there is no rule or principle which requires that the funds which were in the hands of this administrator with the will annexed, should have been sent into a foreign jurisdiction as against any proper claims here, whether of creditors, legatees named in the will, or objects of the testator\u2019s bounty and charity, selected by his executor here in pursuance of the power of the will; and all the cases show that the foreign executor or administrator has no right to meddle with the estate here or sue for it, unless such power is given, on proper application to the courts of this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">In this case such discretion ought not to be exercised in favor of sending the proceeds of real estate in New Jersey out of the State for' the purpose of applying it to purposes not contemplated by the New Jersey executor who held the title to the property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-7\"><em>Mr. John Li. Emery </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-8\">Mr. Justice Gray,</author>\n<p id=\"AW5\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">George Hayes, by his will, devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate, real and personal, to his executors, in trust to sell and invest at their discretion, \u201cand to appropriate and use the principal or income thereof, for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u2022founding and supporting, or uniting in the support of any institution that may be then founded, to furnish a retreat and home for disabled or aged and infirm and deserving American mechanics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The primary, if not the only, intention of the testator evidently was that his bounty should go to a single institution, \u201c a retreat and home for disabled or aged and infirm and deserving American mechanics,\u201d either by founding, as well as supporting, a new institution, or by aiding in the support of one founded by others. The validity of the charitable trust is undoubted, notwithstanding that the trustees might appropriate the fund to an institution established after the testator\u2019s death. <em>Jones </em>v. Habersham, 107 U. S. 174, 191 ; <em>Curran's </em>Appeal, 4 Pennypacker, 331; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bryn Mawr College, </em>7 Stewart, (34 N. J. Eq.) 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The execution of this trust was committed by the, testator to the executors named in the will, first, to Jabez W. Hayes and Lewis'E. Wells, and next, in the event of the death of either or both of these, to Dundas Pratt and Horace H. Nichols, successively. So long as any one of the four is living, and has not declined the office of executor, or been shown to be unsuitable, no other person can execute the trust. And it is doubtful, to say the least, whether the trust is not such a personal Confidence reposed by the testator in th\u00bf persons named, that it would in no event pass to an administrator with the will annexed, but must, if all those named in the will should die before full performance of the trust, be executed by a trustee specially appointed for the purpose. <em>Ingle </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>9 Wall. 486, 497, 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Of the two executor\u2019s first named, Jabez W. Hayes being a citizen of New Jersey, and Lewis E. Wells a citizen of Pennsylvania, each proved the will and took out letters testamentary; in his own State, and assumed the care and management of the property in that State, and Wells also took control of the property in Michigan. But such an arrangement, however convenient, cannot affect the duty of either or both of the executors, or of the court, to see that the trust is carried out according to the testator\u2019s intention. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"AAl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The testator was born and for many years lived in New Jersey, but his domicil at the time of his death and for ten years before was in Pennsylvania. . A small part only of his property was in New Jersey, and the greater part was in Pennsylvania and Michigan. The Hayes Mechanics? Home was incorporated within thirteen months after his death by his partner, by Wells, his Pennsylvania executor, by Pratt, now his executor, and by other citizens of Pennsylvania, under the laws of that State, for the purpose of founding and supporting \u201c a retreat and home for disabled, aged or infirm and deserving American \u2022 mechanics,\u201d as contemplated in his will. Wells settled his account as executor in the proper court of Pennsylvania, and paid over the balance of personal property in his hands to the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home, and also, by order of that court, conveyed to that corporation the lands in Pennsylvania and in Michigan; and the validity of the payment and conveyance has not been impugned. In short, the whole of the residue of the testator\u2019s property, real and personal, except the comparatively small amount now in controversy, has been appropriated, with the approval of the legislature and of the courts of his domicil, in a manner to carry out his' charitable intent in accordance with the letter and spirit of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Jabez W. Hayes, the executor appointed in New Jersey, died in January, 1882, having done nothing towards carrying out the charitable intent of the testator, beyond obtaining the advice of counsel that the executors (not that he alone) might lawfully appropriate the property in New Jersey to the support of the Hospital of St. Barnabas in Newark.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">After his death, Henry Hayes was appointed by the orphans\u2019 court in New Jersey to be administrator of.theunadministered <em>\u201c </em>goods, chattels and credits \u201d of George Hayes in New Jersey. As already indicated, it is difficult to see how this appointment could, give him any title in or power over the real estate devised to the executors' in trust. But if it can be treated as vesting in him the title to the real estate in New Jersey, it.certainly did not authorize him to undertake the performance of the charitable trust created by the will, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>long as Pratt, one of the alternative executors and trustees therein named, was still alive, had never declined the trust, and had not even known, until recently, of the existence of any estate of the testator not already disposed of according to his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Moreover, to apply the fund, received by the defendant from the sale of the real estate in New Jersey, to the maintenance of a free bed in the Hospital of St. Barnabas under the charter and rules of that institution, would be much less in accord with the intention of the testator, as expressed in his will, than to add this fund to his other property already devoted to the foundation and support of the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Both the original executors being dead, and Pratt, the successor next named in the will, having been appointed sole executor in their stead, he is the only person authorized to execute the charitable trust of the\u2019 testator, so far as anything remains to be done with regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">It was objected that Pratt, as executor appointed in Pennsylvania, could not sue in New Jersey without taking out letters testamentary in that State. But this objection is answered by the statute of New Jersey of 1879, c. 16, which enacts that <em>\u201c </em>any executor or administrator, by virtue of letters obtained in another State, may prosecute any action in any court of this State, without first taking out letters in this State: provided such executor or administrator shall, upon commencing suit, file in the office of the clerk of the court in which such suit shall be brought an exemplified copy of the record of his or their appointment,\u201d which has been done in this case. New Jersey Acts of 1879, p. 28; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>143 U. S. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">It was further objected that sinoe the orphans\u2019 court Bad been vested by the statute of New Jersey of 1872, c. 340, with the power, upon allowing the accounts of executors, or of administrators with the will annexed, to order distribution of the residue in accordance with the will, application should have been made to that , court. New Jersey Aots of 1872, p. 47, But the statutes of the State conferring jurisdiction upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the orphans! court do not even affect the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of New Jersey over the settlement of estates. <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Demarest, </em>1 C. E. Green, (16 N. J. Eq.) 236; <em>Coddington </em>v. <em>Bispham, </em>9 Stewart, (36 N. J. Eq.) 224, 574; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>17 Stew. (44 N. J. Eq.) 6. Certainly, no such statutes can defeat or impair the general equity jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States to .administer, as between citizens of different States, the assets of a deceased person within its jurisdiction. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>23 How. 90; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>7 Wall. 425 ; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>143 U. S. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The defendant, as administrator with the will annex\u00e9d of George Hayes, having received money from th.e income and sale of his real estate, and settled his account therefor in the court which appointed him, and having, without any order of court, and without right, and with notice of Pratt\u2019s claim, paid the money <em>fo </em>the Hospital of St. Barnabas, taking from that corporation a bond of indemnity, was rightly held liable to'account for it, with interest from the date when he so settled his account after having determined so to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">There being no one in New Jersey having any right to or claim upon this fund, and no special reason being shown for administering it in New Jersey, it should, upon familiar principles, be transmitted to the executor appointed at the testator\u2019s domicil for distribution. <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Ellett, </em>9 Wall. 740, 742; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>1 Mason, 381, 412, 413; <em>Normand </em>v. <em>Grognard, </em>2 C. E. Green (17 N. J. Eq.) 425, 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Pratt, being the executor appointed in the State of the testator\u2019s \u00a1domicil, and the trustee charged with the administration of the charitable trust, is the only person entitled to maintain this suit. The joinder of the Hayes Mechanics\u2019 Home as a plaintiff was unnecessary, and perhaps improper; but not having been objected to, by demurrer or otherwise, in the court below, it affords no ground for refusing relief. The decree of the Circuit Court is irregular in that it directs payment to be made to Pratt as .treasurer of the Hayes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Mechanics\u2019 Home, instead of to him as executor, and is therefore to be amended in that particular, and,</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><em>So </em>amended, <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b597-5\">Mr. Justice Shiras, not having beeit a member of the court when this case was argued, took no part in its decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
