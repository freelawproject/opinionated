Bennett alleged that Cantu, as a common carrier, through Ms agent, Q. Rodriguez, on April 6, 1865, received from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>W. <em>A. </em>Bennett <em>&amp; Co., </em>at Piedras Negras, in Mexico, a sum of $28,000 coin, to be delivered to W.' A. Bennett at San Antonio, Texas, and that Cantu had failed to deliver $24,000 thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">The bill of lading, a Spanish document made in Mexico;, was attached to the petition as a part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">An attachment was sued out and levied upon the train \u25a0 belonging to Cantu, which was sold for $3290 under an order of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">Cantu, by plea of <em>non est factvm, </em>denied the execution of the bill of lading, and alleged that the money was taken from Quirino Rodriguez in the night by superior force of the soldiers of the Confederate States, then at-war with the United States, without any negligence, default or want of due care on the part of Rodriguez.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">That the bill of lading was made and delivered at' Piedras Negras, Mexico; that the Mexican laws relative-to common carriers were different from the English common law, excusing the carrier if the loss was caused by superior force, and that they govern the adjudication of' controversies arising under the bill of lading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">He alleged that the suing out \"of the attachment was-malicious and wrongful, and so, too, the sale of the property, estimating his damages at $17,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">That war existed between the United States and the Confederate States; that Piedras Negras, the place where the bill of lading was made, was in Mexico, a neutral country;. - that the freight was contraband of war;' that the commerce' carried on between W. A. Bennett &amp; Co., in Piedras Negras, and W. A. Bennett, of San Antonio, was illicit and against law; that such commerce was carried on through the town of Eagle Pass, in Texas, a port closed by the proclamation of the President of the United States and by acts of Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-12\">Bennett moved to strike out the answer so far as it set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>up the illegality of the transaction, and the court sustained the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\">It appeared that Martin Muench (who, with W. A. Bennett, composed the firm W. A. Bennett &amp; Co., and who had an interest of $4000 or more in the coin shipped), made an agreement with Quirino Rodriguez, the conductor of the train of A. Cantu, for the transportation of the coin.

They wanted to search the train, but being refused permission forced their way in, and before any alarm could be given, were upon the men of the train, disarmed them and took them off about a mile, where they guarded them until their confederates were off with the booty. The party consisted of about twenty-five to thirty soldiers in uniforms, armed with pistols, six-shooters and rifles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">Twenty-four thousand dollars were taken; the remainder was delivered to the consignee by Rodriguez.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">Verdict and judgment for Bennett for $11,210, from which Cantu appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">The eighth assignment of error refers to the exclusion by the court of the depositions of Mexican attorneys relative to the legality of the bill of lading, and the interpretation of the same under the laws of Mexico.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-9\"><em>W.

This suit grew out of a transaction which may be briefly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">W. A. Bennett and his partner, Martin Muench, early in the month of April, 1865, during the late civil war, wanted to bring some $28,000 of silver coin from Peidras Negras, in Mexico, to San Antonio, Texas, for what purpose the statement of facts does not inform us in direct terms. Ambrosio Cantu, of Monterey, Mexico, was the owner of a train of mule teams, which, the evidence tells us, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>been engaged during the greater period of the war in hauling cotton from Texas to Mexico. It appears that W. A. Bennett &amp; Co. had two places of business, one at San Antonio, Texas, and the other at' Piedras Negras, Mexico; and the fact is irresistibly forced upon our mind, as a deduction from all the facts in this case, that these men were engaged in a contraband trade, and that their object in bringing a large sum of money, to-wit, $28,000, from Mexico to Texas at the time they made the shipment, was to enable them to carry on this contraband trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">On the fifth of April, 1865, although most of the Confederate forces in the field had surrendered, the war was not declared at an end until long afterwards, nor had the blockade, established under the non-intercourse acts of July 13, 1861, and May 20, 1862, been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of the <em>Reform, </em>3 Wal,, 617, says: \u201cThe act of July 13, 1861, to provide <em>for the collection of duties on imposts, </em>and for other purposes, and xvhich, by one section, on a proclamation made by the President, makes intercourse between citizens of those parts of the United States in insurrection against its government with citizens of the rest of the United States unlawful, \u2018so long as such condition of hostilities should continue,\u2019 was not a temporary act, though passed during the late Rebellion; nor on the cessation of hostilities did forfeitures which had been incurred after proclamation, under that section, cease to be capable of enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u2022We do not propose to hold the shipment of this coin as contraband because it was probably intended to purchase cotton, for the evidence does not warrant a statement of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">But in the case of Gay\u2019s gold, 13 Wallace, 358, the court hold: 1. The treasury regulation No. 22, forbidding all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>transportation of coin or bullion to any State or section declared by the President\u2019s proclamation to be in insurrection, was valid, and was authorized by the act of May 20, 1862. 2. Gold coin in packages, and not used for traveling expenses, was merchandise in 1864, in point of fact, and was within the mischief to be remedied by the non-intercourse acts of July 31, 1861, and May 20, 1862. 3. The proclamation of pardon and amnesty of President Johnson of December 25, 1865, was limited to persons \u201cwho participated in the late insurrection or rebellion,\u201d and to the offense of \u201c treason against the United States, or adhering to their enemies during the late civil war.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The rule here laid down cannot be mistaken as the rule which must govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In the case of the schooner <em>John Gilpin </em>and cargo, Blatchford\u2019s Prin. Cases, 291, the court say: \u201cTrade of <em>every </em>description with an enemy during war is, by the law of nations, inhibited to the subjects of the nation prosecuting the war.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">And by statute (12 U. S. Stat. at Large, 257), all commercial intercourse between the citizens of the loyal States and those belonging to the insurrectionary States is unlawful, and the property acquired through such intercourse is subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The same doctrine is laid down in the United States v. Wythenbury, Revenue Cases, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">There is a learned discussion and a very clear definition of what is contraband in the Peterhoff, 5 Wallace, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">We will not discuss this branch of the case further at present,' but will now notice the sixth and seventh assignments for error. They relate to the admission of hearsay evidence, and this was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">The eighth assignment brings us to a more interesting question.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">The appellant proposed in the court below to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>law of Mexico governing the liability of common carriers, which the court ruled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">There has been much discussion in the books and with the courts touching the <em>lex loci </em>contractu, the <em>lex domicilii., </em>the <em>lex loci rei </em>sitae, the <em>lex </em>fori, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">But so much of the law touching these questions as can have any reference to this case is summed up in few words ok pages 318 and 319 of Parsons Mercantile Law, <em>2 </em>Edition. \u201cThe general principles upon which the law of place depends are four: First, every sovereignty can bind by its laws all persons and all things within the limits of the State. Second, no law has any force or authority of its own beyond those limits. Third, by the comity of nations, aided in our case as to the several States by the peculiar and close relation between the States and for some purposes by a constitutional' provision, the laws of foreign States have a qualified force and influence, which it is perhaps impossible to define or describe with precision. The fourth of these general rules is, that a contract which is not valid where it is made, is valid nowhere else; and one which is valid where it is made, is valid everywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u201cAs contracts relate either to movable or immovables, or, to use the phraseology of our own law, to personal or to real property, the following distinction is taken: If the contract refers to personal property (which never has a fixed place, and is therefore called, in some systems of law, movable property), the place of the contract governs by its law the construction and effect of the contract. But if the contract refers to real property, it is construed and applied by the law of the place where that real property is situated, without reference, so far as the title is concerned, to the law of the place of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">To the same point see Kent\u2019s Com., Vol. <em>2, </em>454; Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The civil law as in force in Mexico does not hold a carrier responsible where the subject of the bailment is taken away or destroyed by a <em>vis </em>major, and robbery is so considered when perpetrated by an irresistible force. (Domat, 484; Story on Bailments, Secs. 26, 458, 459, 488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The bill of lading signed by Rodrigeuz, the major domo, or train master, for the coin, which'has become the subject- matter of this suit, shows that it was executed on the sixth day of April, 1865, at Piedras Negras, Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The bailment was of personal property, which, according to Parsons, has no fixed place, and is movable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">If, then, the contract in this case had been otherwise legal and binding, it must have been enforced in accordance with the law of Mexico. And the court, treating it as a valid contract, should have admitted the evidence in proof of the law of that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">But for the reasons already given we cannot enforce this contract, nor can we award damages for its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The judgment in this case must follow our own rulings in Whitis v. Polk, 26 Texas, 602, and Converse v. Miller, 33 Texas, 216, and is therefore reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Reversed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
