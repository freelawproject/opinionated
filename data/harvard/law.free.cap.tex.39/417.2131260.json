W. R.

Flint, 30 Texas, 383, and the analogous reasoning in Page v. Holliman, 31 Texas, 158, and Davidson v. Peticolas, 34 Texas, 34, we cannot hesitate to decide that it is not a statute of limitation' in that sense; nor can the facts of this case entitle the appellant to a variance of the application of the rule to his case, notwithstanding his residence has been in a far distant State. '</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The administration had been open for more than six years before the claim in controversy was presented for acceptance and allowance, and nearly five years had elapsed after the civil courts of Texas wer\u00e9 fully thrown open to litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">We find no error in the judgment of the court below, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
