Ebenezer Allen sold to Baker one hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock in the Houston and \u00bfTexas Central Railway Company under a contract dated July 9, 1859. Payment was to be made for the stock on the thirtieth of June, 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The war coming on, Allen went into the service of the Confederacy, leaving his wife and child in Texas. Owing, perhaps, to the necessities of Mrs. Allen, she accepted the payments, under authority from her husband, in advance of maturity. In 1863 Allen died, leaving his entire property to his wife, and appointing her the executrix of his will. Mrs. Allen appears to have taken a considerable estate by the devise over and above what was necessary to pay debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The defendant payed ofi his indebtedness in Confederate money. The receipt of Confederate money by Mrs. Allen as the agent of her husband, without an express authority to receive Confederate money, would not have discharged the debt, nor would her receipt as executrix of her husband\u2019s 'will have discharged the debt if there were other heirs, legatees or creditors to complain; but Mrs. Allen is sole legatee under her husband\u2019s will, and a handsome estate remains to her, after the payment of debts; and in the absence of fraud, covin, misrepresentation or undue influence, she must be bound by her contracts ; and though, in this case, the contract was executed in Confederate money, it is nevertheless an executed contract, against which this court can grant no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Aeeirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>M. A. </em>Long, for appellant, filed an able argument for rehearing, which being obtained, he submitted a brief contesting the authority and application of the case relied upon and reported in 32 Texas, 333, of Richie v. Sweet. \u201cThat decision was a mere dictum, the question of Confederate money not necessarily\u00bb arising. The report itself shows that Sweet collected the note sued on in Confederate money when that currency was of par <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>value, and like coin could be used to buy cotton at the current rate of nine cents per pound.\u201d The note having thus been once fully paid, should not have been again demanded. The second demand was unjust and absurd. There was therefore no occasion for the court to have uttered the dictum about an \u201cillegal executed contract,\u201d or to speculate about the effect of substituting an illegal contract for a legal one, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It was also contended that the case of Richie v. Sweet was not a decision of the Supreme Court of Texas, but only by a provisional military tribunal of final resort, appointed by the General of the United States Army commanding the department of Western Texas. The so-called judges, so appointed, held their offices during the pleasure of the officer commanding, and not for the term designated by the Constitution of this State. In no proper sense could such a temporary military tribunal be respected as the Supreme Court of Texas, however learned and able its members. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b233-7\">McAdoo, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AN\"><em>on </em>rehearing.\u2014Ebenezer Allen held a written obligation of the appellee, W. R. Baker, for the sum of $7500, executed June 30, 1859, payable five years after date.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">On December 11, 1862, Allen (who was at the time in the Confederate military service at Columbia, S. C.) wrote the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\u201c <em>W. It. </em>Baker, <em>Esq.:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201cSib: Please pay to my wife, Mrs. S. J. Allen, all or any portion of the sum of $7500, which will become due and payable from you to me, upon contract for railroad stock, sometime in June (say on or about the twenty-ninth day of that month), 1864, deducting, if you choose, ten per cent, from the day of payment until maturity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the debt, and her receipt or receipts shall be as good and valid to you therefor as my own would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">(Signed) \u201cEbenezer Allen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Before this letter was received by Baker, he had paid a small portion of the debt to Mrs. Allen. Payments were made from time to time, until May 15, 1863, when the last payment was made, Mrs. Allen endorsing on the note the several payments. The payments were made in Confederate money.</p>\n<p id=\"AC7\">In the fall of 1863, after the note had been paid off, Ebenezer Allen died at Richmond, Va. He left a will, his wife being sole executrix and sole devisee and legatee of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">She accepted the estate and filed an inventory. The will was proven up in 1864, and in April of that year she received from Baker one hundred and fifty shares of Central Railroad stock,. which Baker held for Ebenezer Allen, as trustee, and which said shares of stock were mentioned in the same obligation of Baker for $7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">She executed to Baker the following receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">\u201cReceived of W. R. Baker the one hundred find fifty shares of Central Railroad stock named in above contract held by him as trustee; and the agreement to pay $7500 having been heretofore paid, the above contract is declared settled, canceled and annulled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">\u201cHouston, April35, 1864.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">(Signed) \u201c Josephine Allen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">This last receipt was executed about a year after the last payment was made, and after the death of Ebenezer Allen\u2014after the probate of the will, after the return of the inventory, and after she had taken charge of the estate as executrix and legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">The inventory (showing about $30,000 of assets) did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>not embrace the claim against Baker for \u00a77500, though it did include the one hundred and fifty shares of railroad stock embraced in the same contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The entire indebtedness of the estate of Ebenezer Allen amounted to less than $2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It has been the uniform ruling of this court that contracts based on payment in Confederate money, or tainted with Confederate money considerations, would' not and could not be enforced by the courts in this State. But we have also held, and see no reason to change the ruling, that those who have voluntarily executed their contracts, paid and received, in satisfaction of demands, Confederate money, would be left by the courts precisely where they had placed themselves. We see no reason and know no authority for interference in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">This is not an action by creditors of Ebenezer Allen, but of his surviving wife, who acted as his authorized agent, who, in his absence long continued from the State, would have been competent, we think, to act without his special authority; who is his sole legatee; who ratified her own acts as agent after she became alone responsible for them, and who does not, in our judgment, present such equities as entitles her to any relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
