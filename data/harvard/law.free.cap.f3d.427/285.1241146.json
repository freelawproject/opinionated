Responding to the request, counsel for Norwegian Cruise Line raised for the first time fact-based mootness and standing issues that are contested by counsel for Douglas Spector, et al. To properly address these jurisdictional issues and, if appropriate, the remaining issues in the case, we must remand. In doing so, we note only that the district court\u2019s original basis for denying relief\u2014the Government\u2019s failure to promulgate uniform physical accessibility guidelines for cruise ships\u2014has not been eliminated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as at least a factor in the liability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
