(Gen. Const. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 25; <em>Gilbert </em>v. Johnson, 169 App. Div. 840; <em>Gribbon </em>v. <em>Frell, </em>93 N. Y. 93; <em>Binder </em>v. <em>Metropolitan St. Ry.

Because April fifteenth fell on a Sunday, the plaintiff postponed sending the notice by registered mail till April sixteenth. We do not pass upon the question whether section 25 of the General Construction Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 22) has any application to a contract which does not require the performance of a condition on a public holiday, but merely provides that an option must be exercised on or before a date which happens to fall on a Sunday. (See <em>Joannides </em>v. <em>Assimacy, </em>216 App. Div. 133; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Shainwald, </em>169 N. Y. 246.) Here the contract provided in addition, <em>\u201c </em>Should, however, the seller\u2019s attorney not receive the registered notice herein referred to on or before April 16th, 1928, then and in such event the right of the purchasers to cancel the contract shall be deemed to have expired.\u201d The terms of section 25 of the General Construction Law can have no application to that provision. The notice was received on April seventeenth. Then the right had by its terms expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that of the Special Term affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Cabdozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, Lehman, Kellogg, O\u2019Brien and Hubbs, JJ., concur,</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
