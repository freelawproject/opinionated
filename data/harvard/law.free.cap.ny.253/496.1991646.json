Even so, there has been no abandonment of the contention that the notes are within the purview of the defendant\u2019s bond. Our duty does not require us to reject a contention sound in its ultimate conclusion because the path that we follow is different from the one marked out for us in the argument of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Cardozo, Ch.
