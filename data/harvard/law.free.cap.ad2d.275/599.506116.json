If said condition is not met, the order is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Under the present circumstances, and in light of our strong policy favoring resolution of disputes on their merits, the lack of prejudice to plaintiffs, the relatively short delay in bringing the underlying motion, and the absence of willful or contumacious conduct on the part of defendants, it was an improvident exercise of discretion to strike defendants\u2019 answer <em>(see, Quality Jewelry Co. v Marcovici, </em>247 AD2d 280, 281; <em>Matter of Kaufman v Board of Educ., </em>210 AD2d 226). If defendants are unable to produce defendant Ally Mohamed for examination before trial within a period to be set by the motion court, then we find that a sufficient sanction would be to preclude the use of Mohamed\u2019s testimony at trial <em>(see, Heyward v Benyarko, </em>82 AD2d 751).
