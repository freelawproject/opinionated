In order to qualify as a serious injury within the meaning of the no-fault statute, a \u201cpermanent loss of use\u201d must be total <em>(Oberly v Ambulance, </em>96 NY2d 295, 297 [2001] [internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>tion marks omitted]). The plaintiff Darlene Albury did not sustain a total loss of use of any body part or organ. Therefore, the court properly declined to charge the jury on this category of serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The amount of the damages awards in question did not deviate materially from what would be reasonable compensation <em>(see </em>CPLR 5501).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Skelos, J.P., Santucci, Dickerson and Roman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
