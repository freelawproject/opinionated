It was found that the compensation of the guardian for the care and management of the estate should be $1,500. The other question is as to compensation for support and education. The guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>dian charges $75 per month for the period. Both the ward and her mother derived a considerable estate from the father of the ward, which yields income, and the guardian has married the mother, and has property and income of his own. Four children have been born of this last marriage, and all reside together. The ward, now seventeen years of age, requests that the guardian be allowed the sum asked by him. The guardian has treated the ward kindly, and educated her according to her condition in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Note.\u2014A warrant of commitment was issued and the party lodged in jail.
