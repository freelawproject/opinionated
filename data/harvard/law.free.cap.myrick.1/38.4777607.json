(36 Cal., 329, as to devise.) The statute uses these words, legacy and devise, as convertible terms. The Hew York statute says, \u2018/may devise real and personal property.\u201d 1 Bradf., 116. The popular meaning of the word \"relation\u201d should be taken. Webst. Dic. adopted, 2 Sand. Ch., 506. Meaning of this statute: 3 Bradf., 317; 7 Mass., 86; 18 Pick., 43; 1 Vesey, sen., 84. The statute should be construed liberally.

Testatrix died Sept. 22, 1872. Petitioner asks for distribution of the legacy, claiming the same as heir of Louis W. The executor resists the application on two grounds: First, that under Section 1310, C. C., the term <em>devise </em>limits the application of the section to real estate; Second, that Louis W. was not a relative of testatrix, and the legacy lapsed, he dying before testatrix. The first point is not well taken. The word devise is generally applied to \u2022passing real estate by will, but is not necessarily exclusive. The second point is well taken. A step-son is not a relation within the meaning of Sec. 1310, C. C. <em>Esty, adm'r, </em>v. <em>Clark </em>101 Mass., 36, is a decision under a similar statute, and is directly in point. It is there decided that a wife is not a relation of the husband within the meaning of the statute, and that her son by a former husband will not succeed to her rights by virtue of the statute.
