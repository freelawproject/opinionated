Doyle and John H. Eedington, executors of the last will and testament of Margaret T. Clarke, deceased, demur to the petition filed herein by Daniel Wallace, and allege as grounds of demurrer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">1. That said petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action, or to show that petitioner is entitled to file the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">2. That said petition is uncertain in this:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">That it does not set forth the nature of the restraint under which said will is asserted to have been signed, nor by whom the same was imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">3. That it does not set forth the nature of the undue influence alleged to have been exercised over the said Margaret T. Clarke, nor by whom the same was exercised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">4. That it does not set forth the nature or character of the alleged fraudulent representations, under which the said will is alleged to have been signed, nor what the said fraudulent representations actually were, nor in what respect they were fraudulent, nor by whom they were made.</blockquote>\n<author id=\"b282-15\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"AMK\">(Nov. 26, 1879.) The demurrer is overruled as to point No. 1, for the reason that the demurrer is general; not directed to any particular part of the petition. There is at least one proper allegation in the petition, viz: that at the time of signing the supposed will, said Margaret T. Clarke was not of sound and disposing mind. An allegation of unsound mind is a proper averment of a fact.. Where there is one proper allegation, a \"general demurrer will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">As to points Nos. 2, 3 and 4, the demurrer is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In alleging either restraint, nndne influence, or fraud- \u2022 ulent representations, the facts which are the basis, of the allegation must be stated. Influence in executing a will is one thing, and may be quite proper; <em>undue </em>influence is another thing, quite improper. The facts constituting the supposed undue influence must be stated, so that the Court may determine whether the facts being found by the jury, as a matter of the law they constitute undue influence. So, as to restraint, and as to fraudulent representations. Representations may be quite commendable, while fraudulent representations would be reprehensible; whether the representations are fraudulent, or not, is a question of law, for the Court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">Dec. 6, 1879, petitioner filed an amended petition, stating the facts regarding the proceedings for probate, and the heirs and devisees, and legatees, as is the former petition, and then as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">That the following are the grounds on which your petitioner asks that the probate of said alleged will be revoked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">First\u2014That the said supposed will, so probated as aforesaid, is not the last will and testament of said Margaret T. Clarke, deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Second\u2014That long prior to, and at the time of the signing of said supposed will, by her, the said Margaret T. Clarke, deceased, she, the said Margaret T. Clarke, was not of sound and disposing mind, but was <em>non compos -mentis.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Third\u2014That at the time of the siguing of said supposed will, if the same ever was signed by her, the said Margaret T. Clarke, deceased, she, the said Margaret T. Clarke, signed the same under restraint, undue influence, and fraudulent misrepresentations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">That the restraint aforesaid, was of a moral nature, exerted by stronger wills over a weaker one, and that said restraint was so exerted by the aforesaid John T. Doyle, John H. Redington, Joseph S. Alemany, Rev. Father Bowman, Rev. Father Dempsey, and divers other persons, unknown to your petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>That the nature of the undue influence aforesaid, was such as to overpower the enfeebled\" and tottering intellect of the said deceased, to divert her affections from their natural and proper channel, and to prevent her from pursuing the course, in the disposition of her property, which she would have done, had such undue influence not been exercised, and particularly in the case of your petitioner, and that said undue influence was exerted upon her, the said deceased, by the aforesaid John T. Doyle, John H. Redington, J. S. Ale-many, Rev. Father Bowman, Rev. Father Dempsey, and by divers other persons, unknown to your petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">That the nature of the fraudulent representations, aforesaid, was such as wrongfully to prejudice said deceased against your petitioner, and to cause her to withdraw from him her usual and habitual affection, and to violate and disregard her promises and agreements, previously made and entered into with your petitioner, and on his behalf; to instil into her mind false notions of her relative obligations to your petitioner, and other members of her family, and to the Roman Catholic Church, and to pervert and to distort her views of duty, and of religious obligation, and to induce her to trust the bulk of her estate, without security, to comparative strangers, instead of following the natural and proper course in its disposition, which she would have done had such fraudulent representations not been made. That said fraudulent representations were made by the said John T. Doyle, John H. Redington, Joseph S. Alemany, Rev. Father Dempsey, Rev. Father Bowman, and by divers other persons, unknown to your petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Prayer and Verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The executors filed demurrer and answer to the amended petition; the demurrer is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">John T. Doyle and John H. Redington, executors of the last will and testament of Margaret T. Clarke, deceased, demur to the amended petition of Daniel Wallace, filed herein, for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">1. That said petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or to justify the relief prayed in said petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>2. That the same is uncertain in this: that the allegations contained in said petition, in respect to the alleged restraint, under which the said will was signed, are vague, indefinite and uncertain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">That the nature of the undue influence exercised over the said Margaret T. Clarke, is not set forth with sufficient certainty or precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">That the nature of the fraudulent representations under which the said will was signed, is not set forth with sufficient certainty or precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">That the persons by whom the said restraint was exerted, are not described with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">That the persons who exerted the said undue influence, are not described with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">That the persons who made the said fraudulent representations, are not described with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<author id=\"b285-9\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"AYf\">(Dec. 29, 1879.) The demurrer is overruled as to point No. 1, for the same reasons given in the ruling on the former demurrer, viz: there is at least one proper allegation in the complaint, to wit: of unsoundness of mind; and a general demurrer will be overruled if there is one proper allegation. As to point No. 2, the demurrer is sustained, except as to the statement that the persons by whom the restraint, undue influence and fraudulent representations were exercised and made, are not sufficiently described; as to those statements the demurrer is overruled. This petition states the <em>nature </em>of the restraint,, undue influence and fraudulent representations, but does not state <em>facts </em>tending to show either. As to the allegation of persons, it may be very true that the <em>persons </em>doing certain acts were unknown to petitioner, and yet a petition be good, if the facts be properly alleged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
