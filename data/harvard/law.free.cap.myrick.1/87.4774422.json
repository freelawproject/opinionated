In making the payment he cannot deplete the estate; he takes the risk that the property will sell for or will be of the value of the amount paid. If he desires not to take such risk, he may sell subject to the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The amount paid is allowed as a credit to the administrator.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
