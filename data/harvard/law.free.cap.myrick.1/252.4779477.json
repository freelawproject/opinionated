His duty and connection with estate lies simply in its administration for the payment of the debts. He cannot, therefore, properly be made a distributee of another estate. The true course should be to administer the estate of the heir or devisee, and distribute the interest which such decedent may have in the former estate to the proper parties, who may, when thus armed with their decree, apply for the share to which they may thereby be entitled in the estate of the first decedent as representing an heir or devisee thereof.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b272-8\">Construing sections, C.

A portion of the estate was devised to his wife, Johanna Cronin, who has since died testate, and administration of her estate is also pending. Both estates are ready for distribution. The direction of the Court is asked as to the proper mode of distribution; that is, whether the interest of the estate of Johanna Cronin in the estate of John Cronin, acquired by her through the will of her husband, should be distributed, in the distribution of the estate of John Cronin, to the executor of the will of Johanna Cronin, or to the devisees named in the will of Johanna Cronin.</p>\n<author id=\"b273-8\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"AsS\">It is not the province of an executor or administrator to take title on distribution; he administers upon the title of the testate or intestate, and the object of his administration is to pay the debts and ascertain who is entitled to the surplus. The proper course to pursue in these cases is, to close the estate of Johanna Cronin, by having distribution of her estate, including her interest in the estate of John Cronin, to her devisees, and then let those devisees go with the decree of distribution to the estate of John Cronin, and apply to have the interest of Johanna Cronin in the estate of John Cronin distributed to them as successors in interest of Johanna Cronin as found in the decree of distribution of her estate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The same principles would apply, as well to the estates of intestates as of testates.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Wm.

Daly.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The surviving daughter, Mary Cronin, then made application for the distribution of the whole estate to her as the only person entitled to the same under the will.
