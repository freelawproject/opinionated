In March, 1879, he gave notice to creditors to present their claims within four months. He has never presented or filed any report, exhibit, or account of his administration of the estate; no inventory was filed until Nov. 19, 1879, and after these proceedings were instituted; prior to April, 1879, he received more than $2,300 cash belonging to the estate; in July, 1879, he withdrew from the bank of the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society more than $4,000, and deposited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the same, with the other moneys received by him, in bank, in his individual name, mingled with his own funds, and not in any way distinguished; the moneys were not needed to pay current expenses. He has never deposited any of the funds of the estate with the City and County Treasurer. At least $4,000 should have been so deposited. In making his official semi-annual report as Public Administrator, to the Judge of this Court, it does not appear that up to June 30, 1879, he had received any property of said estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">The Court therefore finds that the administrator has wrongfully neglected the estate, and has failed to perform acts as such administrator which are required by law to be performed, viz: rendering account and inventory, depositing money in the County Treasury, and making semi-annual statement of the affairs of said estate; and it is ordered that the letters of administration of said estate heretofore granted be revoked in accordance with the prayer of petitioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
