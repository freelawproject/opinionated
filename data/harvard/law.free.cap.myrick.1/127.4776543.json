Upon Kehoe\u2019s death, Cronin was appointed administrator with the will annexed of the estate of McConnell. Cronin presented to the executor of Kehoe\u2019s will a claim for $3,876.95, the amount as above stated, which was allowed by the executor and approved by the Judge. The estate of Kehoe is insolvent. Cronin now applies for an order adjudging his claim' to be a preferred one, as a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ment, and directing that it be paid in full, there being funds sufficient if it be preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The point in issue is this: Did the settlement of the account of Kehoe as executor of McConnell\u2019s will constitute a judgment against him so as to entitle it to be preferred, under Sec. 1643, C. C. P. ?</p>\n<author id=\"b148-5\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"AAv3\">The decree settling the account is not a judgment within the section referred to. It has none of the indicia of a judgment; it does not necessarily bear interest as a judgment; it was merely an ascertainment that, from the matters involved in the settlement, there was that amount then in the hands of Kehoe.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
