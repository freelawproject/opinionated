C., 1402.</syllabus>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-11\"><em>W. W.

There should be an antagonism in the two rights. If the will had said, <em>\u201c </em>she shall renounce all claim to the property of the community,\u201d or words of like import, there would be no room for question; but the words of the will do not by necessary implication require her to forego her right as survivor in order to take as legatee; indeed, the words are consistent with the idea that he knew that she had some claim against him for money or other thing, and that he intended the legacies to be taken in place of asserting such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The widow is entitled to one-half the estate as survivor of the community, to the legacies named for her in the will, and to her share of the legacies named for the children who have deceased.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
