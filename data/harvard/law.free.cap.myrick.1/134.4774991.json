C.; on behalf of Fitzgerald that she will take that share as residuary legatee; and on behalf of the father that he will take the share as heir, and that Fitzgerald\u2019s interest is limited by the will to the one-half of the estate, as named in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The effect of Sec. 1313, C.

The \u201c Boys\u2019 Boman Catholic Orphan Asylum at San Bafael,\u201d being a charitable and benevolent society, the bequest to it is good, and the estate should be distributed according to the terms of the will.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
