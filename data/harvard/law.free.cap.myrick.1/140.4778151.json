It is dated; but no name is subscribed at the foot. The paper is complete in itself as to the disposition of property. It was found in the safe of the deceased. The name of the deceased appears in the paper at the commencement only, which reads thus: \u201cThis is the last will and testament of me, Philip Donoho,\u201d etc.</p>\n<author id=\"b160-12\">Mr. Pringle:</author>\n<p id=\"A9p\">The paper must be signed at the foot. Sec. 1277, Civil Code, which requires that an olographic will must be signed, is taken from the civil law, and the decisions under that law are that the signature must be at the foot. When a statute is taken from the civil law, we must go to the civil law decisions for authorities concerning it.</p>\n<author id=\"b160-13\">Mr. Loughborough:</author>\n<p id=\"AG9\">The common law decisions are uniform that the name may appear anywhere in the instrument.</p>\n<author id=\"b160-14\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"A44\">Sec. 1277 provides that an olographic will must be \u201c signed; \u201d Sec. 1276, relating to other wills provides that they must be \u201csubscribed at the end thereof;\u201d evidently recognizing a distinction. Even if the word \u201csigned\u201d in Sec. 1277, be taken from the civil law, it is a word known to the common law, and the common law decisions are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>used in ascertaining its meaning. It is not necessary that the name of the testator be <em>subscribed ut the end </em>of an olographic will; it is sufficient if the name appear anywhere in the instrument, provided the paper shows on its face that it is complete as a testamentary paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Objection overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
