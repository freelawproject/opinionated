Jones, wrote his name. The other witness, William H. Ford, wrote the abbreviation \u201cWm.\u201d and the first down stroke of the initial \u201cH.\u201d The second down stroke of the \u201cH.\u201d is indistinct but discernible; and there the signing stopped, as if the ink ceased to flow. Some faint marks as if of a pen point are discernible through a powerful glass, where the name \u201cFord\u201d should have been; but no letter can be traced. It is not a case of faded ink, but of failure to write. No person can tell from an examination of the paper whether the witness\u2019 name was William H. Ford or William H. Smith, or William H. anything. The word Ford is an essential part of the witness\u2019 name. Under these circumstances I must find that the witness Ford did not sign his name as a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ness, and it consequently follows that the proposed will of Feb\u2019y 24, 1876, was not properly executed and is not the will of deceased. The paper of Feb\u2019y 14, 1876, is properly executed, and is the will of deceased.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
