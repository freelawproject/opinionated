The Attorney-General claims an escheat. The half-brother can take nothing, as the father of an illegitimate does not inherit, nor can the father be a conduit. As to the right of the half-sisters, there is a conflict in the Code. Sec. 1387, C. C., provides that an illegitimate child <em>\u201c </em>does not represent his father or mother by inheriting any part of the estate of his or her kindred\u201d; while Sec. 1388 provides that if an illegitimate child dies intestate without issue, the estate goes to his mother, or in case of her decease, to her heirs-at-law. An illegitimate child is the heir of its mother. By Sec. 4484, Pol. Code, in case of conflicting sections the provisions of the section last in numerical order must prevail; therefore Sec. 1388 prevails, and the half-sisters, being heirs of the mother, she being dead, are entitled to the estate of the deceased.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
