We resolve two issues presented in this case: (1) whether the State must introduce the results of a chemical analysis to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the composition of that substance; and (2) whether the trial court erred by allowing the introduction of lay opinion testimony that the disputed substance was in fact crack cocaine. We conclude that proof based on scientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove the nature of a controlled substance, and that the State may base a conviction for the possession of a controlled dangerous substance solely upon circumstantial evidence. The lay opinion testimony in this case, however, was inadmissible because that evidence was not competent for the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">On November 20, 1994, Trooper Donald Harrison of the Maryland State Police was patrolling Route 4, just north of Leonardtown, Maryland. At 11:30 p.m., Trooper Harrison stopped an automobile for exceeding the posted speed limit. Robinson was seated in the front passenger seat. As Trooper Harrison approached the automobile, he observed Robinson making \u201csuspicious and furtive movements toward the floorboard of the vehicle.\u201d When the driver of the car was unable to produce either a driver\u2019s license or a registration card, Trooper Harrison ordered both the driver and Robinson out of the automobile. A subsequent \u201cwanted check\u201d revealed an outstanding parole retake warrant for Robinson. During a search of Robinson at the side of the road, the trooper seized a plastic container concealed in Robinson\u2019s sock. Inside the container was a transparent plastic baggie holding eight rocks that Trooper Harrison believed to be crack cocaine. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>trooper arrested Robinson and transported him to the Leon-ardtown police barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">At the Leonardtown barracks, Robinson was handcuffed to the desk of Trooper Harrison. The trooper then placed the plastic baggie containing the suspected crack cocaine on his desk. Accommodating Robinson\u2019s request to use the bathroom, Trooper Harrison removed the handcuffs, allowing Robinson to be escorted to and from the bathroom by Trooper Mark Karwaeki. Upon his return from the bathroom, Robinson suddenly ran away from Karwaeki and hurled himself at Trooper Harrison. Pinning Trooper Harrison against a wall, Robinson initially punched and kicked Harrison. Moments later, Robinson began to repeatedly punch and kick Trooper Karwaeki as well. During the fracas, Robinson seized the baggie containing the eight rocks and swallowed it. Shortly thereafter, Robinson was taken to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, where he remained for several days. Neither the rocks nor the baggie were ever recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">As a result of this incident, Robinson was charged by criminal information with, <em>inter alia, </em>possession of cocaine in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 287(a), possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of \u00a7 286(a), and two counts of common law battery. Robinson was subsequently tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since Robinson ingested the suspected cocaine, neither the substance itself nor a chemical analysis was introduced at trial. The State\u2019s proof as to the identity of the chemical composition of the suspected contraband was based primarily on the visual identification of the substance by Troopers Harrison and Karwaeki.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Trooper Harrison testified that he got a \u201cgood look\u201d at the baggie and its contents when it was on his desk. He described the substance he seized from Robinson as eight crystalline rocks with jagged edges, creamy-yellowish in color, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>with each rock between an eighth of an inch and a quarter of an inch in length.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor then asked Trooper Harrison to give his opinion as to the identity of the substance that he seized from Robinson. Defense counsel objected on the grounds that Harrison was not an expert in narcotics identification, and therefore was not qualified to identify the contraband based upon sight alone. The trial judge overruled the objection and Trooper Harrison testified that the suspected contraband seized from Robinson was, in his opinion, crack cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The State then called Trooper Karwacki to the witness stand. Karwacki testified that he had handled and observed the suspected contraband at the Leonardtown barracks. Specifically, he stated that he removed the transparent baggie from its plastic container and \u201ccould see the eight pieces clearly.\u201d After the State established Karwacki\u2019s credentials,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>he was also permitted, over the objection of defense counsel, to offer his opinion that the substance seized from Robinson was crack cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury convicted Robinson of possession of crack cocaine and two counts of battery. The trial judge sentenced Robinson to eight years incarceration for the battery of Trooper Harrison, four years incarceration for the cocaine possession, to be served consecutive to the battery of Trooper Harrison, and eight years incarceration, suspended, for the battery of Trooper Karwacki.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Robinson noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed Robinson\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We then granted Robinson\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Before this Court, Robinson seeks to reverse his conviction for possession of cocaine on a number of grounds. Initially, he argues that proof of a controlled substance may be established only through chemical analysis. Robinson also contends that the testimony of Troopers Harrison and Karwacki was inadmissible because, after only a visual inspection of the alleged contraband, they could not rationally conclude that the substance was in fact crack cocaine. In contrast, the State argues that the trial court properly admitted the lay testimony of Troopers Harrison and Karwacki because their training and experience assisted the jury in determining whether the sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>pected cocaine was in fact a controlled substance. Thus, reasons the State, any infirmity in this visual identification by the troopers goes to the weight of that testimony, and not to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Robinson argues in the first instance that proof of the chemical composition of the alleged controlled substance may be established solely by chemical analysis. We disagree. The result advocated by Robinson would deviate from a fundamental evidentiary principle: Circumstantial evidence is in no manner intrinsically inferior to direct evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State v. Gray, </em>344 Md. 417, 424 n. 5, 687 A.2d 660, 664 n. 5, <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 117 S.Ct. 2452, 138 L.Ed.2d 210 (1997); <em>Mangum v. State, </em>342 Md. 392, 398-400, 676 A.2d 80, 82-84 (1996). \u201c \u2018[W]hether direct evidence or circumstantial evidence is more trustworthy and probative depends upon the particular facts of the case and no generalizations realistically can be made that one class of evidence is per se more reliable than is the other class of evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 225, 627 A.2d 1029, 1032 (1993) (quoting <em>State v. Gosby, </em>85 Wash.2d 758, 539 P.2d 680, 685 (1975)). In a given case, circumstantial evidence may be <em>more </em>persuasive than direct evidence. <em>E.g., Janifer v. Jandebeur, </em>551 A.2d 1351, 1352 (D.C.1989) (citing <em>Michalic v.

We note that the great weight of authority from other state and federal courts recognizes that circumstantial or indirect evidence may be sufficient, standing alone, to establish the nature of a controlled substance. <em>United States v.

While we need not define today the precise limits of our holding, we observe that a contrary decision would bar the State from proving the identity of a controlled substance beyond a reasonable doubt <em>every </em>time the suspected substance is not recovered. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[i]llegal drugs will often be unavailable for scientific analysis because their nature is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>consumed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bernard, </em>575 A.2d at 1194 (quoting <em>United States v.

As we said in <em>Mangum, </em>neither policy nor logic supports any evidentiary distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence. <em>Mangum, </em>342 Md. at 398, 676 A.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Recognizing the prevailing view that the identity of a substance may be proven by circumstantial evidence, Robinson argues in the alternative that the opinion testimony of Troopers Harrison and Karwacki was inadmissible because a lay witness could not rationally identify a substance as crack cocaine based upon visual inspection alone. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In distinguishing between opinion testimony, as opposed to testimony detailing solely factual information, this Court has previously defined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">[a]n opinion [as] a belief based upon inferences drawn from ascertained or assumed facts, the soundness of which depends both on the truth of the premises and upon the knowledge, skill, and intelligence of the witness, and is to be distinguished from positive knowledge based upon the direct evidence of the senses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>Baltimore C. &amp; A. Rwy. Co. v. Turner, </em>152 Md. 216, 225, 136 A. 609, 612 (1927). This distinction between testimony conveying opinion, and testimony merely relating fact, was a product of the common law system of proof, and its exacting \u201cinsistence upon the most reliable sources of information.\u201d 1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 10, at 37 (J. Strong ed., 4th ed.1992). Born of this insistence upon reliability was the evidentiary rule that generally \u201cwitnesses are not allowed to testify to their opinions or conclusions on material matters, but must [only] state facts within their knowledge relevant1 to the issues.\u201d 2 Underhill\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 305, at 763 (P. Herrick rev., 5th ed.1956) (footnote omitted); <em>see 2 </em>Spenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>er A.

Averza, </em>223 Md. 12, 17, 161 A.2d 671, 675 (1960) (\u201c[T]he witness should not have been asked about her opinion or impression but only concerning facts and circumstances of which she was competent to speak.\u201d); <em>Flickinger v. Wagner, </em>46 Md. 580, 600 (1877) (\u201cThe answer ... would have been nothing more or less than the opinion of the witness, and therefore inadmissible.\u201d); <em>Law v. Scott, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 438, 458-59 (Md.1822) (\u201cThis is not [testimony] to facts only, resting in the immediate knowledge and recollection of the witness, but is a plain expression of his opinion ..., and we think ... wholly inadmissible.\u201d). Nonetheless, this Court has upheld the admission of lay opinion testimony with such frequency<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that one commentator has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>observed \u201c[t]here are so many exceptions that the general rule seems to be swallowed by them.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 603, at 328 (2nd ed.1993). Finally, our predecessors reasoned, on occasion, that certain opinions, by virtue of being testified to in court, can be transformed into facts. <em>See E.F. Enoch Co. v. Johnson, </em>183 Md. 326, 329, 37 A.2d 901, 903 (1944) (\u201cHe stated he saw \u2018an automobile going east.\u2019 This was not a conclusion---- And if it be conceded that the answer contained conclusions, it, nevertheless, contained the quoted statement to which the witness testified as a fact.\u201d); <em>Livingston v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>157 Md. 492, 499-500, 146 A. 432, 435 (1929) (\u201cSuch a conclusion, while called an opinion, has been described as \u2018knowledge at shorthand,\u2019 and has more of the elements of direct than of opinion evidence____ [I]t is regarded as a fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">In analyzing the admissibility of lay opinion testimony, writing for this Court almost a century ago, Judge (later Chief Judge) Boyd made the cogent observation that \u201c[i]t is sometimes difficult to draw the line between what is and is not admissible from a non-expert, when his opinion is offered in evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Tucker v. State ex rel. Johnson, </em>89 Md. 471, 477, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>43 A. 778, 780 (1899). We need not enter this legal labyrinth, however, because the admissibility of lay opinion testimony is now governed by Maryland Rule 5-701:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the \"witness\u2019s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Md. Rule 5-701. Except for minor stylistic changes, this rule is identical to Federal Rule of Evidence 701, and reflects the modern trend away from the traditional common law tenet that a lay witness may not express an opinion. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11, at 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">This retreat from the common law rule of inadmissibility of lay opinion testimony has led several courts and commentators to conclude that, although the burden of proof as to admissibility is on the proponent of evidence, the \u201cmodern trend favors admissibility of opinion testimony.\u201d <em>Virgin Islands v. Knight, </em>989 F.2d 619, 630 (3rd Cir.) (quotation marks and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 994, 114 S.Ct. 556, 126 L.Ed.2d 457 (1993); <em>see MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Wanzer, </em>897 F.2d 703, 706 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Teen-Ed, Inc. v. Kimball International, Inc., </em>620 F.2d 399, 403 (3rd Cir.1980); citing 3 Jack B. Weinstein, Evidence \u00a7 701[02], at 701-9 &amp; 701-17 (1978)); McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11, at 44-45. A trial court should, within the sound exercise of its discretion, admit lay opinion testimony if such testimony is derived from first-hand knowledge; is rationally connected to the underlying facts; is helpful to the trier of fact; and is not barred by any other rule of evidence. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. 594, 630, 616 A.2d 392, 410 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 963, 113 S.Ct. 2936, 124 L.Ed.2d 686 (1993); <em>Stebbing v.

Such testimony generally falls into one of two categories. Edward J. Imwinkelried, Evidentiary Foundations 241 (3rd ed.1995). The first category is lay opinion testimony where it is impossible, difficult, or inefficient to verbalize or communicate the underlying data observed by the witness. This Court long ago recognized the principle that relevant lay opinion testimony should be admitted in such circumstances, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL_\">There are ... cases where all the facts cannot be detailed to the jury, which are necessary for a proper understanding of the subject. In speaking of a precipice, or of the condition of a road which is ... dangerous for travel, or of numbers, weights, heights, distances, and other like subjects, it would rarely be practicable for a witness to give the jury a satisfactory idea of the things described, without stating his opinion of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>Baltimore &amp; Yorktown T. Rd. v. Leonhardt, </em>66 Md. 70, 78, 5 A. 346, 351 (1886). In other words, where the facts cannot otherwise be adequately presented or described to the jury, lay opinion testimony should be admitted. <em>United States v. Yazzie, </em>976 F.2d 1252, 1255 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Sheet, </em>665 F.2d 983, 985 (9th Cir.1982)). For instance, in <em>State v. Jones, </em>311 Md. 23, 532 A.2d 169 (1987), we upheld the admission of a lay opinion that an automobile was \u201ctrying to catch up with\u201d a police car. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 532 A.2d at 173-74. Because it would have been difficult or impossible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>for the witness in that case to fully convey this impression to the jury merely by reciting the underlying facts observed by that witness, the opinion was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The second broad category of lay opinion testimony is where \u201cthe lay trier of fact lacks the knowledge or skill to draw the proper inferences from the underlying data.\u201d Im-winkelried, <em>supra, </em>at 241. With this category of lay opinion testimony, to determine admissibility, the trial court properly focuses on the relative knowledge and experience of the witness versus the trier of fact. As an example, in <em>Scott v. Hampshire, Inc., </em>246 Md. 171, 227 A.2d 751 (1967), we allowed a former naval construction worker to offer a lay opinion as to the relative degree of safety connected with different methods of operating a crane. <em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 227 A.2d at 754. Although the plaintiff in <em>Scott </em>was not qualified as an expert, we concluded that his prior experiences and observations in the operation of cranes qualified him to offer lay opinion testimony in that case. <em>See also Ager v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>213 Md. 414, 419-20, 132 A.2d 469, 472 (1957) (allowing an experienced ambulance attendant to offer lay opinion testimony that an accident victim was \u201cfeigning\u201d injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Maryland courts have recognized that the specialized training, experience, and professional acumen of law enforcement officials often justify permitting a police officer to offer testimony in the form of lay opinion. <em>See, e.g., Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 31-32, 537 A.2d 612, 621-22, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 832, 109 S.Ct. 90, 102 L.Ed.2d 66 (1988). To restrict such testimony to underlying factual observations would often deprive the trier of fact of the necessary benefit of the percipient mind\u2019s prior experiences. In those circumstances, these prior experiences would be a <em>sine qua non </em>to a full understanding of the underlying factual data. <em>See Tu v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 486, 501, 631 A.2d 110, 117 (1993), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>336 Md. 406, 648 A.2d 993 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In this case, Troopers Harrison and Karwacki did not simply offer opinion testimony that the disputed substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>looked like </em>crack cocaine. Rather, the troopers expressed the opinion that, based on their training and experience, the alleged contraband <em>was in fact </em>crack cocaine. The determination of whether specific evidence is relevant in a given case rests with the trial court, and that determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404-05, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997); <em>State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 101, 517 A.2d 741, 747 (1986). As previously discussed, for lay opinion testimony to be admissible in the first instance, it must be derived from first-hand knowledge, rationally connected to the underlying facts, and helpful to the trier of fact. <em>See supra, </em>part III. A. Because we conclude that the lay opinion testimony of Troopers Harrison and Karwacki satisfied none of these threshold requirements, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting that testimony. We discuss each deficiency in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Personal Knowledge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The first-hand or personal knowledge prerequisite of Maryland Rule 5-701 derives from the rule\u2019s requirement that lay opinion testimony be based upon \u201cthe perception of the witness.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Md. Rule 5-701. Yet the act of perceiving, by itself, does not satisfy this requirement: \u201cEven if a witness has perceived a matter with his senses, the second component of personal knowledge requires that he has the experience necessary to comprehend his perceptions.\u201d 29 Charles A. Wright &amp; Victor J. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 6254, at 133 (1997) (footnote omitted). Thus, \u201cwhere the lay witness observes matters that can be comprehended only with specialized experience, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the witness has such experience.\u201d <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>see </em>Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 701.1, at 195-96 (1987); 1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 12, at 46 n. 22 (J. Strong ed., 4th ed. 1992) (\u201c[W]here relevancy requires, a foundation must be laid as to the witness\u2019 personal knowledge of facts to which the observed facts are being compared.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In the present case, the record demonstrates that the trial court would have been justified in concluding that Troopers Harrison and Karwacki had the training and experience to offer opinion testimony as to the visual appearance of crack cocaine. <em>See State v. Schofill, </em>68 Haw. 77, 621 P.2d 364, 369-70 (1980) (noting that a police officer not able to render an opinion that a \u201csubstance was in fact cocaine,\u201d still possessed the expertise \u201cto state that the substance \u2018appeared to be cocaine\u2019 \u201d). Yet neither trooper limited his testimony to identifying the visual characteristics of the disputed substance. Rather, both Harrison and Karwacki testified to the chemical nature of the alleged contraband. In response to the question, \u201cDo you have an opinion as to what the substance was?,\u201d Trooper Harrison stated, \u201cCrack cocaine\u201d; and Trooper Karwacki answered, \u201cThat it was, in fact, crack cocaine.\u201d In stark contrast to their relative abilities to perceive the <em>visual characteristics </em>of suspected crack cocaine, the record does not demonstrate that either Trooper Harrison or Trooper Karwacki had the training and experience necessary to accurately identify the <em>chemical nature </em>of that substance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Yet that is precisely what their testimony purported to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A case decided by our predecessors over a half century ago, <em>Smith v. State, </em>182 Md. 176, 32 A.2d 863 (1943), foreshadowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the result we reach today. In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant challenged the testimony of a lay witness who stated that a mattress was covered with spots of what the witness believed to be blood. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 32 A.2d at 866. In rejecting Smith\u2019s exception, the Court cited the general rule that \u201c \u2018non-experts have always been permitted to state their conclusions from the facts observed, [ ] that certain stains on clothing or other substances looked like or resembled blood stains, and to describe them by color or appearance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 32 A.2d at 867 (quoting 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 997 (11th ed.1935)). The Court indicated, however, that such opinion testimony was only admissible because \u201cthe evidence objected to as evidence of blood [was] from the laymen\u2019s point of view in appearance, and not from a scientific demonstration that it was blood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 32 A.2d at 867. The implication of <em>Smith </em>is that a lay witness may offer testimony as to the visual identity of a substance, but may not conclusively identify the chemical composition of the substance absent a showing that the witness possesses the training and experience necessary to accurately identify the chemical nature of that substance. <em>See Symington v. Graham, </em>165 Md. 441, 446-47, 169 A. 316, 318-19 (1933) (concluding that a woman who had experienced eight normal pregnancies was properly qualified to characterize the pain undergone during a ninth pregnancy as abnormal, but, absent medical training, unqualified to identify the cause of that abnormality); <em>see also </em>McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12, at 46 n. 22 (\u201cThus, a witness may not testify that something smelled like dynamite unless it is sufficiently established that the witness from prior experience knows what dynamite smells like.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Maryland law requires a witness to have personal knowledge \u201c \u2018sufficient to form a basis for the formation of rational opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingalls v. Trustees of Mt. Oak Methodist Church, </em>244 Md. 243, 258, 223 A.2d 778, 785 (1966) (quoting <em>Doyle v. Rody, </em>180 Md. 471, 481, 25 A.2d 457, 462 (1942)); <em>see also Wyatt v. Johnson, </em>103 Md.App. 250, 268, 653 A.2d 496, 505 (1995). We agree with the observation of Robinson\u2019s counsel at oral argument that the State could not introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the testimony of a qualified chemist as to the chemical composition of a substance unless such an opinion was based upon the scientific evidence necessary to support that opinion. Hence, it follows <em>a fortiori, </em>that a lay witness may not offer such an unsupported opinion based solely on visual observation. <em>See Lazard v. Merchants &amp; Min. Transp. Co., </em>78 Md. 1, 20-21, 26 A. 897, 900 (1893) (upholding the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow a witness to express an opinion not \u201cbased upon knowledge\u201d), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>17 S.Ct. 995, 41 L.Ed. 1178 (1897); <em>see also Viterbo v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>826 F.2d 420, 424 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cAs an unsupported opinion, it does not serve the purposes for which it is offered, that is, objectively to assist the jury in arriving at its verdict.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>Rational Connection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The lay opinion testimony offered by Troopers Harrison and Karwacki was also inadmissible because of an insufficient rational connection between what the troopers actually perceived and the ultimate opinions they expressed at trial. Rule 5-701 requires that lay opinion testimony be \u201crationally based.\u201d This precondition to admissibility contemplates that there must \u201cbe a rational connection between th[e] perception and the opinion.\u201d Wright &amp; Gold, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6254, at 135 (footnote omitted); <em>see Smith v. Biggs, </em>171 Md. 528, 534, 189 A. 256, 259 (1937) (noting that not only must a witness have personal knowledge regarding that witness\u2019s testimony, but that knowledge \u201cmust be sufficient to form a relevant and testimonial basis for the expression ... of an opinion\u201d). Thus, \u201cspeculation and conjecture will be excluded as irrationally based.\u201d <em>Reporter\u2019s Note, </em>The Maryland Rules of Evidence \u00a7 5-701-2 (H. Chasanow ed.1994); Lynn McLain, Maryland Rules of Evidence \u00a7 2.701.4, at 187 (1994). For lay testimony to be relevant, and thus admissible, \u201cthe logical connection between the evidence and the fact it is offered to prove must be supplied by a proposition of knowledge.\u201d Wright <em>&amp; </em>Gold, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6254, at 137 (footnote omitted); <em>see Turpin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1349, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>1359 (6th Cir.) (noting a factual or theoretical basis for opinion testimony is a necessary predicate to admissibility); <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 826, 113 S.Ct. 84, 121 L.Ed.2d 47 (1992); <em>Calhoun v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., </em>738 F.2d 126, 131-32 (6th Cir.1984) (same). Thus, the proper question for determining if a sufficiently rational nexus exists between actual perception and the subsequent lay opinion testimony based on that perception is the validity of the proposition the witness used to link perception to opinion. <em>See </em>Wright <em>&amp; </em>Gold, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6254, at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In this case, based on their training and experience, the troopers drew the common sense inference that the substance swallowed by Robinson looked like crack cocaine. The troopers further concluded that the substance was, in fact, crack cocaine. To testify to those conclusions in court, however, those opinions must have been both rational and reasonably certain. The conclusion that the substance seized from Robinson was in fact cocaine fails to meet this threshold requirement because the visual characteristics of crack cocaine are not unique to that substance alone. The relative abundance of counterfeit substances intended to visually resemble controlled substances is so great, that the General Assembly has made it a criminal act to possess, with the intent to distribute, \u201cany non-controlled substance intended by that person for use or distribution as a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 286B(c). For instance, as the legislative history to Article 27, \u00a7 286B indicates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">The production and distribution of substances such as caffeine, phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine sulfate, and pseu-doephedrine in an oral dosage form which is substantially identical to various legally manufactured controlled dangerous substances, has become an extremely serious prob-lem____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Memorandum from the Maryland Dept, of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene to Judiciary Comm., Maryland House of Delegates, at 1 (undated) (available at the Dept, of Legislative Reference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Bill File for House Bill 622 (1981)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, as reflected by the legislative history of \u00a7 286B, the proliferation of counterfeit or look-alike substances is so substantial as to render the identification of suspected cocaine through sight alone a tenuous proposition at best. <em>See People v. Jones, </em>174 Ill.2d 427, 221 Ill.Dec. 192, 194, 675 N.E.2d 99, 101 (1996) (\u201cWhether the untested packets in the instant case may have contained cocaine or mere look-alike substances is pure conjecture.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Robinson, </em>517 N.W.2d 336, 338 (Minn.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Moreover, there has been no suggestion that crack cocaine is not subject to counterfeit imitation in the same manner as other illegal substances. To the contrary, the record reflects that any number of substances can adequately mimic crack cocaine.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 374-75, 681 A.2d 501, 503 (1996) (detailing in that case how possession of \u201cdried milk chips\u201d led to a charge of possession of a noncontrolled substance with the intent to distribute it as a controlled substance). Although the circumstances of this case might support the inference that the substance visually identified by Troopers Harrison and Karwacki was a controlled substance, the facts also fairly and substantially support the contradictory inference that the alleged contraband was a counterfeit noncontrolled substance. Hence, the proposition that crack cocaine can be identified by sight alone -with reasonable certainty by a lay witness is logically unsound.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>trial court should not have admitted the lay opinion testimony of Troopers Harrison and Karwacki. <em>State v. Conn, </em>286 Md. 406, 428, 408 A.2d 700, 710 (1979) (\u201c[T]he statement by the lay nonexpert witness becomes trustworthy and thus admissible only after he demonstrates a sufficient foundation for the inference drawn.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Helpful to the Trier of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The third threshold requirement for admissibility is a determination by the trial court that a lay opinion will be helpful to the trier of fact in resolving a fact at issue in the case. Md. Rule 5-701. \u201cUltimately, the question is whether the witness\u2019s perception was sufficient under all the circumstances to warrant the conclusion his opinion will be helpful.\u201d Weight &amp; Gold, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6254, at 144 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">When lay opinion testimony is offered without sufficient factual support, \u201cthe jury may be lulled by a convincing witness into accepting a flawed or unfounded opinion.\u201d Weight <em>&amp; </em>Gold, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6255, at 153 (footnote omitted). Wigmore also recognized the danger of the trier of fact \u201cattributing] greater evidential value to the evidence than is warranted.\u201d 1 Wigmoee, Evidence \u00a7 10a, at 684 (Tillers rev.1983). This danger is especially prevalent in a case such as this, where the lay opinion testimony is offered by a police officer. Thus, in the first instance, lay opinion testimony will not be helpful if the opinion as offered deprives the trier of fact of information necessary to resolve the fact at issue. In other words, a lay opinion is not reliable if that opinion is \u201cincomplete in a critical area.\u201d <em>Viterbo, </em>826 F.2d at 423; <em>see Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </em>4 F.3d 1153, 1175 (3rd Cir.1993) (\u201cAn opinion based on false assumptions is unhelpful in aiding the jury in its search for the truth, and is likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>mislead and confuse.\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In the present case, for example, Troopers Harrison and Karwacki did not offer the court in the first instance a factual predicate for distinguishing between crack cocaine and a counterfeit substance similar in appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In the context of expert testimony, this Court has repeatedly held that such a witness must base his or her \u201copinion on probability and not on mere possibility.\u201d <em>Kujawa v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>224 Md. 195, 203-04, 167 A.2d 96, 99 (1961). This limitation applies with equal force to the trial court\u2019s determination of whether lay opinion testimony is admissible in the first instance. <em>See Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 163, 143 A. 872, 878 (1928); McLain, Maryland Evidence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 701.1, at 194; <em>accord Asplundh Mfg. Div. v.

Thus, it follows that a speculative opinion will not be helpful to the trier of fact. <em>See Asplundh, </em>57 F.3d at 1201 (\u201c[I]n order to be \u2018helpful,\u2019 an opinion must be reasonably reliable.\u201d); <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

The troopers made an assumption, based on their relative experience, that the substance seized was crack cocaine. This assumption, \u201calthough possessing a certain common sense appeal,\u201d was too conjectural to establish the chemical composition of the alleged contraband with substantial certainty. <em>See Calhoun, </em>738 F.2d at 131-33 (rejecting testimony when the witness\u2019s \u201cassumption ... is not supported by the type of evidence necessary to reach th[e] conclusion\u201d). Accordingly, the troopers\u2019 lay opinion testimony in this case was not helpful to the jury, and should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In sum, to satisfy its burden of proof, the State must offer sufficient, admissible evidence for every element of the crime.

The requirement that lay opinion testimony must have incremental probative value beyond that of the underlying facts to be admissible is consonant with the common law rule that such testimony will not be admitted if: only an expert could reach a rational conclusion due to the subject matter of the testimony; if the conclusion and the inferences relied upon by the witness are within the common knowledge of the trier of fact; or if the lay witness states an opinion on a question of law. <em>See supra, </em>note 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">.
