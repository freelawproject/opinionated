We referred the matter, pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Judge Carol E. Smith of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Following an evidentiary hearing and oral argument involving ten separate complaints, Judge Smith found evidence sufficient to sustain nine of the ten complaints.

Milliken, Esquire is the subject of two Petitions for Disciplinary Action filed by the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cAGC\u201d) of Maryland pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9. Bar Counsel, acting on the direction of the Review Board and pursuant to Maryland Rule BV7, filed charges against the Respondent pertaining to eight separate Complaints received by the Review Board. The charges related to each Complaint were set forth in the Petition for Disciplinary Action, case number 96022071. On January 18, 1996, the Court of Appeals ordered that the charges be transmitted to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for service and hearing in accordance with Maryland Rule BV9. On February 13, 1996, Bar Counsel, again acting on the direction of the Review Board, filed a second set of charges against Respondent Milliken pertaining to two Complaints by former clients. The charges related to these two Complaints were set out in the second Petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Disciplinary Action, Case number 96053040. On February 14, 1996, the Court of Appeals ordered that these new charges be transmitted to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and further ordered that the Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Consolidation of these two matters for a hearing of charges be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">\u201cThe charges in both Petitions allege that the Respondent engaged in misconduct, defined by Maryland Rule BVl(k) as \u201can act or omission by an attorney, individually or in concert with any other person or persons which violates the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Rule 1230, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.\u201d The hearings on both Petitions for Disciplinary Action were held before the undersigned judge, and took place over the course of several days in April and May, 1996. Raymond Hein, Assistant Bar Counsel, represented the Petitioner, Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland. Herschel D. Milliken, the Respondent, proceeded pro se. In support of its allegations, Petitioner\u2019s counsel entered nineteen exhibits into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\n<em>Standard of Proof</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201cMaryland Rule BVlO(d) provides that the hearing of charges is governed by the same rules of law, evidence, and procedure as in civil proceedings in equity. Consequently, factual findings shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence. In contrast, an attorney establishing a defense, including mitigating circumstances, need only prove factual matters by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bakas, </em>322 Md. 603, 589 A.2d 52, modified, 323 Md. 395, 593 A.2d 1087 (1991).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201cAt the hearings before this Court in April and May, 1996, the following facts were established by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">\u201cThe Respondent attended the University of Baltimore School of Law, and obtained his Juris Doctor degree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>1979. Mr. Milliken was admitted to practice in Maryland in September 1981. Except for one year when he worked for the firm of Singleton, DeShiell <em>&amp; </em>Robinson, Milliken has historically engaged in the general practice of law as a sole practitioner. The Respondent has always practiced law in Baltimore City, and currently maintains a law office in his home at 1509 East 36th Street, Baltimore, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">\n<em>I. Complaint of Tonya L. Steward (Dorsey)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter before this Court, Petitioner requested that Mr. Milliken stipulate to the submission of the IPT of Ms. Dorsey because she had moved from her last known address, and the Petitioner was unable to locate her. The Respondent refused to stipulate to this witness\u2019 testimony and stated that he was interested in conducting a cross-examination of Ms. Dorsey on certain matters. The Respondent had an opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Dorsey at the IPH on March 21,1994. The Respondent also stated that he wished to see if the witness would recant her testimony. The Respondent further suggested that Petitioner\u2019s Counsel had not satisfactorily proven Ms. Dorsey\u2019s unavailability as defined by Maryland Rule 5-804(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201cFinding that Ms. Dorsey was absent from the hearing and that Bar Counsel had made reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, attempts to procure her attendance through the issuance of subpoenas at her last known address, this Court declared Ms. Dorsey to be \u201cunavailable\u201d in accordance with Maryland Rule 5-804. Due to Mr. Milliken\u2019s prior opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Dorsey, this Court held that Ms. Dorsey\u2019s former testimony at the IPH was admissible under the standards set forth in Maryland Rule 5-804.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cAt the April 16, 1996 hearing before this Court, the Petitioner introduced evidence and testimony obtained through its investigation of this Complaint and established the following facts. Tonya Dorsey met Respondent in May, 1993, and hired him to represent her in a divorce case. A fee was agreed upon at that time. Although there was a discrepancy between Ms. Dorsey\u2019s testimony that the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>spondent wanted $700.00 and Respondent\u2019s testimony at the Circuit Court hearing that his standard fee in such a matter was $350.00, it is clear from the evidence that Ms. Dorsey wrote a check on May 5, 1993, to Herschel D. Milliken payable in the amount of $200.00 as partial payment of his fee for representation. There was no written retainer agreement and she did not receive any correspondence either during, or after the period in which the Respondent was supposed to be representing her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201cMs. Dorsey\u2019s case had already been filed and a hearing was scheduled for June 4,1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201cThe Respondent accepted and kept the $200.00 paid to him by Ms. Dorsey despite the fact that he never performed any work beyond conducting the initial interview. He never reviewed the court file to check the status of Ms. Dorsey\u2019s case. He conceded that he had no justification for keeping Ms. Dorsey\u2019s $200.00 payment and he did not deposit her check in a trust account. Instead, he cashed it immediately. Curiously, Respondent noted his trust account number on the back of the check. However, this was done to identify him as a person who maintained an account with the bank in order that the bank would cash the check, and not for the purpose of placing it in the trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201cIn fact, Mr. Milliken admitted that he tried to liquidate checks as soon as possible. It appears from his testimony that generally checks were either cashed immediately or placed directly in his operating account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201cMr. Milliken testified several times over the course of the hearing that it was his policy to be paid in full before appearing in court or performing any work. Indeed, he suggested in this particular instance that he did not show up because he had not been paid the balance. Both the Respondent and Ms. Dorsey agreed that her case already had been filed and a trial was scheduled for June 4, 1993. Although she left several messages on the Respondent\u2019s answering machine, Ms. Dorsey was unable to reach him to discuss her divorce and the balance of the fee. After paying Mr. Milliken the $200.00 retainer, she was not contacted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>him until June 3, 1993, the day before her hearing. During this phone conversation, the Respondent instructed Ms. Dorsey to meet him in court the next day with the balance of his fee. However, the Respondent failed to appear the next day for Ms. Dorsey\u2019s hearing. Ms. Dorsey was forced to proceed without an attorney. The Respondent telephoned Ms. Dorsey on June 5, 1993 to apologize for his behavior and promised to refund the money she had paid. However, no refund was ever made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">\u201cIn light of the clear and convincing evidence as set forth above, this Court finds that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 1.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct which provides that \u201ca lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client\u201d and Maryland Rule 1.3 which requires that an attorney act \u201cwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d Mr. Milliken\u2019s failure to contact his client, to review her file and prepare her case, and to appear in court are clear violations of these rules. Further, the Respondent\u2019s lack of communication with Ms. Dorsey, which was evidenced by his neglecting to send her correspondence, failing to respond to her phone messages and/or failing to contact her by telephonic or other means of communication to inform and prepare her for trial violates Maryland Rule 1.4(a) which obligates a lawyer to \u201ckeep a client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d Finally, according to Maryland Rule 1.16(d), Mr. Milliken had a duty to \u201ctake steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, ... surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of the fee that has not been earned.\u201d In dereliction of this duty Milliken never formally terminated his representation, nor did he surrender all documents and property to this client or refund the $200 of Ms. Dorsey\u2019s money that he admitted he did not earn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201cAlthough the Respondent stated, presumably by way of defense or mitigation, that this and other client files were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>destroyed in office fires, he failed to produce any evidence to show that such fires ever occurred. Throughout the proceedings before this Court, the Respondent referred to fires allegedly taking place at his offices at 2901 Druid Park Drive. In response to inquiries concerning his lack of documentation and inability to produce files, Mr. Milliken asserted that his paperwork and files were destroyed in these fires. However, Mr. Milliken was unable to produce even a scintilla of evidence that these fires actually occurred despite the fact that he had ample opportunity to do so for several years during the investigation process and again over the course of the hearings before this Court. In fact, the Respondent could not provide this Court with even dates certain as to when the fires took place. To the contrary, John Reburn an investigator for the AGC contacted Mr. Milliken at his home on October 10, 1993 and requested Ms. Dorsey\u2019s files and records. Mr. Milliken\u2019s law office had closed sometime in August or September, 1993. Originally, Mr. Milliken shared space in Suite 110A at 2901 Druid Park Drive with a cleaning service. He later moved to Suite 302 -with George Davis and another attorney. Mr. Milliken told Reburn that his records and files were still at the Druid Park complex. Reburn advised him to retrieve them. Mr. Milliken never did so. Another AGC investigator wrote to Morris lies, the CEO for the Druid Park office complex regarding Mr. Milliken\u2019s files. Iles\u2019s written response of May 13,1994 advised that Mr. Milliken left five (5) boxes of papers and two (2) to four (4) file cabinets when he defaulted on his lease and vacated Suite 302. An additional sixteen (16) boxes of papers were removed from the offices and stored by the landlord. Mr. Milliken\u2019s files and papers were among those stored by the landlord in its general purpose storage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\u201cIf fires had occurred there surely would be verification available from the City police, and/or fire departments or the landlord. This Court gave Milliken the opportunity to obtain and provide verification. Whether he chose not to, or could not do so because there is no such verification, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>result is the same. This Court finds his assertions utterly without support or credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\n<em>II. Complaint of Thelma Lambert</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cAs a result of the Complaint filed by Thelma Lambert, an AGC investigation was initiated. Although Ms. Lambert was not present at the hearing before this Court, the excerpt of her testimony from the IPH was introduced without objection. The facts revealed by the investigation follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cMs. Lambert wanted a deed prepared for her home. After seeing an advertisement in the paper for Maryland Paralegal Associates, Inc. (\u201cMPA\u201d), Ms. Lambert contacted Robert Morgan. Mr. Morgan is not an attorney. Mr. Morgan agreed to perform the desired services for her upon receipt of her check for the fee. The check was sent in May, 1993. Ms. Lambert then made numerous attempts to reach Mr. Morgan. Eventually, she received a call from Mr. Morgan who told her that he would take care of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\u201cIn July, 1993, Mr. Morgan visited Ms. Lambert\u2019s house with Mr. Milliken. Mr. Morgan asked Ms. Lambert in the presence of Mr. Milliken if there was any other work for him to do. Both Mr. Morgan and the Respondent gave Ms. Lambert their business cards. After promising to take care of the paperwork that day, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Milliken left the house. Mr. Morgan never completed the work, contacted Ms. Lambert, or refunded her money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\u201cOn cross-examination, Ms. Lambert admitted that she did not expect anything from Mr. Milliken nor did he promise to do anything for her. After this contact, Ms. Lambert was unable to reach Mr. Morgan again even though he had cashed a $200 check from her. Mr. Milliken maintained that he had nothing to do with Ms. Lambert. He did not recall handing her his business card and stated that he was only there because he was getting a ride from Mr. Morgan. The Respondent testified that he went out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>side with Ms. Lambert\u2019s son while Mr. Morgan discussed business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\u201cBar Counsel urges this Court find that Mr. Milliken violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 5.5 by assisting a person not a member of the Bar with the unauthorized practice of law. Bar Counsel was unable to establish by clear and convincing evidence a relationship of the nature that would violate this rule. Ms. Lambert was unclear whether Mr. Morgan and Mr. Milliken were working together and Mr. Milliken stated that he was not involved in the case. In fact, on May 2, 1996, Bar Counsel admitted in closing argument that this was the most tenuous of the complaints and asked this Court to find that evidence showing a close working relationship between both men, the carrying of each other\u2019s business card, and Mr. Milliken\u2019s presence at the meeting with Ms. Lambert were enough to demonstrate the alleged misconduct. This Court declines such an invitation as Bar Counsel was unable to meet its burden of proof of clear and convincing evidence with respect to this Complaint. Since the client herself acknowledged at the IPH that she did not expect anything from Milliken and that he did not promise to do anything for her, this Court finds the evidence utterly insufficient in this instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\n<em>III. Complaint of Shannette Taylor-Hawkins</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201cEvidence was presented at the Circuit Court hearings on April 17 and 18,1996 to establish the following facts regarding the above Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cOn October 10, 1991, Ms. Taylor-Hawkins, the Complainant, and her daughter, Charise Nicole Colbert, were passengers in a taxicab that was involved in an accident. Initially, the Complainant hired attorney Nelson Kandel to represent her in a personal injury action. After fifteen months, Ms. Taylor-Hawkins discharged Kandel, and hired Mr. Milliken \u201cto her knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cMs. Taylor-Hawkins learned of Mr. Milliken from an acquaintance. During their initial telephone conversation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Mr. Milliken told Ms. Taylor-Hawkins to pick up the file from Nelson Kandel\u2019s office and drop it off at MPA with his paralegal, Robert Morgan. Ms. Taylor-Hawkins believed the Respondent also maintained one of his offices at MPA. When she arrived there, she gave the file to Mr. Morgan. Mr. Milliken was not present. Subsequently, Ms. Taylor-Hawkins called MPA\u2019s office at St. Paul Street several times and spoke to Robert Morgan or his wife. She also tried to contact the Respondent at his office but always spoke with an individual named Ina. She found that the \u201c462\u201d number (Druid Park, the location of Mr. Milliken\u2019s office), was eventually disconnected. The only contact she had regarding her case was with Mr. Morgan with whom she met one time. He told her \u201cthey\u201d were working on the file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201cMr. Milliken explained that Ms. Taylor-Hawkins knew she could reach him through a mutual friend named Margo. He testified that his role was to determine whether she had a case. He determined that she did not, and he informed her of his conclusion by phone. He believed that to be a sufficient communication and therefore did not send any written correspondence. When asked for verification of his actions, Mr. Milliken stated that he had no files or records because \u201che did not record incidents of that nature.\u201d He testified that he did not maintain records because he never accepted money from her, and therefore, did not view her as a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cFinally, although Mr. Milliken testified that he made his relationship with MPA clear to her, Ms. Taylor-Hawkins did not understand the distinction between a lawyer and a paralegal. In the Answers to Requests for Admissions, the Respondent addressed Mr. Morgan\u2019s involvement with Ms. Taylor-Hawkins\u2019 file. Mr. Milliken admitted that he asked Mr. Morgan to \u201ctake a look into the file and see just what was in it and what would I need\u2014what, if anything, I might need.\u201d Mr. Milliken stated that he took the file for his own review, but after deciding that he did not want the case, he returned it to Robert Morgan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cBar Counsel demonstrated through clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated several Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in the course of his representation of Ms. Taylor-Hawkins. In this situation Mr. Milliken essentially left Ms. Taylor-Hawkins dangling. Though he did not understand that she was his client, from the moment that he agreed to review her case and directed her to deliver her file to his paralegal associate, Mr. Milliken was bound by the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in handling this matter. Although Mr. Milliken asserted that he did review the file and advised Ms. Taylor-Hawkins by phone that she had no case, he did not memorialize the conversation in any fashion. He did not notify her in writing. He did not make or keep a file of any kind. He did not even make any notes regarding his evaluation of the case or any conversation with her. Indeed, he attempted to justify the failure to make or maintain records on the rather astounding basis that because he never accepted money from her, he did not view her as a client. By contrast, Ms. Taylor-Hawkins was quite convincing in explaining that after their one (and only) telephone conversation, she never heard from Mr. Milliken again. He failed to return any of her numerous phone calls, and after his office phone was disconnected, he never provided her with information regarding how she could get in touch with him. Such inaction by Mr. Milliken clearly fails to comply with Rule 1.1 which requires a lawyer to provide competent representation and necessitates thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. Further, Mr. Milliken\u2019s inaction and inattentiveness, as noted above likewise fails to satisfy Rule 1.3 which obligates a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u201cBy failing to contact, communicate with, or respond to his client\u2019s requests Mr. Milliken failed to comply with Rule 1.4(a). It obligated him to keep her reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information. In startling contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>to this important duty, Mr. Milliken did nothing to respond to, or communicate with his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201cRule 1.16(d) obligates a lawyer to surrender papers and property to which the client is entitled. Since the file that was obtained from Nelson Kandel and turned over to Robert Morgan at Mr. Millikeris direction for delivery to, and review by Mr. Milliken was somehow lost and never returned to Ms. Taylor-Hawkins after review by Mr. Milliken, he has also violated Rule 1.16(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cFinally, in the context presented, having directed the client to deliver her file to Robert Morgan to do some type of work, and subsequently directing Mr. Morgan to return the file to the client, Mr. Milliken had supervisory responsibility under Rule 5.3(b) over Mr. Morgan and his possession and disposition of the file. Mr. Milliken\u2019s responsibility to supervise the activities of such non-lawyer assistants obligated him to make reasonable efforts to ensure that Mr. Morgan\u2019s conduct was compatible with the lawyer\u2019s professional obligations in this case, including the responsibility to return the file or take other reasonable steps to make certain that the client knew what happened to the file. Ms. Taylor-Hawkins\u2019 file was never returned to her. Neither Mr. Milliken nor Mr. Morgan had any explanation for what happened to the file. Such shoulder shrugging hardly suffices to satisfy the mandate of Rule 5.3(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\n<em>IV. Complaint of Bar Counsel</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cThe Complaint filed by Bar Counsel in this matter concerns the Respondent\u2019s representation of Charles Clark in a Post Conviction proceeding before the Honorable Marvin Steinberg. The matter was first brought to the attention of Bar Counsel by Judge Steinberg after the Respondent missed two scheduled pre-hearing conferences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cMr. Milliken readily admitted that he misnoted the date of the original conference and failed to appear for a rescheduled conference because he had not checked his messages to learn of the new date. Mr. Milliken also admitted that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>did not respond to two letters from Bar Counsel relating to these events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">\u201cThe asserted \u201cmisnoting\u201d of the first scheduled conference might be credible and even excusable as inadvertent clerical error if Respondent had not also, in connection with this same client matter, failed to appear for a subsequently rescheduled conference about which ample notice was given, or if he had responded, as required, to Bar Counsel\u2019s two letters relating to these events. Failing to check messages in the context presented can in no way suffice to justify the second failure to appear for a scheduled court conference. At a minimum both Judge Steinberg and his client had the right to expect Mr. Milliken\u2019s attendance, or to receive the courtesy of some reasonable notice or explanation for nonappearance if not reasonably before, then surely promptly after the fact(s) of his non-appearance. Mr. Milliken appears simply to have ignored the matters in the hope they would, as often colloquially expressed, \u201cgo away.\u201d Based upon Respondent\u2019s own admissions, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent violated Maryland Rules 1.3, 3.2, and 8.4(d). By failing to attend the conferences, it is clear that the Respondent did not \u201cact with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d In addition, Maryland Rule 3.2 requires that an attorney \u201cmake reasonable efforts to expedite litigation.\u201d Respondent\u2019s repeated absence from the conferences made compliance with this Rule impossible. These absences also indicate that the Respondent \u201cengage[d] in conduct that [was] prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u201d which is prohibited by Maryland Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201cLastly, Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters was in dereliction of his duty under Maryland Rule 8.1(b) which requires that Respondent \u201cshall not ... knowingly fail to respond to a demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">F. <em>Complaint of Bar Counsel</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201cThe second Complaint filed by Bar Counsel concerns Mr. Milliken\u2019s handling of his attorney trust account from 1992-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>1993. During the course of this investigation, several violations of the Maryland BU Rules, governing attorney trust accounts were discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201cThe evidence introduced at the hearing consisted of Nations Bank statements (Exhibit 7), a summary \u201cReview of Escrow Account Records\u201d prepared by AGC Investigator John Reburn in April 1994 at the request of Assistant Bar Counsel Walter D. Murphy (Exhibit 8), a spreadsheet illustrating the monthly activity of the Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account for the period of January, 1987\u2014September, 1993 (Exhibit 9) and 1992 Nations Bank statements (Exhibit 10).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201cThe evidence indicated that from 1986-1991, the activity related to Mr. Milliken\u2019s attorney trust account was in the normal range; there was nothing unusual about his method of disbursements. There was consistently a running balance at the end of each month of approximately $20,000 or more. However, in 1992, there was a significant change in the way the Respondent disbursed funds from the attorney trust account. Interestingly, this change in attorney trust account activity coincided with the Bank\u2019s unsatisfactory closeout of Mr. Milliken\u2019s general account in June, 1992 after three months of overdrafts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cAfter Mr. Milliken\u2019s general account was closed, he regularly deposited funds into his attorney trust account and immediately wrote counterchecks payable to cash. He also issued regular escrow checks payable to cash. As a result, the funds in the attorney trust account dwindled significantly. Mr. Milliken began drawing down on the accumulated funds in the attorney trust account. All these transactions and balances are reflected in the exhibits introduced at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201cIn addition to writing checks payable to \u201ccash,\u201d the Respondent made cash disbursements to some of his clients from the trust account. He also stated that he would cash checks for clients as an accommodation because some of his clients did not have bank accounts. On August 4, 1992 Respondent received a check for $3,000.00 from the MTA in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>settlement of a case he was handling for Theola Moore. He deposited the total amount into his escrow account, and then wrote and cashed a countercheck for $3,000.00 payable to cash. At the end of August Respondent received a check for $4,000.00 from Continental Loss Adjusting in settlement of a claim he was handling for Norma Williams. On September 15, 1992 he deposited the $4,000.00 check in his escrow account, and then wrote and cashed a countercheck for $4,000.00 payable to cash. On September 16, 1992, Respondent received a check for $2,250.00 \u25a0 from MAIF in settlement of a claim he was handling for Wylie Cator. On that same date he wrote and cashed a countercheck for the full amount payable to cash. An especially intriguing series of escrow account transactions by Mr. Milliken was evident in his handling of $6,000.00 in settlement funds which he received in connection with a case for his client, Sharon Stanley. On September 23, 1992 he deposited the $6,000.00 into his escrow account. On that same date he issued a check for two-thirds of that amount, i.e, $4,000.00 to his client. However, on September 24, 1992 he wrote a check from escrow for $1,500.00 to his wife, Ruth Milliken and a check for $500.00 payable to cash. Ruth Milliken was not Respondent\u2019s employee. Mr. Milliken explained that his wife handled the bills for their home and family and that in writing the $1,500.00 to her directly from escrow he was just taking \u201ca short cut.\u201d He had no explanation as to what happened to or who received the $500.00 payable to cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">\u201cMr. Milliken also accommodated corporate clients by keeping money in the trust account. He claimed that he was in-house counsel, although he was unable to provide any details as to what legal work he performed on behalf of the corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cThe Respondent testified that he neither put non-client funds into his escrow account, nor did he commingle his funds and other clients\u2019 funds. However, according to his testimony at the IPH, the Respondent acknowledged holding monies for people with whom he had a personal relationship rather than an attorney-client relationship. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>asked at the Circuit Court hearing to verify his relationship with these entities and his business with them, Mr. Milliken merely responded that he did \u201cwhatever legal matters came up.\u201d He produced no records or files, nor any corporate clients or other witnesses to substantiate any such corporate client relationships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">\u201cFurthermore, the Respondent allowed fees to accumulate in the attorney trust account, and then drew on those fees in 1992-1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cDespite all of the above-mentioned activity, the Respondent has no records of any of these transactions, payments, fees, etc. He testified that the only records he kept were on a \u201csimple pad,\u201d which was not produced at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cThe documentary evidence and Respondent\u2019s own admissions discussed above lead to the obvious and inescapable conclusion that Mr. Milliken did violate Rule BU9 by drawing instruments payable to cash on his attorney trust account. Making cash disbursements or writing counter-checks from the trust account is clearly prohibited. AGO Investigator Reburn\u2019s testimony concerning his review and analysis of Mr. Milliken\u2019s bank records demonstrated that for several years prior to 1992 Mr. Milliken allowed fee income to accumulate in his trust account in violation of Rule BU7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u201cFurther, by his own admission at the IPH, Mr. Milliken deposited and held funds for non-clients. Although he testified before this Court that such individuals and entities were clients, he produced none of these \u201cclients\u201d or other witnesses nor records of any kind to substantiate client relationships as to those individuals and entities. By allowing his own fees to accumulate in escrow and by holding non-clients\u2019 funds in escrow for extended periods with the funds of clients, and by not keeping those funds separate from the property of clients and third persons, he violated Rule 1.15(a) and BU7(a) which prohibit commingling of funds in a trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u201cMaryland Rule BU9 prohibits an attorney from \u201cborrow[ing] or pledg[ing] any funds required by these rules to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>be deposited in an attorney trust account, ..., or us[ing] any funds for any unauthorized purpose.\u201d As previously discussed, Mr. Milliken wrote a check from the trust account directly to his wife for $1,500.00 for maintenance of their household, he wrote checks for cash, and cashed checks from his attorney trust account. The funds that he removed from the account or neglected to place in the account were appropriately attorney trust account funds and therefore, the Respondent was unauthorized to use the funds in the manner listed above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">\u201cThe Respondent also had a duty under Maryland Rule 1.15(a) to keep \u201ccomplete records of such accounts ... [to be] preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.\u201d By Respondent\u2019s own admission, he kept no records. In light of his consistent and repeated use of counterchecks and instruments payable to cash, Mr. Milliken\u2019s failure to produce any records himself regarding the trust account is hardly surprising. Keeping track and accounting would be difficult, if not impossible, without some concomitant system of record-keeping correlating such instruments with particular clients, cases, or transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>VI. Complaint of Gorman Murphy</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cMr. Gorman Murphy was not present at the hearings before this Court. Neither were Ms. Rosaleen Brewer or Ms. Pauleen Williams. However, both women testified before the Inquiry Panel in April and May, 1995. Mr. Murphy never testified. The facts related to this Complaint were established as follows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201cMr. Murphy and his two sisters, Ms. Brewer and Ms. Williams, went to Mr. Milliken\u2019s office for his assistance in preparing a deed that would convey Mr. Murphy\u2019s property to his grandsons. Although Mr. Murphy said very little during the meeting because of his ill health, it was agreed that the Respondent would prepare both a will and a deed. The will was to be sent to Mr. Murphy\u2019s house and the deed was to be delivered to the sisters\u2019 house. The Respondent testified that he fully explained to the sisters the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>steps to execute the will and the deed properly, and how to take the deed to the land records office and have it recorded and pay the necessary property tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cMr. Milliken stated that the sisters were unhappy with the completed deed because they wanted the house to be deeded to them and apparently decided that if the property was not deeded to them, they did not want the work done. Mr. Milliken testified that he told the sisters he could not do as they wished because it was contrary to the wishes of his client, Mr. Murphy, who was allegedly satisfied with the work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cAt the hearing, Bar Counsel introduced a copy of a letter to Mr. Milliken signed by Mr. Murphy, Ms. Brewer, and Ms. Williams. The letter, dated August 1, 1993, indicated that they expected Mr. Milliken to record the deed and send it back to them and, if this was not possible, they expected the return of their money. At that time, the Respondent had not contacted the Complainants for approximately one year since their first meeting. Ms. Brewer and Ms. Williams were unable to contact the Respondent. He never recorded the deed and they never received a refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cThe Respondent maintained that he did everything they requested of him and more because he gave them a will in addition to the deed. Mr. Milliken was unable to support his contentions as he produced no documents to support his position. Instead, he claims that all relevant documents were destroyed in the alleged office fires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\u201cIn light of the facts established by clear and convincing evidence at the hearing, this Court concludes that Mr. Milliken violated Maryland Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), (b), and 8.1(b). His failure to record the deed or provide adequate instructions for the Complainants, his dereliction in failing to contact his clients either before or after they wrote him the letter, and his non-existent documentation of work allegedly performed demonstrate that he acted incompetently and without diligence. Further, he did not keep his client \u201creasonably informed about the status of his legal matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion ... or explain [the] matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">\u201cIn addition, as admitted by the Respondent in Exhibit 2, it is clear that he violated Maryland Rule 8.1 by failing \u201cto respond to a lawful demand for information,\u201d in that he refused to answer letters from Bar Counsel regarding the Complaint of Gorman Murphy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\n<em>VII. Complaint of Patricia Carmichael</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cBased upon allegations set forth in this Complaint as well as testimony elicited from the Respondent at an IPH on May 3, 1994, an investigation into Mr. Milliken\u2019s representation of Patricia Carmichael took place. The following facts were established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cPatricia Carmichael testified under oath before the IPH by telephone from a federal correctional facility in California on April 20, 1995 (Exhibit 13) and on May 23, 1995 (Exhibit 14). She was introduced to Mr. Milliken by Mr. Morgan. Mr. Milliken visited her with Morgan one time at the Montgomery County Detention Center. He agreed to represent her on her three (3) pending state matters for an agreed fee of $1,500.00. The three matters involved a Parole Violation, and two (2) state matters involving theft charges. Ms. Carmichael\u2019s mother, Iva Andrew, sent the $1,500.00 to Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan gave Mr. Milliken $1,500.00. Mr. Milliken in turn gave him back $500.00 for Morgan\u2019s services in working on Ms. Carmichael\u2019s legal problems. After the initial meeting at the Montgomery County Detention Center Ms. Carmichael never heard from Mr. Milliken again. He did not effect the desired <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the state charges, nor did he assist in bringing about the lifting of the Maryland detainers. The state matters were ultimately resolved with the assistance of Colleen Beach, a legal intern at Legal Aid at Lexington, Kentucky.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\u201cAlthough the Respondent denied in testimony before this court that he ever represented Ms. Carmichael, his testimony before the Inquiry Panel on May 3, 1994 indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>otherwise. In fact, before the Inquiry Panel at a time before Ms. Carmichael had filed a Complaint with the AGC, the Respondent testified that he was hired to negotiate with a State\u2019s Attorney to nolle pros Ms. Carmichael\u2019s shoplifting charge in order for her to avoid serving substantial federal time. He specifically stated that, \u201cthat\u2019s what I was hired for and that\u2019s what I dealt with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">\u201cBefore this Court, Mr. Milliken testified that he spoke with Ms. Carmichael at the Baltimore City or Baltimore County Detention Center and told her that he would handle her State case for $1500.00. He testified that he made it clear that he would not do any work until he was paid in full and then he gave Ms. Carmichael his name, address, telephone number, paper and a pen, and told her to have a relative get in touch with him about the fee. Mr. Milliken stated that he never again heard from Ms. Carmichael.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u201cTwo letters, allegedly signed by the Respondent, and on his office letterhead, were introduced into evidence before this Court. One letter was addressed to Ms. Carmichael and confirmed that Mr. Milliken had been retained, having received the necessary funds, and that he would visit her within a week. The second letter was addressed to the Warden of the Montgomery County Detention Center indicating that the Respondent was Ms. Carmichael\u2019s attorney and he intended to visit his client. The Respondent denied writing the letters, and suggested that Mr. Morgan may have used the Respondent\u2019s letterhead and forged the Respondent\u2019s signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201cMr. Morgan appeared before this Court on May 2, 1996, and confirmed that he arranged the meeting between Ms. Carmichael and Mr. Milliken and Mr. Milliken returned $500.00 to Mr. Morgan for services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201cThe testimony of Ms. Carmichael before the IPH, the testimony of Mr. Morgan before the IPH and before this Court, as well as that of Mr. Milliken before both the IPH and this Court are essentially consistent with respect to Mr. Morgan introducing Mr. Milliken to Ms. Carmichael, arranging their meeting, the nature of the work to be per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>formed and the amount of the fee. At a time before Ms. Carmichael had actually filed a Complaint, Mr. Milliken readily, repeatedly and in great detail admitted that he was hired by Ms. Carmichael to deal with her state matters. His subsequent denial before this Court years after such admissions and at a time after Ms. Carmichael\u2019s complaint was filed and pursued by the AGC, renders Mr. Milliken\u2019s former rather than latter testimony credible. This Court further finds that Ms. Carmichael\u2019s testimony that Mr. Milliken never did any work in her cases was, however, in some sense at least corroborated by Mr. Milliken\u2019s later position in testimony before this Court in that he acknowledged that he never did any work. His justification, i.e., never having received any money from her, is what is not credible. This Court\u2019s conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that once again Mr. Milliken produced no record, files or documentation of any kind to support any of his testimony at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">\u201cBy failing to undertake any work in this case Mr. Milliken has violated his obligation under Rule 1.3 to act with diligence in representing this client. By not communicating with her, or responding to her or her family\u2019s messages and requests for contact he has violated Rule 1.4(a) which governs his obligation to communicate with his client and to comply with reasonable requests for information. Having failed to do any work whatsoever for Ms. Carmichael his fee of $1,500.00 can hardly be said to have been reasonable as required by Rule 1.5(a). Further under Rule 1.5(b) Mr. Milliken was obligated to communicate, preferably in writing, the basis or rate of his fee to Ms. Carmichael, who had not regularly been represented by Mr. Milliken. In this instance there was never any communication of any kind concerning the basis of his fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201cThe evidence in this matter further satisfies this Court that Mr. Milliken violated Rule 5.4 by sharing legal fees with a non-lawyer. Mr. Morgan got the $1,500.00 fee from Ms. Carmichael\u2019s family, gave it all to Mr. Milliken, who immediately gave $500.00 back to Mr. Morgan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cBy requesting a fee, receiving it in full, and then failing to do any work whatsoever Mr. Milliken\u2019s conduct and actions were dishonest, deceitful and fraudulent. They constitute not only misconduct, but indeed the very kind of misconduct which is also prejudicial to the administration of justice under Rule 8.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">\u201cFinally, in this as in several other instances, Mr. Milliken by his own admissions failed to respond to a lawful demand for information by Bar Counsel concerning this Complaint in violation of Rule 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>VIII. Complaint of Carroll Middleton</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cIn connection with this Complaint, the following facts were established by clear and convincing evidence at the hearings before this Court in April and May, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cThis Complainant was introduced to the Respondent in the spring or summer of 1994 by Marian Turner, a mutual acquaintance. The Respondent met with Mr. Middleton at Ms. Turner\u2019s house. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss whether Mr. Milliken would review and evaluate a prior lawsuit in which Mr. Middleton was a party. The Respondent suggested at their meeting that Mr. Middleton\u2019s prior lawyer had not pursued the case in Mr. Middleton\u2019s best interest, and that Mr. Middleton had a potential lawsuit against that lawyer. Mr. Milliken agreed to review the file and think about how to pursue the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201cAfter conferring with Mr. Morgan, who was also present, Mr. Milliken said his fee was $350.00 and asked Mr. Middleton to make the check out to Mr. Morgan, who Mr. Middleton understood was not an attorney. Mr. Middleton stated that he was never really sure what basis there was for the fee. The fee was never placed in an attorney trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">\u201cAt the request of Mr. Milliken, Mr. Middleton produced all of his files and documents. However, when Mr. Middleton tried to contact Mr. Milliken, he was unsuccessful. Mr. Middleton left several messages, but it took more than six months for Mr. Milliken to respond. When Mr. Milliken did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>respond, he agreed to return $250.00 and the files. However, Mr. Middleton received nothing from the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">\u201cMr. Milliken stated that he reviewed the files and sent an opinion letter, which he was unable to produce at the hearing because it was destroyed in the alleged fire. The Respondent had no documents, files, correspondence, or retainer agreements to evidence any work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201cBar Counsel has established by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent met with Mr. Middleton, agreed to perform legal services for him, collected a fee, cashed the check prior to performing any services, and then made himself unavailable to Mr. Middleton. Mr. Milliken ultimately promised to refund money to this client, but never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cBased on the Respondent\u2019s failure to communicate with Mr. Middleton after receiving his file and his negligence in acting to apprise Mr. Middleton regarding his case, this Court concludes that Mr. Milliken violated Maryland Rules 1.3 and 1.4(a) requiring him to act with diligence and to keep his client reasonably informed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201cBy failing to perform any work on Mr. Middleton\u2019s behalf and charging a fee, the basis of which was not explained to the client, the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 1.5(a), (b) which obligates a lawyer to charge reasonable fees consistent with the amount of effort made on a client\u2019s behalf and to communicate the basis of the fee to the client. Here, Mr. Milliken charged $350.00 and did nothing. In addition, Mr. Milliken neglected to return Mr. Middleton\u2019s files and the fee which he did not earn. These actions are violative of Maryland Rule 1.16 which requires an attorney to \u201csurrender[ ] papers and property to which the client is entitled and refund\u00ed ] any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201cFinally, as admitted by the Respondent in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 2, it is clear that he violated Maryland Rule 8.1(b) by failing \u201cto respond to a lawful demand for information,\u201d in that he refused to answer letters from Bar Counsel regarding the above Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\n<em>IX. Complaint of Olivia Cornish</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">\u201cEvidence and testimony were presented at trial to establish the following facts relating to this Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cThis Complaint resulted from Mr. Milliken\u2019s representation of William Cornish, an individual who was a fugitive from the law at the time he sought legal assistance. Federal charges were pending against Mr. Cornish, his co-defendant had been apprehended, and was in the last phase of his trial. Mr. Cornish allegedly asked the Respondent to monitor the trial to find out the outcome and to determine whether there was evidence incriminating Mr. Cornish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cMr. Milliken approached Ms. Cornish several times for money and actually received seven cash payments totaling $5,000.00 from Ms. Cornish on behalf of her son. Mr. Milliken testified that he told Ms. Cornish exactly how much to pay him for each service. Randolph Cornish, the client\u2019s brother, testified that Mr. Milliken was told by Ms. Cornish to communicate through Randolph regarding the case and the fees, but that the Respondent continued to demand the money from Ms. Cornish and never contacted Randolph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cMs. Cornish stated that she was nervous about the lack of progress. She noticed that the Respondent never gave progress reports. Furthermore, although the Respondent testified that he met with detectives and the federal prosecutor, consulted with Mr. Cornish\u2019s girlfriend and did research, he produced no evidence of any kind at the hearing to substantiate such assertions. He had no accounting of time spent on the Cornish matters. He testified that he did take notes on research but did not keep them, nor did the Respondent keep notes regarding the alleged visits to the District Court to see if a warrant was outstanding for Mr. Cornish. Respondent explained that he did not feel the records were necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">\u201cIt is unclear from the evidence presented at the hearing precisely what Mr. Milliken\u2019s responsibilities entailed because it seems that Mr. Cornish was the only person who spoke to the Respondent about the scope of his representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tion. In fact, Ms. Cornish testified that she was called to the Grand Jury and expected to see Mr. Milliken there because she thought he was her lawyer. He did not appear. The Respondent indicated during his cross-examination of Ms. Cornish that the above responsibilities, i.e. meeting with the federal prosecutors and detectives, etc., were his function as Mr. Cornish\u2019s attorney. The Respondent also testified that he attempted to update Ms. Cornish but she admittedly did not want to hear the details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">\u201cMr. Milliken stated that he had several conversations with the federal prosecutor to see if he could get a deal for Mr. Cornish. Both Ms. Cornish and her son, Randolph, believed that Mr. Milliken was hired to work out a plea with the federal prosecutor. Testimony indicates that there was some understanding that Mr. Milliken was to monitor a federal trial and engage in plea negotiations with the federal prosecutor. However, Mr. Milliken is not a member of the Federal Bar. Mr. Milliken indicated that he knew he couldn\u2019t represent Mr. Cornish in federal court, but he thought he could do the work leading up to the court date and suggested that Mr. Cornish could represent himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201cUltimately when William was caught and put in prison, Mr. Milliken was nowhere to be found. Ms. Cornish was forced to hire another attorney to represent her son because she never heard from Mr. Milliken again, nor did she know how to contact him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201cSubsequently, Ms. Cornish filed a suit against the Respondent and was awarded a civil judgment for $5000.00 by default. Respondent stated that he did not contest the suit because \u201cthe time just got away from [him].\u201d Mr. Milliken neither paid nor appealed the judgment. He testified that he did not pay it because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel she [was] entitled to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201cThe facts established by clear and convincing evidence at the trial support a conclusion by this Court that Mr. Milliken violated Maryland Rule 1.16(d). There is absolutely no credible evidence to show that Mr. Milliken performed any work on behalf of Mr. Cornish and he never refunded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>money Ms. Cornish was entitled to receive as a \u201cfee that had not been earned.\u201d Having accepted fees to work out a plea agreement in a Court before which he was not admitted to practice, doing no work and failing to be present at any hearings directly involving his client, Mr. Milliken also violated Maryland Rule 8.4(d) which deems it to be professional misconduct when a lawyer \u201cengage[s] in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Similarly, as a lawyer who has failed to pay a judgment, which he neither contested nor appealed, because he doesn\u2019t feel that Ms. Cornish is entitled to the money, he has in this Court\u2019s view engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cFinally, as admitted by the Respondent in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 4, it is clear that he violated Maryland Rule 8.1(b) by failing \u201cto respond to a lawful demand for information,\u201d in that he refused to answer letters from Bar Counsel regarding the above Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\n<em>X. Complaint of Tyrese Alexander</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201cThe facts established before this Court demonstrated that the Respondent agreed to represent a Ms. Alexander, accepted payment for services to be performed, and never fulfilled his responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201cIn this case, Ms. Alexander approached Mr. Milliken for assistance in an uncontested divorce and was quoted a fee of $350.00. Mr. Milliken did not explain the basis of the fee to Ms. Alexander. She paid a $200.00 retainer fee on the date of their initial meeting in March, 1991. She tried unsuccessfully to reach him by phone on numerous occasions, but got no response for months. Five months after reaching Mr. Milliken, Ms. Alexander recalled getting a two page Bill of Complaint for Absolute Divorce in August, 1991. There was no cover letter and no instructions as to how she should proceed. Mr. Milliken testified that he previously instructed her, but he cannot produce evidence of his work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201cSubsequently, Ms. Alexander attempted to call the Respondent several times without success. Finally, on Decern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ber 24, 1993, Mr. Milliken contacted Ms. Alexander and requested that she give him until January 1, 1994 to refund her money. Ms. Alexander never heard from the Respondent again, nor did she receive a refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">\u201cBased upon the facts established by clear and convincing evidence, this Court concludes that the Respondent has violated Maryland Rules 1.3 and 1.4(a) by failing to act with diligence and to communicate with Ms. Alexander and keep her \u201creasonably informed.\u201d As noted above, Mr. Milliken provided no letter of explanation with the Complaint he sent, nor did he return her many phone calls. More than two (2) years passed without any further work by Mr. Milliken or communication with this client. By charging Ms. Alexander a fee, doing minimal work, and failing to explain the basis for the charge, Mr. Milliken violated Maryland Rule 1.5(b) which obligates a lawyer to charge reasonable fees consistent with the amount of effort made on a client\u2019s behalf and to communicate the basis of his fee to the client within a reasonable amount of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cAlthough Mr. Milliken told Ms. Alexander he would return her money, he did not do so and therefore he is in violation of Maryland Rule 1.16(d) which mandates that a lawyer \u201crefund[ ] any advance payment of fee that he has not earned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cFinally, as admitted by the Respondent in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 4, it is clear that he violated Maryland Rule 8.1(b) by failing \u201cto respond to a lawful demand for information,\u201d in that he refused to answer letters from Bar Counsel regarding the above Complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that Milliken violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: 1.1 (Competence); 1.3 (Diligence); 1.4(a), (b) (Communication); 1.15(a), (b) (Safekeeping Property); 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation); 3.2 (Expediting Litigation); 5.3(b) (Responsibilities Regarding Non-lawyer Assistants); 5.4(a) (Professional Independence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Lawyer); 8.1(b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); 8.4 (Misconduct), and Maryland Rules BU7 (Commingling of Funds) and BU9 (Prohibited Transactions). Neither Bar Counsel nor Respondent has filed exceptions to these findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The sole issue before this Court is the extent of the discipline to be imposed upon Respondent. This Court is vested with the responsibility to supervise the conduct of lawyers in order to protect the public and to maintain public confidence in the judicial system and the bar as a whole. The purpose of sanctions is not to punish the errant lawyer, but rather to protect the public from further acts of misconduct, to protect the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Myers </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994). Each case is to be judged based on the particular facts and circumstances. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>300 Md. 637, 642, 479 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1984). Bar Counsel recommends disbarment as the appropriate sanction in this case. Respondent urges this Court to consider some lesser sanction other than disbarment, such as suspension. For the following reasons, we conclude that the appropriate sanction is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The hearing judge found that Respondent engaged in egregious misconduct that amounted to \u201cfraud, deceit and misrepresentation.\u201d His clients suffered severe detriment. He repeatedly neglected client matters and failed to take steps to protect client interests. Respondent repeatedly failed to apprise clients honestly of the status of their cases, and in effect, repeatedly lied to his clients. In failing to provide proper representation, he misled his clients into believing that their matters were being appropriately handled. He did not refund advance payment of fees that had not been earned and, on more than one occasion, he shared fees with a non-lawyer. When sued by a client for the return of the unearned fee, he did not appear in court, and subsequently ignored the default judgment simply because he felt the judgment was unwarrant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ed. Respondent violated Maryland Rules BU7 and BU9 by drawing instruments payable to cash on his attorney trust account, by making cash disbursements from his trust account, and by allowing fee income to accumulate in his attorney trust account. He deposited and held funds for non-clients in his trust account, thereby commingling client funds with personal and non-client funds. In writing checks from the trust account directly to his wife, he used trust funds for unauthorized purposes. He also failed to keep complete records of his trust account. In addition to his pattern of misconduct and neglect of client matters, Respondent failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel. He repeatedly refused to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">In each of the matters before the Court, Respondent received fees from the client for work to be performed in the future.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As an advance fee payment, he was obligated to return any unearned portion of the fee under Rule 1.16(d). <em>See Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. David, </em>331 Md. 317, 323, 628 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>A.2d 178, 181 (1993) (sanctioning attorney in part for his failure to return a fee which was unearned); <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Hill, </em>314 Md. 293, 294, 550 A.2d 707, 707 (1988) (ordering attorney to show cause why he should not be suspended for refusal to return the fees to two clients for whom he took no action); <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Bloom, </em>306 Md. 609, 610, 510 A.2d 589, 589 (1986) (disbarring attorney, in part, for conversion of client funds in failing to refund a retainer after attorney took no action on client\u2019s case); <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Harper, </em>300 Md. 193, 198, 477 A.2d 756, 758 (1984) (disbarring attorney, in part, for misappropriation of funds in failing to return monies client paid attorney); Charles W. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 9.2.2, at 506 (1986). Milliken has never returned the unearned portion of the fees to the clients. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Manning, </em>318 Md. 697, 704-05, 569 A.2d 1250, 1254 (1990), we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\">In recent years, however, we have noticed too many instances when lawyers have agreed to represent clients and accepted fees, in part or in whole, only to completely neglect these same legal problems, causing the same clients emotional distress, financial loss, or other varying kinds of inconvenience. More often than not, these situations have been exacerbated by the lack of respect and attention extended to the courts as evidenced by the failure to file timely pleadings or to make appearances as scheduled before the court to enable proceedings to be conducted. It seems to us that this kind of persistent conduct is evidence of a lawyer\u2019s disregard of his obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">As in <em>Manning, </em>the instant case is a clear example of such an attitude. The hearing judge found that \u201c[b]y requesting a fee, receiving it in full, and then failing to do any work whatsoever Mr. Milliken\u2019s conduct and actions were dishonest, deceitful and fraudulent. They constitute not only misconduct, but indeed the very kind of misconduct which is also prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d The hearing judge found that Respondent told clients Steward (Dorsey), Middleton, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Alexander that he would refund the legal fee, but he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">It is well settled that the extent of discipline to be applied is dependent upon the severity of the attorney\u2019s misconduct and the particular facts of the case. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 165, 567 A.2d 112, 117 (1989). The gravity of misconduct is not measured solely by the number of rules broken but is determined largely by the lawyer\u2019s conduct. <em>Flint\u2019s Case, </em>133 N.H. 685, 582 A.2d 291, 293 (1990). This case involves the most serious of professional and ethical duties arising from the attorney-client relationship. Respondent\u2019s treatment of his trust account in violation of Rules BU7 and BU9 alone warrants disbarment. As we have repeatedly said, commingling and conversion of client funds, in the absence of mitigating circumstances, ordinarily warrants disbarment. <em>Myers, </em>333 Md. at 449, 635 A.2d at 1319; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 417, 614 A.2d 955, 958 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Lazerow, </em>320 Md. 507, 513, 578 A.2d 779, 782 (1990); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608-09, 541 A.2d 966, 968 (1988). Respondent has never returned the money he owes to his clients, even in the face of a judgment for the amount of the unearned fee. Respondent\u2019s pattern of neglect of client affairs, resulting in serious harm to his clients, and his failure to return unearned fees, undermine the \u201cvery underpinnings of the practice of law, which are honesty toward his clients and loyal advocacy on their behalf.\u201d <em>Flint\u2019s Case, </em>582 A.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">As an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Maryland, Respondent has submitted to the exclusive disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court. The refusal of an attorney to respond to a demand by the disciplinary authority is sanctionable conduct under Rule 8.1(b). <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 408, 681 A.2d 510, 519 (1996). Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters in any manner evidences his disrespect for the attorney disciplin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ary process in this State. His total disregard for the judgment entered against him on behalf of Ms. Cornish evidences his lack of concern for the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The violations in this case are serious and reveal in Respondent the absence of fundamental requirements of a lawyer: honesty, integrity, and respect for the legal system. Writing for the Court in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n. v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 366, 347 A.2d 556, 563 (1975), Judge O\u2019Donnell observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahb\">As we see it, the interests of the public mandate his disbarment; indeed, to order otherwise, would constitute an abnegation of our responsibilities, and would convey to the public, implicitly, a misrepresentation that the respondent continues to possess the basic attributes, required of all members of the bar, that they will act with proper care in representing their clients and will, with strictest fidelity, diligently attend their clients\u2019 interests. On the part of the respondent these attributes are convincingly found to be utterly wanting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The record in the instant matter shows numerous trust account violations, a continuing pattern of neglect of client affairs, conversion of client monies in failing to return unearned fees, and contempt for the disciplinary process. The gravity of Respondent\u2019s conduct is further aggravated by the fact that the Court rejected as totally incredible Respondent\u2019s explanation that his failure to maintain records relating to his trust account as well as client matters was due to an office fire. <em>See Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 520, 307 A.2d 677, 682 (1973). As in <em>Phoebus, </em>to protect the public, to instill confidence in the legal profession, and to deter similar behavior, disbarment is mandated. <em>Myers, </em>333 Md. at 446-47, 635 A.2d at 1318. Accordingly, the name of Herschel D. Milliken will be stricken from the rolls of those authorized to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15(c), FOR WHICH SUM </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST HERSCHEL D.

This Court has not previously addressed the question of whether advance payment fees must be placed in a trust account, or whether they are funds which may be placed in the operating account. <em>But Cf. Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 409, 681 A.2d 510, 519-20 (1996). Most courts that have considered the issue have determined that advance payment fees must be placed in the trust account. <em>See Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Tucker, </em>560 So.2d 435, 440 (La.1989). For example, in <em>Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Williams, </em>512 So.2d 404, 409 (La. 1987), the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that \"an advanced fee for particular services not yet performed constitutes funds of the client which should be placed in a trust account and not withdrawn or withheld without the consent of the client.\u201d <em>See also The Advance Fee Payment Dilemma, </em>10 Cardozo L.Rev. 647, 649 (1989); Charles W. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 9.2.2, at 506 (1986) (advance fee payment must be treated as client trust funds subject to the special rules for safeguarding them).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">It is beyond question, however, that under Rule 1.16(d), any portion of an advance payment fee that is unearned must be returned to the client. In the case before us, there is no dispute as to whether the fees Milliken received were advance payment for work to be done in the future. The only issue before the hearing court was whether Milliken had earned the full fee. The hearing judge found that the fees were unearned and should have been returned to the clients. Moreover, the judgment in the Cornish case, which Milliken did not appeal, is further evidence that Milliken failed to return unearned fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
