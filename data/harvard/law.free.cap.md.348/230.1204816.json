As grounds for the motion, Kostelec contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that an anticipatory warrant violates Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 551(a). For the reasons set forth below we shall hold that \u00a7 551(a) does not authorize anticipatory search warrants. Further, inasmuch as the State never argued to the courts below the unavailability of suppression as a remedy for a search without statutory authorization, and the State never raised that issue by a cross-petition for certiorari, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>shall direct that the motion to suppress in this case be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The relevant portion of \u00a7 551(a) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201cWhenever it be made to appear to any judge ... by written application signed and sworn to by the applicant, accompanied by an affidavit ... containing facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant ... that there is probable cause, the basis of which shall be set forth in said affidavit ... to believe that any misdemeanor or felony is being committed by any individual or in any building ... or that any property subject to seizure under the criminal laws of the State is situated or located on the person of any such individual or in or on any such building, ... then the judge may forthwith issue a search warrant____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">At the hearing in the circuit court on the motion to suppress no testimony was taken. Counsel for the parties argued exclusively legal issues derived from the face of the application for the search warrant. Thus, for this review, the facts justifying the search are those found in the application sworn to on April 5, 1995. <em>See Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 226, 686 A.2d 274, 285 (1996) (\u201cThe State ordinarily is bound on appeal of a suppression hearing issue by the record made at the suppression hearing.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 117 S.Ct. 1318, 137 L.Ed.2d 480 (1997); <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670-72, 521 A.2d 749, 755 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"ARvk\">The affiant on the search warrant application was a detective of the Howard County Police Department, Criminal Investigation Bureau, Vice and Narcotics Division. In addition to presenting his background and experience, the affiant presented the following facts: Less than eight hours earlier a Federal Express package had been seized under a warrant. This package contained a large quantity of liquid phencycli-dine (PCP), confirmed by a field test. The package was addressed to one Joey Labaugh at 7118 Dogwood Road, Baltimore, Maryland 21244. Based on the absence of any entries for that name in official data bases, the affiant believed the name Joey Labaugh to be fictitious. Subsequently the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>police made a controlled delivery of the package to 7118 Dogwood Road where it was accepted by Randal Lucabaugh (Lucabaugh) who, shortly after accepting delivery, was arrested when he left his residence with the package. In a post-arrest interview Lucabaugh stated that a portion of the package was to be delivered to Roarke Boulton (Boulton) who lived near Route 103 in Elkridge. Lucabaugh placed \u201ca controlled telephone call\u201d to Boulton and advised Boulton that <em>\u201ca </em>friend\u201d of Lucabaugh\u2019s would deliver the package to Boulton.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Within three hours of the warrant application a police officer had dialed the same telephone number dialed by Luca-baugh and, after first speaking to an unknown male, was referred to another male who identified himself as Boulton. Boulton said that all of the package was his and that it was to be delivered to his home address at 5967 Rowanberry Drive in Elkridge. A crisscross telephone directory showed that the number called was listed to Kostelec at 5967 Rowanberry Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The affiant \u201cpray[ed] that an Anticipatory Search and Seizure Warrant be issued for said premises and persons\u201d and further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201cYour affiant will only execute said warrant if the following actions are observed at 5967 Rowanberry Drive, within the next fifteen (15) days:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201c1. A member of the Howard County Police Department will visit the residence at 5967 Rowanberry Drive and present the package containing the [PCP] for delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201c2. An individual within the residence accepts the package containing the [PCP].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">\u201c3. This individual is observed to carry the package containing the [PCP] into said residence after the delivery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">\u201c4. Law enforcement officials conduct a constant surveillance of the residence from the time of delivery until the time the warrant is served.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Additional facts, developed at Kostelec\u2019s trial, reveal that Boulton was a longtime Mend of Kostelec\u2019s and that Kostelec permitted Boulton to move into Kostelec\u2019s Elkridge home in March of 1995 because Boulton was down on his luck. When the delivery was made to Kostelec\u2019s home on the evening of April 5, 1995, Kostelec answered the door and accepted the package for Boulton. The police had attached an electronic device to the package that would secretly alert them when the package was opened. Within minutes after the delivery the signal was activated. The police immediately made a no-knock entry and found both Kostelec and Boulton in the living room, the former seated on a love seat and the latter on an adjacent couch. The package contained nearly forty ounces of PCP in two bottles. When the police entered one bottle was still inside the open package, and the other bottle was sitting on the floor between Boulton and the coffee table.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In addition to the PCP, the police seized an aluminum can that had been crushed and perforated, apparently for use as a pipe, and which contained a trace of cocaine. In Kostelec\u2019s bedroom the police seized from a dresser drawer a pipe containing a trace of cocaine. Another pipe containing marijuana residue was found in a china hutch in Kostelec\u2019s dining room. Three large bottles of parsley flakes were found in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Kostelec was indicted on multiple charges, including possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kostelec moved to suppress, contending in part</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aki-dedup-1\">\u201c[t]hat the Application for Search and Seizure Warrant failed to allege facts then in existence which would have constituted probable cause for the issuance of a Search and Seizure Warrant by a judge under Article 27, Section 551(a)....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In his memorandum in support of the motion to suppress, Kostelec argued that the warrant \u201cdoes not comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>narrowly drawn Maryland statute permitting the issuance of search and seizure warrants\u201d and that \u201canticipatory warrants have never been validated by the legislature----\u201d Citing \u00a7 551(a) he submitted that \u201cprobable cause <em>was not shown within the Affidavit </em>because the anticipatory search and seizure warrant executed upon lacked facts indicating that there was any misdemeanor or felony <em>being </em>committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">At a hearing before Judge Raymond J. Kane, Jr., Kostelec included in his oral argument the contention set forth above. The court took the matter <em>sub curia. </em>It denied the motion to suppress in a memorandum and order which viewed the issue to be \u201cwhether the Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated by the issuance of what is commonly referred to as an \u2018anticipatory search warrant.\u2019 \u201d Kostelec was convicted in a jury trial and sentenced to five years without parole, to certain concurrent sentences, and to payment of a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Kostelec v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 656, 685 A.2d 1222 (1996). That court rejected Kostelec\u2019s argument based on \u00a7 551(a), reasoning that although Kostelec\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 551(a) was \u201ca plausible one, the language could also be read merely to require that probable cause be present at the time the warrant is executed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669, 685 A.2d at 1229. Hence the language was \u201cat best, ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Inasmuch as the Court of Special Appeals had held earlier in its opinion that anticipatory warrants did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that \u00a7 551(a), for the problem under consideration, should be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment to permit anticipatory search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We granted Kostelec\u2019s petition for certiorari. Our order limited review solely to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">\u201cWhether an anticipatory search warrant, issued on the basis of an affidavit which lacked probable cause that a crime was being committed at the time of issuance ... is constitutional and in compliance with Article 27, Section 551(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUVP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>This Court should not decide a constitutional issue unless the record compels it. <em>See State v. Lee, </em>330 Md. 320, 329, 624 A.2d 492, 495 (1993). Our decision rests on the construction of \u00a7 551(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The Court of Special Appeals pointed out in this ease, 112 Md.App. at 662, 685 A.2d at 1225, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1N\">\u201c[t]here is no dispute that the warrant in issue was an anticipatory one, <em>ie., </em>\u2018based upon an affidavit showing probable cause that at some future time (but not presently) certain evidence of crime will be located at a specified place.\u2019 2 Wayne R. LaFave <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.7(c), at 362 (3rd ed.1996).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The argument of Kostelec that we address here is not whether the warrant-issuing judge had probable cause to conclude that the PCP would in the future be at the premises to be searched, that is, whether the PCP was on a \u201csure course\u201d to Kostelec\u2019s home. The issue, quite simply, is whether \u00a7 551(a) authorizes a warrant to search for and seize evidence of crime on described premises when the affidavit in support of issuing the warrant shows that the evidence of crime to be seized is not on the premises to be searched when the warrant is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Section 551 requires \u201cthat there is probable cause ... to believe that any misdemeanor or felony is being committed ... or that any property subject to seizure ... is situated or located ... in or on any such building.... \u201d This probable cause must \u201cbe made to appear\u201d to the judge who is asked to issue the warrant. The time to which the present tense of these verbs in \u00a7 551(a) refers is the time when the warrant is sought. Literally, the statute contemplates that the crime \u201cis being committed\u201d and that the property \u201cis situated or located\u201d on the described premises when the judge is asked to rule. We do not agree with the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that \u00a7 551(a) can be read to refer to the time when the warrant is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The incompatibility of the language of \u00a7 551(a) with anticipatory warrants is explained by the fact that the language under consideration formed part of the statute\u2019s original enactment by Chapter 749 of the Acts of 1939, long before anticipatory warrants came into use. Indeed, the language under consideration antedates <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967) (abolishing the \u201cmere evidence rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In one of its early decisions the Court of Special Appeals, speaking through Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy, later Chief Judge of this Court, described the operation of \u00a7 551 in light of <em>Warden v. Hayden. </em>The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cIt is thus clear from the provisions of the statute that what it, in effect, authorizes is a <em>search </em>of persons, places or things, as reasonably particularized in the warrant, for specifically designated property, unlawfully obtained or held, or of evidence of the commission of the crime, now including items relating thereto which are purely evidentiary in nature.2 As the search warrant is issued for the basic purpose of making a search, the probable cause necessary to support its issuance requires a proper showing not only that a crime has been or is being committed, but also that the evidence of the crime is upon the person or within the place or thing to be searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\"2See <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>385 U.S. 926 [87 S.Ct. 290, 17 L.Ed.2d 210].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\"><em>Salmon v.

Although none of the foregoing decisions can be considered holdings on the issue now before us, these decisions put a gloss on \u00a7 551(a) that evidences the common understanding of the reach of \u00a7 551(a) and its predecessors, based on its present tense language.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cTo justify the issuance of such a warrant, [\u00a7 551(a) ] appears to require that probable cause first be shown that \u2018any misdemeanor or felony\u2019 is being committed ... and that in connection therewith \u2018property\u2019 subject or liable to seizure \u2018under the criminal laws of this State\u2019 is located upon the individual or at the place or thing to be searched.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In its brief to us the State cites cases from ten federal circuit courts of appeal and from numerous state courts in support of the proposition that \u201cthe overwhelming majority of courts addressing the present issue have concluded that anticipatory search warrants are constitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 7 (footnote omitted). Under the signal \u201cBut <em>cf.\u201d </em>the State refers to decisions from Alabama, Colorado, and Iowa that are more pertinent to the issue on which we have focused.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The court in <em>Ex Parte Oswalt, </em>686 So.2d 368 (Ala.1996), construed an Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure which, based upon a predecessor statute, authorized search warrants. The warrant was to issue if there was probable cause that the property sought \u201c \u2018(1) [w]as unlawfully obtained ... (2) [w]as used as a means of committing ... any offense ... (3) [i]s in the possession of any person with intent to use it as a means of committing a criminal offense ... or ... (4) [constitutes evidence of a criminal offense____\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371 (italics omitted). The predecessor statute, which the rule \u201cmimicked,\u201d required \u201c \u2018that the evidence be <em>presently in the possession </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the person whose premises are to be searched.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373. The court concluded there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201cno intent [by the legislature] to allow the issuance of a search warrant where ... the crime to which the evidence at issue relates has not yet occurred and the evidence to be seized is not presently in the possession of the person whose premises are to be searched.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Id. </em>(italics omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The Colorado search warrant statute, 8A C.R.S. \u00a7 16-3-303(l)(d) (1986), requires that the affidavit \u201cestablish probable cause to believe that the property to be searched for, seized, or inspected is located at, in, or upon the premises, person, place, or thing to be searched.\u201d In <em>People v. Poirez, </em>904 P.2d 880 (Colo.1995), an anticipatory warrant was issued for marijuana that was to be delivered to the defendant\u2019s residence. The court held that the language of the statute \u201ccreates a barrier to the issuance of anticipatory warrants by judicial officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 883. Particularly persuasive to the Colorado court was an amendment to Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(a). Prior to 1990 that rule had authorized issuance of a search warrant by certain judicial officers \u201cwithin the district wherein the property or person sought is located.\u201d In 1990 the words of limitation were deleted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The note of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cRule 41(a)(1) permits anticipatory warrants by omitting the words \u2018is located,\u2019 which in the past required that in all instances the object of the search had to be located within the district at the time the warrant was issued. Now a search for property or a person within the district, or expected to be within the district, is valid if it otherwise complies with the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5EB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Since the Colorado legislature had not amended its statute to delete similar language, the court concluded that anticipatory search warrants were not authorized. <em>See Poirez, </em>904 P.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><em>State v. Gillespie, </em>530 N.W.2d 446 (Iowa 1995), construed the Iowa search warrant authorization statute, Iowa Code, \u00a7 808.3 (1991). That statute required the sworn application for a search warrant to include \u201cfacts, information, and circumstances tending to establish sufficient grounds for granting the application, and probable cause for believing that the grounds exist.\u201d Iowa Code, \u00a7 808.3 provided that \u201c[ujpon a finding of probable cause for grounds to issue a search warrant, the magistrate shall issue a warrant.... \u201d The court concluded \u201cthat the plain meaning of these statutes is that probable cause must exist at the time the warrant is <em>issued and not at some future time when the warrant is executed.\u201d </em>530 N.W.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The decisions reviewed above deal with statutory language quite analogous to that found in \u00a7 551(a) and reach results that are consistent with the gloss placed on \u00a7 551(a) by Maryland\u2019s appellate courts. Accordingly, we hold that the search warrant in the instant case was not authorized by \u00a7 551(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">For the first time in the entire course of this litigation, the State in its brief in this Court points out that \u00a7 551(a) does not embody an exclusionary rule so that a violation of \u00a7 551(a) that does not constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment does not result in suppression of the evidence seized under the warrant. <em>See Chu v. Anne Arundel County, </em>311 Md. 673, 537 A.2d 250 (1988), <em>aff'g </em>69 Md.App. 523, 518 A.2d 733 (1987), and in particular see Judge Moylan\u2019s scholarly opinion for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>In re Special Investigation No. 228, </em>54 Md.App. 149, 458 A.2d 820 (1983). This attempt by the State to inject a new issue into the case comes too late. In our discussion of this new issue we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>assume that the violation of \u00a7 551(a) here is <em>not </em>also a violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Kostelec raised the limited application of \u00a7 551(a) in his motion to dismiss in the circuit court, in his memorandum in support of that motion, and in oral argument before the circuit court. He clearly was asserting that, if his argument based on the construction of \u00a7 551(a) were valid, the result that flowed from the issuance of an unauthorized warrant was suppression of the evidence seized under the warrant. In the circuit court, the State did not challenge that conclusion. Its only fallback argument, in the event that \u00a7 551(a) were construed as Koste-lec contended, was that the warrant nevertheless issued in good faith and, consequently, there should be no suppression under <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3421, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, 698-99 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In his brief to the Court of Special Appeals, Kostelec renewed his statutory construction argument, but, in its brief as appellee, the State made no argument that evidence was not excluded even if \u00a7 551(a) were violated on a ground independent of the Fourth Amendment. In its opinion the Court of Special Appeals rejected Kostelec\u2019s construction of \u00a7 551(a), reasoning that on questions of probable cause the statute should be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment. <em>Kostelec, </em>112 Md.App. at 669, 685 A.2d at 1229. For the <em>pari materia </em>proposition the court cited <em>Andresen v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 128, 169, 331 A.2d 78, 104, <em>cert. denied, </em>274 Md. 725, <em>cert. granted on other grounds, </em>423 U.S. 822, 96 S.Ct. 36, 46 L.Ed.2d 39 (1975), <em>aff'd, </em>427 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976). The Court of Special Appeals in its <em>Kostelec </em>also recognized that the <em>pari materia </em>statement in <em>Andresen </em>had been severely limited by <em>In re Special Investigation No. 228, </em>54 Md.App. at 176-77 &amp; n. 26, 458 A.2d at 833-34 &amp; n. 26. In that context, the Court of Special Appeals included in its opinion the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201c <em>\u2018Compare Anne Arundel County v. Chu, </em>69 Md.App. 523, 518 A.2d 733 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>311 Md. 673, 537 A.2d 250 (1988) (observing, in the context of explaining that \u00a7 551(a) is not an exclusionary rule, that in many ways \u00a7 551(a) is not <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Kostelec, </em>112 Md.App. at 670, 685 A.2d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">When Kostelec petitioned this Court for certiorari, the first issue that he presented included the construction of \u00a7 551(a). In its answer to the petition for certiorari the State simply asserted that the Court of Special Appeals \u201calso correctly held that Section 551 of Article 27 does not preclude the issuance of [an] anticipatory warrant.\u201d Further, although the Court of Special Appeals had referred to <em>Special Investigation No. 228 </em>and the <em>Chu </em>opinions, the State did not attempt to raise by conditional cross-petition for certiorari the issue that there was no suppression remedy for a violation limited to noncompliance with \u00a7 551(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals, this Court ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition.\u201d <em>Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 700-01, 602 A.2d 1191, 1199 (1992) (citations omitted). <em>See also County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Offen, </em>334 Md. 499, 508, 639 A.2d 1070, 1074 (1994) (reviewing only the narrow issue of zoning estoppel addressed by the Court of Special Appeals); <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 563, 625 A.2d 914, 925 (1993) (holding that an evidentiary claim was not preserved for review); <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>322 Md. 62, 69, 585 A.2d 222, 225-26 (1991) (refusing to consider an issue in this Court because it was not raised in the petition for certiorari); <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>313 Md. 118, 143, 544 A.2d 764, 776 (1988) (declining to review issue not raised at trial level or in the Court of Special Appeals); <em>Allgood v. State, </em>309 Md. 58, 82, 522 A.2d 917, 929 (1987) (declining to review issue not raised in certiorari petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">From the time Kostelec filed his motion to suppress in the circuit court through the grant of the writ of certiorari by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Court, this case proceeded on the assumption by Kostelec and by the representatives of the State that the remedy would be suppression of the evidence if the search warrant were issued in violation of \u00a7 551(a). Inasmuch as \u00a7 551(a) was violated and there has been no previous challenge to Kostelec\u2019s assertion of a right to suppression as the remedy for that violation, the motion to suppress should be granted under the unique procedural history of this case. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION ENTERED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AND TO REMAND THIS CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY WITH DIRECTIONS TO GRANT THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS OF THE PETITIONER, JOSEPH KOSTELEC, AND FOR SUCH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS AS MAY BE CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY HOWARD COUNTY, MARYLAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">.
