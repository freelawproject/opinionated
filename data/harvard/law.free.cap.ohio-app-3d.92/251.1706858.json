For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Pearne Gordon, a Cleveland law firm, purchased a lawyer\u2019s professional liability insurance policy from American Home. The insurance consisted of payment, subject to a deductible and coverage limits, of (1) all damages arising out of Pearne Gordon and its individual insured attorneys\u2019 provision of legal services \u201cexcept as excluded or limited by the [policy\u2019s] terms, conditions and exclusions\u201d; and (2) the costs of defending, including legal fees, \u201cany suit against the insured seeking damages which are payable under the terms of [the policy].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">This appeal concerns the following quoted exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201cThis policy does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">\u201c(a) to any claim arising out of any criminal act, error or omission of any insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201c(b) to any claim arising out of any dishonest, fraudulent or malicious act, error or omission of any insured, committed with actual dishonest, fraudulent, or malicious purpose or intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\"><em>(t </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201c(k) to any punitive or exemplary damages, fines, sanctions or penalties, or the return of or reimbursement for legal fees, costs or expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">This appeal also concerns the policy\u2019s innocent-insured provision, Section V (\u201cInnocent Insured Provision\u201d), under which certain insurance is provided to the firm and its members if they did nothing wrong and are vicariously called to account for another member\u2019s criminal, dishonest, fraudulent or malicious acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cV. Innocent Insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">\u201cWhenever coverage under this policy would be excluded, suspended or lost</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\u201c(a) because of any exclusion relating to criminal, dishonest, fraudulent or malicious acts, errors or omissions by any insured, and with respect to which any other insured did not personally participate or personally acquiesce or remain passive after having personal knowledge thereof,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\"><em>U </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">\u201c[American Home] agrees that such insurance as would otherwise be afforded under this policy shall cover and be paid with respect to each and every insured who did not personally commit or personally participate in committing or personally acquiesce in or remain passive after having personal knowledge of one or more of the acts, errors or omissions described in any such exclusion * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">\u201cWith respect to this provision, [American Home\u2019s] obligation to pay in such event shall be in excess of the deductible and in excess of the full extent of any assets of any insured to whom the exclusion applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Tilberry, then one of Pearne Gordon\u2019s partners, and Pearne Gordon were served a motion for sanctions in one of Tilberry\u2019s federal patent cases. The motion alleged that the movant\u2019s opponent\u2019s lawyers, including Tilberry and Pearne Gordon, had disobeyed a discovery order. It asked for reimbursement of their client\u2019s attorney fees and an equal amount as a sanction. One of Tilberry\u2019s letters was attached that suggested it would be a good idea to keep certain documents from the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">Pearne Gordon asked American Home to defend it against the motion under the Innocent Insured Provision. American Home conceded that Pearne Gordon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>was an \u201cinnocent insured,\u201d but refused to defend. It claimed that exclusion (k) provides that it never pays sanctions. Because the motion was not a suit for damages payable under the policy, it need not provide a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Pearne Gordon paid $30,913.85 in legal fees to successfully defend against the motion. It sued American Home for reimbursement. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted American Home\u2019s motion without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Pearne Gordon\u2019s assignments of error are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erroneously granted defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erroneously failed to grant plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">To interpret insurance contracts, courts consider \u201cthe policy language as a whole\u201d to determine a \u201c\u2018reasonable construction [of the contract] in conformity with the intention of the parties as gathered from the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the language employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 211, 519 N.E.2d 1380, 1383 (quoting <em>Dealers Dairy Prod. Co. v. Royal Ins. Co. </em>[1960], 170 Ohio St. 336, 10 O.O.2d 424, 164 N.E.2d 745, paragraph one of the syllabus). However, a contract \u201cmust be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer if the language used is doubtful, uncertain or ambiguous.\u201d <em>Am. Financial Corp. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 171, 173, 44 O.O.2d 147, 148, 239 N.E.2d 33, 35. \u201cLanguage in a contract of insurance reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning will be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.\u201d <em>Faruque v. Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 34, 31 OBR 83, 508 N.E.2d 949, syllabus. Pearne Gordon\u2019s contract interpretation is implemented if it is a reasonable interpretation of uncertain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Pearne Gordon argues as follows that the Innocent Insured Provision requires American Home to pay its legal expenses to defend against the motion. The motion is related to Tilberry\u2019s malicious acts. Tilberry\u2019s coverage is excluded by either exclusion (a), (b) or (k).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Tilberry\u2019s exclusion relates to his malicious acts, the Innocent Insured Provision is activated for Pearne Gordon. It is entitled to \u201csuch insurance as would otherwise be available under this policy\u201d including a defense against the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>American Home argues as follows that it need not pay Pearne Gordon\u2019s legal expenses. Pearne Gordon is an innocent insured. The Innocent Insured Provision provides Pearne Gordon \u201csuch insurance as would otherwise be afforded under this policy * * This does not include payment of attorney fees and sanctions, as asked for in the motion, because of exclusion (k). Because it never pays attorney fees or sanctions, it need not provide a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Both interpretations present problems. Pearne Gordon\u2019s interpretation may have American Home paying damages, including punitives and fines, and providing a defense whenever one of Pearne Gordon\u2019s attorneys is malicious and Pearne Gordon is innocent. American Home\u2019s interpretation breaks down in that it fails to explain how or why the Innocent Insured Provision deactivates exclusions (a) and (b) with respect to the innocent insured but not (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Constrained by the policy\u2019s language and construing uncertainties in the insured\u2019s favor, Pearne Gordon is entitled to a defense. It is a reasonable interpretation of uncertain language that exclusion (k) is an exclusion \u201crelat[ed] to criminal, dishonest, fraudulent or malicious acts.\u201d Tilberry\u2019s insurance is excluded by exclusion (k). The Innocent Insured Provision is activated for Pearne Gordon \u2014 it gets such insurance as is otherwise afforded under the policy. This includes (1) payment of all \u201cclaims,\u201d defined as demands for money, and (2) a defense to any suit for damages payable under the policy. The motion\u2019s sanctions are payable because Pearne Gordon is an innocent insured and Pearne Gordon is entitled to a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">If it is required to insure Pearne Gordon against the motion, American Home argues that a separate deductible applies for Innocent Insured Provision insurance. The policy\u2019s language does not support this position. The declarations contain one $25,000 annual <em>aggregate </em>deductible. Only one deductible is described in the policy\u2019s deductible section. The Innocent Insured Provision refers to \u201cthe deductible\u201d and does not suggest it is separate or different from the policy\u2019s aggregate deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">American Home must pay for Pearne Gordon\u2019s defense against the motion. One deductible applies to all damages and claims expenses incurred during the year whether they arise from the Innocent Insured Provision or otherwise. Pearne Gordon\u2019s assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The judgment for appellee is reversed and judgment is entered for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-10\">Blackmon and Harper, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\">. Pearne Gordon\u2019s argument hinges on exclusion (k) \"relating to criminal, dishonest, fraudulent or malicious acts.\" American Home argues that only exclusions (a) and (b) so relate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
