No. 00083. In his single assignment of error, Leichtman contends that his complaint was sufficient to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and, therefore, the trial court was in error when it granted the defendants\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion. We agree in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In his complaint, Leichtman claims to be \u201ca nationally known\u201d antismoking advocate. Leichtman alleges that, on the date of the Great American Smokeout, he was invited to appear on the WLW Bill Cunningham radio talk show to discuss the harmful effects of smoking and breathing secondary smoke. He also alleges that, while he was in the studio, Furman, another WLW talk-show host, lit a cigar and repeatedly blew smoke in Leichtman\u2019s face \u201cfor the purpose of causing physical discomfort, humiliation and distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Under the rules of notice pleading, Civ.R. 8(A)(1) requires only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d When construing a complaint for failure to state a claim, under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), the court assumes that the factual allegations on the face of the complaint are true. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus. For the court to grant a motion to dismiss, \u201cit must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A court cannot dismiss a complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) merely because it doubts the plaintiff will prevail. <em>Slife v. Kundtz Properties, Inc. </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 179, 69 O.O.2d 178, 318 N.E.2d 557. Because it is so easy for the pleader to satisfy the standard of Civ.R. 8(A), few complaints are subject to dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 182, 69 O.O.2d at 180, 318 N.E.2d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Leichtman contends that Furman\u2019s intentional act constituted a battery. The Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">\u201cAn actor is subject to liability to another for battery if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">\u201c(a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other * * *, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">\u201c(b) a harmful contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results[; or]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201c[c] an offensive contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Footnote added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In determining if a person is liable for a battery, the Supreme Court has adopted the rule that \u201c[c]ontact which is offensive to a reasonable sense of personal dignity is offensive contact.\u201d <em>Love v. Port Clinton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 524 N.E.2d 166, 167. It has defined \u201coffensive\u201d to mean \u201cdisagreeable or nauseating or painful because of outrage to taste and sensibilities or affronting insultingness.\u201d <em>State v. Phipps </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 271, 274, 12 O.O.3d 273, 275, 389 N.E.2d 1128, 1131. Furthermore, tobacco smoke, as \u201cparticulate matter,\u201d has the physical properties capable of making contact. R.C. 3704.01(B) and 5709.20(A); Ohio Adm.Code 3745-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As alleged in Leichtman\u2019s complaint, when Furman intentionally blew cigar smoke in Leichtman\u2019s face, under Ohio common law, he committed a battery. No matter how trivial the incident, a battery is actionable, even if damages are only one dollar. <em>Lacey v. Laird </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 12, 1 O.O.2d 158, 139 N.E.2d 25, paragraph two of the syllabus. The rationale is explained by Roscoe Pound in his essay \u201cLiability\u201d: \u201c[I]n civilized society men must be able to assume that others will do them no intentional injury \u2014 that others will commit no intentioned aggressions upon them.\u201d Pound, An Introduction to the Philosophy of Law (1922) 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Other jurisdictions also have concluded that a person can commit a battery by intentionally directing tobacco smoke at another. <em>Richardson v. Hennly </em>(1993), 209 Ga.App. 868, 871, 434 S.E.2d 772, 774-775. We do not, however, adopt or lend credence to the theory of a \u201csmoker\u2019s battery,\u201d which imposes liability if there is substantial certainty that exhaled smoke will predictably contact a nonsmoker. Ezra, Smoker Battery: An Antidote to Second-Hand Smoke (1990), 63 S.Cal.L.Rev. 1061, 1090. Also, whether the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d prong of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>intent from the Restatement of Torts translates to liability for secondary smoke via the intentional tort doctrine in employment cases as defined by the Supreme Court in <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph one of the syllabus, need not be decided here because Leichtman\u2019s claim for battery is based exclusively on Furman\u2019s commission of a deliberate act. Finally, because Leichtman alleges that Furman deliberately blew smoke into his face, we find it unnecessary to address offensive contact from passive or secondary smoke under the \u201cglass cage\u201d defense of <em>McCracken v. Sloan </em>(1979), 40 N.C.App. 214, 217, 252 S.E.2d 250, 252, relied on by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Neither Cunningham nor WLW is entitled to judgment on the battery claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Concerning Cunningham, at common law, one who is present and encourages or incites commission of a battery by words can be equally liable as a principal. <em>Bell v. Miller </em>(1831), 5 Ohio 250; 6 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1978) 121-122, Assault, Section 20. Leichtman\u2019s complaint states, \u201cAt Defendant Cunningham\u2019s urging, Defendant Furman repeatedly blew cigar smoke in Plaintiffs face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">With regard to WLW, an employer is not legally responsible for the intentional torts of its employees that do not facilitate or promote its business. <em>Osborne v. Lyles </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 326, 329-330, 587 N.E.2d 825, 828-829. However, whether an employer is liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>because its employee is acting within the scope of employment is ordinarily a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 587 N.E.2d at 825. Accordingly, Leichtman\u2019s claim for battery with the allegations against the three defendants in the second count of the complaint is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">By contrast, the first and third counts of Leichtman\u2019s complaint do not state claims upon which relief can be granted. The trial court correctly granted the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion as to both counts. In his first count, Leichtman alleged a tortious invasion of his privacy. See, generally, Restatement, <em>supra, </em>at 376, Section 652B, as adopted by <em>Sustin v. Fee </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 143, 145, 23 O.O.3d 182, 183-184, 431 N.E.2d 992, 993. A claim for invasion of privacy may involve any one of four distinct torts. Prosser, Privacy (1960), 48 Cal.L.Rev. 383. The tort that is relevant here requires some substantial intrusion into a plaintiffs solitude, seclusion, habitation, or affairs that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. See, <em>e.g., </em>Restatement, <em>supra, </em>at 378-379, Section 652B, Comments <em>a </em>to <em>d; Killilea v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 163, 166, 27 OBR 196, 198-199, 499 N.E.2d 1291, 1294. Leichtman acknowledges that he willingly entered the WLW radio studio to make a public radio appearance with Cunningham, who is known for his blowtorch rhetoric. Therefore, Leicht-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>man\u2019s allegations do not support his assertion that Furman, Cunningham, or WLW intruded into his privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In his third count, Leichtman attempts to create a private right of action for violation of Cincinnati Bd. of Health Reg. No. 00083, which makes it illegal to smoke in designated public places. Even if we are to assume, for argument, that a municipal regulation is tantamount to public policy established by a statute enacted by the General Assembly, the regulation has created rights for nonsmokers that did not exist at common law. Bd. of Health Reg., <em>supra, </em>at Sections 00083-7 and 00083-13. Therefore, because sanctions also are provided to enforce the regulation, there is no implied private remedy for its violation. R.C. 3707.99, 3707.48(C); <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 169, 572 N.E.2d 87, 89-90; <em>Fawcett v. G.C. Murphy &amp; Co. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 245, 248-250, 75 O.O.2d 291, 293-294, 348 N.E.2d 144, 147 (superseded by statute on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Arguably, trivial cases are responsible for an avalanche of lawsuits in the courts. They delay cases that are important to individuals and corporations and that involve important social issues. The result is justice denied to litigants and their counsel who must wait for their day in court. However, absent circumstances that warrant sanctions for frivolous appeals under App.R. 23, we refuse to limit one\u2019s right to sue. Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution states, \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">This case emphasizes the need for some form of alternative dispute resolution operating totally outside the court system as a means to provide an attentive ear to the parties and a resolution of disputes in a nominal case. Some need a forum in which they can express corrosive contempt for another without dragging their antagonist through the expense inherent in a lawsuit. Until such an alternative forum is created, Leichtman\u2019s battery claim, previously knocked out by the trial judge in the first round, now survives round two to advance again through the courts into round three.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the first and third counts of the complaint, but we reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s order that dismissed the battery claim in the second count of the complaint. This cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law on that claim only.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-10\">Doan, P.J., Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-12\">.
