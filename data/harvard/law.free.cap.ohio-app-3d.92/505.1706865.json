McBride, from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Van Wert County granting the motion of the defendant-appellee, Coble Express, Inc. (\u201cCoble\u201d), for summary judgment and dismissing the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">On February 18, 1986, McBride, an Ohio resident, was injured in Ohio while in the course of his employment as a truck driver for Coble, an Indiana-based corporation. McBride applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the Industrial Commission of Ohio for a \u201ccrush\u201d injury and fracture to his left leg. The claim was allowed on July 23, 1986. Although Coble was given the opportunity to object to the decision of the hearing board, no objection to the award was filed, and benefits were paid to McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">On March 19, 1987, a hearing was held on McBride\u2019s motion for temporary total disability benefits. On September 3, 1987, benefits were allowed by the hearing officer, and the claim was \u201cadditionally allowed\u201d for amputation of McBride\u2019s injured left leg.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coble appealed the September 1987 decision to the regional board of review, which affirmed the allowance of McBride\u2019s claim for additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Coble further appealed to the Industrial Commission. On March 9, 1992, the commission affirmed the allowance of McBride\u2019s claim, in toto, issuing the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u201c * * * that the commission find from proof of record that this claim has been recognized for: crush injury and fracture left leg, amputation left leg, acute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>somatic dysfunction of thoracic and lumbosacral spine secondary to misfitting prosthesis, post-traumatic stress disorder.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cThe matter came before the members of the Industrial Commission on the issues of employer\u2019s appeal filed April 11, 1988 and employer\u2019s oral motion that the Commission reconsider the prior determinations that Ohio is the proper State for jurisdiction over this injury. It is the finding and order of the Industrial Commission that the facts of this claim demonstrate that the claim has properly been allowed as an Ohio claim. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The commission further found it \u201cnoteworthy that the claim was allowed by unappealed [sic ] [Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation] tentative order based upon the employer\u2019s full certification July 23, 1986. The employer did not raise concerns about the propriety of the exercise of jurisdiction by Ohio until it became evident that substantial compensation would be paid out of this claim as a result of the severity of claimant\u2019s injury. * * * Employer through counsel states they [sic ] do not object to the award of compensation for loss of leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Coble timely filed its notice of appeal from the commission\u2019s decision in the Court of Common Pleas of Van Wert County, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519. McBride filed the requisite complaint asserting his right to participate in the State Insurance Fund, as set forth in the statute. Coble filed its answer, alleging that (1) Coble, as an Indiana employer, was not amenable to the workers\u2019 compensation law of Ohio, and (2) McBride\u2019s participation in an insurance fund in Indiana precluded his receipt of benefits under the laws of Ohio, and that, therefore, the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. Phillip McBride contended that all jurisdictional issues were <em>res judicata. </em>He further asserted that summary judgment should not be granted in favor of Coble, because the issue of appellant\u2019s right to continuing benefits raised questions of material fact to be decided by a jury. As the basis for its motion, Coble maintained that \u201cthe Ohio Industrial Commission did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The trial court granted Coble\u2019s motion, and overruled McBride\u2019s motion. McBride has appealed the court\u2019s judgment, asserting that the court erroneously granted judgment to Coble and further erred in dismissing the complaint. Since we find Coble\u2019s jurisdictional arguments to be without merit, and further find that there may exist genuine issues of material fact as to claimant McBride\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>right to \u201ccontinue to participate\u201d in the State Insurance Fund, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The trial court in this case determined that since the facts \u201cmaterial to the determination of the issues herein\u201d are \u201cuncontroverted,\u201d summary judgment should be granted \u201cbased upon the evidence presented by the parties.\u201d Although we agree that the facts recited by the trial court were uncontroverted, we find those particular undisputed facts irrelevant and immaterial to a determination of the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We agree with the trial court and Coble that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised by objection at any time in the proceedings because subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, see, <em>e.g., Jenkins v. Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 122, 126, 35 O.O.2d 147, 149, 216 N.E.2d 379, 382. However, we find that a lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not the actual basis for the trial court\u2019s decision below. Rather, the trial court supports its decision with only a <em>personal </em>jurisdiction analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Personal jurisdiction is the authority of a particular forum to enter a judgment constitutionally binding on the defendant in the case. Friedenthal, Kane <em>&amp; </em>Miller (1985) 10-11, Civil Procedure, Section 2.2. The traditional bases, and still the underlying foundations for assertions of personal jurisdiction, are \u201cthe presence of the person or thing involved in the litigation within the forum\u2019s territorial boundaries or the consent [express or implied] of the party,\u201d although \u201cstrict\u201d physical presence is no longer necessary. The Supreme Court has continued to develop the concept, presently requiring a court to find that a defendant has certain voluntary contacts with a forum, such that assertion of personal jurisdiction is defensible on the constitutional notions of notice, fairness, and due process. See Friedenthal at 102-103, Section 3.4. In this case, Coble, the employer, knowingly entered into a contract of employment with an Ohio resident, for work to be performed primarily in Ohio, and the employee was injured in Ohio. Based on these facts, it would be difficult to find it unfair for Coble to submit to Ohio\u2019s jurisdictional authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Dotson v. Com Trans, Inc. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 98, 104, 601 N.E.2d 126, 130, citing <em>Bridges v. Natl. Eng. &amp; Contracting Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 108, 551 N.E.2d 163. Cf. <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Stanadyne, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 199, 12 OBR 264, 466 N.E.2d 171 (holding employee\u2019s residence irrelevant because all other material circumstances were related only to Indiana).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Moreover, a defendant may always concede personal jurisdiction; indeed, any objection to assumption of personal jurisdiction is waived by a party\u2019s failure to assert a challenge at its first appearance in the case, and such defendant is considered to have consented to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Once an action has been determined on its merits, after the considerations of notice and due process have been satisfied without challenge, a defendant waives its right to contest personal jurisdiction and has impliedly consented to the forum\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction. See <em>Scott v. E. Cleveland </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 429, 431, 16 OBR 500, 502, 476 N.E.2d 710, 713 (res <em>judicata </em>applicable to issues which have been reviewed before an administrative body, wherein no appeal has been taken).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On the other hand, whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a determination as to \u201cwhether the court chosen has the power or competence to decide the kind of controversy that is involved. * * * Questions of subject matter jurisdiction typically are determined by reference to state or federal constitutional provisions or statutes that authorize particular courts to entertain certain categories of controversies.\u201d Friedenthal, <em>supra, </em>at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In workers\u2019 compensation cases, subject matter jurisdiction has been granted to the Industrial Commission and to the common pleas courts by the legislature. See R.C. 4123.54; R.C. 4123.84; R.C. 4123.519. The commission thus has a statutory grant of power to determine the right of an injured worker to participate in the fund for injuries sustained in the course of employment, with few specified exceptions, none of which applies to this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Dotson, supra, </em>76 Ohio App.3d at 102, 601 N.E.2d at 129 (wherein the court was required to determine both subject matter <em>and </em>personal jurisdiction). The statute specifically authorizes the commission to hear cases involving injury in this state to a resident of this state who is injured in the course of his employment, regardless of whether he recovers benefits under the law of another state. R.C. 4123.54(B). In fact, the code provides for such situation by affording a foreign employer the opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund by contract with the employee and notice to the Industrial Commission. R.C. 4123.54.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Further, the courts of common pleas have subject matter jurisdiction as bestowed upon them under the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. An appeal is permitted in the court of common pleas \u201cin the county where the injury or death occurred, or to the county in which the contract of employment was made, if the injury or death occurred outside [Ohio].\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>6 Ohio St.2d at 127, 35 O.O.2d at 149, 216 N.E.2d at 382. R.C. 4123.519 thus provides for subject matter jurisdiction in the common pleas courts for the purpose of appeal by either a claimant or an employer, only on the issue of the claimant\u2019s right to participation or continued participation, due to an additional injury, in the workers\u2019 compensation system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">R.C. 4123.52 and 4123.84 specifically grant the Industrial Commission continuing subject matter jurisdiction over the original claim for \u201closs or impairment of bodily functions\u201d which are \u201cdue to and a result of or a residual of the injury to one of the parts of the body\u201d for which compensation was granted pursuant to the claimant\u2019s original petition. R.C. 4123.84(B)(3). In this case, Coble has availed itself of Ohio\u2019s jurisdiction by failing to object to the authority of the Industrial Commission to award benefits to McBride for his injuries, thus consenting to \u201cpersonal jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Now, when the commission asserts its statutorily authorized \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d to allow disability benefits due to exacerbation of McBride\u2019s original injuries, objection to personal jurisdiction is not an avenue available to Coble. Coble\u2019s attempt to create a position for itself by improperly designating the jurisdiction argument as one against \u201csubject matter jurisdiction,\u201d while supporting its position only with an analysis of personal jurisdiction authority,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We find that the Industrial Commission\u2019s additional award of benefits specifically for \u201cacute somatic dysfunction of thoracic and lumbosacral spine secondary to misfitting prosthesis, post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d is a \u201cnew\u201d determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>of McBride\u2019s right to continuing participation in the fund, and not a decision as to his extent of disability. The common pleas court thus has subject matter jurisdiction to hear an appeal on that part of the decision, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 and <em>Felty v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 240, 602 N.E.2d 1141, 1146. See, also, <em>Davis v. Connor </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 174, 13 OBR 209, 468 N.E.2d 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We also find Coble\u2019s contention that McBride\u2019s participation in the Indiana workers\u2019 compensation system precludes his participation in Ohio\u2019s fund without merit. As stated above, R.C. 4123.54 specifically provides for such contingency by granting the employer the opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of the Ohio system and, further, by providing for a \u201ccredit\u201d to an employer for the amounts paid under another state\u2019s compensation system. Thus, the possibility of a claimant\u2019s receiving compensation from more than one state was foreseen, and was specifically addressed by the Ohio legislature. See <em>Lynch v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 229, 235, 590 N.E.2d 351, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Consequently, the <em>only </em>issue for determination in this case is whether McBride\u2019s \u201cacute somatic dysfunction of thoracic and lumbosacral spine secondary to misfitting prosthesis\u201d following the amputation of his injured leg, and \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder\u201d were a \u201cresult of or a residual of\u2019 the injuries for which he was originally granted compensation, thus entitling him to benefits as ordered by the Industrial Commission. See R.C. 4123.84(B)(3). Although the conclusion of the commission seems unavoidably appropriate, the issue is, under the statute, one for consideration by a jury,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>or, </em>if after consideration of the facts reasonable minds could only conclude that those conditions <em>did </em>arise out of the injuries claimed in the claimant\u2019s original petition, the case could be disposed of by summary judgment in favor of appellant. In this action, the claimant, Phillip McBride, was wrongly deprived by the trial court of either opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-9\">Shaw and Thomas F. Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-14\">. The record is incomplete as to filings in the administrative process, and thus we are unable to ascertain the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s request for benefits for the amputation, or even if there <em>was </em>a written application for those \"additionally allowed\" benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\">. It is not clear from the record at what point in the adjudication process these \"related\u201d claims were raised and first resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">. See, <em>e.g., Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (purposeful establishment of minimum contacts with a forum state subjects defendant to personal jurisdiction), citing, <em>e.g., Internatl. Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95. See, also, <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall Co. v. Mitchell\u2019s Formal Wear, Inc. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 73, 559 N.E.2d 477 (negotiating and executing a lease with an Ohio partnership for lease of a Kentucky property was sufficient minimum contact for Ohio court to asset jurisdiction over Georgia corporation); <em>Reliance Elec. Co. v. Luecke </em>(S.D.Ohio 1988), 695 F.Supp. 917 (nonresident defendant subjected self to long-arm jurisdiction in Ohio by its intentional act of entering into a contractual relationship with a resident of Ohio).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. R.C. 4123.54 prohibits recovery of workers' compensation benefits if: (1) injury is self-inflicted or suffered as a result of intoxication, (2) the employee has contracted with his employer to be bound by the workers' compensation laws of another state, (3) the employee is both a resident of another state and insured under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of another state, or (4) the employee is incarcerated. None of these exceptions is applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">. Coble failed to take advantage of that provision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. The Supreme Court has determined that the code provisions must be read restrictively to mean that \u201d[t]he <em>only </em>decisions of the commission that may be appealed to the courts of common pleas under R.C. 4123.519 are those that are final and that resolve an employee\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the State Insurance Fund.\u201d <em>Felty v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 238, 602 N.E.2d 1141, 1145, following <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175; <em>Zavatsky v.
