We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">Johnson filed its complaint alleging fraud on the part of the defendants-appellees, Alltel Corp., Western Reserve Telephone Company and Sue Andrews. Johnson claims that on August 6, 1992, the defendants established a bidding procedure to utilize in retaining janitorial services, which they then failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>follow. The defendants moved to dismiss Johnson\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted on September 29, 1992. Johnson did not respond and the court dismissed its claim on November 13, 1992. Johnson appeals, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">\u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing this action as it stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should be granted only if the complaint does' not set forth any set of facts which would permit recovery. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus. In ruling on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, a court must accept as true all the allegations in the complaint. <em>Phung v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 100, 102, 23 OBR 260, 262, 491 N.E.2d 1114, 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A complaint for fraud must include five elements: (1) a false representation; (2) knowledge by the person making the representation that it is false; (3) intent by the person making the representation to induce the other to rely on the representation; (4) rightful reliance by the other to his detriment; and (5) an injury as a result of the reliance. <em>Korodi v. Minot </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 1, 3, 531 N.E.2d 318, 320-321. In <em>Korodi, </em>the court noted three requirements that must be met in order for a complaint sounding in fraud to state a cause of action: (1) the plaintiff must specify the alleged false statement; (2) the complaint must state the time and place the statement was made; and (3) the plaintiff must identify the defendant who made the statement. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 531 N.E.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In its complaint, Johnson alleged the following facts pertaining to fraudulent misrepresentations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\u201c25. When efforts in bad faith [to terminate the defendants\u2019 relationship with Johnson] failed by defendant Andrews, defendants devised a \u2018bidding1 process in November, 1990 solely as a means to defeat the ongoing contract defendants maintained with plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201c26. In a notice dated November 20,1990, defendants Alltel, Western Reserve Telephone Company and Andrews directed that a \u2018sealed bid\u2019 was required to be returned to defendant Andrews no later than December 17, 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201c27. The November 20, 1990 notice further indicated that the \u2018bids would be opened on January 7, 1991, and [the] contract will be awarded at that time.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">\u201c28. Plaintiff complied with the requirements of the November 20, 1990 notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201c29. Plaintiff discovered that its sealed bid had been opened before the January 7, 1991 deadline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201c30. Upon belief of the plaintiff, information concerning plaintiffs bid was provided to others and a bid by a firm not as experienced and with inadequate personnel was permitted to submit a bid approximately .75% lower in order to avoid the legitimacy of the bidding process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201c31. As a result of the foregoing, plaintiff has lost and continues to lose the equivalence of the bid which, to date, exceeds at least $84,000.00 in actual loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201c37. The rigging of the bidding process in order to injure the plaintiff by denying it an opportunity to perform services was fraudulent, deceptive and undertaken with malice, bad faith and with an intent to injure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Based on these portions of its complaint, Johnson has stated a claim for which relief could be granted. The defendants told Johnson that sealed bids would be opened on January 7. However, Johnson alleges those bids were opened earlier and its bid was allegedly shown to its competitors. Thus, in this case Johnson has met the three requirements from <em>Korodi: </em>Johnson alleged it was falsely told a sealed bid <em>process </em>would be followed to award the janitorial contract; this alleged false statement was conveyed in a notice dated November 20, 1990; and the false statement was allegedly made by all three defendants. Accordingly, the court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The defendants also allege that the court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed because the plaintiffs complaint did not name the real party in interest. Civ.R. 17(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">\u201c(A) Real party in interest. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. * * * No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest. Such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The rule provides a plaintiff with an opportunity to amend his complaint if it is done in a reasonable time. This is in keeping with the spirit of the Civil Rules, which is the resolution of cases on their merits, not upon deficiencies in the pleadings. <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 175, 63 O.O.2d 262, 269, 297 N.E.2d 113, 122. Further, the timeliness of a motion to amend a complaint is determined by the reasonable diligence of the plaintiff and any prejudice to the defendant\u2019s claim, questions which we are unable to determine on a review of the pleadings. See <em>Patterson v. V &amp; M Auto Body </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 573, 575, 589 N.E.2d 1306, 1308, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Johnson\u2019s assignment of error is well taken. The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AGZB\"><em>Cook, P.J., </em>and Dickinson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
