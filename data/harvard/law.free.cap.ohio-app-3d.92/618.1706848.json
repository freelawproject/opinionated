Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Kimberly J. Hedrick (\u201cappellant\u201d) is appealing from a conviction of one count of passing a bad check in violation of R.C. 2913.11(A), a felony of the fourth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. On September 13, 1991, in Greene County, Ohio, the appellant wrote a check to a realty company in payment of past due rent for the months of August and September 1991. The check was returned by the bank marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d The check was in the amount of $700 and the appellant never made it good. Appellant was indicted on May 22, 1992. She initially entered a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">On October 26, 1992, appellant\u2019s appointed counsel filed a motion to dismiss upon the same grounds that are presented to this court in this appeal. The state filed a memorandum contra appellant\u2019s motion, and on November 5, 1992, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion. The appellant then entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty as charged. The sentence of one year was suspended and the appellant was placed on probation and subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal. During her plea hearing, the appellant clearly admitted all the facts that were in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">The appellant brings to this court the same issue it presented to the trial court, that is, \u201cwhether the payment of a past due account by means of a worthless check, without more, constitutes a criminal offense under Revised Code Section 2913.11.\u201d Brief of appellant, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">This issue was decided by the trial court, the Honorable Thomas M. Rose, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-16\">\u201cThe basis underlying Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is that under <em>State v. Rudd, </em>55 Ohio Misc.2d 1 [562 N.E.2d 955] (Hamilton Co., 1988), payment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>past due account by means of a worthless check, without more, does not constitute a criminal offense under Section 2913.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. Defendant was charged with writing a bad check to cover a past due rent obligation. Therefore, Defendant argues that under <em>State v. Rudd, </em>Defendant\u2019s actions do not constitute a criminal offense. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cAlternatively, in <em>State v. Doane, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh District found that a person can be charged with Passing Bad Checks, under R.C. 2913.11, even if those checks are written to cover a pre-existing debt. 69 Ohio App.3d 638 [591 N.E.2d 735] (1990). The Court relied on an earlier decision by the Ohio Supreme Court, <em>State v. Lowenstein, </em>109 Ohio St. 393 [142 N.E. 897] (1924), in which \u2018fraud\u2019 was defined as \u2018deception deliberately practiced with a view to gaining an unlawful or unfair advantage.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>[69 Ohio App.3d] at 650 [591 N.E.2d at 744]. Under this definition the Court in <em>Lowenstein </em>found that purely financial damage was not a prerequisite for a finding of fraud. 109 Ohio St. at 400 [142 N.E. at 898]. If the person writing the check gains any type of advantage as a result of his/her actions there has been fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 400 [142 N.E. at 898].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cThe Court in <em>Doane </em>compared the use of the word \u2018fraud\u2019 under the analysis in <em>Lowenstein </em>with the term \u2018defraud\u2019 as defined in R.C. 2913.01(B): \u2018Defraud means to knowingly obtain, by deception, some benefit for oneself or another, or to knowingly cause, by deception some detriment to another.\u2019 69 Ohio App.3d at 650 [591 N.E.2d at 744]. The Court found that for the purposes of interpreting R.C. 2913.11, passing bad checks, there is no distinction between the terms \u2018advantage\u2019, as used in the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Lowenstein, </em>and \u2018benefit\u2019 under R.C. 2913.01(B). <em>Id. </em>The Court in <em>Doane </em>then found that the <em>Lowenstein </em>precedent is still binding, and that a check given for a pre-existing debt can be the basis of a violation of the statutory prohibition. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cTherefore, under <em>State v. Doane, </em>the Defendant\u2019s actions do constitute an actionable offense under R.C. 2913.11.\u201d Judgment Entry, at 1-2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The issue appears to be one of first impression in this appellate district.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The offense of passing bad checks is set forth in R.C. 2913.11, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">\u201c(A) No person, with purpose to defraud, shall issue or transfer or cause to be issued or transferred a check or other negotiable instrument, knowing that it will be dishonored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">\u201c(B) For purposes of this section, a person who issues or transfers a check or other negotiable instrument is presumed to know that it will be dishonored, if either of the following occurs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u201c(1) The drawer had no account with the drawee at the time of issue or the stated date, whichever is later;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201c(2) The check or other negotiable instrument was properly refused payment for insufficient funds upon presentment within thirty days after issue or the stated date, whichever is later, and the liability of the drawer, indorser, or any party who may be liable thereon is not discharged by payment or satisfaction within ten days after receiving notice of dishonor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u00ab \u2021 \u2021 $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201c(D) Whoever violates this section is guilty of passing bad checks. If the check or other negotiable instrument is for the payment of less than three hundred dollars, passing a bad check is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the check or other negotiable instrument is for payment of three hundred dollars or more and is for the payment of less than five thousand dollars, or if the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, passing bad checks is a felony of the fourth degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The term \u201cdefraud\u201d is defined in R.C. 2913.01(B) as to \u201cknowingly obtain, by deception, some benefit for one\u2019s self or another, or to knowingly cause, by deception, some detriment to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The Hamilton County Municipal Court held in the <em>Rudd </em>case that the defendant there could not have had a \u201cpurpose to defraud,\u201d since the check was presented as payment on an antecedent debt. The court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">\u201cWhere a check, subsequently found to be worthless, is tendered for the payment of an antecedent or pre-existing debt, the creditor is not defrauded, since the debt still remains and the creditor is not fraudulently induced to part with property in reliance upon the check\u2019s value.\u201d <em>Id., </em>55 Ohio Misc.2d at 2, 562 N.E.2d at 956.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The municipal court in <em>Rudd </em>noted that it was joining the majority view on the issue, and it is true that a bare majority (ten) of courts of other states which have taken up the issue have ruled that if a worthless check is given in presumed payment of a pre-existing debt, nothing else appearing, there can be no fraudulent intent. See Annotation, Construction and Effect of \u201cBad Check\u201d Statute With Respect to Check in Payment of Pre-existing Debt (1958), 59 A.L.R.2d 1159. Courts in seven other states, including California and New York, plus the District of Columbia, have held the other way. New Jersey and Georgia courts have gone both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">The only Ohio Supreme Court decision on the issue is <em>State v. Lowenstein </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 393, 142 N.E. 897, which held that the mere fact that a worthless check is given for a past consideration does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>relieve the passer of the bad check from the criminal charge provided by the statute. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>holding of <em>Lowenstein </em>was recognized as the law in Ohio by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County in <em>Gutridge v. State </em>(1930), 37 Ohio App. 1, 173 N.E. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The municipal court in <em>Rudd </em>argued that <em>Lowenstein </em>is not controlling, since the Supreme Court \u201c(1) did not reach the issue here, and (2) held only that the prosecution would have the right to prove facts that could take it out of the situation in this case. Additionally, the statute now in effect, R.C. 2913.11, is totally different from the prior statute in <em>Lowenstein </em>and does not include the <em>presumption of intent to defraud, </em>probably because such a presumption would be blatantly unconstitutional (an issue not addressed in Lowenstein).\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Rudd, supra, </em>55 Ohio Misc.2d at 3, 562 N.E.2d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\"><em>Rudd </em>was decided on December 27, 1988, but, according to appellant, was not published until November 1990. Appellant\u2019s brief at 3. In the interim, however, the exact same issue was taken up by the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County in <em>State v. Doane </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 638, 591 N.E.2d 735, where the court held on October 1, 1990, that the presentment of a bad check to pay a preexisting debt can indeed be a felony of the fourth degree under R.C. 2913.11. While the court there was apparently unaware of the <em>Rudd </em>decision, it did cite and rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in <em>Lowenstein </em>where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201c * * * the Ohio Supreme Court held that a prima facie violation of the applicable statute had been alleged when the prosecuting attorney stated during his opening argument that the bad check had been given for a past consideration. At that time, the applicable statute provided that a felony had been committed if a person, with intent to defraud, drew a check when insufficient funds were on deposit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">\u201cInterpreting this statute, the <em>Lowenstein </em>court quoted Webster\u2019s definition of fraud: \u2018 \u201cFraud\u201d is a \u201cdeception deliberately practiced with a view to gaining an unlawful or unfair advantage.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 400, 142 N.E. at 898. Pursuant to this definition, the court concluded that <em>financial </em>damage was not a prerequisite for a finding of fraud. Instead, it was sufficient if the person issuing the check gained some type of advantage as a result of his actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">\u201c \u201cWhen in payment of a past consideration a man gives a check, if he gives the check knowing that he had not funds on deposit to cover it, why does he so act? He so acts because he expects to gain an advantage. He expects perhaps to deceive persons who are pressing for payment; he expects them to think that he had paid the old debt when he has not paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 142 N.E. at 899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">\u201cIn the modern Revised Code, the term \u2018defraud\u2019 is defined in R.C. 2913.01:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">\u201c \u2018(B) \u201cDefraud\u201d means to knowingly obtain, by deception, some benefit for oneself or another, or to knowingly cause, by deception some detriment to another.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>\u201cFor the purposes of interpreting R.C. 2913.11, passing bad checks, this court fails to see any distinction between the terms \u2018advantage\u2019 and \u2018benefit.\u2019 In this regard, it should be noted that the present definition does not require that something of value be obtained as a result of the deception. Thus, this court holds that the <em>Lowenstein </em>precedent is still binding, and that a check given for a pre-existing debt can be the basis of a violation of the statutory prohibition.\u201d <em>Id., </em>69 Ohio App.3d at 650, 591 N.E.2d at 743-744.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Two years later, the Court of Appeals for Lucas County followed the <em>Doane </em>decision and agreed with its holding that a check given for an antecedent or a pre-existing debt can be the basis for a violation of R.C. 2913.11, but then, curiously, turned the decision on its head by stating that the appellant in that case had not been proven to have had a purpose to defraud, since he still owed the money and the payee \u201chas suffered no detriment as she may bring an ordinary civil proceeding or contempt proceedings against appellant.\u201d <em>State v. Durbin </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 156, 161, 614 N.E.2d 799, 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We believe, along with our brethren in the Eleventh District <em>(Doane, </em>supra) that the decision and reasoning of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Lowenstein </em>are still valid, and we expressly disagree with the decision of the Hamilton County Municipal Court in <em>Rudd, </em>which held otherwise. The Hamilton County Municipal Court in <em>Rudd </em>mistakenly stated that the Supreme Court in <em>Lowenstein </em>did not reach the issue before the municipal court in <em>Rudd. </em>It certainly did. The question before the court in <em>Rudd </em>was whether the defendant can be found guilty of violating the statute where the check is presented solely in payment on account of an antecedent debt, and the Supreme Court in <em>Lowenstein </em>expressly held that even if the check is given in presumed payment on account of an antecedent debt the element of fraud is still present and the defendant can indeed be held guilty under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Lowenstein </em>noted that if it adopted the appellant\u2019s view in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\u201c * * * we should have to hold that where a man issues a false check in payment of a debt past due, knowing that he has no money in the bank, or insufficient credit, and immediately absconds from the jurisdiction in order to avoid service, he has committed no fraud because the check was issued in payment of a past-due obligation. This proposition states its own absurdity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201cThe crime of uttering a check to defraud is not the crime of false pretense; it is a new and distinct crime. It was created by the statute to meet a situation different from that covered by the law against obtaining under false pretenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">\u201cIt was the evident purpose of this statute to prevent the negotiation of false checks drawn on accounts which did not exist, or were insufficient to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>checks drawn. It was meant, for example, to protect hotel keepers from receiving \u2018cold checks\u2019 in payment of obligations incurred for lodging, many of which are past due. It was enacted to protect business men all over the state, to protect commercial life; about 90 per cent, of the commercial work of the world being done on credit. In order to protect the credit intercourse of the community this statute was enacted creating a new crime and providing new and distinct rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>109 Ohio St. at 401-402, 142 N.E. at 899.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The appellant argues that she did not receive anything of value for her worthless check and gained nothing in return for writing it. The elements of the crime, however, do not require the passer of the bad check to receive a material or financial benefit, but only \u201csome benefit.\u201d As the appellee notes in its brief at 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201cIn a case such as this, where a bad check is written for a past due rent obligation, the issuer of the check does receive a benefit from the issuing of that check. First, she avoids harassment of the creditor, at least for a little while. Secondly, she avoids eviction proceedings, at least for a little while. Therefore, the element of intent to defraud is shown in this case by the Defendant\u2019s expectation of some benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Finally, where is it written that the exchange of the worthless check for an item of value \u2014 real or personal property, occupation of premises, labor, etc. \u2014 has to be <em>simultaneous </em>? In a purchase on credit the seller has been induced to part with his merchandise, hotel room, or whatever, in reliance on the value of the purchaser\u2019s credit. If that credit subsequently proves worthless when a bad check is tendered in payment, has not the creditor been defrauded of his reasonable expectation of timely payment? Of course he has. To find otherwise is to defy common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The Supreme Court noted in <em>Lowenstein </em>that even in 1924, \u201cabout 90 per cent, of the commercial work of the world [is] being done on credit\u201d <em>(Lowenstein, </em>109 Ohio St. at 402, 142 N.E. at 899), and the statute in question was enacted to \u201cprotect commercial life\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Even more so today than in 1924, credit makes the world go around. It would be astonishing indeed to the general public if it learned that one could go down to the friendly department store, purchase goods using that store\u2019s own credit card, and subsequently issue a worthless check in presumed payment of the debt without being subject to a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">We expressly accept and adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Lowenstein, </em>as recently reaffirmed by the Court of Appeals <em>for </em>Trumbull County in <em>Doane, </em>which was succinctly set forth by Judge Thomas M. Rose in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>portion of his entry quoted heretofore, and we expressly reject the holding of the Hamilton County Municipal Court in <em>Rudd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-6\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
