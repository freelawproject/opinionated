The trial court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim against defendants upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiffs have appealed to this court and have argued: (1) that the trial court incorrectly concluded that they failed to state a negligence claim against defendants for refusing to investigate a charge they filed with the board alleging that their granddaughter had been sexually abused, and (2) that the trial court incorrectly concluded that they failed tp state a claim upon which relief could be granted when they had requested a declaratory judgment \u201cordering that [defendants] conduct an investigation\u201d of the charge they had filed with the board. This court affirms the judgment of the trial court because the averments of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, if true, did not show that defendants violated any duty owed plaintiffs and because plaintiffs failed to allege a justiciable controversy that entitled them to a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">According to the averments of the Neuenschwanders\u2019 complaint, commencing in approximately April 1992, the Wayne County Children Services Board and the Orrville Police Department conducted an investigation of a charge that their granddaughter had been sexually abused. That charge, according to the Neuen-schwanders, was filed by the child\u2019s mother, their daughter-in-law. Mr. Neuen-schwander was apparently viewed as a suspect during that investigation, but no criminal charges were filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">According to the Neuenschwanders, they were repeatedly told during that investigation that representatives of the children services board believed the child had been abused. The Neuenschwanders claim that Mr. Neuenschwander was eventually \u201cruled out as the alleged abuser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">On June 18, 1992, the Neuenschwanders filed their own charge with the children services board that their granddaughter had been sexually abused. According to the averments of their complaint in this case, the Neuenschwanders\u2019 charge was \u201cpremised\u201d on \u201cobservations they had made of their granddaughter, vaginal infections that the child had since she was a baby,\u201d and comments of various employees of the children services board. According to the Neuen-schwanders, the children services board failed to conduct an investigation of their charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The Neuenschwanders\u2019 complaint in this action included three \u201ccounts.\u201d By \u201cCount 1,\u201d they asserted that defendants were negligent in failing to investigate their charge \u201cin violation of Ohio Revised Code Section 2151.421.\u201d By \u201cCount 2,\u201d they asserted that defendants were negligent in the way they conducted the investigation of the initial allegations of child abuse of their granddaughter and that, as a result, they had \u201csuffered severe emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation and pain and suffering.\u201d By \u201cCount 3,\u201d they asserted that the children services board and the board\u2019s director had been negligent in failing to train board employees \u201cin how to properly conduct an investigation of child abuse or endangerment.\u201d Based upon their averments, the Neuenschwanders demanded \u201ca declaratory judgment against Defendants ordering that they conduct an investigation\u201d and judgment \u201cin the amount of $500,000.00 together with interest thereupon plus the costs of this action * *</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Although \u201cCount 2\u201d of the Neuenschwanders\u2019 complaint appears to have been addressed to the handling of the investigation of the initial charge, their counsel specifically stated at the oral argument in this case that \u201cnothing in this lawsuit is an attempt to recover for anything related to the initial investigation.\u201d The issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>presented by this appeal, therefore, is whether the Neuenschwanders set forth claims in their complaint regarding their charge to the children services board upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The Neuenschwanders\u2019 first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly concluded that they had failed to set forth a negligence claim upon which relief could be granted. The basis of their negligence claim was that the defendants had violated R.C. 2151.421 by refusing to conduct an investigation based upon their charge. That violation, according to plaintiffs, was negligence <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">A necessary prerequisite to a successful negligence claim is a duty owed plaintiffs by the defendants. See <em>Hill v. Sonitrol </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 36, 521 N.E.2d 780. One possible source of such a duty is a legislative enactment. \u201cThe violation of any specific legislative enactment enacted for the protection of private persons is of itself such a breach of duty as to constitute negligence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Eisenhuth v. Moneyhon </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 367, 372, 53 O.O. 274, 277, 119 N.E.2d 440, 443. It is not enough, however, that a defendant violated a statute and that the violation resulted in an injury to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must also show that the duty imposed by the statute was for the plaintiffs benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201cIn an action for neglect of duty it is not enough for the plaintiff to show that the defendant neglected a duty imposed by statute, and that he would not have been injured if the duty had been performed, but to entitle him to recover, he must further show that such duty was imposed for his benefit, or was one which the defendant owed to him for his protection and security, from the particular loss or injury of which he complains.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hocking Valley Ry. Co. v. Phillips </em>(1910), 81 Ohio St. 453, 462, 91 N.E. 118, 120.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">In order for the Neuenschwanders to have set forth a claim of negligence <em>per se </em>based upon defendants\u2019 alleged violation of R.C. 2151.421, therefore, they would have to fall within the class of individuals that statute was designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">In <em>Brodie v. Summit Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 112, 554 N.E.2d 1301, the Ohio Supreme Court considered R.C. 2151.421 in a slightly different context. The plaintiff in that case was the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of a child who had allegedly been injured as the result of a violation of R.C. 2151.421 by the Summit County Children Services Board. One of the issues considered by the Supreme Court was whether the board was protected from liability by the \u201cpublic duty doctrine.\u201d Pursuant to the \u201cpublic duty doctrine,\u201d an individual cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>recover based upon an agency\u2019s violation of a statute if that statute imposes a duty only \u201cto the public\u201d as opposed to an individual or an identifiable class of individuals. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 554 N.E.2d at 1307. The Supreme Court concluded that a children services board was not protected from liability in an action brought on behalf of a child who suffered injuries as a result of the board\u2019s violation of R.C. 2151.421 because that section imposed a duty owed to that child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">\u201cWhen CSB receives a report that a child is suspected of being abused or neglected, CSB has a duty under the statute to begin an investigation within twenty-four hours. The mandate is to take affirmative action on behalf of a specifically identified individual. This individual is a minor whom the General Assembly has determined to be a proper recipient of the specialized care and protection that only the state through its political subdivisions is able to provide in many instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 554 N.E.2d at 1308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">R.C. 2151.421 imposes a duty owed to a minor child who has allegedly been abused or neglected. It does not impose a duty to that child\u2019s grandparents or to any other member of the public who files a charge with a children services board. The Neuenschwanders\u2019 allegation that the defendants violated R.C. 2151.421, therefore, did not set forth a cause of action upon which relief could be granted to them under the theory of negligence <em>per se. </em>Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The Neuenschwanders\u2019 second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly concluded that they failed to state a claim for a declaratory judgment upon which relief could be granted. Pursuant to R.C. 2721.02, Ohio courts are provided jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d R.C. 2721.03 provides, in part, that persons \u201caffected by\u201d a statute \u201cmay have determined any question of construction or validity arising under such * * * statute * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d In effect, the Neuenschwanders requested a declaratory judgment from the trial court construing R.C. 2151.421 as requiring the defendants to take action in response to their charge that their granddaughter was being abused. In order to be entitled to a declaratory judgment construing R.C. 2151.421, the Neuenschwanders would have had to have been \u201caffected by\u201d that statute. As discussed in regard to their first assignment of error, however, the duty imposed by R.C. 2151.421 is owed to the allegedly abused child, not to that child\u2019s grandparents or any other person who files a charge with the children services board. Accordingly, the Neuen-schwanders did not have standing to seek a declaratory judgment construing R.C. 2151.421 and, accordingly, their request for such a declaratory judgment did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>present a justiciable controversy. The trial court correctly concluded, therefore, that they had failed to set forth a claim for declaratory relief upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiffs\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"amf-dedup-1\">Reece, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
