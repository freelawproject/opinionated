The contract was to continue for one year, when, if the money with interest thereon was not paid, it was to continue in force until payment should be made. After B. had advanced the money, and entered upon the performance of the contract, A. conveyed all its property, including its franchises, to C. in trust to secure the payment of certain bonds issued by it. Default having been made in their payment, C. brought a foreclosure suit, and obtained a decree placing the road in the hands of a receiver and ordering its sale. The receiver having declined to carry out tire contract witlv B., the latter, with the consent of the court, brought its bill in equity for specific performance against him, A., and C. <em>Held, </em>1. That the receiver is the only necessary party defendant. 2. That' the transaction between the companies is not a license, but simply a contract for transportation creating no lien, the specific performance whereof would be a form of satisfaction or payment, which the receiver cannot be required to make.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">Appeal from tbe Circuit- Court of the United States for the Western District of North Carolina.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">This is a bill in equity, filed June 18, 1875, by the Southern Express Company, a corporation of Georgia, against the Western North Carolina Railroad. Company, a corporation of North Carolina, W. A. Smith, and Henry Clews, for the specific performance of a contract entered into Dec. 2, 1865, between the railroad company and the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The bill alleges that the railroad company was organized for the purpose of constructing a railroad from Salisbury, North Carolina, to a point on the Tennessee line; that it completed that portion of its line between Salisbury and Morganton, and put it in running order; that the road-bed, rolling-stock, &amp;c., became dilapidated during the war, and that the company in 1865 was without the means to repair the road and make it safe for the transportation of passengers and freight; that the company, having been unsuccessful elsewhere, applied to the complainant for a loan or advance of 120,000; that the com\"plainant having agreed to loan or advance that sum in consideration of securing the exclusive privilege of transporting freights over said road as far as Morganton, and of certain other advantages, entered, with the advice and consent of the stockholders of the railroad company, into the following contract with that company: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">\u201c This indenture of agreement, made and entered into this second day of December, a. d. eighteen hundred and sixty-five, between the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, as party of the first part, and the Southern Express Company, as party of the second part, witnesseth as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">\u201c Whereas the party of the second part has agreed to loan and advance to the party of the first part the sum of twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars upon the notes of said railroad company, bearing interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, which sum is to be expended in repairs and equipments for said road.

Caldwell and Henry Clews, as joint tenants, and to the survivor of each, \u2014 the former of whom has since deceased, \u2014 all its real and personal property, including its franchises, in trust, to secure a large number of its bonds then about to be issued; that $1,400,000 of said bonds were sold or hypothecated, and came into the hands of persons unknown to the complainant, but for much less than their value and not by a <em>bona fide </em>sale; that, notwithstanding, the alleged creditors of the company instituted foreclosure proceedings in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of North Carolina, and in 1873 obtained a decree ordering the sale of all the property of said company; that the defendant, Smith, having in that suit been appointed receiver of the company, forbade the complainant, in July, 1873, from further using the cars of the company, unless upon conditions wherebjr said contract was virtually surrendered or ignored; that thereupon the complainant was compelled to abandon said railroad, although the money so loaned, with a portion of the interest thereon, is still due and unpaid. It then alleges that the suit is brought with the consent of said court, and with the privilege of making such parties defendant as might be deemed necessary for that purpose; that the trustees in the mortgage to secure the bonds of the railroad company had express notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>of the contract when they accepted the trust, and that it was claimed by the complainant as an existing lien; that the substance of said contract had been published separately at the instance of the stockholders of the railroad company, and was well known to its creditors and to the purchasers of its bonds \u00e1t the time, and especially to the defendant Smith; and that the railroad company having conveyed away its property, and being in part insolvent, the violation of the contract cannot be compensated by any damages which would be recovered at law. The bill therefore prays for a decree compelling the railroad company to specifically perform its contract, and for such other and further relief as the nature and circumstances of the case may require, and for process against the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">The charter of the railroad company granted in February, 1855, is annexed to the bill and made a part thereof. Its twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sections are as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">\u201c Sect. 25. Be it further enacted, that the said company shall have the exclusive right of conveyance, transportation of persons, goods, merchandise, and produce over the said railroad, to be by them constructed, at such charges as may be fixed on by the board of directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">\u201c Sect. 26. Be it further enacted, that said. company may, when they see fit, farm out their right of transportation over.said railroad, subject to the rules above mentioned; and the said company and every one who may have received from it the right of transportation of goods, wares, and merchandise over the said railroad, shall be deemed and taken to be a common carrier, as respects all goods, wares, produce, and merchandise intrusted to them for transportation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">At rule-day in July, 1875, the writ of subpoena was returned executed, and the cause continued until the October Term, when it was ordered that the commissioners in possession of the road in the western district of North Carolina, and Howerton, president of the company, be notified to appear and answer or demur to the bill of complaint at rule-day in January, 1876. The commissioners appeared and demurred. The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed. The express company then brought the case here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Mr. Clarence A.

Caldwell, who executed the contract, was also one of the trustees in the mortgage, and he, therefore, as trustee, knew that he had executed the contract as president. <em>Ex parte </em>Rogers, 8 De G., M. &amp; G. 271; <em>Weetjen </em>v. <em>St. </em>Paul, &amp;c. 4 Hun (N. Y.), 529. Notice to him was, in judgment of law, notice to all the trustees. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Cromp. &amp; M. 280; <em>Willes </em>v. <em>Greenhill, </em>4 De G., F. &amp; J. 147; <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>13 Abb. (N. Y.) Pr. 173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">As between the two companies the contraet was valid. It was lawful for the express company to agree to look for its remuneration to the fund arising from the transportation of its freight over the road of the railroad company; and having made an agreement so to resort to such fund, equity would compel it to perform such agreement, and restrain it from prosecuting a suit at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-8\">The railroad company having authorized the express company to carry its freight, and specifically appropriated the moneys for such transportation when they came to the hands of the express company to the repayment of the loan, thereby constituted a fund in- the hands of the express company, which the railroad company could not impair, divert, or waste. <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>Union Pacific, </em>4 Dill. 78; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>30 Mich. 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">The contract created as between the companies an equitable lien upon the right of transportation, and upon an accruing fund, which equity will enforce as against all parties having notice thereof. <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>11 R.

If.it may mortgage the property <em>per se, </em>no good reason is perceived why it may not, upon the use of the property, create an equitable lien which can be enforced against all subsequent purchasers who had notice of its existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-10\">The contract was a license for the enjoyment of the occupancy of Avay and terminal stations, and of the vehicles of the railway company while in transit. Such license was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>by the express company so far as an advance payment o\u00a3 rent was concerned. The payment is called rent in the contract. Such license could not be revoked by the railroad company, or by those who purchased, or had notice prior to the attachment of their interest- of the existence of such license. <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Brockwell, </em>8 East, 308; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>7 Taunt. 374; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>Say. 103 ; <em>Ameriscoggin Company </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>11 N. H. 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\">The owner in fee of land may, by covenant, impose upon it any burden, not inconsistent with his general right of ownership, which is not in violation of public policy, and does not injuriously affect the rights or the property of others. <em>Van Rensselaer </em>v. <em>Albany, </em>1 Hun (N. Y.), 507. Here the railroad company,'by an instrument under seal, and without-violating public policy, imposed upon its road the burden of occupancy of its stations and vehicles by the- express company for a specific period, at a designated rent paid in advance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\">As long as the owner' of the fee retains the title in himself, his covenants and agreements respecting the use and enjoyment of his estate will be binding on him personally. A purchaser with notice is bound to perform them. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Nightingale, </em>6 Allen (Mass.), 344.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">A court of equity can grant the relief prayed for not only by injunction, but by a decree for specific performance. <em>Mechanics Bank of Alexandria </em>v. <em>Seton, </em>1 Pet. 299; <em>Clark </em>v.

' At the time of suit brought, it was the owner in fee of the right of way, and the sole owner of the rolling-stock, the right to use which was granted by the contract. <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>18 Wall. 471; <em>Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria </em>v. <em>Seton, 1 </em>Pet. 299; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>id. 357.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>Mr. A.

Without this latter fact the bill could not have been filed or maintained.' The suit would have been a contempt of the court which had appointed the receiver, and punishable as such. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Cray, </em>16 Wall, 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The citizenship of the complainant corporation is sufficiently averred. <em>Express Company </em>v. <em>Kountz </em>Brothers, 8 id. 342. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Such a complainant need not prove its existence, unless the fact is directly put in issue by the defendant. <em>The Society for the </em>Propagation, <em>&amp;c. </em>v. <em>The Town of </em>Paulet, 4 Pet. 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">To the objection that the requisite corporate power of the complainant is not shown, there are two answers. The contract of a corporation is presumed to be <em>infra </em>vires, until the contrary is made to appear. 2 Waite, Actions and Defences, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The charter is set out in the record, and forms a part of it. That leaves no room for doubt upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Adequate capacity on the part of the railroad company to make the contract is to be presumed in like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">No party defendant was necessary but the receiver. He was in the possession of the property and effects of the railroad company, subject to the. order of the court, and could have specifically performed the contract, or paid back the money loaned if the court had so directed. The presence of the other parties was immaterial, and the bill might well have been dismissed as to them. <em>Davis </em>v. Gray, <em>supra ; Doggett </em>v. <em>Railroad Company, </em>supra, p. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The contract between the express company and the railroad company was that the latter should give to the former the necessary facilities for the transaction of all its business upon the road, forward without delay by the passenger trains both ways all the express matter that should be offered, do all in its power to promote the convenience of the express company, both at the way and terminal stations, and carry free of charge the messengers in charge of the express matter, and the officers and agents of the express company passing over the road on express business. The consideration for these stipulations was a loan by the express company to the railroad company of 120,000, to be expended in repairs and equipments for the road, the loan to bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, and the payment of fifty cents per hundred pounds for all express matter carried over the road, to be applied in discharge of the loan and interest. The contract was to continue for one year from the first day of January, 1866, and until the principal and interest of the debt should be fully paid. The bill avers that the receiver had refused to carry out the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and that the principal of $20,000 and a part of the interest were unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The enforcement of contracts not relating to realty by a decree for specific performance is not an unusual exercise of equity jurisdiction. Such cases are numerous in .both English and American jurisprudence. They proceed upon the ground that under the circumstances a judgment at law would not meet the demands of justice, that it would be less beneficial than relief in equity, that the damages would not be an accurate satisfaction, that their extent could not be exactly shown, or that the pursuit of the legal remedy would be attended otherwise with doubt and difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Judge Story, after an elaborate examination of the subject, thus lays down the general rule: \u201cThe just conclusion in all such cases would seem to be that courts of equity ought not to decline the jurisdiction for a specific performance of contracts whenever the remedy at law is doubtful in its nature, extent, operation, or adequacy.\u201d 2 Story, Eq. Jur., sect. 728. See also <em>Stuyvesant </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New </em>York, 11 Paige (N. Y.), 414; <em>Barr </em>v. Lapsley, 1 Wheat. 151; <em>Storer </em>v. <em>The Great Western Railway Co., </em>2 You. &amp; Coll. <em>48; Wilson </em>v. <em>Furness Railroad Co., </em>Law Rep. 9 Eq. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">But we need not pursue the subject further, because there is one provision of the contract in this case which is fatal to the relief sought. A court of equity never interferes where the power of revocation exists. Frye, Specif. Perform. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The contract stipulates that after the first year it shall cease upon \u00abthe payment of the $20,000 and interest. This might be made immediately upon the rendition of the decree. The action of the court would thus become a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">There is another objection to the appellant\u2019s case which is no less conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The road is in the hands of the receiver appointed in a suit brought by the bondholders to foreclose their \u25a0 mortgage. The appellant has no lien. The contract neither expressly nor by implication touches that subject. It is not a license as insisted, by counsel. It is simply a contract for the transportation of. persons and property over the road. A specific performance by the receiver would be a form of satisfaction or payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>whicb he cannot be required to make. As well might he be decreed to satisfy the appellant\u2019s demand by money,' as by the service sought to be enforced. Both belong to the lien-holders, and neither can thus be diverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The appellant can, therefore, have no <em>locus standi </em>in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Both these objections appear by its own showing. It was, therefore, competent and proper for the court below, <em>sua </em>sponte, to dismiss the bill for the want of equity upon its face. <em>Brown et al. </em>v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
