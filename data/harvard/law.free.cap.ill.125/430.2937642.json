Where the fact that a party acquired title to land by devise is not disputed, and the only question is whether such devisee conveyed the same, the widow of the grantee is a competent witness to prove that she saw the deed during her husband\u2019s lifetime, when it was acknowledged. In such case, the grantor, seeking to set aside the deed as a, cloud on her title, does not sue as a devisee, and it is not material how she originally acquired title.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-16\" pgmap=\"430\">3.

John J. Glenn, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\" pgmap=\"431(172) 432(178)\">This hill was exhibited by Mary Griffin, against Amelia Griffin, widow, and Rettie Griffin, Oliver Griffin and Sarah Griffin, minors, children and heirs-at-law of George Griffin, deceased. It is alleged in the bill, that complainant is, and has been for more than -twenty years last past, owner of the south-east quarter of the north-east quarter of section 13, township 14, north of range 2, west, in Mercer county; that she has been in the open and notorious possession thereof, and paid all taxes thereon, for more than twenty years before the filing of the bill; that hy some means unknown to the complainant, there is a deed upon the record of deeds in Mercer county, purporting to have been made by complainant to George Griffin, which is a cloud upon the complainant\u2019s title; that she did not intentionally execute such deed; that if she did execute it she did so through mistake; that she never gave or sold the tract to George Griffin, and she has never received any consideration therefor; that George Griffin rented the tract from her for the years 1877, 1878, 1879 and 1880, and paid her rent therefor. It is also further alleged, that the deed purporting to have been made by complainant to George Griffin bears date May 23, 1866, and was recorded upon April 16, 1868, but complainant had no knowledge or notice thereof until March, 1886; that said deed is a fraud upon the rights of the complainant; that George Griffin died intestate before the filing of the bill, leaving the widow and heirs-at-law named as defendants. The prayer is that the deed be cancelled and set aside as a cloud upon complainant\u2019s title. Amelia Griffin answered the bill, putting in issue the material allegations. The other defendants answered by guardian ad litem, also putting in issue the material allegations of the bill. The court, on final hearing, decreed that the bill be dismissed. This appeal is from that decree, and errors are assigned, bringing before the court the questions considered in the opinion of the \u25a0court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-5\" pgmap=\"432\">Mr. I.

This being \u201ca fact,\u201d in the language of the statute, \u201coccurring after the death of such deceased person,\u201d it is competent to prove it by her. (Rev. Stat. 1874, p. 488, secs. 1, 2.) The statement that she saw it before his death, at the time it was acknowledged, in view of the entire evidence in the case, is not very important; but we have no doubt that it also is competent. While it is true that complainant\u2019s title was originally derived under and by virtue of the will of her deceased husband, yet that title is not here disputed. It is conceded she had title, and it is immaterial how it was acquired ; but it is contended by appellees that she subsequently conveyed it to George Griffin, while she denies that she did so, and this presents the only issue. She therefore neither sues nor defends here as conservator, executrix, administratrix, heir, legatee or devisee. (See Pigg v. Carroll, 89 Ill. 205.) The minor defendants, however, defend as heirs of George Griffin, deceased, and as to them rights she is not, in the first instance and of her own motion, a competent witness; but as against her, and on behalf of the defendants, the widow of George Griffin is a competent witness. (See Statute, supra.) And the widow of George Griffin having testified, complainant was a competent witness to testify to the same facts. See Statute, supra, exception 3.</p> <p id=\"b435-5\" pgmap=\"435\">Second\u2014As above stated, complainant was not a competent witness, generally. She was competent to testify in rebuttal as to the same facts testified to by the widow of George Griffin, but she was not offered for that purpose.</p> <p id=\"b435-6\" pgmap=\"435(185) 436(26)\">Third\u2014John Griffin, the husband of the complainant, by his will, devised the property in controversy, and other property, as follows: \u201cI give and bequeath to my wife, Mary Griffin, all my personal property, after my debts are paid, for her own use forever, and the use of all my real estate during her natural life, with the same right to sell the same for her support and maintenance that I would have if living.\u201d This invested complainant with a life estate, and a power of sale of the fee for her maintenance and support. (Funk et al. v. Eggleston et al. 92 Ill. 515.) E complainant\u2019s deed to George Griffin was valid, it executed the power, and left no estate undisposed of. (Christy v. Pulliam, 17 Ill. 59.) But necessarily, if the deed was invalid, the remainder in fee is still in the heirs-at-law of John Griffin, deceased. Henry Griffin was one of the children and heirs-at-law of John Griffin, deceased. He was therefore directly interested in defeating this deed, and so he was incompetent as a witness against the children and heirs-at-law of George Griffin, deceased, who here defend in that capacity. See statute in relation to evidence, supra, and Comer v. Comer et al. 119 Ill. 170.</p> <p id=\"b436-5\" pgmap=\"436\">Fourth\u2014The relation of attorney and client did not exist between complainant and Pepper at the time of the conversation testified to by him. The facts, as he states, are: George Griffin, Mary Griffin, the complainant, and John B. Hoag, brought the deed to the witness, already signed and acknowledged, and asked his opinion what was necessary to convey title to George Griffin. John B. Hoag was the nephew of complainant, but had no interest in the matter. Pepper says he was never attorney for complainant about this land, and that he was called in by George Hoag. Very clearly he was a competent witness. We held in Lynn v. Lyerle, 113 Ill. 129, where two parties go together to an attorney, and make statements to him in the presence of each other, such statements are not confidential communications, intended to be withheld from the opposite party, and there is no error in permitting the attorney to testify thereto in a suit between the parties relating to the subject matter of such communications.</p> <p id=\"b436-6\" pgmap=\"436\">Fifth\u2014Where a deed duly executed is found in the hands of the grantee, there is a strong implication that it has been delivered, and only clear and convincing evidence can overcome the presumption. (Reed et al. v. Douthit et al. 62 Ill. 348; Tunison v. Chamblin et al. 88 id. 378.) There is no evidence in this record that this deed was not delivered, but,' on the contrary, there is, in addition to this legal presumption, affirmative evidence in effect acknowledging that it had been delivered.</p> <p id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436(73) 437(44)\">Sixth\u2014The evidence to impeach a certificate of acknowledgment of a competent officer to a deed of conveyance, must be so full and satisfactory as to convince the mind that the certificate is false or forged. A mere suspicion, or even preponderance of evidence less than sufficient to establish a moral certainty to that effect, is insufficient. Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, 100 Ill. 386; Lickmon v. Harding, 65 id. 505; McPherson v. Sanborn, 88 id. 150; Crane v. Crane, 81 id. 165; Russell v. Theological Union, 73 id. 337; Heacock v. Lubuke, 107 id. 402; Canal and Dock Co. v. Russell, 68 id. 430; Kerr v. Russell, 69 id. 666; Watson v. Watson, 118 id. 56.</p> <p id=\"b437-5\" pgmap=\"437\">The only evidence in this record tending to question the bona fides of this deed, does not tend to prove that it was not executed, or that it was executed by mistake, but rather, if anything, to establish a secret trust. It wants much of being sufficient to warrant a decree in conformity with the prayer of the bill.</p> <p id=\"b437-6\" pgmap=\"437\">The decree is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"Aq5\" pgmap=\"437\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
