The order of the circuit court upon which error is assigned is not final, in the sense that an appeal may be taken from it, or writ of error may be sued out to review it. It is simply an interlocutory order made by the court in the progress of a suit at law, and is in no sense definitive, as that term is used in the law. It is an order made under power thought to be conferred by the statute, upon defendants, to place certain books, in which the business transactions of defendants with plaintiff and other persons are recorded, in the possession of the clerk of the court, that they may be inspected by plaintiff and his attorney, in order that they might prepare for the trial of the cause. It was the privilege of defendants either to obey the order, or stand in defiance of the power of the court. Had the court attempted to enforce obedience to its order by the imposition of a fine in a sum of money, with an order for an execution, or by a definite term of imprisonment, as for contempt of court, the judgment of the court imposing such fine or imprisonment would be final, and from which an appeal might be taken, or to which a writ of error would lie. That would conform exactly with the rule stated by this court in Blake\u2019s case, 80 Ill. 523. On the reviewing of such a judgment of the court that might deprive defendants either of their-property or their liberty, the propriety of the preliminary or interlocutory order could be considered, otherwise not.</p> <p id=\"b308-7\" pgmap=\"308\">The writ of error will be dismissed.</p> <p id=\"b308-8\" pgmap=\"308\">Writ of error dismissed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
