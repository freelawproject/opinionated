HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b748-25\">Charles Allen Garrison was convicted of first-degree murder in Colorado state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>court. He filed an application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, seeking habeas relief on the ground that the introduction at trial of two out-of-court statements violated his right to confront the witnesses against him. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado denied relief and he seeks a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (requiring COA to pursue an appeal). Because Mr. Garrison has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his application for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The relevant out-of-court statements admitted at Mr. Garrison\u2019s trial were made by Brent Pellerin, the victim of the crime. Approximately three weeks before he was murdered, Pellerin took a series of pei\u2019sonal phone calls at his place of employment. These calls visibly upset Pellerin, and his manager, Richard Budnik, asked what was wrong. Pellerin replied that a friend from California was threatening to kill him. This statement was admitted at trial as an excited utterance. Two weeks later Pellerin was again visibly agitated at work and, during a cigarette break, told a concerned Budnik that his friend was \u201ccoming here from California to kill [him].\u201d Aplt.App. at 67. When Budnik suggested that he call the police, Pellerin downplayed the threat, stating that \u201che doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d and that \u201cit is no big deal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. These statements were admitted under Colorado\u2019s residual exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which applies to the states through its incorporation in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>see Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) (incorporating Confrontation Clause). In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Without exhaustively defining \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the <em>Crawford </em>Court noted that testimonial statements typically involve \u201ca solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of ... proving some fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">In <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), the Court addressed the scope of the term \u201ctestimonial\u201d in the context of police interrogations. The Court held that statements are testimonial when made during a police interrogation whose \u201cprimary purpose ... is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Conversely, statements are not testimonial if made during an interrogation whose \u201cprimary purpose ... is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The out-of-court statements made by Pellerin are plainly not testimonial. Pellerin made the statements to explain his mood, not to prove that Mr. Garrison was, in fact, coming from California to kill him. Indeed, Pellerin stated that police involvement was unnecessary because the threats were \u201cno big deal\u201d because the friend did not actually \u201cmean anything.\u201d Aplt.App. at 175; see <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\u201ctestimony\u201d generally seeks to establish \u201csome fact\u201d); <em>see also Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>statements at issue were made informally to a person with no role in the enforcement of criminal laws, and thus bear none of the indicia of \u201ctestimony.\u201d As <em>Crawford </em>observed, \u201cAn accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. In this respect <em>Davis </em>was even more explicit, declaring that \u201cformality is indeed essential to testimonial utterance.\u201d 547 U.S. at 830 n. 5, 126 S.Ct. 2266. In short, because Pellerin\u2019s out-of-court statements were made informally to an acquaintance and did not seek to prove facts relevant to a criminal investigation, they cannot be deemed testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">After similarly concluding that Pellerin\u2019s statements were not testimonial, the district court nonetheless analyzed whether the statements bore sufficient \u201cguarantees of trustworthiness\u201d under the <em>pre-Crawford, </em>Confrontation Clause test set out in <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). The court relied on our opinion in <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>479 F.3d 1229 (10th Cir.2007), which held that although <em>Crawford </em>applies to testimonial statements, nontestimonial statements are still approached \u201cunder the <em>pre-Crawford </em>rubric of <em>Ohio v. Roberts.\u201d Id. </em>at 1247. <em>Ramirez </em>is not good law on this particular point. In <em>Davis </em>the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause applies only to testimonial statements, observing that a \u201climitation so clearly reflected in the text of the constitutional provision must fairly be said to mark out not merely its \u2018core,\u2019 but its perimeter.\u201d 547 U.S. at 824, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Thus, it is clear that the trustworthiness test established in <em>Roberts </em>has been overruled. <em>See Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1183, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Townley, </em>472 F.3d 1267, 1273 (10th Cir.2007) (noting that <em>Crawford </em>\u201cabrogated\u201d Roberts). Accordingly, we do not need to address whether the statements at issue bore sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Because the out-of-court statements admitted in Mr. Garrison\u2019s trial were nontestimonial, he has not made a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d that his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We therefore DENY Mr. Garrison\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
