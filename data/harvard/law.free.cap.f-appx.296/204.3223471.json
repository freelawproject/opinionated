Elstein denying Dai\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ke Chiang Dai, </em>No. A77 272 724 (B.I.A. Nov. 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 272 724 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Jin Yu Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>413 F.3d 188, 191 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, the Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). The Court reviews de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Vumi v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 150,153 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\">In his brief to this Court, Dai does not address the agency\u2019s findings: (1) that he failed to establish eligibility for relief based on his wife\u2019s alleged mistreatment; (2) that he lacked an independent well-founded fear of persecution due to his alleged violation of the family planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>policy; and (3) that he is not eligible for relief under the CAT. Therefore, we deem any such challenges waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Having waived many of the arguments he made below, Dai now alleges only that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on the U.S. government\u2019s \u201crelease of his confidential information to Chinese officials.\u201d He claims that a \u201cnew risk of persecution\u201d arose when the INS conducted its investigation into the authenticity of his supporting documentation, thereby bringing him \u201cto the attention of the Chinese government authority\u201d and establishing \u201chis well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In <em>Zhen Nan Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255 (2d Cir.2006), we held that a new risk of persecution may arise due to the government\u2019s violation of an asylum applicant\u2019s confidentiality under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.6. <em>Zhen Nan Lin, </em>459 F.3d at 268. However, where there has been such a violation, the fact-finder must determine whether the breach of confidentiality gave \u201crise to a new risk of persecution and a new claim for relief based thereon.\u201d <em>Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 96. Here, assuming that the government did violate the confidentiality provision, Dai failed to present any evidence that would establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution due to the exposure of his confidential information to the Chinese government. Thus, we find that the BIA did not err in determining that Dai\u2019s claimed fear of future persecution was \u201cspeculative at best,\u201d given his failure to present any \u201csolid support\u201d in the record for his assertion. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Furthermore, because Dai was unable to establish his eligibility for asylum, he was also unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Dai\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
