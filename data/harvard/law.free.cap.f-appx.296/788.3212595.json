It was brought by the plaintiff more than four years after the decree dissolving his marriage was entered. The defendants are the judge who presided over the case, the lawyer who represented appellant, the lawyer who represented his then wife, another unrelated divorce lawyer, and their law firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">In a thoroughgoing order, record, vol. 3 at tab 73, the district court granted the judge summary judgment on the ground of judicial immunity, and dismissed the claims against the remaining defendants as barred by the statute of limitations. The court also denied plaintiffs motion to alter or amend its judgment. Plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">We agree for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order that plaintiffs claims were due to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-14\">.
