We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review discovery issues for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., </em>314 F.3d 995, 1000 (9th Cir.2002), and summary judgment de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied without prejudice Borquez\u2019s motion to compel disclosure of the addresses of non-party former Arizona Department of Corrections officers Black and Schriber, where the only issues before the court at that time were Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity. <em>See Hallett v. Morgan, </em>296 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir.2002) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of motion to compel where disputed evidence was \u201conly minimally relevant\u201d to plaintiffs case).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Furthermore, Borquez failed to take the district court\u2019s advice to refile his motion to compel discovery after Josie James filed her cross-motion for summary judgment. <em>See Barcamerica Int\u2019l USA Trust v. Tyfield Importers, Inc., </em>289 F.3d 589, 595 n. 6 (9th Cir.2002) (\u2018We have made clear that we generally will not consider on appeal from the grant or denial of summary judgment matters that are not first affirmatively brought to the attention of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The district court did not err when it then granted summary judgment after determining that James responded reasonably to Borquez\u2019s requests. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\u201c[Pjrison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may be found free from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Borquez\u2019s remaining contentions are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">We deny as moot Borquez\u2019s request for copies of court documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate For publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
