The District Court sentenced Vera Ramos to a term of imprisonment of 41 months, a term of supervised release of three years, and a special assessment of $100. Vera Ramos is currently serving his sentence. On appeal, Vera Ramos challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for both substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-21\">The procedural inquiry focuses primarily on the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with its statutory obligations to consider the factors detailed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), while the substantive inquiry assess the length of the sentence imposed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In both respects, our standard of review is abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">To impose a procedurally reasonable sentence, a district court must (1) determine the applicable Guidelines ranges, (2) consider the Guidelines along with the other factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and (3) determine whether to impose a Guidelines sentence or a non-Guidelines sentence, <em>see United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 111-13 (2d Cir.2005); see <em>also United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006). We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">While sentencing judges ordinarily are required to put Guidelines calculations on the record, this Court has not imposed a similar requirement with respect to \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 29. Thus, \u201cin the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise,\u201d a sentencing court is \u201cpresumed\u201d to have \u201cfaithfully discharged [its] duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Vera Ramos claims that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because (1) the District Court did not adequately consider, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (directing courts to consider at sentencing \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d), the sentencing disparity created by the lack of a fast-track program<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this jurisdiction; and (2) the District Court did not adequately consider Vera Ramos\u2019s background and family circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">We have held that fast-track programs do not create unwarranted sentencing disparities within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that \u201ca district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d). Vera Ramos claims that the District Court should have exercised its discretion to depart downward notwithstanding the lack of a fast-track program in this jurisdiction, <em>see United States v. Liriano-Blanco, </em>510 F.3d 168, 172 (2d Cir.2007) (remarking that <em>Mejia </em>\u201cdid not foreclose the possibility that a court has the legal authority to impose, in its discretion, a non-Guidelines sentence\u201d to account for a possible sentencing disparity created by the lack of a fast-track program). Vera Ramos claims that the court\u2019s remark, \u201cI mean that really doesn\u2019t move me,\u201d in response to Vera Ramos\u2019s disparity argument demonstrates a failure to adequately consider the sentencing disparity. We think that this remark indicates that the District court considered the contention and rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">The record demonstrates that the District Court carefully considered Vera Ramos\u2019s personal circumstances, noting his \u201cdifficult upbringing\u201d and \u201cvery substantial family responsibilities.\u201d The court reasoned that such circumstances were almost universal in illegal reentry cases and concluded that a low-end Guidelines sentence rather than a non-Guidelines sentence was justified. The District Court committed no procedural error in its consideration of the statutory factors and of Vera Ramos\u2019s arguments. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Vera Ramos claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable because (1) the court violated the parsimony clause, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (\u201cThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d); (2) court refused to impose a below-Guidelines sentence on the basis of his family circumstances; and (3) his prior conviction served to increase both his base offense level (a threefold increase) and his criminal history. Vera Ramos concedes that this Court\u2019s precedent \u201cforecloses\u201d the latter claim of error, <em>see United States v. Per</em>eira, 465 F.3d 515, 522 (2d Cir.2006), and merely raises the issue on appeal to preserve it for further possible appellate review. Vera Ramos\u2019s claim of error based on the parsimony clause fails in light of <em>Mejia. </em>Finally, as the District Court explained, Vera Ramos chose to start a family in the United States in spite of his illegal status, and the court sentenced Vera Ramos at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range. We see no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Vera Ramos\u2019s sentencing challenges were unpreserved in the District Court. We review an unpreserved challenge to the procedural reasonableness of a sentence for plain error, reversing only if there (1) is an error (2) that is plain, (3) which affected the substantial rights of the defendant, and (4) which seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir.2007). For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the District Court committed no procedural error, much less plain error, in sentencing Vera Ramos. Moreover, the sentence imposed by the District Court was substantively reasonable. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 (\"Upon motion of the Government, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
