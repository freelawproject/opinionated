We will deny the mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-20\">In April 2007, Cobb filed \u00e1 motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in District Court and submitted a complaint alleging discrimination at his prison job based on his disabilities. Cobb claimed violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other federal statutes. In December 2007, a Magistrate Judge granted the motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and ordered that Cobb\u2019s complaint be filed. The Magistrate Judge also terminated two motions for summary judgment that Cobb had filed, noting that neither was a proper summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In June 2008, the Magistrate Judge ordered the United States Marshall to serve Cobb\u2019s complaint on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">In his mandamus petition, Cobb complains that the District Court has not compelled the defendants to answer his complaint. He asks us to grant a default judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">The writ of mandamus has traditionally been used to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ty when it is its duty to do so. <em>In re Patenaude, </em>210 F.3d 135, 140 (3d Cir.2000) (citations omitted). The writ is a drastic remedy that is seldom issued and its use is discouraged. <em>Id. </em>A petitioner must show that he has no other means to attain the desired relief and that the right to a writ is clear and indisputable. <em>Id. </em>at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Applying these standards, Cobb is not entitled to relief. Cobb has not sought any relief in the District Court since the Magistrate Judge ordered the United States Marshal to serve his complaint. Cobb may move the District Court for a default judgment based on the defendants\u2019 failure to answer his complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent the complaint was not served, Cobb may move the District Court to enforce its order directing service of the complaint. Because Cobb has other means to attain the desired relief, mandamus relief is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-15\">. In the first motion, filed in June 2007, Cobb sought a default judgment because the defendants had not answered his complaint. In the second motion, filed in August 2007, Cobb sought a temporary release from prison for medical treatment. The latter motion appears to be related to another action Cobb had filed alleging deliberate indifference to his medical needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-15\">. Cobb's previous motion for a default judgment was premature because his complaint had yet to be filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
