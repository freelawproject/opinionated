In 2007, we affirmed Porter\u2019s convictions, but remanded for re-sentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, the court sentenced Porter to concurrent prison terms of 120 months. He now appeals, contending that these sentences are unreasonable because they are disparate from those imposed on his codefendants, exceeded his criminal responsibility, and did not adequately account for his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-20\">After <em>Booker, </em>the district courts are still bound by statutory minimum penalties. <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1362 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>instruction to district courts to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning a reasonable sentence cannot be read to authorize using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-21\">The district court sentenced Porter to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, 120 months, for Counts 1 and 5 under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because the court could not have imposed sentences of a lesser term for those offenses, his sentences could not be held to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
