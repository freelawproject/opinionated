He also appeals an adverse summary judgment in favor of Kathleen Archer and Marilu Mach\u00edn on Hill\u2019s claims against these defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-19\">A suit against the federal government is barred \u201cunless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of the final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). However, statutes of limitation are generally subject to equitable tolling. <em>Cook v. Deltona Corp., </em>753 F.2d 1552, 1562 (11th Cir.1985). Here, the district court did not clearly err by finding that the final denial of claim letter was mailed on February 7, 2007 and that there was no basis for equitable tolling. Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing Hill\u2019s claims against the United States as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-20\">We also conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Hill\u2019s constitutional claims against Kathleen Archer and Marilu Machin were barred by the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d). <em>See Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 388-90, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 2416-17, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983) (holding that the CSRA precluded an action brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)); <em>Stephens v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Services, </em>901 F.2d 1571, 1576-78 (11th Cir.1990) (noting the CSRA is an adequate remedy and precludes all <em>Bivens </em>actions for personnel ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>tions that allegedly violate the Constitution). Moreover, the district court did not err in granting Archer and Machin\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity because there was no constitutional violation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
