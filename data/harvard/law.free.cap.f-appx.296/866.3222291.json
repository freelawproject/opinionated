She asserts two issues on appeal, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Abioro is the guardian of her granddaughter, who started receiving SSI benefits in 1996. Abioro\u2019s granddaughter was involved in a class action lawsuit against a drug manufacturer, and, after the case settled, she received three checks: (1) $10,000 in January 1999; (2) $6,600 in April 1999; and (3) $1,492.80 in August 2001. Abioro put the funds into three separate accounts, each marked as a \u201ccustodial account,\u201d soon after receiving each check. Before the ALJ, Abioro testified she wanted to make sure that her granddaughter could not access the money until she turned 18 years\u2019 old.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">Abioro asserts the accounts established for her granddaughter were not an available resource and, therefore, she was not overpaid in SSI benefits. She contends the Commissioner erred in analyzing the issue because he did not address the issue of trust creation under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">\u201cOur review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to an inquiry into whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commissioner, and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g)). \u201cSubstantial evidence must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221 (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s decision on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision <em>do novo. Id. </em>(citation omitted). Despite the deferential substantial evidence standard, this Court looks at the record as a whole to determine the reasonableness of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Bridges v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 622, 624 (11th' Cir.1987). The Commissioner\u2019s determination of the proper legal standards is not entitled to a presumption of validity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">The Social Security Act conditions eligibility for disabled individuals to receive SSI benefits on meeting income and resource requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(1)(A) and (B). An individual without a spouse cannot have resources that exceed $2,000, unless those resources are excluded. <em>Id., </em>(a)(1)(B), (a)(3)(B). In turn, the applicable regulation defines \u201cresources\u201d as \u201ccash or other liquid assets or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>any real or personal property that an individual (or spouse, if any) owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1201(a). When the Commissioner finds that more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to an individual, the Commissioner \u201cshall\u201d recover the excess funds from that individual. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">As noted above, certain resources are exempt from being counted towards an individual\u2019s $2,000 maximum. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(3)(B). The SSA Programs Operations Manual System (POMS) states that for trusts established prior to January 1, 2000, \u201c[i]f an individual does not have the legal authority to revoke the trust or direct the use of the trust assets for his/ her own support and maintenance, the trust principal <em>is not </em>the individual\u2019s resource for SSI purposes.\u201d POMS SI 01120.200(D)(2) (emphasis in original). It further notes the revocability of a trust and the ability to use the trust principal \u201cdepends on the terms of the trust agreement and/or on State law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1999, the law was amended to state that for trusts established on or after January 1, 2000, the corpus of any revocable trust is a resource. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382b(e)(3)(A); POMS SI 01120.201(D). For irrevocable trusts, only the portion of the trust from which \u201cpayment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual\u201d is considered a resource. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">According to Georgia statutes, an \u201cexpress trust\u201d is \u201ca trust in which the settlor\u2019s intention to create the trust is expressly stated, and which meets the requirements of Code Section 53-12-20.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-2(2). Section 53-12-20 states that an express trust \u201cshall be created or declared in writing,\u201d and have the following elements, \u201cascertainable with reasonable certainty: (1) An intention by a settlor to create a trust; (2) Trust property; (3) A beneficiary; (4) A trustee; and (5) Active duties imposed on the trustee, which duties may be specified in the writing or implied by law.\u201d The writing may be informal. <em>Id., </em>cmt. 1. In addition, while the trust must be writing, \u201c[n]o formal words are necessary to create an express trust.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-21. Rather, \u201c[a]ll that is required is that a manifest intention must be found that another person shall have the benefit of the property in question.\u201d <em>Odum v. Henry, </em>254 Ga. 739, 334 S.E.2d 304, 305-06 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Alternatively, an \u201cimplied trust\u201d is \u201ca trust in which the settlor\u2019s intention to create the trust is implied from the circumstances, and which meets the requirements of Code Sections 53-12-90 through 53-12-93.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-2(3). \u201cAn implied trust is either a resulting trust or a constructive trust.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-90. A \u201cresulting trust is a trust implied for the benefit of the settlor or the settlor\u2019s successors in interest when it is determined that the settlor did not intend that the holder of the legal title to the trust property also should have the beneficial interest in the property\u201d when: (1) a trust is created but fails, in whole or in part; (2) a trust is fully performed but all trust property is not exhausted; or (3) a purchase money resulting trust is established. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-91. \u201cA constructive trust is a trust implied whenever the circumstances are such that the person holding legal title to the property, either from fraud or otherwise, cannot enjoy the beneficial interest in the property without violating some established principle of equity.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-93(a). The Georgia Court of Appeals has noted that a constructive trust may arise when a person who receives property agrees to hold it for the benefit for another, because the use of the property would be unjust enrichment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>which is a violation of an equitable principle. <em>Dodd v. Scott, </em>250 Ga.App. 82, 550 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2001). Regardless of whether a trust is express or implied, \u201cA settlor shall have no power to modify or revoke a trust in the absence of an express reservation of such power.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 53-12-150 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Neither the ALJ nor the Appeals Council determined whether Abioro manifested intent to create an irrevocable trust under Georgia law. <em>See </em>POMS SI 01120.200(D)(2) (stating revocability of a trust and the ability to use the trust principal \u201cdepends on the terms of the trust agreement and/or on State law\u201d). Because intention is an integral question regarding whether a trust was created under Georgia law, the trier of fact should decide in the first instance, with its firsthand view of credibility, whether Abioro intended to create an irrevocable trust. <em>See Viehman v. Schweiker, </em>679 F.2d 223, 227 (11th Cir. 1982) (citation omitted) (stating \u201c[c]redibility determinations lie solely within the province of the trier of fact\u201d). Thus, we remand to the Commissioner to decide in the first instance whether Abioro intended to create an irrevocable trust under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Abioro next asserts the notices she received related to the overpayment and termination of her granddaughter\u2019s SSI benefits were not legally adequate because (1) the overpayment notice lists the settlement award as income but does not address a specific problem and does not address the termination of SSI benefits; and (2) the notice of termination of SSI benefits did not adequately explain the reason for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">\u201cProcedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of \u2018liberty1 or \u2018property\u2019 interests within the meaning of the Due Process clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 901, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The Supreme Court has recognized that, in appropriate circumstances, a person\u2019s interest in federal entitlements may constitute a protected property interest. These entitlements include social security disability benefits. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 902 (quotation and citation omitted). In addition, the Commissioner is required to ensure that individuals receive notice that \u201cis written in simple and clear language.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(o)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Here, the record shows that the notice Abioro received regarding overpayment included a detailed explanation of the overpayment and instructions regarding how to appeal the decision, written in simple and clear language. In addition, the fact that Abioro did seek review of the decision, and eventually exhausted her administrative remedies, further indicates that she received adequate notice of overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Next, the application Abioro filled out for SSI benefits for her granddaughter plainly told her to report any changes. Such changes would naturally include changes to her granddaughter\u2019s income and resources, which she was required to report in her application. Therefore, the record shows that that Abioro had notice that she needed to report the settlement money.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Finally, the notice Abioro received regarding the termination of her granddaughter\u2019s SSI benefits informed her that her granddaughter\u2019s benefits would be terminated because her income exceeded the threshold amount, rendering her ineligible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Specifically, the notice cited \u201cunearned income of $9,999.99 for January 2000 on,\u201d and it further explained the appeals process and provided a toll-free number to call with any question. Therefore, Abioro was on notice that her granddaughter\u2019s benefits were being terminated because of the settlement funds, and that she could appeal the decision. As a result, Abioro did not receive inadequate notice of the overpayment of SSI benefits, the need to report changes in income and resources, and the termination of SSI benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the Commissioner on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">REMANDED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
