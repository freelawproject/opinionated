For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">By memorandum and order dated June 13, 2007, 2007 WL 1740805, the District Court denied Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Campbell did not file a timely appeal from that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). However, on December 14, 2007, Campbell filed a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen the time for an appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). The District Court, without explanation, denied the motion on January 10, 2008. Campbell took no further action until more than seven months later, when he submitted a petition for a writ of mandamus with this Court on August 18, 2008. Therein he requests the same relief that he sought in his Rule 4(a)(6) motion: that this Court reopen the time for an appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. In support of that request, Campbell claims in his mandamus petition that the District Judge denied his Rule 4(a)(6) motion \u201cbecause of bias and prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in the most extraordinary of circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir. 2005). It is not a substitute for an appeal. <em>See In re Chambers Dev. Co., </em>148 F.3d 214, 226 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201c[M]andamus is not a substitute for appeal and a writ of mandamus will not be granted if relief can be obtained by way of our appellate jurisdiction\u201d). Campbell could have filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order denying his Rule 4(a)(6) motion, <em>see United States v. Rinaldi, </em>447 F.3d 192, 194 (3d Cir.2006), and he provides no explanation in his mandamus petition as to why he was unable to do so. Thus, Campbell has not demonstrated that he is entitled to mandamus relief, and we will deny his petition accordingly. Moreover, to the extent that Campbell is asking this Court to grant him relief under Rule 4(a)(6), we are without authority to do so as that is the province of a district court. <em>See id.; </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
