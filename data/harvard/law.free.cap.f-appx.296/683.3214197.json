He was sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment. His attorney filed a timely notice of appeal, followed by a brief and motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). After reviewing the record, we agree that there are no meritorious issues to raise on appeal. Accordingly, we GRANT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">On July 5, 2007, border patrol agents found Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez, a citizen and national of Mexico, in the United States where he freely admitted that he was illegally present in the country. Subsequent criminal and immigration checks revealed that Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez had previously been deported after three convictions for transporting illegal aliens. He was then charged with and pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) and (2), and \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined the base offense level to be 8. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSR recommended a sixteen-level enhancement because Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez had previously been deported after a conviction for an alien smuggling offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), the PSR recommended a total offense level of twenty-one. Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history category was II, which produced an advisory Guidelines range of forty-one to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced him to forty-one months.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">The district court found that Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s guilty plea was made freely, voluntarily, and intelligently. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Valenzuela-Ramirez never sought to withdraw his plea below, and there is no indication he wishes to challenge his plea on appeal. Nonetheless, we have reviewed the record, and we independently find no nonfrivolous basis for Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez to challenge his plea. Thus, we turn to whether Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Kristl, </em>487 F.3d 1050,1053 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">During sentencing, Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez objected to the sixteen-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii), which applies when the defendant has previously been deported after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... (vii) an alien smuggling offense.\u201d The commentary to the Guidelines states that an \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d includes all offenses listed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(i). That statute, in turn, includes offenses under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2) within its definition. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez pleaded guilty in 1999 to three counts of alien smuggling in violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii). Moreover, Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez admitted to the elements of a \u00a7 1324(a) smuggling offense at the sentencing hearing in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly enhanced Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s offense level by sixteen. The district court also properly determined the base offense level to be 8, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(a), properly subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), and properly calculated his criminal history category. Thus, because the district court correctly determined the applicable Guidelines range and sentenced Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez within that range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Haley, </em>529 F.3d 1308, 1311 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez may rebut this presumption by showing that the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) justify a lower sentence. <em>See id. </em>Our review of the record demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vary downward. See <em>id. </em>(noting that \u201cwe generally defer to [a district court\u2019s] decision to grant, or not grant, a variance based upon its balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d and review that decision for abuse of discretion). Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted a full examination of the record before us. The record establishes no non-frivolous basis for challenging either Mr. Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s guilty plea or his sentence. Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
