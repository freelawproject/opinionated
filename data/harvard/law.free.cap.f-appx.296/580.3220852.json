INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner was ineligible for caneellation of removal. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted as to petitioner Ana Laura Martinez-Gallegos (A96-353-037) because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">With regard to petitioner Laura Elena Gallegos-Calderon (A096-353-036), we conclude that she has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review. See Martinez-Rosas <em>v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137,1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, in part, DISMISSED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-12\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
