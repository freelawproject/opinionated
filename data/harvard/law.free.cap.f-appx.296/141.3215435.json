Jan. 14, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-24\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision insofar as it declined to exercise its discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>power to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings. <em>Zhao Quan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 153,155 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Here, the BIA did not err in denying as untimely what it construed as Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The BIA\u2019s regulations require an alien seeking to reopen proceedings to file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Zheng\u2019s July 2007 motion was untimely where he was ordered deported in September 1996. <em>See id. </em>However, there is no time limit for filing a motion to reopen \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Here, the BIA properly found that Zheng\u2019s motion did not qualify for such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It is well-settled that a change in personal circumstances, such as Zheng\u2019s newly commenced practice of Falun Gong, does not excuse the time limit for filing a motion to reopen. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, the BIA correctly found that Zheng\u2019s evidence did not demonstrate changed country conditions in China related to his Falun Gong claim. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, contrary to Zheng\u2019s argument, he was not eligible to file a successive asylum application independent of the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
