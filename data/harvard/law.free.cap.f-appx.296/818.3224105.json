Bogdan argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>district court should not have enhanced his sentence for targeting vulnerable victims, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) (Nov.1998); involving a large number of vulnerable victims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.1(b)(2); and abusing a position of trust, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 3B1.3. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Aap\">We review <em>de novo </em>the application of the vulnerable-victim and abuse-of-position-of-trust enhancements to a sentence. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1317 (11th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Ward, </em>222 F.3d 909, 911 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe district court\u2019s determination of a victim\u2019s \u2018vulnerability\u2019 is, however, essentially a factual finding to which we give due deference.\u201d <em>Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d at 1317 (quoting <em>United States v. Arguedas, </em>86 F.3d 1054, 1057 (11th Cir.1996)). \u201c\u2018We review the district court\u2019s fact findings\u2019 \u201d regarding an abuse of trust \u201c \u2018for clear error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward, </em>222 F.3d at 911 (quoting <em>United States v. Mills, </em>138 F.3d 928, 941 (11th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"AK2\">Bogdan argues that the enhancement for a vulnerable victim of section 3Al.l(b) requires that the jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether a defendant knew or should have known that his vietims were vulnerable, but we disagree, The only reference to a jury finding pertains to a victim of a hate crime, U.S.S.G. <em>es </em>3A1.1 cmt. n. 1, but Bogdan was not convicted of a hate crime. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c\u2018Wlrere Congress in-eludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The district court was required to make the findings about Bogdan\u2019s enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">The district court did not err by applying the vulnerable-victim enhancements to Bogdan\u2019s sentence. The evidence established that Bogdan marketed his investments to a large number of senior citizens. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), (b)(2). He enticed retirees, in person and in advertisements and articles submitted to a free local newsPaPer&gt; to invest their income by touting a to 14 percent return on secured investments- Bogdan\u2019s investors were predominantly 70 years old or older&gt; possessed a minimal level of financial sophistication, and reded on income maintain their standard of living. <em>See United States v. Rudisill </em>187 F.3d 1260, 1268-69 (11th Cir. 19\")- The investigation revealed that Bogdan also targeted repeatedly the same investors. <em>See United States v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293,1296 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"ARq\">The district court also did not err by finding that Bogdan abused a position of trust. Bogdan exploited a fiduciary relationship with his clients by misrepresenting that he had invested their money in exchange for either a secured mortgage or a promissory note. Bodgen instead diverted those funds to make unsecured loans and interest payments to investors, pay agents\u2019 commissions and operating costs, and satisfy personal obligations. <em>Cf. United States v. Yount, </em>960 F.2d 955, 957-58 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"Abk\">n Bogdan s sentence is AFFIRMED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
