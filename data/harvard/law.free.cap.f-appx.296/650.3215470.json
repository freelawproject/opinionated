LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFs\">Following his September 2000 guilty plea to one count of distribution of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the district court sentenced Johnny D. Martin to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Martin filed a motion to reduce his sentence and a motion to modify his sentence. Martin argued that amendments promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission (\u201cSentencing Commission\u201d) relative to the crack cocaine drug quantity table authorized a reduction of his sentence. The district court denied the motions, and Martin appeals. For substantially the same reasons as the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">On July 24, 2000, Martin was charged by information with one count of distribution of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Martin entered a guilty plea on August 7, 2000, and appeared for sentencing on September 11, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">Because Martin distributed approximately 24.35 grams of cocaine base, his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 28 under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) (2000). With a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Martin\u2019s adjusted offense level was calculated as 25. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">Under Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1, however, Martin qualified as a career offender because he was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, the instant offense was a controlled substance offense, and he had at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. Accordingly, because Martin faced a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), his offense level was recalculated at 32, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Martin\u2019s final offense level was reduced to 29. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3E1.1, 4Bl.l(b). Combined with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>criminal history category of VI, <em>see </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b), his resulting Guidelines range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Martin to the bottom end of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, substantially revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 201.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). \u201cThe effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008). Relatedly, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 713, which made Amendment 706 retroactive in certain cases. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In December 2007 and March 2008, Martin filed two motions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a reduction or modification of his 151-month sentence. Martin contended that Amendment 706 reduced his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 from 28 to 26, and that his sentence should be reduced accordingly. In May 2008, the district court denied Martin\u2019s motions, concluding that Amendment 706 was inapplicable to Martin\u2019s case because Martin had been sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court therefore ruled that it lacked authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce or modify the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentencing range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Commission. Nonetheless, a district court is not authorized to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if an amendment to the Guidelines does <em>not </em>lower the defendant\u2019s sentencing range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (Supp. May 1, 2008) (\u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the Amendment] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Martin is correct that Amendment 706 reduces by two levels the base offense level associated with crack cocaine offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). But the Amendment applies only to sentences calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), which sets offense levels based on the quantity of cocaine base distributed. The Amendment simply does not apply to Martin\u2019s sentence because Martin was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. As a career offender facing a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, Martin\u2019s offense level was set at 32 without regard to the amount of crack cocaine he distributed. \u00a7 4B1.1. Amendment 706 \u2014 which only affects sentencing ranges determined by the amount of crack cocaine attributable to a defendant \u2014 plainly has no effect upon a sentencing range determined by a defendant\u2019s status as a career offender. Even Martin admits that his sentence was determined by his career offender status. Accordingly, because Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [Martin\u2019s] applicable guideline range,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B), the district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce or modify Martin\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238-39 (10th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-13\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed.

Martin does not cite Amendment 713, but instead cites Amendments 706 and 711. Amendment 711 modifies Amendment 706, but does not address the issue of retroactivity. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 711 (2007). Amendment 713 provides that Amendments 706 and 711 may be applied retroactively in certain circumstances. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008). Because Martin filed his appeal pro se, and because the district court considered the retroactivity issue, we liberally construe Martin's argument that Amendment 706 authorizes the district court to reduce his sentence as an argument that Amendment 713 creates such authority. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">. Martin's brief repeatedly refers to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), for the proposition that the Guidelines are advisory. Martin seems to argue that the Guidelines\u2019 advisory status by itself permits a reduction of his sentence. There can be no doubt, however, that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is <em>not </em>advisory and that it only authorizes a sentence reduction when the <em>Guidelines </em>have been amended to allow a lower sentencing range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
