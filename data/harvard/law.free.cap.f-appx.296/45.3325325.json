For the reasons set forth below, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">Ms. Addams-More filed a complaint against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims (\u201ctrial court\u201d) alleging that defendant breached its \u201cfiduciary duties of the trustee obligation\u201d with regard to the disbursement of Social Security funds. In response to defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear her claims, Ms. Addams-More stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-18\">\u201cWhether U.S. Court of Claims has jurisdiction via [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1491 money damages, over $10,000; trust common law jurisdictional standing of U.S. as [Social Security Act] Trustee, under federal statutes, regulations permitting a certain sum, and whether said agencies function as instrumentality of the federal government-regulatory taking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-19\"><em>Addams-More v. United States, </em>81 Fed.Cl. 312, 314 (Ct.Cl.2008) (alterations in original) (quoting Pl.\u2019s Resp.). The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Ms. Addams-More\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it could not adjudicate claims arising under the Social Security Act. <em>Id. </em>at 315. The trial court also held that it is not \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to transfer the complaint to another jurisdiction because it was unable to discern the exact nature of plaintiff\u2019s claims contained in her complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>On appeal, Ms. Addams-More argues that the U.S. is a trustee of the Social Security assets and that the systemic mismanagement and waste of the trust assets by the U.S. constitutes a breach of its fiduciary duty owed to Appellant under the Social Security Act. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5-6. Ms. Addams-More further argues that her negative prognosis, a vitamin deficiency,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> constitutes a Fifth Amendment taking of her productivity by the Social Security Administration, and she asserts she made a claim for reimbursement of $12,000 which was never adjudicated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 4, 8-9, 12. Overall, Ms. Addams-More seeks adjudication of her claim for Social Security benefits and adjudication of the withholding of alleged overpayments of those benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">This court reviews de novo the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Ms. Addams-More\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Samish Indian Nation v. United States, </em>419 F.3d 1355, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2005). In conducting its review, this court assumes that the facts pled by Ms. Addams-More are true. <em>See id. </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The Court of Federal Claims is a court of limited jurisdiction. The Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over \u201cany claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). This court has explained that \u201cbecause the Tucker Act itself does not create a substantive cause of action, \u2018in order to come within the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc). Therefore, the ability of the Court of Federal Claims to hear Ms. Addams-More\u2019s case depends on whether she asserts a substantive claim to money damages as defined in the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Ms. Addams-More does not assert any substantive claims upon which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction. First, the Court of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction to review the alleged systemic mismanagement and waste of trust assets by the Social Security Administration. Indeed, the Court of Federal Claims \u201clacks the general federal question jurisdiction of the district courts, which would allow it to review [an] agency\u2019s actions and to grant relief pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d <em>Crocker v. United States, </em>125 F.3d 1475, 1476 (Fed.Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">The Court of Federal Claims similarly lacks jurisdiction over Ms. Addams-More\u2019s Fifth Amendment regulatory tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ing claim because Appellant is alleging a violation of her constitutional rights due to a denial of social security benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Marcus v. United States, </em>909 F.2d 1470, 1471 (Fed.Cir.1990) (\u201c[W]e hold that the Claims Court has no jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (1988), over claims to social security benefits, even considering appellant\u2019s assertions that he is entitled to relief under the Constitution.\u201d); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 756-767, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and (h) (1982) require that action for social security benefits must be brought in district court). Accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction to hear Ms. Addams-More\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A1E\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Court of Federal Claims. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-13\">. Although Ms. Addams-More did not request a transfer of her case to another jurisdiction, the Court of Federal Claims determined whether such transfer was \"in the interest of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. In her response to Defendant's motion to dismiss, Ms. Addams-More alleges that her \u201cvitamin deficiency symptoms were misdetermined [sic]; engendering a negative profile that limited her income.\u201d <em>Addams-More v. United States, </em>81 Fed.Cl. 312, 314 (Ct.Cl. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-8\">. Ms. Addams-More also argues that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. However, these are procedural statutes; thus they do not give the Appellant a substantive cause of action upon which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction. <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">. Appellee argues that Ms. Addams-More\u2019s Fifth Amendment regulatory taking claim is not properly before this Court because Appellant allegedly raised the claim in response to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and did not amend her complaint to incorporate this alternative theory. It is unclear from the record when Ms. Addams-More raised this argument and therefore this Court assumes the issue was properly raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
