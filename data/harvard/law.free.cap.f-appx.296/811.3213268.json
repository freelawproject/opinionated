On appeal, Green argues that: (1) sufficient evidence did not support his convictions; (2) the district court erred in admitting expert testimony regarding the gross weight of the drugs and packaging seized by the police; (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the government needed to prove that he willfully violated the law in regard to his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base; (4) the district court plainly erred in sentencing him as a career offender; and (5) the district court\u2019s judgment contains a clerical error regarding his sentence on count one, necessitating a limited remand to correct the error. After thorough review, we affirm in part, vacate in part as to the clerical error in Green\u2019s sentence, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"AgS\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and accepting all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict. <em>United States v. Klopf, </em>423 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir.2005). If a reasonable trier of fact could find that evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction even if evidence might also support a defendant\u2019s theory of innocence. <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088,1122 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"AKI\">\u201cWe review cases dealing with discovery violations under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16 using an <em>abuse </em>of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Hastamorir, </em>881 F.2d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1989). A Rule 16 violation \u201cis reversible error only when it violates a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d 993, 998 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cSubstantial prejudice exists when a defendant is unduly surprised and lacks an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense, or if the mistake substantially influences the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 998-99. We also review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction tor abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1314-15 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201cWe will find reversible error only if (1) the requested instruction correctly stated the law; (2) the actual charge to the jury did not substantially cover the proposed instruction; and (3) the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">\u201cA sentencing issue not raised in the district court is reviewed for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>166 F.3d 1360) 1361 (llth Cir.1999). Under the plain error standard, we will correct an error only if there is; (1) error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>469 F.3d 963, 966 (11th Cir.2006). An error is plain or obvious only if it is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). An error is not clear under current law if no binding decisions from this Court or the Supreme Court in materially similar cases resolve the issue, and other circuits are SP^ on issue- <em>Id-</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUm\">First, we find no merit to Green\u2019s contention that sufficient evidence did not support his convictions. Possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is proven by evidence showing a defendant\u2019s (1) knowing or intentional (2) possession of a controlled substance (3) with intent to distribute that substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). \u201cIntent to distribute can be proven circumstantially from, among other things, the quantity of cocaine and the existence of implements such as scales commonly used in connection with the distribution of cocaine.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389,1392 (11th Cir.1989). Other relevant circumstances include the defendant\u2019s possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>of a firearm, a large amount of cash, or an implement, like a razor blade, used to cut up drugs. <em>United States v. Marszalkowski, </em>669 F.2d 655, 662 (11th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>183 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.1999). In addition, a defendant\u2019s denial of guilt in his trial testimony, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as <em>substantive evidence </em>of the defendant s guilt. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995) (emphasis in original). In such a case, where some corroborative evidence exists for the charged offense, the defendant s testimony may establish the elements of the offense, <em>Id. </em>at 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">Here, sufficient evidence supported Green\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. As an initial matter, Green does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to his knowing possession of crack cocaine, Direct and circumstantial evidence proved the remaining element of the offense\u2014 intent to distribute \u2014 by showing that Green spontaneously admitted to a federal agent that he was a drug dealer, he made multiple statements regarding the quantity of the crack cocaine seized, police seized from his pocket numerous baggies filled with individual crack cocaine rocks, a gun was found in his vehicle, and the jury was entitled to reject his testimony that he was not a drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">We likewise conclude that sufficient evidence supported his remaining convictions. A 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction requires evidence to show that: (1) the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm; (2) the defendant was previously convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year; and (3) the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce. <em>Palma, </em>511 F.3d at 1315. A 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction requires evidence to show that the defendant: \u201c(1) knowingly (2) possessed a firearm (3) in furtherance of any drug trafficking crime for which he could be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1362 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AsB\">first element under both \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(c) \u2014 knowing possessjon of a firearm may be proved by evidence of either actual or constructive possession. <em>See United States v. Pedro, </em>999 F.2d 497, 500 (11th Cir.1993). A defendant has construction possession if he has \u201cownership, dominion, or control\u201d over the firearm itself, or the vehicle in which the firearm is located. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). In <em>Wright, </em>we found sufficient evidence to support knowing possession where: (1) police found the firearm in the defendant\u2019s vehicle; (2) the firearm was located under the seat in which the defendant was sitting; (3) the defendant resisted arrest; and (4) the defondant made a vague threat to the police during his arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"A5o\">For purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(c), a firearm includes \u201cany weapon ... which win 0r is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)(A). We have held that a firearm met the statutory definition where the evidence included: (1) the actual firearm; an&lt;^ \u00ae a witness testified that the firearm was a Winchester blue 12 gauge shotgun, <em>United States v. Adams, </em>137 F.3d 1298, 1300 n. 2 (11th Cir.1998). The government need not to prove that the firearm is opera^fo- ^ 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"ATf\">The \u201cin furtherance\u201d element of a \u00a7 924(c) offense requires proof of a nexus between the firearm and the drug trafficking offense. <em>United States v. Molina, </em>443 F.3d 824, 829 (11th Cir.2006). Factors relevant to the nexus between the firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and a drug crime include: (1) the accessibility of the firearm to the defendant; (2) the proximity of the firearm to the drugs or drug profits; (3) the status of the possession (legal or illegal); and (4) the circumstances under which the gun was found. <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2002). A jury may infer that the purpose of a firearm located near drugs was to provide defense or deterrence in furtherance of a defendant\u2019s drug trafficking activity. <em>United States v. Miranda,, </em>425 F.3d 953, 962 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"A-s\">The evidence here demonstrated each of the elements Green now contests. As for his knowing possession of the gun found in his vehicle under both \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 924, there was evidence that Green purchased the vehicle in which the gun was found over a week before his arrest, he was driving the vehicle before the gun was found, and the gun was found under the driver\u2019s seat, which was readily accessible to him. At a minimum, this evidence showed that Green constructively possessed the firearm because he had dominion and control over the vehicle in which it was found. Moreover, Green testified that he was unaware of the gun and that the police placed it in his vehicle, and the jury was entitled to believe the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">The evidence further demonstrated that the gun met the statutory definition of a firearm found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3). The gun was admitted into evidence, an expert testified that it was a Smith &amp; Wesson pistol designed to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, and it did not appear to be counterfeit. The jury was free to credit this testimony and find that the gun was a firearm under the statute, despite Green\u2019s theory that the gun may have been counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"AbC\">The evidence also established that, under \u00a7 924(c), Green possessed the firearm \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a drug trafficking crime: (1) the gun was found in his vehicle, under the driver\u2019s seat; (2) he was driving the vehicle; (3) he was carrying a bag of individually packaged crack cocaine rocks on him; and (4) he admitted to dealing drugs and said it was a dangerous profession. And, as discussed above, evidence proved that Green committed a drug trafficking crime for the purposes of his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Because he does not challenge any remaining elements of the firearm offenses, sufficient evidence supported these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"A0G\">Second, we are unpersuaded by Green\u2019s claim that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony regarding the gross weight of the drugs and paekaging seized by the police. Rule 16 provides that the government must disclose to the defendant, upon request, a written summary of any expected expert testimony, Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G). But even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the government\u2019s mid-trial disclosure of the expert report violated Rule 16, the record does not indicate that Green was substantially prejudiced,</p>\n<p id=\"APG\">According to the record, Green s only problem with the expert testimony was that it countered one of his lines of cross examination and supported a federal agent&gt;s testimony. At trial the jury heard testimony regarding three different estimate8 of the weight of the drugs seized from Green; (1) 21 gramS; which was Green&gt;s own estimate 0f the weight, ac-cording to Agent Rathelj Qr not going to be 28,\u201d according to Detective Bello; (2) 9 7 gramS; which was the net weight of a sample of the drugs&gt; according to the ex-perfc. and (3) ^ which was the gross weight of the drugs and baggieSj according to the expert. The expert testimony simply dispelled any confusion between the 9.7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>grams and 21 grams\u2014which were based on different measurements\u2014by explaining how the expert arrived at the 9.7 gram figure, without any regard to her testimony regarding the gross weight of the drugs and baggies, the 27.8 gram figure. Because defense counsel was on notice that an expert would testify regarding the 9.7 gram figure and how she came up with that figure, the additional testimony regarding the corrected 27.8 gram figure did not prejudice Green by impairing his counsel\u2019s ability to formulate a defense strategy. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting the disputed expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Third, we reject Green\u2019s contention that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the government needed to prove that he \u201cwillfully\u201d violated the law to establish possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. As we note above, the elements of a \u00a7 841(a)(1) offense are (1) knowing or intentional (2) possession of a controlled substance (3) with intent to distribute that substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Based on this statutory language, we have long required the government to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that [a defendant] knowingly possessed [a controlled substance], either actually or constructively, and that he intended to distribute it,\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Cruz-Valdez, 773 F.2d 1541, 1544 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>United States v. Littrell, </em>574 F.2d 828, 835 (5th Cir. 1978))\u2014without imposing <em>any </em>\u201cwillfulness\u201d element into the statute. This makes sense, because the statutory language makes no reference to willfulness, nor to an intent to violate the law, as a <em>mens rea </em>requirement. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201cit shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to ... possess with intent to ... distribute ... a controlled substance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Accordingly, under the plain language of \u00a7 841(a)(1), a defendant must knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Green does not identify any binding case law holding that willfulness\u2014defined as a specific intent to disobey the law\u2014is an element of a \u00a7 841(a)(1) crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with the statutory language and case law, the district court rejected Green\u2019s proposed instruction and instead instructed the jury that a conviction on count two required proof that Green \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d possessed with intent to distribute cocaine base. It then correctly defined a knowing and intentional act as one that was committed voluntarily and purposefully, and not by mistake or accident. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Fourth, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Green as a career offender. A defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>qualifies as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, if: (1) he was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the instant offense; (2) the instant offense is a felony that is either a crime or violence or a drug offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a drug offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any federal or state offense punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao7\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abi\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AixW\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). To determine whether a crime is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we use a categorical approach, \u201cconsidering] the offense as defined by the law, rather than considering the facts of the specific violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 1350 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AuF\">Because we have observed that the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d from \u00a7 4B1.2 is nearly the same as the ACCA\u2019s defin\u00edtion of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1350 n. 1, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, \u2014 </em>U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), interpreting the \u201cviolent felony\u201d provision, is instructive in the career offender context. In <em>Begay, </em>the Court determined that violent felonies included crimes that \u201cpresent[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury,\u201d only to the extent that such crimes were \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\u201d to the enumerated crimes \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and use of explosives, <em>Id. </em>at 1585. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he listed crimes all typically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1586. The Court then applied that standard to felony driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) and held that that crime did not qualify as a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1587. It observed that statutes forbidding driving under the influence \u201ctypically do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive eon-duct,\u201d and rather, are comparable to strict liability crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 1586. The Court recognized that although a person might drink on purpose, the crime of felony DUI did not require purposeful or deliberate conduct, and instead, could involve mere negligence or recklessness. <em>Id. </em>at 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ7h\">Green was convicted of throwing a deadly missile, in violation of a Florida law creating a felony if a person \u201cwantonly or maliciously ... throws any missile or hurls or projects a stone or other hard substance which would produce death or great bodily harm \u201d at a building, vehicle, train, boat, or aireraft, occupied or unoccupied. Fla. \u00a7 790.19. The intent element is de^ued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agg\">\u2018Wantonly\u2019 means consciously and intentionally, with reckless indifference to consequences and with the knowledge that damaSe is to be done to some person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABq\">\u2018Maliciously\u2019 means wrongfully, intentionally&gt; without leSal Justification or excuse, and with the knowledge that injury or damaSe ^ or be caused to another Person or the ProPerty of another Person-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqn\"><em>State v. Kettell, </em>980 So.2d 1061, 1067 (Fla. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"ALY\">Based on these definitions, the Florida crime of throwing a deadly missile plainly passes the threshold test of the second definition of a crime of violence, under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), because it requires that the offender\u2019s conduct present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, Moreover, the crime arguably qualifies as a crime of violence because it is roughly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>similar to the crimes listed in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) in that it involves purposeful and deliberate conduct aimed at property where persons might be located and thereby injured. Although Florida law references reckless indifference as part of its definition of \u201cwantonness,\u201d it also appears to require an intentional act done with knowledge of the risk of harm it could cause to another as part of its definitions of wantonness and maliciousness. This contrasts with the crime of felony DUI, which typically requires a only reckless action, and <em>Begay </em>therefore does not resolve the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Green does not identify any binding case law from this Court, or a settled line of cases from other circuits, addressing whether the crime of throwing a deadly missile is a crime of violence. We therefore conclude that because the issue is unresolved, the district court\u2019s finding that Green\u2019s prior crime was a crime of violence was not, and could not have been, plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Last but not least, we do agree with the parties that the district court\u2019s judgment contains a clerical error regarding Green\u2019s sentence on count one. \u201c[Wjhen the orally-imposed sentence differs from the written order of judgment, the oral sentence controls.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>289 F.3d 1260, 1264 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). If the district court\u2019s judgment contains a clerical error, we will vacate and remand with instructions that the district court correct the error. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The parties agree and the record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s judgment improperly said that Green\u2019s sentence for count one was 160 months\u2019 imprisonment, whereas the district court orally imposed a 120-month sentence, on count one. Accordingly, we affirm Green\u2019s convictions and sentence, but vacate and remand for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in the judgment regarding the length of his sentence on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-5\">. Indeed, our prior precedent has long held that a \u00a7 841(a)(1) conviction requires evidence that a defendant \"knowingly\u201d or \"intentionally\u201d possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute, merely tracking the language of the statute. In <em>Cruz-Valdez, </em>our <em>en banc </em>court held that the government must prove that a defendant \u201cknowingly possessed\" a controlled substance. 773 F.2d at 1544; <em>accord United States v. Alvarez, </em>837 F.2d 1024, 1027 (11th Cir. 1988). Similarly, in <em>Cauchon v. United States, </em>824 F.2d 908, 912 (11th Cir.1987), we held that \"there must have been sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that appellant (1) knowingly <em>or </em>intentionally (2) manufactured MDA.\u201d (emphasis in original). To the extent that <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>289 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 2002), is read to say that willfulness is a required element of \u00a7 841(a)(1)\u2014and it is not at all clear to us that <em>Anderson </em>holds that willfulness is a required element\u2014we are bound by earlier case precedent. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2004) (\"where there is conflicting prior panel precedent, we follow the first in time\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
