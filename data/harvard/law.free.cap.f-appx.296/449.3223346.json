(\u201cPeno Trucking\u201d) appeals both the Tax Court\u2019s classification of its truckers as employees and the Tax Court\u2019s determination that Peno Trucking was not entitled to relief from tax liability under \u00a7 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">Peno Trucking was incorporated in the State of Ohio on December 23, 1993. Its principal place of business was in Warren, Ohio. Throughout the period in question, Peno Tracking was incorporated as a Sub-chapter S Corporation under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7\u00a7 1361 <em>et seq. </em>From 1997 through 1999, Robert Peno, Sr. and his wife, Joann Peno, together owned 100% of the stock of Peno Trucking; Robert and Joann Peno were also the officers of the corporation, with Joann Peno as the President and Robert Peno, Sr. as the Vice President.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">In its Memorandum Findings of Fact and Opinion, the Tax Court summarized the stipulated facts regarding Peno Tracking\u2019s business operations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-19\">During the periods at issue, petitioner owned approximately 15 tractor-trailers (trucks), which it leased to the Ohio Transport Corp. (Ohio Transport) pursuant to written lease agreements (leases). The leases required petitioner to transport freight and perform related services for Ohio Transport within a reasonable time in a safe, competent, lawful, and workmanlike manner, inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Ohio Transport daily as to the vehicles\u2019 locations and the shipments being transported, and pay all costs of operating the leased trucks and related equipment. Under the leases, petitioner was required to provide drivers to operate its trucks and be responsible for all work performed by the drivers and to confirm their work was performed in accordance with the leases. Consequently, petitioner was required to direct, supervise, pay, discipline, and discharge its drivers. Petitioner was also responsible for determining the days and hours per day the drivers worked, the routes traveled, and the order of picking up and delivery of shipments and ensuring that the drivers had the appropriate commercial drivers\u2019 licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">The leases also required petitioner to submit completed drivers\u2019 logs to Ohio Transport and to \u201ccooperate in the preparation, carrying and preservation of manifestos, bills of lading, way bills, freight bills, and other papers and records respecting the lading and the use of equipment, all in accordance with applicable laws and regulations\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">As compensation, petitioner received 75 percent of the total amount paid to Ohio Transport by its customers for each load hauled by a leased truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">These loads were hauled by petitioner\u2019s trucks or by individuals who owned their own trucks (owner-operators). A number of owner-operators hauled steel for Ohio Transport and were dispatched by petitioner. The owner-operators\u2019 employment relationship with petitioner is not at issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">The leases required Ohio Transport to provide liability insurance for petitioner\u2019s trucks while they were \u201cunder dispatch\u201d. Otherwise petitioner provided the insurance. If a driver intentionally damaged a truck or its cargo, he or she was responsible for the damage, to the extent it was not insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Peno Trucking entered into an agreement with each of its drivers during the dates in question which explicitly provided that the drivers were independent contractors and not employees. The agreement stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">Peno Trucking Inc. and Operator agree and understand that Operator is not an employee or agent of Peno Trucking Inc. Operator is an independent contractor and Peno Trucking Inc. shall not direct in any manner the means or method by which Operator shall perform his occupation. Operator understands that Peno Trucking Inc. from time to time contracts with other persons or corporations, to transport goods via Peno Trucking Inc. trucks and equipment. While not an employee of such other persons or corporations, Operator shall, at all times applicable hereto, work at the direction and control of such persons or corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">Peno Trucking Inc. agrees to pay Operator at the percentage of_ per total gross pay per load. Additionally, Peno Trucking Inc. shall be responsible for all maintenance of Peno Trucking Inc. equipment, all fuel, oil, tolls, permits, and road fuel taxes incurred by Operator on such dispatched trips in Peno Trucking Inc. equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">Operator agrees and understands that he is solely responsible for payment of all income and withholding taxes, Social Security and unemployment compensation. In accordance with the terms of this agreement, Peno Trucking Inc. will supply Operator with an IRS Form 1099 at the end of each calendar year. Operator understands and agrees that he cannot obligate, contract or incur any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>indebtedness on behalf of Peno Trucking Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Tax Court further explained the details of the relationship between Peno Trucking and the drivers as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6F\">Petitioner\u2019s drivers were not obligated to accept petitioner\u2019s request to transport a load, to work on any particular day, or work any particular schedule. If a driver chose not to haul a load or work for a period of time, he or she was not disciplined or sanctioned. Petitioner and the drivers were entitled to terminate their relationship at any time. Petitioner provided all necessary equipment required to secure the cargo hauled on its trucks. However, petitioner\u2019s drivers were free to supply any additional equipment at their own cost. Drivers paid for their own gloves, hand tools, and meals. If a driver\u2019s relationship with petitioner was severed, the driver was free to take any equipment or accessories he or she had provided. Petitioner paid for all fuel, oil, highway use taxes, and normal maintenance and repairs required to operate its trucks. Petitioner was solely responsible for determining the nature and timing of any repairs and/or maintenance of its trucks, and its mechanics performed all the maintenance and repairs. The drivers were not required to make any repairs or perform any maintenance to the trucks, but they were obligated to comply with the Federal motor carrier safety regulations, including those provisions which required pretrip inspections. Drivers were paid, on a weekly basis, between 28 percent and 27 percent of the 75 percent petitioner received for each hauled load. The more loads a driver hauled each week, the more money he or she earned. During the periods at issue, petitioner filed Forms 1099MISC, Miscellaneous Income, for each of its drivers who worked under the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">In 1997, 1998, and 1999, respondent reclassified as employees a total of 29, 24, and 21 drivers, respectively. Of the drivers who were reclassified, 13 had contracted with petitioner for more than 2 years and 4 had contracted with petitioner for more than 3 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">(footnotes omitted). The Tax Court also described Peno Trucking\u2019s day to day operations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">When Ohio Transport had freight which needed to be transported, ordinarily in the Midwest and frequently to States adjoining Ohio, it or a mill working with Ohio Transport would contact petitioner and instruct it as to the specifications of the particular job. If petitioner had a truck available to haul the load, it would offer the job to one of its drivers. If a driver was unavailable or unwilling to accept the load, then the load was offered to another driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">If a driver accepted the job, petitioner advised the driver, in accordance with Ohio Transport\u2019s or the mill\u2019s directives, of the time to pick up the load, the delivery location, and the expected delivery time. The drivers carried beepers so that petitioner could remain in contact while they were on the road. Petitioner did not direct the routes drivers were to use in either picking up or delivering loads. If a driver chose to drive on a toll road, the driver was responsible for paying the tolls. After a load was delivered, the driver could immediately return to petitioner\u2019s place of business with or without a return load.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">During its years of operation, two of Peno Trucking\u2019s drivers filed claims for workers\u2019 compensation because they suffered injuries during the course of their trucking activities. On May 18, 1995, Richard Chatfield filed his claim for work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ers\u2019 compensation. The Ohio Industrial Commission (\u201cOIC\u201d), in an order dated October 25, 1995, disallowed Chatfield\u2019s claim, finding that he \u201cwas not an employee of [Peno Trucking] on the date of injury herein. [Chatfield] was an independent contractor who had not secured Workers\u2019 Compensation for himself.\u201d The order did not provide the basis for its determination. Chatfield\u2019s appeal of the order was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Similarly, on June 26, 1997, Kenneth Jamison filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation because of an injury he suffered during the course of his trucking activities. In an order dated August 25, 1997, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) denied Jamison\u2019s claim, finding that \u201c[t]here is no proof of an employee/employer relationship between the injured worker and the listed employer.\u201d The BWC further explained that this decision was based on the signed agreement between Jamison and Peno Trucking. Pursuant to Jamison\u2019s appeal of the BWC order, the OIC vacated the BWC order and found that \u201c[Jamison] was an independent contractor who had not secured Workers\u2019 Compensation for himself.\u201d The OIC did not explain the grounds of its decision and simply stated that \u201cAll evidence in the file was considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On September 12, 2008, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) issued Peno Trucking a Notice of Determination of Worker Classification. In that determination, the Commissioner stated that certain identified drivers were in fact employees of Peno Trucking and not independent contractors. In addition, the Commissioner concluded that Peno Tracking was not entitled to relief from employment taxes under \u00a7 530(a) of the Revenue Act of 1978. The Commissioner then went on to calculate the additional taxes owed by Peno Trucking. Peno Tracking appealed the Commissioner\u2019s determination pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7436. In that appeal, Peno Trucking argued that the truck drivers in question were independent contractors and not employees. In addition, Peno Trucking claimed that it had not treated the truckers in question as employees, had filed all federal tax returns consistent with this treatment, and had a reasonable basis for doing so \u2014 the order of the OIC concluding that both Chatfield and Jamison were not employees, but independent contractors. Thus, Peno Trucking claimed its tax liability should have been terminated under \u00a7 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978\u2019s safe harbor provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The Tax Court found in favor of the Commissioner, concluding that the relevant factors indicated the truckers in question were employees and not independent contractors. Furthermore, the Tax Court found that Peno Trucking could not have reasonably relied upon the determination of either the BWC or the OIC in treating the truckers as independent contractors because (1) \u201c[t]he record d[id] not indicate that the BWC, the OIC, or the court of common pleas evaluated the employment relationships of petitioner\u2019s former drivers, Chatfield and Jamison, through a common law analysis\u201d and (2) \u201cnothing in the record indicates the rulings concerning Jami-son and Chatfield were relied upon at the time petitioner\u2019s employment decisions were made.\u201d Peno Trucking appeals the Tax Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">As a general rule \u201c[w]e review the tax court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings under the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Zack v. Comm\u2019r, </em>291 F.3d 407, 412 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Indmar Prods. Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>444 F.3d 771, 777 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cWe review the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings for \u2018clear error\u2019 and its application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>of law <em>de novo.\u201d)-, MTS Int\u2019l Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>169 F.3d 1018,1021 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201cThis court reviews the tax court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact under the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard.\u201d). In turn, \u201c[fjactual findings are clearly erroneous if, based upon the entire record, the reviewing court is \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zack, </em>291 F.3d at 412 (quoting <em>Sanford v. Harvard Indus., Inc., </em>262 F.3d 590, 595 (6th Cir.2001)). This tracks the language of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a) which states \u201c[t]he United States Courts of Appeals ... shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court ... in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury....\u201d <em>Cf. Freytag v. Comm\u2019r, </em>501 U.S. 868, 891, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) (noting that the standard under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a) \u201ccontrasts with the standard applied to agency rulemaking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Although this court has in the past applied the clearly erroneous standard to the employee-independent contractor question, it has done so only when the dispute hinged primarily on factual determinations. <em>Lanigan Storage &amp; Van Co. v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 337, 341 (6th Cir. 1968). Indeed, in <em>Lanigan Storage, </em>this court cited precedent from the Ninth Circuit, which indicated that, when courts below make findings on such issues <em>\u201cas a fact,\u201d </em>we review the conclusion for clear error. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citing <em>McGuire v. United States, </em>349 F.2d 644 (9th Cir.1965)). And, only applying the clear-error standard to the factual determinations underlying the employee-independent contractor distinction comports with both <em>Lanigan Storage\u2019s </em>analysis of the tax court\u2019s role as factfinder and this court\u2019s analysis of the distinction in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., Trs. of the Resilient Floor Decorators Ins. Fund v. A &amp; M Installations, Inc., </em>395 F.3d 244, 249 (6th Cir.2005) (stating in the ERISA context that \u201c[t]his court applies de novo review to the question of whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor\u201d). We therefore review the facts underlying the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the truckers in question were employees for clear error, while reviewing its legal conclusions <em>de novo. But see Spicer Accounting v. United States, </em>918 F.2d 90, 92 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe determination of whether an employer-employee relationship exists involves a mixed question of law and fact. However, since the determination is predominantly one of fact, it is subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Employers are required to pay one half of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101 <em>et seq., </em>(\u201cFICA\u201d) taxes assessed against them employees and withhold from \u201cwages\u201d the amount of FICA taxes owed by the employees themselves. <em>See Boles Trucking v. United States, </em>77 F.3d 236, 238 (8th Cir.1996) (citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3102(a), 3402(a)). In addition, employers must pay Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301 <em>et seq., </em>(\u201cFUTA\u201d) taxes on the \u201cwages\u201d paid to their employees. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301; <em>see also Boles Trucking, </em>77 F.3d at 238. For the purposes of both FICA and FUTA taxes, \u201cwages\u201d is defined as \u201call remuneration for employment.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121 (FICA); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306 (FUTA). However, employers are not required to pay and withhold FICA and FUTA taxes in connection with payments to independent contractors. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3121(d) \u2014 1 (FICA); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3306(i)-l (FUTA); <em>see also, e.g., Hosp. Res. Pers. v. United States, </em>68 F.3d 421, 424 (11th Cir.1995); <em>Breaux &amp; Daigle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Inc. v. United States, </em>900 F.2d 49, 52 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see generally United States v. Silk, </em>331 U.S. 704, 712-14, 67 S.Ct. 1463, 91 L.Ed. 1757 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As a general rule, \u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s determination of tax liability is entitled to a presumption of correctness and ... the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the determination is erroneous.\u201d <em>Boles Trucking, </em>77 F.3d at 239 (citing <em>Helvering v. Taylor, </em>293 U.S. 507, 55 S.Ct. 287, 79 L.Ed. 623 (1935)). This principle applies \u201cto the Commissioner\u2019s classification of a taxpayer\u2019s workers as employees, i.e., once such a determination is made, it is the taxpayer\u2019s burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that its workers are or were independent contractors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in reviewing the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions, this court must determine whether the Tax Court clearly erred in concluding that Peno Trucking had not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the truckers in question were not employees, but instead independent contractors. <em>See Van Camp &amp; Bennion v. United States, </em>251 F.3d 862, 865 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">For the purposes of FICA, the term \u201cemployee\u201d includes \u201cany individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(d)(2). The regulations promulgated pursuant to FICA and FUTA provide some additional guidance as to the definition of an employer-employee relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">Generally such relationship exists when the person for whom services are performed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished. That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but how it shall be done. In this connection, it is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; it is sufficient if he has the right to do so. The right to discharge is also an important factor indicating that the person possessing that right is an employer. Other factors characteristic of an employer, but not necessarily present in every case, are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work, to the individual who performs the services. In general, if an individual is subject to the control or direction of another merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is an independent contractor. An individual performing services as an independent contractor is not as to such services an employee under the usual common law rules. Individuals such as physicians, lawyers, dentists, veterinarians, construction contractors, public stenographers, and auctioneers, engaged in the pursuit of an independent trade, business, or profession, in which they offer them services to the public, are independent contractors and not employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3121(d)-l (FICA); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3306(i)-l (FUTA).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u201cThe determination of an individual\u2019s status as an employee or an independent contractor has been the subject of numerous decisions. It is settled that each case must stand on its own facts, in light of all the existing circumstances, and that no one facet of the relationship is generally determinative.\u201d <em>Azad v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 74, 76 (8th Cir.1968); <em>see also Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 716, 67 S.Ct. 1463. Despite this fact, \u201cauthorities seem to be in general agreement that an employer\u2019s right to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>trol the manner in which the work is performed is an important if not the master test to be considered in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>Azad, </em>388 F.2d at 76. Nonetheless, courts typically consider the following factors in determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists: \u201c(1) The degree of control exercised by the principal over the details of the work; (2) which party invests in the facilities used in the work; (3) the opportunity of the individual for profit or loss; (4) whether or not the principal has the right to discharge the individual; (5) whether the work is part of the principal\u2019s regular business; (6) the permanency of the relationship; and (7) the relationship the parties believe they are creating.\u201d <em>Weber v. Comm\u2019r, </em>60 F.3d 1104, 1110 (4th Cir.1995); <em>Professional &amp; Executive Leasing v. Comm\u2019r, </em>89 T.C. 225, 232 (T.C.1987) (listing the same seven factors); <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. United States, </em>503 F.2d 423, 428 (2d Cir. 1974) (listing the same seven factors); <em>Pack v. United States, </em>434 F.Supp. 232, 234 (E.D.Tenn.1977) (listing the same seven factors); <em>see also Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 716, 67 S.Ct. 1463. <em>But see Doty v. Elias, </em>733 F.2d 720, 723 (10th Cir.1984) (\u201cIn applying this test, the courts generally focus on five factors: (1) the degree of control exerted by the alleged employer over the worker; (2) the worker\u2019s opportunity for profit or loss; (3) the worker\u2019s investment in the business; (4) the permanence of the working relationship; and (5) the degree of skill required to perform the work.\u201d); Rev. Rul. 87-41, 1987-1 Cum. Bull. 296, 298-299 (compiling a list of twenty non-exhaustive factors when determining whether an individual was an employee or independent contractor). Indeed, these were the same seven factors considered by the Tax Court below. Thus, in order to review the Tax Court\u2019s opinion, we consider each of these seven factors in turn as they apply to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">(1) The degree of control exercised by the principal over the details of the work</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">As noted above, an employer-employee relationship is generally assumed to exist where \u201csuch relationship exists when the person for whom services are performed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3121(d) \u2014 1 (FICA); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3306(i)-l (FUTA). In other words, \u201cit is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; it is sufficient if he has the right to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, no actual control need be exercised, as long as the employer has the right to control.\u201d <em>Professional &amp; Executive Leasing v. Comm\u2019r, </em>862 F.2d 751, 753 (9th Cir.1988) (using a five-factor test); <em>see also McGuire v. United States, </em>349 F.2d 644, 646 (9th Cir.1965) (\u201cThe absence of need to control should not be confused with the absence of right to control. The right to control contemplated by the Regulations relevant here and the common law as an incident of employment requires only such supervision as the nature of the work requires.\u201d); <em>Air Terminal Cab, Inc. v. United States, </em>478 F.2d 575, 580 (8th Cir.1973) (stating that \u201cit is the <em>right </em>to control which is determinative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Moreover, \u201c[wjhere the nature of a person\u2019s work requires little supervision, there is no need for actual control.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McGuire, </em>349 F.2d at 646 (noting that the work in question required little supervision, but nonetheless the individuals in question were employees as the appellant maintained the right to control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>their work). Furthermore, \u201cThe mere fact that the workers set their own hours and determined when to take breaks did not make them independent contractors.\u201d <em>General Inv. Corp. v. United States, </em>823 F.2d 337, 342 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In detailing the facts that supported its conclusion that Peno Trucking exercised control over the truckers consistent with an employer-employee relationship, the Tax Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">Pursuant to the leases with Ohio Transport, petitioner was responsible for hiring drivers, overseeing all work performed by the drivers, confirming their work was performed in accordance with the leases, and directing, supervising, paying, disciplining, and discharging the drivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">Petitioner determined the days drivers could work and controlled which loads the drivers would haul. Petitioner required the drivers to have appropriate commercial drivers\u2019 licenses, deliver the freight to certain places at certain times, maintain driving logs and other documents, and carry beepers. Petitioner, not the drivers, determined whether truck repairs were performed on the road or by its own mechanics and was responsible for all track maintenance costs incurred in maintaining the trucks,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1J\">(footnote omitted.) Peno Tracking contends that some of these factual conclusions are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">First, Robert Peno, Sr., stated at trial that the truckers were not required to carry beepers to stay in touch with him. However, two of the subcontract statements \u2014 both stipulated exhibits \u2014 include charges for lost pagers or beepers. Given this evidence, the Tax Court concluded that Peno Trucking \u201crequired its drivers to carry beepers, presumably so that it could maintain contact while the drivers were on the road.\u201d And, because of this evidence in the record, this conclusion is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Conti v. Comm\u2019r, </em>39 F.3d 658, 664 (6th Cir.1994) (noting that \u201cthe Tax Court, like any other court, may disregard uncontradicted testimony by a taxpayer where it finds that testimony lacking in credibility, or finds the testimony to be improbable, unreasonable or questionable.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Second, Peno Trucking focuses on the fact that it did not control the rates for the freight hauled by the truckers; in turn, because the truckers\u2019 income was a percentage of the income from the freight hauled, Peno Trucking argues that it did not control the amount of income earned by its truckers. However, this conclusion overlooks the fact that the different trackers received different percentages of income from the hauled freight. It would appear that the truckers negotiated the rate with Peno Trucking; in this way, Peno Trucking does appear to have controlled, to some degree, the income of the truckers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Third, Peno Trucking emphasizes that the truckers could choose whether or not to accept a particular load to haul. Thus, Peno Trucking argues that the truckers controlled their own work. While this may be true, it also appears to be the case that once a trucker did agree to haul a particular load, Peno Trucking controlled many of the conditions under which that hauling was done. Indeed, in its lease with Ohio transport, Peno Trucking stated that it would be \u201csolely responsible for directing, supervising, paying, discharging, disciplining and otherwise controlling and such drivers, helpers or other persons.\u201d This representation by Peno Trucking to Ohio Transport gives strong indication that Peno Trucking did in fact control the truckers in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>We therefore conclude that the Tax Court did not clearly err in determining that Peno Trucking did exercise sufficient control over the truckers in question to indicate the existence of an employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">(2) Which party invests in the facilities used in the work</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u201cThe fact that a worker provides his or her own tools generally indicates independent contractor status.\u201d <em>Ewens &amp; Miller, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>117 T.C. 263, 271 (T.C. 2001) (citing <em>Breaux &amp; Daigle, Inc. v. United States, </em>900 F.2d 49, 52 (5th Cir. 1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The Tax Court, in considering this factor, found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">The drivers incurred some cost for tools and maintaining them licenses. However, these costs were insignificant when compared to petitioner\u2019s substantial investment to acquire and maintain the fleet of approximately 15 trucks. The drivers did not pay any of the costs of operating the trucks or transporting the freight. The agreement stated petitioner alone was responsible for all maintenance of its equipment, all fuel, oil, tolls, 21 permits, and road fuel taxes incurred by the drivers on dispatched trips while in petitioner\u2019s trucks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">(footnotes omitted.) In response, Peno Trucking emphasizes that the truckers could in fact provide their own tools and would be entitled to take those tools with them if they chose to no longer drive a Peno truck. In addition, the parties stipulated that the drivers were responsible for paying tolls incurred en route to picking up a load for hauling. The Tax Court noted these facts, but nonetheless concluded \u201c[t]he relatively minor investment by the drivers and the substantial investment by petitioner support an employer-employee relationship.\u201d The Tax Court did not err in this evaluation. \u25a0 As a result, this factor also supports the existence of an employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">(3) The opportunity of the individual for profit or loss</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">In evaluating this factor, the Tax Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">The drivers were not paid an hourly wage or salary. They were paid 23 to 27 percent of the 75 percent petitioner received per load hauled, and the amounts earned depended entirely upon the number of trips they made. The drivers did not assume any risk of loss. As stated in the agreement, a driver could not incur any indebtedness on behalf of petitioner. This factor indicates an employer-employee relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">Based on these facts, the Tax Court concluded that \u201c[t]his factor indicates an employer-employee relationship.\u201d In doing so, the Tax Court clearly emphasized the fact that the truckers were not exposed to risk of loss, while minimizing the import of the truckers\u2019 ability to profit by pursuing more hauling assignments. Emphasizing the risk of loss while minimizing the opportunity for profit comports with analysis of this factor in Revenue Ruling 87-41 (1987): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Indeed, the Tax Court has similarly emphasized the exposure to losses in weighing this factor. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Comm\u2019r, </em>94 T.C.M. (CCH) 230, 2007 WL 2417271, at *3-4, 2007 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 251, at *9 (2007); <em>Hathaway v. Comm\u2019r, </em>72 T.C.M. (CCH) 460, P53 (1996); <em>Feivor v. Comm\u2019r, </em>69 T.C.M. (CCH) 2078, 1995 WL 113840, at *12-13, 1995 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 108, at *38-39 (1995). And, such an analysis ensures that the mere fact that an employer links salary to performance does not militate against finding that his workers are in fact employees. We therefore conclude that the Tax Court did not clearly err in determining that this factor also indicates the existence of an employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>Realization of Profit or Loss. </em>A worker who can realize a profit or suffer a loss as a result of the worker\u2019s services (in addition to the profit or loss ordinarily realized by employees) is generally an independent contractor, but the worker who cannot is an employee. For example, <em>if the worker is subject to a real risk of economic loss due to significant investments or a bona fide liability for expenses, such as salary payments to unrelated employees, that factor indicates that the worker is an independent contractor....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>(4) Whether or not the principal has the right to discharge the individual</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As noted above, the right to discharge indicates the existence of an employer-employee relationship. <em>See, e.g., Air Terminal Cab, Inc., </em>478 F.2d at 581. In evaluating this factor, the Tax Court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">The parties stipulated that petitioner retained the right to discharge its drivers and the drivers had a right to terminate their relationship with petitioner. However, at trial Mr. Peno testified that he personally would not terminate a driver; instead Ohio Transport or the mills would ban the driver. Mr. Peno\u2019s testimony as to this factor was self-serving and unreliable. This factor indicates an employee-employer relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">As this court has previously explained, \u201cwe give deference to the Tax Court\u2019s credibility findings because of the court\u2019s opportunity to observe the witnesses and them demeanor when they testify.\u201d <em>Conti v. Comm\u2019r, </em>39 F.3d at 664. Thus, \u201c[o]nce the Tax Court finds that the taxpayer\u2019s testimony lacks credibility, if the taxpayer has offered no other evidence in support of his position, the Tax Court has no choice but to rule for the Commissioner, since the taxpayer has failed to carry his requisite burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted). This is most notably the case here where the transcript of Robert Peno\u2019s testimony seems inconsistent on its face. Because of the Tax Court\u2019s credibility determination, this factor also supports a finding that an employer-employee relationship existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">(5) Whether the work is part of the principal\u2019s regular business</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">In its brief, Peno Trucking concedes that this factor supports a finding of an employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">(6) The permanency of the relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">According to the Tax Court, \u201c[t]he drivers worked in the course of petitioner\u2019s business rather than having a transitory relationship with petitioner. This factor supports an employer-employee relationship.\u201d However, as Peno Trucking correctly notes, the truckers were not required to work any particular hours or days. These facts make it somewhat difficult to determine whether there was, in fact, a \u201cpermanent\u201d relationship. That being said, such a determination is a factual determination, which we review for clear error. Moreover, the absence of this factor has limited import in effecting the employee-independent contractor analysis. <em>See Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. United States, </em>503 F.2d 423, 430 (2d Cir.1974) (finding the individuals in question to be employees despite then.' being transient and noting that the individuals in <em>Silk </em>were also transient and still deemed by the Supreme Court to be employees). We therefore conclude that the Tax Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>not clearly err in finding that this factor indicated the existence of an employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">(7) The relationship the parties believe they are creating</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The record does provide evidence that Peno Trucking and its truckers believed they were creating an independent contractor relationship. Most notably, the contracts between Peno Trucking and its truckers specifically stated that the truckers were to be considered independent contractors. However, as noted by the Tax Court, \u201c[i]f the relationship of employer and employee exists, the designation or description of the relationship by the parties as anything other than that of employer and employee is immaterial. Thus, if such relationship exists, it is of no consequence that the employee is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or the like.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3121(d)-l(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In sum, the factors detailed above weigh heavily in favor of finding an employer-employee relationship, combined with the fact that it is Peno Trucking\u2019s burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Commissioner erred in his assessment, <em>see Boles Trucking, </em>77 F.3d at 239, the beliefs of the parties simply cannot undermine the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion. Therefore, based on the factual and credibility determinations of the Tax Court, we conclude that the truckers in question were employees of Peno Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Despite the foregoing conclusions, Peno Trucking can still avoid liability under the safe harbor provisions of \u00a7 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 (\u201c \u00a7 530\u201d) provides for the termination of tax liability if \u201cfor purposes of employment taxes, the taxpayer did not treat an individual as an employee for any period\u201d; \u201call Federal tax returns (including information returns) required to be filed by the taxpayer with respect to such individual for such period are filed on a basis consistent with the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of such individual as not being an employee\u201d; and the employer had a \u201creasonable basis for not treating such individual as an employee.\u201d Pub.L. No. 95-600, 92 Stat. 2763, 2885-86 (reproduced at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401 note \u00a7 530(a)(2)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Among the grounds giving rise to a such a reasonable basis, \u00a7 530(a)(2) includes \u201cjudicial precedent, published rulings, technical advice with respect to the taxpayer, or a letter ruling to the taxpayer....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2885. Whether Peno Trucking can satisfy the \u201creasonable basis\u201d requirement of \u00a7 530 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Spicer Accounting v. United States, </em>918 F.2d 90, 94 (9th Cir.1990) (applying <em>de novo </em>review to whether the appellant had a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for not treating the individuals in question as employees); <em>cf. United States v. Talley, </em>275 F.3d 560, 563 (6th Cir.2001) (noting, in the Fourth Amendment context, that \u201c[t]he question of whether a belief is reasonable is one we review de novo, since the reasonableness test is objective, not subjective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Section 530 also provides a specific burden-shifting scheme: \u201cIf (i) a taxpayer establishes a prima facie case that it was reasonable not to treat an individual as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>employee for purposes of this section, and (ii) the taxpayer has fully cooperated with reasonable requests from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, then the burden of proof with respect to such treatment shall be on the Secretary.\u201d Pub.L. No. 104-188, 110 Stat. 1755, 1767 (reproduced at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401 note \u00a7 530(e)(4)(A)). It is the petitioner\u2019s initial burden to establish his <em>prima facie </em>case by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Dains v. United States, Internal Revenue Service, </em>82 A.F.T.R.2d (RIA) 5044, 1998 WL 385470, at *8, 1998 U.S.App. LEXIS 14924, at *21 (6th Cir.1998) (applying a preponderance of the evidence standard to the reasonable basis showing under \u00a7 530); <em>see also Springfield, </em>88 F.3d at 752-53 (applying a preponderance of the evidence standard despite Congress\u2019s \u201cliberally construed\u201d directive).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In the instant case, Peno Trucking argues that it has satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 530\u2019s safe harbor provision. As evidence of this claim, Peno Trucking notes that the Tax Court concluded that \u201c[Peno Trucking] never treated the drivers as employees and consistently issued them Forms 1099-MISC.\u201d This comports with the tax returns Peno Trucking provided the Commissioner for the years in question, 1997-1999. Peno Trucking argues that the decisions of the OIC and the BWC issued in response to the workers\u2019 compensation claims of Chatfield and Jamison provided reasonable bases for treating the truckers in question as independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We believe that Peno Trucking has clearly established a <em>prima facie </em>case that it was reasonable not to treat the truckers in question as employees, thus shifting the burden of proof to the Commissioner for the purposes of our \u00a7 530 analysis. Peno Trucking\u2019s tax returns for the years in question and representative contracts for the truckers in question constitute sufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>showing that it had always treated the truckers in question as independent contractors and that it has always filed its tax returns in a manner consistent with this treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Although the reasonable basis requirement presents a somewhat more complex issue, the legislative history for \u00a7 530 counsels finding that reliance on the decisions from the OIC and the BWC satisfy this inquiry. Section 530 was originally passed \u201cto provide interim relief for taxpayers who are involved in employment tax status controversies with the Internal Revenue Service, and who potentially face large assessments, as a result of the Service\u2019s proposed reclassifications of workers....\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1748, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>1978-3 C.B. 629, 632[\u201cHouse Report\u201d]. To that end, \u00a7 530 was intended to \u201cgrant[ ] relief if a taxpayer had any reasonable basis for treating workers as other than employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632-33. Most notably, Congress intended \u201cthat this reasonable basis requirement be construed liberally in favor of taxpayers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. As the Ninth Circuit has stated, \u201c[without question, Congress intended to protect employers who exercised good faith in determining whether them workers were employees or independent contractors.\u201d <em>General Inv. Corp. v. United States, </em>823 F.2d 337, 340 (9th Cir.1987); <em>see also McClellan v. United States, </em>900 F.Supp. 101, 104-06 (E.D.Mich.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Given this purpose, it is not surprising that other courts have construed this \u201creasonable basis\u201d standard as requiring reliance in-fact. <em>See, e.g., 303 West 42nd St. Enters, v. IRS, </em>181 F.3d 272, 277 (2d Cir. 1999) (focusing its inquiry on whether there the appellant \u201cin fact relied on\u201d the grounds alleged); <em>Nu-Look Design, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>85 T.C.M. (CCH) 927, 2003 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>548583, at *8, 2003 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 48, at *21 (2003) (\u201cThe statute does not countenance ex post facto justification.\u201d). Importantly, this requirement functions as a double-edged sword. While on the one hand, courts must liberally construe potential grounds for reasonable reliance, courts must be extremely vigilant in only applying the tax relief afforded by \u00a7 530 when \u201cthe taxpayer ... relied on the alleged authority ... at the time the employment decisions were being made.\u201d <em>Veterinary Surgical Consultants, P.C. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>85 T.C.M. (CCH) 901, 2003 WL 548572, at *9, 2003 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 52, at *24-25 (2003); <em>see also 303 West 42nd St. Enters., </em>181 F.3d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In applying the reasonable basis requirement, the Tax Court concluded that reliance on the decisions of the BWC and the OIC could not be considered reasonable. In reaching this conclusion, the Tax Court cited <em>Nu-Look Design, </em>for the proposition that \u201c[fjor a taxpayer to have a reasonable basis for not treating an individual as an employee under the judicial precedent safe harbor, the judicial precedent relied upon must have evaluated the employment relationship through a Federal common law analysis.\u201d And, according to the Tax Court, \u201c[t]he record does not indicate that the BWC [or] the OIC ... evaluated the employment relationships of petitioner\u2019s former drivers, Chatfield and Jamison, through a common law analysis.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In doing so, we begin by noting that, although not part of the record before us, the Ohio Board of Worker\u2019s Compensation appears to employ a twenty-factor common-law test virtually identical to the twenty-factor test outlined by Internal Revenue Service for determining whether individuals are employees or independent contractors. <em>Compare </em>http:/Avww. ohiobwe.com/infostation/content/1/1.2/1.2.8. 1.2.2.1.htm (stating that the Ohio BWC uses the twenty-factor test outlined at O.R.C. \u00a7 4123.01(A)(1)(c)), <em>and </em>O.R.C. \u00a7 4123.01(A)(1)(c), <em>with </em>Rev. Rul. 87-41; 1987-1 C.B. 296 (outlining the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s twenty-factor common law test). Indeed, at oral argument the Commissioner could not point to another jurisdiction in the United States that uses a test for differentiating between employees and independent contractors at odds with typical common-law tests. Thus, much of the Commissioner\u2019s argument stands on shaky ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">But more importantly, <em>Nu-Look Design </em>is clearly distinguishable from our own case. In <em>Nu-Look Design, </em>the petitioners relied upon the language in previously decided cases, applying the logic of those cases to their own. <em>Nu-Look Design, </em>2003 WL 548583, at *7-8, 2003 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 48, at *21. In our own case, Peno Trucking received official determinations \u2014 the determinations of the OIC and the BWC \u2014 as to the status of its truckers. Peno Trucking did not engage in the type of specious application of prior case law that pervaded the arguments of the petitioner in <em>Nur-Look Design. </em>Indeed, Peno Trucking\u2019s reliance on the official determinations of the OIC and the BWC would seem to satisfy the reasonable basis requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">This is especially the case in circumstances like ours, where the individuals in question, while ultimately determined to be employees, resemble independent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tractors on many counts. It is in such cases where courts can be confident that \u00a7 530 functions to advance its legislative purpose: \u201cto protect employers who exercised good faith in determining whether them workers were employees or independent contractors.\u201d <em>General Inv. Corp., </em>823 F.2d at 340 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">With the burden shifted, the Commissioner has not demonstrated that Peno Trucking does not qualify for tax relief under \u00a7 530. <em>See </em>McClellan, 900 F.Supp. at 107 (\u201cOnce the taxpayer has made this <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden then shifts to the IRS to verify or refute the taxpayer\u2019s explanation.\u201d). The Commissioner has not presented any evidence of Peno Trucking\u2019s treatment of the truckers in question in a manner inconsistent with that of an independent contractor and the Commissioner has not presented any tax returns, filed by Peno Trucking, that would be inconsistent with its truckers\u2019 independent contractor status. In addition, the Commissioner has not alleged that Peno Trucking has failed to cooperate in any way with the reasonable requests made in the underlying audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The Commissioner does argue, however, that Peno Tracking could not have in fact relied upon the decisions of the OIC and the BWC because those determinations came after the decision to treat the truckers in question as independent contractors. This argument overlooks the factual record here. Although the decisions of the BWC and the OIC in response to Jami-son\u2019s workers compensation claim were rendered in late 1997, too late to have actually served as the basis for Peno Trucking\u2019s employment decision, the OIC\u2019s decision to treat Chatfield as an independent contractor was rendered on October 25, 1995. Thus, Peno Trucking could have in fact relied upon the decision of the OIC in making its employment decision for the years in question \u2014 1997 though 1999 \u2014 -to treat its trackers as independent contractors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, Robert Peno, Sr., testified at trial that this was in fact what he had done. The Commissioner has not provided any evidence to the contrary. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 530, we conclude that Peno Trucking is eligible for relief from the tax liabilities imposed upon it by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\">. Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 was initially intended to provide interim tax relief. However, although never codified, it was extended indefinitely by \u00a7 269 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (\"TEFRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324, 552. It is reproduced in the notes following 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401. <em>See also Springfield </em>v. <em>United States, </em>88 F.3d 750, 751 n. 2 (9th Cir.1996) (summarizing legislative history).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">. The Tax Court also stated that it had no evidence that the Ohio Court of Common Pleas used federal common law analysis. The record does not indicate that there ever was an adjudication of any claims in the Court of Common Pleas, only that Chatfield filed an appeal of his independent contractor designation and then withdrew that appeal on June 18, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">. The Commissioner, in his brief, seems to argue that the OIC's decision in Chatfield\u2019s case could not have been relied upon because Chatfield could still have pursued an appeal of the OIC's decision in the Court of Common Pleas until June 18, 1997. While this may in fact have been the case, the Commissioner fails to explain why the mere fact that Chat-field could have appealed the decision of the OIC until June 18, 1997 should preclude Peno Trucking from relying on the decision of the OIC prior to that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
