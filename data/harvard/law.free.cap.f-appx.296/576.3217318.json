Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline, and petitioners have not contended that any exceptions to this time limit apply, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 untimely motion to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Accordingly, this petition for review is summarily denied in part because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">As to petitioners\u2019 request for sua sponte reopening, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision to deny sua sponte reopening of petitioners\u2019 case. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2002). We therefore grant respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
