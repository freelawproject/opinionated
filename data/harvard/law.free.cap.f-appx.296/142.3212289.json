Jan. 2, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 959 238 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 25, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ relied, in part, on Li\u2019s inconsistent testimony regarding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>he had ever been arrested. While Li initially testified that he had never been arrested, convicted of a crime, or appeared in any other U.S. court, the record showed that Li had in fact been convicted of fraud for attempting to use a false passport to enter the United States and that he served time in prison for that offense. Li argues that it was improper for the agency to rely on the fact that he had presented false documents in concluding that he was not credible; however, Li misconstrues the IJ\u2019s finding, which relied instead on his inconsistent testimony about that conviction. <em>Cf. Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127, 133-35 (2d Cir.2006). Li also argues that he adequately explained in an affidavit why he failed to admit his conviction, but the IJ properly found that the affidavit itself contradicted his explanation. <em>See, e.g., Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The IJ also found Li\u2019s testimony as to why he had not submitted his second child\u2019s birth certificate to be \u201cevasive, contradictory, and non-responsive.\u201d An IJ\u2019s findings relating to an applicant\u2019s demean- or are accorded \u201cparticular deference.\u201d <em>Shu Wen Sun v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007). Here, the IJ was in the best position to discern how Li\u2019s demeanor during his testimony reflected on his truthfulness, and we therefore defer to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Taken together, the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, and his finding with respect to Li\u2019s inconsistent testimony about his criminal conviction constitute substantial evidence in support of the denial of his asylum application. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). We need not address the IJ\u2019s alternative discretionary denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Finally, inasmuch as Li based his claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, and the IJ found that this evidence lacked credibility, those claims necessarily fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
