We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>358 F.3d 599, 602 (9th Cir. 2004), and may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>Valdez v. Rosenbaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Acosta\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims relating to his transfer to Salt River Service Center because he failed to make any reference to that transfer in his Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) Charge of Discrimination. <em>See Green v. Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schs., </em>883 F.2d 1472, 1475-76 (1989) (explaining that the court could not consider a Title VII claim when the plaintiff did not exhaust his administrative remedies for an incident that was not \u201clike or reasonably related to\u201d the allegations in his EEOC Charge of Discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Acosta\u2019s discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>tion and retaliation claims relating to his transfer to the Metro Facilities Division and his work-station assignments because he failed to demonstrate an adverse employment action and therefore failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. <em>See Peterson, </em>358 F.3d at 603 (explaining that the plaintiff alleging discrimination has the burden of showing that he experienced an adverse employment action); <em>Porter v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>419 F.3d 885, 894 (9th Cir.2005) (same, retaliation case).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We do not consider Acosta\u2019s contention that the City violated his First Amendment rights. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cAs a general rule, we will not consider arguments that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We deny the City\u2019s motion to strike Acosta\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
