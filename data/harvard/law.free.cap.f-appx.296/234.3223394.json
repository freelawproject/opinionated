Banks of mail fraud, copyright infringement, money laundering, uttering and possession of counterfeit and forged securities, and witness tampering. He was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. We affirmed the judgment and sentence in June 2006. <em>See United States v. Vampire Nation, </em>451 F.3d 189 (3d Cir.2006). The Supreme Court denied Banks\u2019 petition for certiorari. <em>See Banks v. United States, </em>549 U.S. 970, 127 S.Ct. 424, 166 L.Ed.2d 300 (2006). Banks next filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion and Banks appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>In the meantime, Banks filed various \u201cnotices\u201d in the District Court, alleging that his sentence must be suspended under admiralty law, that he is a \u201cforeign sovereign agent\u201d protected by the \u201cact of state doctrine,\u201d and that he is immune from prosecution as a Lakota Sioux Indian. The District Court treated the notices as motions attacking his conviction, and held that it was without jurisdiction to entertain them while this Court considered Banks\u2019 appeal of the order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, the District Court denied the motions without prejudice to their re-submission following our adjudication of Banks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 appeal. Banks filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied by order entered December 13, 2007. He then filed the present appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">As a general rule, a District Court should not entertain a habeas corpus petition while there is an appeal pending in the court of appeals or in the Supreme Court. <em>See Feldman v. Henman, </em>815 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (9th Cir.1987). Such actions are disfavored as a matter of judicial economy and concern that disposition of the appeal may make the District Court\u2019s efforts a nullity. <em>See, e.g., Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570-72 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Venen v. Sweet, </em>758 F.2d 117, 121 (3d Cir.1985). These principles apply with equal force in this case. Banks\u2019 motions sought to invalidate his conviction and sentence, the same type of relief sought through the appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore, adjudication of Banks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 appeal may have rendered moot the issues raised in the motions filed in the District Court. Under these eircumstances, the District Court properly rejected Banks\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Because this appeal presents us with no substantial question, <em>see </em>I.O.P. 10.6, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. To the extent that Banks now seeks to appeal from other orders entered on December 13, 2007, we affirm. Those orders directed the Clerk to strike as frivolous a \"Notice of Non-Acceptance and Discharge of Debt Restitution and Special Assessment Fees\u201d and a \"Notice to Perform,\u201d in which Banks demanded payment from one of the District Court\u2019s staff who used his name in correspondence without permission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
