Peake, </em>No. 06-1175 (Vet.App. Feb. 27, 2008), affirming a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board) decision denying entitlement to an earlier effective date of service connection for schizophrenia. Because Mr. Ford raises only a new, fact-based challenge on appeal, we <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-20\">Mr. Ford served on active duty from March 1977 to September 1979. In April 1983, the Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) denied him service connection for a nervous condition. After denying multiple subsequent claims for service connection, the RO granted service connection in October 1998 and assigned a 100% disability rating effective November 30, 1993. Mr. Ford filed a claim in November 2002 seeking an earlier effective date. The RO denied this claim in July 2003, and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Ford appealed to the Board. The Board found that Mr. Ford was entitled to an earlier effective date \u2014 January 2, 1990\u2014 because a claim he had filed on that date was still pending when the RO granted service connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Mr. Ford also argued before the Board that the RO committed clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a November 1983 rating decision by failing to assist him in obtaining records to support his claim for service connection. The Board rejected this argument on the basis that \u201cunder 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1403(d) (2005), a failure to fulfill VA\u2019s duty to assist a claimant with the development of facts relevant to his claim is not an example of a situation constituting CUE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Mr. Ford appealed to the Veterans Court. He argued only that VA \u201cshould have examined the weight and credibility of the evidence\u201d before the RO in November 1983. Because Mr. Ford had not made this argument before the Board, the Veterans Court dismissed Mr. Ford\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Mr. Ford appeals the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, and we have jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Our jurisdiction is limited to considering \u201cchallenge^] to the validity of a statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof\u2019 and to \u201cinterpretfing] constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent a constitutional issue, we cannot review factual determinations or \u201cchallenged] to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2). Moreover, we cannot review new challenges not raised in the Veterans Court. <em>See Boggs v. West, </em>188 F.3d 1335, 1337-38 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Mr. Ford does not challenge the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation. Mr. Ford does not even appeal the only issue decided by the Veterans Court in dismissing for lack of jurisdiction \u2014 i.e., failure to raise before the Board that VA should have examined the weight and credibility of evidence before the RO in November 1983. Instead, Mr. Ford simply argues that he is entitled to an earlier filing date. This challenge to the application of law to fact is not within our jurisdiction. Thus, we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
