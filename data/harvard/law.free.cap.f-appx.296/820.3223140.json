On appeal, Appellants stress that at the time Powell encountered their son, Powell suspected Wright of only a misdemeanor offense. However, as the district court noted, this is just one factor to evaluate in considering whether the amount of force used was reasonable. More important in this case are the following undisputed facts: At the time Powell fired his gun, Wright had repeatedly and actively resisted arrest, failed to be deterred by pepper spray or Powell\u2019s verbal warnings and drawing of his gun, had hit Powell with his car while trying to flee, and was attempting to gain control of Powell\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-23\">Thus, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Appellants, the undisputed evidence shows that Powell had probable cause to believe that Wright posed a threat of serious physical harm to Powell and to others in the vicinity and that, in light of the circumstances confronting Powell, his use of deadly force was objectively reasonable. While the fatal shooting of Wright is no doubt unfortunate, we emphasize, as the district court did, that we are loath to second-guess the decisions of police officers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> such as Powell in this case who are \u201c \u2018forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u2019 \u2019.\u2019 <em>Long v. Slaton, </em>508 F.3d 576, 580 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-24\">Appellants also argue the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. Appellants attempted to dismiss their claim after the close of discovery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>including a discovery extension of six months, and after Powell had filed his motion for summary judgment. The district court held a hearing and denied the voluntary dismissal, but allowed Appellants additional time for discovery and additional time in which to respond to Powell\u2019s summary judgment. Under these circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-17\">.
