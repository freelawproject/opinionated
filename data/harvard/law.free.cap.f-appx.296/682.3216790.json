Minners pleaded guilty to four charges stemming from a crime of violence committed in 2005. <em>See United States v. Minners, </em>211 Fed.Appx. 742, 742-43 (10th Cir. 2007). Minners\u2019s direct appeal was dismissed by this court on January 4, 2007. <em>Id. </em>The instant \u00a7 2255 motion was filed on May 27, 2008. In the motion, Minners asserted claims that his counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. The district court dismissed Minners\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion sua sponte, concluding the motion was filed outside the one-year limitation period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In his appellate brief, Minners argues the merits of the claims he seeks to raise in his \u00a7 2255 motion. He does not address the district court\u2019s procedural ruling and presents no argument that the district court miscalculated the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">To be entitled to a COA, Minners must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (holding that when a district court dismisses a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a petitioner is entitled to a COA only if he shows both that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether he had stated a valid constitutional claim and debatable whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct). Our review of the record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Minners\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely is not deserving of further proceedings or subject to a different resolution on appeal. Accordingly, we deny Minners\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
