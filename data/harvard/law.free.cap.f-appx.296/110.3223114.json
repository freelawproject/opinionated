Bukszpan denying Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), <em>hi re Li Ping Lin, </em>No. A95 673 910 (B.I.A. Jan. 17, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 673 910 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 1, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-27\">\u201cWhere, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>cussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121,129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ based her adverse credibility determination on her observation of Lin\u2019s demeanor, specifically noting that she had to be admonished repeatedly for her \u201cexceptionally evasive\u201d testimony. We accord particular deference to such findings. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The IJ also pointed to internal inconsistencies in Lin\u2019s testimony, as well as discrepancies between that testimony and her asylum application. The IJ noted in particular an inconsistency in Lin\u2019s testimony regarding the year she learned that her friend began practicing Falun Gong. As the IJ observed, Lin testified that her friend began practicing Falun Gong at the end of 2003, and that she knew this because her friend told her in 1993. After repeated attempts at clarification, Lin maintained that she was told in 2003. When the IJ asked the interpreter if he stood by his original translation, he responded in the affirmative, stating that 1993 was Lin\u2019s initial response.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The IJ noted an additional discrepancy in Lin\u2019s testimony with respect to when the police arrested her friend and when they came to arrest her. Lin originally testified that her friend was arrested on March 17, 2004, and that the police went to Lin\u2019s home to arrest her on April 20, 2004. However, later in the hearing, Lin testified that the police began looking for her only a few days after they arrested her friend in March 2004, which is consistent with the date contained within her asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Although arguably minor, taken together with the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, these inconsistencies provide proper support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Taken together, the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of Lin\u2019s inconsistent testimony served to undermine her overall credibility. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir. 2006). Moreover, while Lin attempted to provide \u201cplausible\u201d explanations for these inconsistencies, no reasonable fact-finder would have been \u201ccompelled\u201d to accept them. <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Having called Lin\u2019s testimony into question, the IJ properly evaluated Lin\u2019s evidence, concluding that it did not rehabilitate testimony. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Because Lin was properly found not credible, she failed to show the necessary subjective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir.2004). Thus, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was proper. In addition, Lin\u2019s claim for withholding of removal had the same factual predicate as her asylum claim. Thus, the adverse credibility deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>mination was fatal to that claim as well. <em>See, e.g., Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.8d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006). As the government argues, Lin fails to make any meaningful challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. Thus, we deem that claim to have been abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
