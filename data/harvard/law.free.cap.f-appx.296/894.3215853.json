After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">A. Application for Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">After receiving information from a confidential source (\u201cCS\u201d), special agent Victor D. Washington started an investigation into the unlawful possession of firearms by Deering, a convicted felon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As part of the investigation, Agent Washington spoke with the CS on \u201cseveral occasions\u201d between April 2, 2007, and April 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">The CS told Agent Washington she had observed firearms and ammunition inside Deering\u2019s residence on several occasions during the prior three months and as late as February 15. The CS described one firearm as a rifle with a brown wooden stock and a dark colored barrel. The CS stated that this rifle was kept against a wall by the front door and that Deering described the rifle as a \u201c \u2018.22 caliber rifle.\u2019 \u201d The CS saw a second firearm on the couch in the living room, which the CS described as a \u201c \u2018stainless steel,\u2019 \u201d bottom-loading firearm \u201c \u2018with a black handle.\u2019 \u201d The CS stated that Deering described this firearm as a \u201c \u2018Russian .380 caliber pistol.\u2019 \u201d The CS observed a third firearm in the bedroom that had a brown wooden stock and a gray barrel that had been cut down to approximately eight or ten inches in length. Deering described this firearm to the CS as a \u201c \u2018rifle.\u2019 \u201d From a firearms manual procured by Agent Washington, the CS subsequently identified two firearms as firearms similar to the ones the CS saw in Deering\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-19\">The CS also observed several boxes containing various sizes of ammunition inside Deering\u2019s residence. The CS heard Deer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ing target shooting at the residence and saw shell casings in the front and back yards. The CS described the premises as large enough to target shoot without disturbing, or being seen by, neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The CS provided Agent Washington with this information: (1) Deering\u2019s birth-date, Social Security number, physical description, address and telephone number; (2) his wife\u2019s name and description; and (3) a description of his residence, his dog (including the dog\u2019s name), and his vehicles. The CS told Agent Washington that Deering: (1) had a prior conviction for aggravated battery; (2) had been arrested for battery, kidnaping, and possession of marijuana; (3) had physically abused his wife; (4) claimed he had served in the Army and been employed as a deputy with the Levy County Sheriffs office; and (5) had his driver\u2019s license revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Another law enforcement officer informed Agent Washington that information matching Deering\u2019s date of birth, general description, and address indicated Deering had an expired driver\u2019s license, as well as two vehicles and a motorcycle registered in his name. In investigating the information provided by the CS, Agent Washington learned Deering: (1) had been arrested for, <em>inter alia, </em>battery, kidnaping, possession of marijuana, and battery domestic violence; (2) had worked as a deputy with the Levy County Sheriffs Office; (3) had domestic problems with his wife, Patricia S. Deering; (4) had been arrested for domestic violence, violation of a no-contact order, and violation of probation, and adjudicated guilty of aggravated battery; (5) had been convicted of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; (6) worked for two years as a military police officer in the army; (7) was wanted for failure to pay child support; (8) subscribed to the same telephone number as the one provided by the CS; and (9) had not had his right to possess firearms restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">On April 17, 2007, Agent Washington met with the CS, and the CS identified Deering from a print-out of his driver\u2019s license. The CS directed Agent Washington to Deering\u2019s residence and identified Deering\u2019s dog, \u201c \u2018Tank.\u2019 \u201d Taken together, the information gathered confirmed much of what the CS provided to Agent Washington. Consequently, Agent Washington concluded that there was probable cause to believe Deering had firearms and ammunition in his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">On May 10, 2007, Agent Washington prepared an application for a search warrant to search Deering\u2019s home and attached an affidavit detailing the information gathered. In addition, Agent Washington averred that he had participated in the execution of numerous search warrants for firearms violations and that, in his experience, people who own firearms, including convicted felons, commonly store firearms and ammunition in their residences. Based on this information, a search warrant was issued and executed the same day. The search resulted in the seizure of three firearms and multiple rounds of ammunition from Deering\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">B. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">A federal grand jury indicted Deering on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Deering filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home pursuant to the search warrant. Deering\u2019s motion alleged that: (1) the application contained no information indicating that weapons would be located in his residence; (2) the application contained no information as to the bias of the CS or any indication that law enforcement had used the CS before or that the CS was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>trustworthy; and (3) the OS\u2019s information was stale because law enforcement last had contact with the CS twenty-one days before the search warrant was executed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on these allegations, Deering\u2019s motion argued there was no nexus between the firearms and the residence, and thus no probable cause existed to support the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The district court denied Deering\u2019s motion. The district court found a sufficient nexus between the firearms and the residence because the CS observed the firearms and ammunition at the residence and Agent Washington indicated that, based on his experience and knowledge, most people store firearms in their home. With regard to the veracity and reliability of the CS, the district court indicated that, under the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of probable cause was entirely reasonable. As to the staleness issue, the district court concluded that the information was not stale because the nature of firearm possession is such that it is usually ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Deering filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that the district court misinterpreted his suppression argument. Deering\u2019s motion argued that the staleness argument was not about the twenty-one days since last contact, but the eighty-five-day time lapse between the date the firearms were seen last by the CS in the residence and the date the warrant was executed. The court denied Deering\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The district court acknowledged it had made an error in its factual summary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the district court concluded the eighty-five-day time lapse did not render the information too stale to support a finding of probable cause because of the \u201ctype of items that were being searched for, the corroboration of the source\u2019s information by law enforcement, and the number of firearms that the source had seen in the residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">C. Guilty Plea and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Deering pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement that reserved Deering\u2019s right to appeal any pretrial rulings. During the plea hearing it was revealed the CS was Deering\u2019s wife who had left Deering because they could not get along anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">At sentencing, Deering\u2019s counsel revealed that Deering\u2019s marriage had been legally dissolved after the presentence investigation report had been prepared and Deering\u2019s ex-wife had been awarded the land and mobile home. The court sentenced Deering to sixty-five months\u2019 imprisonment. Deering appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">A. Timeliness of Information in Warrant Application On appeal, Deering argues that the district court should have granted his motion to suppress because the search warrant application was based on stale information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">To show probable cause, the government\u2019s application for a search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>must be timely, that is it \u201cmust reveal facts that make it likely that the items being sought are in that place when the warrant issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 450 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWarrant applications based upon stale information fail to create a probable cause that similar or other improper conduct is continuing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To evaluate staleness claims, we look at the unique facts of each case and may consider \u201cthe maturity of the information, nature of the suspected crime (discrete crimes or ongoing conspiracy), habits of the accused, character of the items sought, and nature and function of the premises to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere is no particular rule or time limit for when information becomes stale.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256,1265 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Here, the information contained in Agent Washington\u2019s affidavit was not too stale to provide probable cause. First, the OS\u2019s information indicated Deering\u2019s firearm possession was ongoing. Specifically, the affidavit stated that the CS had observed firearms and ammunition at Deering\u2019s residence \u201cseveral times\u201d within a three-month period, that there were three different guns in different locations of the house, and that the CS had heard Deering engage in target practice and seen shells scattered in the front and back yards. These facts support a finding that Deering\u2019s firearm possession was for his personal use and was ongoing. <em>See United States v. Haimowitz, </em>706 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201c[I]f an affidavit recites activity indicating protracted or continuous conduct, time is of less significance.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Second, the nature of the evidence sought made the eighty-five-day time lapse less significant. Agent Washington averred in his affidavit that people who own firearms and ammunition commonly store those items in their homes. Furthermore, as the district court noted, common sense suggests that firearms, unlike drugs, are generally not items that are dispersed quickly, particularly when multiple firearms are possessed in the residence for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">These circumstances, taken together, make it more likely than not that the firearms sought were still in Deering\u2019s residence. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the eighty-five-day time lapse \u2014 from the last date the CS witnessed the firearms in Deering\u2019s residence to the date the warrant was issued \u2014 did not render the information too stale to support probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">B. Probable Cause for Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">Whether an affidavit is sufficient to establish probable cause is subject to a \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances analysis.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). \u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reviewing court\u2019s task is to ensure the magistrate judge had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for finding probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 238-39,103 S.Ct. at 2332. \u201cA magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause should be paid great defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ence by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 103 S.Ct. at 2331 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Here, a sufficient basis for finding probable cause existed. The CS showed a detailed knowledge of the wrongdoing; described in detail the various firearms, the ammunition, and its packaging; described the locations of the firearms and ammunition; and indicated that she personally observed the firearms and ammunition in the residence on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Deering argues the affidavit failed to provide a sufficient basis to find probable cause because the affidavit provided no basis to measure the CS\u2019s veracity and reliability. Furthermore, he argues the affidavit only corroborated innocent information provided by the CS. However, to have a substantial basis for making a probable cause determination, the police do not need to corroborate the criminal activity. A finding of probable cause \u201crequires only a probability ... of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 n. 13. Moreover, the corroboration of innocent activity may serve to bolster veracity under the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis because when \u201can informant is right about some things, [she] is more probably right about other facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (quotation marks omitted). This is especially true where, as here, the CS\u2019s information is of a character likely obtained only from the defendant or from someone intimately familiar with his information. In such cases, \u201ca magistrate could properly conclude that it was not unlikely that [the CS] also had access to reliable information of the [defendant\u2019s] alleged illegal activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 103 S.Ct. at 2336.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Thus, Agent Washington\u2019s inability to corroborate criminal activity prior to the application for the search warrant does not preclude a finding of probable cause. In issuing the search warrant, the magistrate judge was called upon to make a practical, common-sense judgment regarding probable cause. Based on the record, we conclude that a substantial basis existed improbable cause because the CS demonstrated detailed knowledge and Agent Washington corroborated a significant amount of innocent information, some of which could have been obtained only by someone close to Deering. Therefore, the district coui't properly determined the search warrant issued by the magistrate judge was supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">C. Failure to Disclose CS\u2019s Identity</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Finally, Deering challenges the probable cause finding on the basis that law enforcement should have disclosed that the CS was Deering\u2019s estranged wife. \u201cTo justify suppression of evidence seized under a warrant, the alleged deliberate or reckless failure to include material information in the affidavit must conceal information that would defeat probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Steiger, </em>318 F.3d 1039, 1046 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Jenkins, </em>901 F.2d 1075, 1080 (11th Cir.1990) (noting that insignificant or immaterial omissions will not invalidate a warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Here, Deering has not shown that the inclusion of the CS\u2019s identity would have defeated the probable cause finding. Even if the CS\u2019s identity had been disclosed, the affidavit still would contain enough facts to allow the magistrate judge to conclude reasonably that Deering likely possessed firearms at his residence. Furthermore, contrary to Deering\u2019s argument, the disclosure of the CS\u2019s identity, if anything, would have strengthened the government\u2019s application for the search warrant because the magistrate judge was free to infer that a spouse has intimate knowledge of the other spouse\u2019s activities and would not lie about the spouse\u2019s illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>activities. <em>See United States v. Martinelli, </em>454 F.3d 1300, 1307 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[C]ourts have traditionally viewed information drawn from an ordinary witness or crime victim with considerably less skepticism than information derived from anonymous sources.\u201d). Finally, given the level of detail in the information the CS provided, the issuing magistrate judge could have inferred that the CS was someone with close ties to Deering but was not on good terms with him. Therefore, there is nothing in the record that indicates the disclosure of the CS\u2019s identity would have altered the outcome of the probable cause analysis. <em>See Gates </em>462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330 (\u201c[E]ven if we entertain some doubt as to an informant\u2019s motive, his explicit and detailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement that the event was observed first-hand, entitles [the informant\u2019s] tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-12\">.
