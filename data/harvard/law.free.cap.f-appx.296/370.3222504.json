She now appeals. Her attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that Arrowood\u2019s sentence is unreasonable, but concluding that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although informed of her right to do so, Arrowood has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-26\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). In making this decision, we first examine the sentence \u201cfor significant procedural errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There were no such errors in this case; we note that the sentencing court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range, heard from the parties regarding an appropriate sentence, considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008), and articulated compelling reasons for imposing a variance sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. Specifically, the court considered Arrowood\u2019s mental and emotional health and her meager work record and determined that the situation warranted a minor downward variation from the advisory guideline range of 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Our review also requires us to consider the substance of the sentence, taking into account the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Arrowood contends that the court erred by imposing an active prison sentence, particularly given the court\u2019s acknowledgement of her physical and emotional problems. Given the seriousness of the charges to which Arrowood pled guilty, as well as the other circumstances of this case, we find that Arrowood\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable and that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We have examined the entire record in the case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and we find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Arrowood\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
