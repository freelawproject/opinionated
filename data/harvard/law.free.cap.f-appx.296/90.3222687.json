It is</p>\n<p id=\"b114-21\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the convictions of Appellant Jaron Brice be affirmed, and the record remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-22\">Brice\u2019s Rule 404(b) argument is without merit. The evidence that Brice boasted of a prior murder went to the heart of the allegation that he used fear to induce his victims to prostitution. Such \u201cintrinsic\u201d evidence \u2014 \u201coffered as direct evidence of a fact in issue, not as circumstantial evidence requiring an inference regarding the character of the accused\u201d \u2014 necessarily complies with Rule 404(b). <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>331 F.3d 116, 125-26 &amp; n. 13 (D.C.Cir.2003). To the extent that certain evidence of drug dealing was inadvertently presented and did not go directly to the charges presented, the district court addressed the issue with curative instructions. <em>See Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (\u201cWe normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to it....\u201d). Brice\u2019s argument that the expert testimony of Dr. Lee was inappropriate is squarely foreclosed by <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>851 F.2d 384 (D.C.Cir.1988), where we affirmed very similar testimony by Dr. Lee herself. And the district court\u2019s decision to review the minor victim\u2019s medical records and withhold unnecessary information from the defense was well within its discretion and our precedents. <em>See, e.g., United States v. George, </em>532 F.3d 933, 936-38 (D.C.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">As to sentencing, our cases foreclose Brice\u2019s challenge to the use of acquitted conduct, which is within the sentencing court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>516 F.3d 1047, 1050-51 (D.C.Cir. 2008). The government concedes, however, that the district court did not clearly articulate the basis for its two-point enhancement for serious bodily injury under section 2A3.1(b)(4)(B) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The commentary for that section provides that the bodily injury must come from \u201cconduct other than criminal sexual abuse, which already is taken into account in the base offense level,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, cmt. n. 1 (2005), and the district court did not specifically point to any such injury. Accordingly, we remand for further fact-finding on that narrow point, and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
