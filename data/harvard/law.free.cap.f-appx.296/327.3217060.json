The district court sentenced Brooks to 180 months in prison. Brooks timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Brooks first contends that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because, at his plea hearing, both the Government and defense counsel misinformed him regarding his status as an armed career criminal. In order to enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea, a defendant must know the direct consequences of his guilty plea. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); <em>Cuthrell v. Dir., Patuxent Inst., </em>475 F.2d 1364, 1365 (4th Cir.1973). \u201cDirect consequences\u201d are defined \u201cas those having a \u2018definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant v. Cherry, </em>687 F.2d 48, 50 (4th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Cuthrell, </em>475 F.2d at 1366). Under Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(I), a defendant must be informed of any mandatory minimum penalty for his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Although the Government and defense counsel expressed belief at the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing that Brooks was not an armed career criminal, both defense counsel and the magistrate judge noted that it was a possibility and the magistrate judge took great pains to ensure that Brooks understood that he might qualify as an armed career offender and, if he did, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison. Brooks stated at the plea hearing that he understood the situation and he is now bound by his statement. <em>See Beck v. Angelone, </em>261 F.3d 377, 395-96 (4th Cir.2001) (absent \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to the contrary, defendant is bound by statements made under oath at Rule 11 hearing). We therefore find that Brooks\u2019 guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Brooks also argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him that he qualified as an armed career criminal and therefore faced an enhanced penalty. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally are not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring his claims in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2008) motion. <em>Id.; United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate both that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test in the context of a guilty plea, a defendant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Here, the record does not conclusively show that Brooks was denied effective assistance of counsel. Assuming arguendo that counsel was or should have been aware at the time of Brooks\u2019 guilty plea that Brooks qualified for the armed career criminal designation and should have so advised his client, Brooks was not prejudiced by the alleged error. The magistrate judge warned Brooks at the plea hearing that he might be subject to the armed career criminal enhancement and, even with this knowledge, Brooks elected to plead guilty. Because it does not appear conclusively from the record that counsel was ineffective, Brooks\u2019 claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Brooks also asserts that the district court failed to adequately state the reasons for the sentence imposed or to sufficiently consider mitigating circumstances. We find this claim to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">This court reviews the sentence imposed by the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no \u201csignificant\u201d procedural errors, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">If the appellate court concludes that the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d the court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">In this case, the district court correctly calculated the guideline range, treated the guidelines as advisory, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range and at the statutory mandatory minimum. Because the sentence was within the guideline range, we afford it a presumption of reasonableness which Brooks has failed to rebut. <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence). Therefore, we are satisfied that the sentence was reasonable and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">For these reasons, we affirm Brooks\u2019 conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">. Brooks also cursorily asserts that his sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), violates the Sixth Amendment because his prior convictions were not submitted to a jury, proved beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by him. We have previously rejected this argument. <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-16\">. We grants Brooks' motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and find the claims therein to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
