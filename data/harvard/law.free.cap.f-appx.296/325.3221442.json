The district court sentenced him to 360 months of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $300 special assessment. In Taylor\u2019s first appeal, we affirmed his convictions but vacated his sentence and remanded for re-sentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>224 Fed.Appx. 269 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">On remand, the Government did not present any evidence to support an enhancement for Taylor\u2019s role in the offense pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.1 (2000), and the parties agreed that a sentencing range of 188 to 235 months applied. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure for substantial assistance pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and sentenced Taylor to 211 months of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $300 special assessment. On appeal, counsel filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether the district court erred in sentencing Taylor to 211 months of imprisonment. Taylor was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. The Government waived the filing of a brief on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The court considers the totality of the circumstances in assessing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>This court presumes that a sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence). In considering the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, this court reviews factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The district court correctly calculated Taylor\u2019s Guidelines range, which resulted from both the drug quantity determination and Taylor\u2019s status as a career offender, as each yielded a base offense level of thirty-four. The court then reduced its intended sentence of 235 months by twenty-four months to reach its sentence of 211 months. Although counsel suggests that Taylor should have received a greater reduction for his assistance to authorities, he does not provide any specific reasons for this assertion. Moreover, in explaining the Government\u2019s departure motion, the Assistant United States Attorney stated that, although Taylor qualified for a departure, his cooperation was not extensive. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Taylor\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Taylor, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Taylor requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>lous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Taylor. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> <em>Anders v.
