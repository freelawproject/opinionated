Zavilla appeals a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d), <em>Zavilla v. Nicholson, </em>No. 04-236, 20 Vet.App. 447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(Vet.App. Jan. 24, 2006), affirming a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision denying service connection for a back disorder. Because we lack jurisdiction, we <em>dismiss </em>his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Zavilla served in the United States Navy from 1974 to 1976. In 1999, the board granted him service connection for a left knee disability. In February 2004, the board denied service connection for a back disorder. The board determined that: (1) the back condition was not incurred in service, and (2) the disorder was not caused by his service-connected knee disability. On appeal, the Veterans Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Zavilla sets forth many reasons why he believes the decision of the Veterans Court was erroneous. He argues that the court improperly relied on the opinions of \u201cunqualified\u201d medical examiners in concluding that his back disability order was not service connected. He further contends that the court incorrectly found that he suffered no prejudice as a result of an alleged failure to provide adequate notice of the evidence required to substantiate his claims. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Our authority to review a decision of the Veterans Court is limited. We may review such a decision only to the extent that it pertains to the validity of \u201ca rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter),\u201d or \u201cto interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7292(a), 7292(c). Unless an appeal from the Veterans Court presents a constitutional issue, we do not otherwise have jurisdiction to review either \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d or \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Because Zavilla\u2019s appeal involves only challenges to factual determinations and the application of law to the facts of his case, we have no authority to consider it. <em>See Newhouse v. Nicholson, </em>497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed.Cir.2007) (\u201cOur jurisdictional statute ... prevents us from reviewing [a veteran\u2019s] contentions regarding actual prejudice.\u201d); <em>Tetro v. Principi, </em>314 F.3d 1310,1312 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cThis court does not review factual determinations by the [Veterans Court], or its application of law to factual situations.\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
