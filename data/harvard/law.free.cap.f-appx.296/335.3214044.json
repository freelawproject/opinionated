We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008). To the extent that Dioubate claims that the time limitation should have been equitably tolled on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, we find this claim foreclosed in light of our recent holding in <em>Afanwi v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 788, 796-99 (4th Cir.2008) (holding that there is no constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We deny Dioubate\u2019s motion for leave to file supplemental materials. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
