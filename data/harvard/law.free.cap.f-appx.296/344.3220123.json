We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">On appeal, Grant argues that the district court erred by failing to adequately explain its imposition of a sentence that is outside the Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> range. He further contends that his sentence is unnecessary under the circumstances and inconsistent with any reasonable weighing of the court\u2019s sentencing considerations. Grant does not contest the district court\u2019s decision to revoke his supervised release or the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculations. The Government responds that the district court\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Because Grant did not object to the district court\u2019s failure to articulate the reasons for its sentence, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), we held that \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) [West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008] factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d We recognized that analysis of a sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release involves both procedural and substantive components. <em>Id. </em>at 438. A sentencing court must provide a sufficient explanation of the sentence to allow \u201ceffective review of [its] reasonableness\u201d on appeal. <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007) (probation revocation). The court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3353(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Our review of the record in this case leads us to conclude that the district court\u2019s reasons supporting its sentencing decision are sufficiently apparent from the record. We conclude that the sentence is neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 297 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">We therefore affirm Grant\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
