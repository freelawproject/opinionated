We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b786-26\">Betancur applied to the Florida Department of Health in 2004 for a license to practice naturopathy. After the Department of Health denied Betancur\u2019s application, Betancur founded the Naturopathic National Council in Connecticut. The Council purported to be \u201ca national licensing agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-27\">Two years after incorporation, the Council registered its name as a trademark. The Council issued a document stating that Betancur was \u201cnationally licensed\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>a \u201cDoctor of Naturopathy, N.D.\u201d Betaneur, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Council, demanded that the Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee of the Florida Senate \u201ccease and desist\u201d its use of the title \u201cDoctor of Naturopathy.\u201d Betancur asserted \u201cexclusive rights\u201d to the titles \u201cDoctor of Naturopathic Medicine\u201d and \u201cDoctor of Naturopathy, N.D.\u201d Betancur also declared that the Council held the trademark to \u201cNaturopathic National Council, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">State health officials Rony Francois, Timothy Cerio, and Dr. Ana Viamonte Ros told Betaneur that Florida ceased the licensing of naturopaths in 1959, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 462.028, with the exception of seven individuals allowed to practice under a grandfather statute, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 462.2001, and the practice of naturopathy without a state license is a third degree felony, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 462.17(5). Betaneur responded that the Council had exclusive authority to license naturopaths; Florida could not prevent a naturopath from practicing; and the naturopaths who practiced under the grandfather statute held fraudulent licenses. The Council later purportedly licensed several naturopaths, including Jose Canas, a Florida citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Betaneur filed a complaint against the Department of Health, Cerio, Dr. Viamonte Ros, and State Attorney William Meggs. In her third amended complaint, Betaneur sought a declaratory judgment to determine \u201cwhether or not under the Supremacy Clause ... a federal trademark pre-empts an inconsistent state statute or regulation.\u201d Betaneur alleged that Florida violated the Thirteenth Amendment \u201cby forcing [her] and traditional naturopaths ... into involuntary servitude by forcing them out of them profession.\u201d Betaneur also alleged that the Florida officials \u201ccaused trade identity confusion\u201d by using the \u201ctrademarked title Doctor of Naturopathy, N.D. or its derivatives,\u201d <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), and violated her rights under the Tenth and Fourteenth Amendments by denying her a license to practice naturopathy, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The officials moved to dismiss the complaint, and the district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Phoenix of Broward, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>489 F.3d 1156, 1161 (11th Cir.2007). We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Betaneur argues that, when the Council trademarked its name to \u201cissue[ ] occupational licenses to traditional naturopaths,\u201d the Council acquired exclusive rights to license naturopaths and to confer the title \u201cDoctor of Naturopathy, N.D.\u201d She argues that her trademark preempts the authority of Florida to regulate the practice of naturopathy and the continued licensing of several naturopaths violates her trademark. Betaneur also argues that Florida officials violated her civil rights. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">States retain the police power to regulate professions, such as the practice of medicine. <em>Watson v. State of Maryland, </em>218 U.S. 173, 176, 30 S.Ct. 644, 646, 54 L.Ed. 987 (1910) (recognizing the authority of the states to regulate the practice of medicine). Betaneur offers no rational argument that her ownership of the mark \u201cNaturopathic National Council, Inc.\u201d preempts the authority of Florida to regulate and license the practice of naturopathy. Betancur\u2019s complaint of trademark infringement, which is based on her argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ment that the Council has the exclusive right to regulate the practice of naturopathy, also is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Betancur\u2019s complaint that Florida violated her civil rights also fails. The licenses given to several individuals to practice naturopathy under a grandfather clause, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 462.2001, is not an arbitrary or unreasonable regulation that violated Betancur\u2019s right to equal protection. <em>See Watson, </em>218 U.S. at 173, 30 S.Ct. at 646 (exemption for physicians who had six years of practice from registration did not violate equal protection rights of less experienced physicians). Betancur has no right under Florida law to be granted a license and has no liberty or property interest protected by due process. <em>See Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003). Betancur\u2019s final argument that the refusal to license naturopaths deprives her of the opportunity to pursue her livelihood does not, as she contends, implicate the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits forced servitude. <em>United States v. Kozminski, </em>487 U.S. 931, 942, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 2760-61, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The dismissal of Betancur\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
