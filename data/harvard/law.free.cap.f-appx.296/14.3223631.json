Georgalis appeals a decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio granting summary judgment in favor of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). <em>Georgalis v. U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office, </em>No. 1:06-CV-1183 (N.D.Ohio Oct. 10, 2007) <em>(\u201cSummary Judgment Order </em>\u201d). For the following reasons, we <em>affirm-in-part, vacate-in-part, </em>and <em>remand-in-paH.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">On April 26, 1988, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 4,740,967 (\u201cthe '967 patent\u201d) to Georgalis. After timely paying the first maintenance fee due for the '967 patent, Georgalis failed to pay the patent\u2019s second maintenance fee. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(b) (requiring payment of a maintenance fee at 3.5 years, at 7.5 years, and at 11.5 years). Consequently, the '967 patent expired by operation of law on April 26, 1996. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cUnless payment of the applicable maintenance fee is received in the Patent and Trademark Office on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter, the patent will expire as of the end of such grace period.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Approximately eight years later, in October 2004, Georgalis petitioned the USP-TO to reinstate his expired patent. The USPTO denied this petition, finding that Georgalis did not show that his failure to pay the second maintenance fee was unavoidable. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(c)(1) (requiring a showing of unavoidability to reinstate an expired patent after a lapse of more than twenty-four months). Georgalis requested reconsideration, but the USPTO again found that Georgalis\u2019s delay \u201ccannot be regarded as unavoidable within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(c)(1).\u201d <em>Summary Judgment Order </em>at 2 (quoting the USPTO\u2019s reconsideration decision). Georgalis did not pursue an appeal of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">Instead, in 2006, Georgalis filed a separate lawsuit in the Northern District of Ohio against the USPTO. His complaint alleged: (1) an unconstitutional taking without just compensation; (2) that the patent maintenance fee system is unconstitutional; and (3) that the patent maintenance fee reinstatement process is an unconstitutional bill of attainder. <em>Id. </em>After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the USP-TO, ruling that there was no genuine issue of material fact on any of Georgalis\u2019s claims and that the USPTO is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 3-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">Georgalis appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b39-18\">On appeal, the USPTO argues that Georgalis\u2019s claims are time-barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a). This statute of limitations requires \u201cevery civil action com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>menced against the United States [to] be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a). The district court declined to address this argument, finding instead that the USPTO was entitled to summary judgment on the merits. <em>Summary Judgment Order </em>at 4, fn.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">After the district court rendered its decision, however, the Supreme Court ruled that a court <em>must </em>address a jurisdictional statute of limitations. <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 750, 752-54, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008). Specifically, <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel </em>addressed the United States Court of Federal Claims\u2019 statute of limitations, found at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55. While we are presented with a different statute in this case\u2014 \u00a7 2401 rather than \u00a7 2501 \u2014 we conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale applies with equal force because both are \u201cjurisdictional\u201d statutes of limitations. <em>See id. </em>at 753 (noting that statutes \u201climiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity\u201d are jurisdictional in nature); <em>Spannaus v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>824 F.2d 52, 55 (D.C.Cir. 1987) (\u201cUnlike an ordinary statute of limitations, \u00a7 2401(a) is a jurisdictional condition attached to the government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity----\u201d). Accordingly, we must first determine whether the district court possessed jurisdiction to adjudicate Georgalis\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The parties agree that the '967 patent expired in 1996 pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(b) because Georgalis failed to pay the second maintenance fee. Therefore, any claim based on the expiration of Georgalis\u2019s patent- \u2014 i.e., any challenge to \u00a7 41(b)\u2014 first accrued in 1996. Because Georgalis waited approximately ten years (until 2006) to file the instant lawsuit, these claims are time-barred under \u00a7 2401(a). Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear Georgalis\u2019s challenges to \u00a7 41(b), including his assertions that the patent\u2019s expiration was a taking without just compensation and that \u00a7 41(b) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">In an effort to escape the six-year statute of limitations, it appears that Georgalis attempts to recast some of his arguments as a challenge to the patent <em>reinstatement </em>process provided by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(c)(1). While Georgalis may be correct that the district court had jurisdiction over the challenges to \u00a7 41(c)(1), we conclude that the district court correctly decided that the USPTO is entitled to summary judgment on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">First, Georgalis argues that the USP-TO\u2019s denial of his request to reinstate the patent was an unconstitutional taking without just compensation in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Anendment of the Constitution. Because Georgalis cannot (and, in the Reply Brief, does not) challenge the expiration of his patent pursuant to \u00a7 41(b), this argument boils down to an assertion that the government\u2019s failure to <em>give </em>him back the patent is a taking without just compensation. This argument is simply without merit. The Takings Clause \u201cprohibits the government from <em>taking </em>private property for public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 617, 121 S.Ct. 2448,150 L.Ed.2d 592 (2001) (emphasis added). It contains no requirement that the government give property to individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">Second, Georgalis contends that the maintenance fee reinstatement process in \u00a7 41(c)(1) is unconstitutional because it thwarts the Patent Clause of the Constitution.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The substance of Georgalis\u2019s argument, however, is directed only to the alleged unconstitutionality of maintenance fees, which are prescribed by \u00a7 41(b), and not the constitutionality of the patent reinstatement process under \u00a7 41(c)(1). <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(b) &amp; (c)(1). As noted above, the statute of limitations bars Georgalis\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of maintenance fees, and a mere statement that the patent reinstatement process is unconstitutional does not amount to a reviewable argument. <em>See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., </em>439 F.3d 1312, 1320 (Fed.Cir.2006) (\u201cA skeletal \u2018argument,\u2019 really nothing more than an assertion, does not preserve a claim.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Dunkel, </em>927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir.1991))).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Finally, Georgalis asserts that the patent \u201cmaintenance fee reinstatement process is an unconstitutional bill of attainder.\u201d A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts guilt and punishment on a class of individuals without the protections of a judicial trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>381 U.S. 437, 447, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). While Georgalis argues that the patent reinstatement process in \u00a7 41(c)(1) is a bill of attainder, this statutory provision does not contain any punishment, much less one of the punishments prohibited by the bill of attainder clause. <em>See Nixon v. Adm\u2019r of Gen. Servs., </em>433 U.S. 425, 474, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977) (identifying prohibited punishments as \u201cimprisonment, banishment, and the punitive confiscation of property by the sovereign\u201d in addition to \u201ca legislative enactment barring designated individuals or groups from participation in specified employments or vocations\u201d (footnotes omitted)). Accordingly, this argument also has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the USPTO on Georgalis\u2019s claims that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(c) is unconstitutional and effected a taking without just compensation. We vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s opinion granting summary judgment in favor of the USPTO on Georgalis\u2019s claims that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41(b) is unconstitutional and effected a taking without just compensation, and we remand with instructions to dismiss Georgalis\u2019s claims challenging \u00a7 41(b) for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\">.
