He appeals his sentence, contending that the district court plainly erred in awarding two criminal history points for commission of the offense while under a sentence of probation, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(d) (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-24\">Because Ramirez-Ramirez did not object to his criminal history calculation in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (error occurred, which was plain, affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-25\">Two criminal history points are prescribed under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d) \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation.... \u201d Application Note 4 explains that a \u201ccriminal justice sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tence\u201d is any \u201csentence countable under \u00a7 4A1.2 ... having a custodial or supervisory component, although active supervision is not required for this item to apply.\u201d Application Note 4 further provides that \u201c[a] defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding <em>{e.g., </em>a probation ... violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(m) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Ramirez-Ramirez acknowledges that, in applying \u00a7 4Al.l(d), the sentencing court need not consider whether an outstanding warrant is stale or whether state authorities were lax in executing the warrant. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>313 F.3d 1300, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Mateo, </em>271 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>184 F.3d 479, 481 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Elmore, </em>108 F.3d 23, 27-28 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Camilo, </em>71 F.3d 984 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Ramirez-Ramirez relies on the First Circuit\u2019s observation in <em>Camilo </em>that an unreasonable delay in the execution of a warrant might give rise to a due process issue under \u00a7 4Al.l(m), although not in Camilo\u2019s case, because he was responsible for the delay. <em>Camilo, </em>71 F.3d at 988 &amp; n. 7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Ramirez-Ramirez argues that, unlike Camilo, he was not responsible for the delay in the execution of the warrant against him. He contends that the \u00a7 4Al.l(d) enhancement violated due process in his case because (1) he did not have an opportunity to have the warrant set aside because he was deported immediately after he finished serving his prison sentence; (2) he did not willfully fail to appear in court but was prevented by his incarceration on another charge; (3) state authorities issued another warrant when the original warrant expired while he was in prison; and (4) state authorities could have discovered his location in prison and executed the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Because the district court was not required to consider the circumstances surrounding the warrant outstanding against Ramirez-Ramirez at the time of the instant offense, Ramirez-Ramirez has not identified any error on the part of the district court in adopting that recommendation in the presentence report. We conclude that the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in determining Ramirez-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history, and no due process violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\"> The First Circuit later held that, \"in determining whether to add criminal history points under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d), a sentencing court ordinarily is not required to look beyond the face of the state-court record, but, rather, may give weight to an outstanding warrant without inquiring into the validity of that warrant.\u201d <em>Mateo, </em>271 F.3d at 16 (noting that <em>Camilo </em>only \u201cleft open the question of whether defects in a state warrant process might be considered by the sentencing court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
