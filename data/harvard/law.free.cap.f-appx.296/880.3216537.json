Restrepo contends that substantial evidence supports neither the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination nor its alternative determination that Restrepo failed to establish statutory eligibility for asylum, withholding of removability, or protection under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">On June 17, 2002, Restrepo, a native and citizen of Colombia, arrived in the United States on a non-immigrant visa with authorization to remain in the country until December 17, 2002. On or about December 3, 2002, Restrepo filed a timely application for asylum, contending that the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) would kill her if she returned to Colombia. Restrepo stated that she was forced to flee Colombia after receiving death threats from FARC guerillas due to her involvement with an alternative political movement, \u201cAlternative Movement Only One Color Remedios\u201d (\u201cAlternative Movement\u201d), which included supporting a mayoral campaign in her hometown of Remedios in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">On January 22, 2003, Restrepo was served with a notice to appear, charging that she was removable, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States for a period longer than permitted. On May 13, 2004, Restrepo appeared before an IJ and, through counsel, conceded removability and sought relief from removal in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Restrepo was the sole witness at the hearing on her application for relief and testified as follows. In 2001 Restrepo began collaborating with the Liberal Party and was the coordinator of the campaign \u201cLos Del Lelos,\u201d whereby she would travel to the farms around Remedios every eight days and encourage the farmers to resist FARC by supporting Jario Hugo Escobar\u2019s mayoral campaign. Restrepo \u201cwas the person most centered on\u201d Escobar\u2019s campaigning among the farmers because the farmers all knew her from when she traveled to the villages with her father, who had been a well-known political leader in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">FARC began to harass her because of her involvement Escobar\u2019s campaign. On December 14, 2001, members of FARC stopped Restrepo\u2019s car, searched her, and seized several documents, including her Liberal Party provisional identification card and other documents related to Escobar\u2019s campaign. On February 12, 2002, an armed guerilla came to Escobar\u2019s political headquarters in Remedios with a message for Restrepo from the Fourth Front of FARC. The guerilla told Restrepo that she should not go back to the farms to carry out her \u201cshitty politicking.\u201d On March 9, 2002, Restrepo received a telephone call from a man identifying himself as an acquaintance of her father\u2019s warning her that FARC was planning to kill her. That evening, Restrepo went to hide at her family\u2019s farm. When she arrived, she found her brother and two employees beaten and tied up, and the house had been ransacked by FARC. Restrepo did not report this incident to the authorities because she believed that the guerillas had infiltrated the farm. The next day, she and her brother fled to Medellin and Restrepo went into hiding at a relative\u2019s house. But FARC soon found her in Medellin and would call her and leave threatening messages. The anxiety and emotional harm caused by these threats led Restrepo to seek therapy three or four times a week. Eventually, these threats drove Restrepo to flee the county; Restrepo fears that FARC will harm her if she returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The IJ denied Restrepo\u2019s claims for relief, finding that her testimony was not credible. In particular, the IJ took issue with three perceived defects in Restrepo\u2019s testimony. The first was the date of the mayoral election. At the hearing, Restrepo testified that the election was held on October 29, 2002. This was inconsistent with a letter from Escobar, which was included in Restrepo\u2019s application for asylum, which was dated October 15, 2002 and stated that the elections occurred on June 30. When the IJ confronted Restrepo with this inconsistency, she testified that there had been an interim mayoral election in June but maintained that the election she worked on with Escobar was on October 29. When the IJ continued to ask about the elections on June 30, Restrepo was unable to explain what the interim election was for, or what the result was, stating only that it was \u201cthe other.\u201d In his-oral opinion, the IJ stated the he felt it was reasonable to expect someone so involved in a campaign to know the date of the election. Further, the IJ was troubled by the fact that Restrepo could not remember the last name of the doctor who treated her for anxiety and stress in Medellin, and further, that when Restrepo sought treatment in the United States for her nervous condition, she did not tell her treating neurologist about any of the harassment she suffered in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The IJ found that Restrepo had failed to provide sufficient credible testimony to support her claims for relief. The IJ also made an alternative ruling that, even assuming Restrepo was telling the truth, the harassment she suffered was insufficient to establish eligibility for asylum, withholding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>of removal, or relief under CAT. In his alternative holding, the IJ found that Restrepo\u2019s allegations of harassment were insufficient N establish past persecution. Further, he found that her claim for a well-founded fear of future persecution was undermined by the fact that Restrepo\u2019s mother and siblings have lived in Colombia unharmed since her departure. Restrepo appealed to the BIA, which affirmed both the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and his alternative ruling that Restrepo\u2019s allegations failed to meet the statutory requirements for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case the BIA issued a written opinion that did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion but did adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, we will review the BIA\u2019s opinion, as well as the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>any legal determinations by the BIA, but we review its factual determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). As we have repeatedly recognized, the substantial evidence test is highly deferential, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cFindings of fact made by the Immigration Judge may be reversed by this Court only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2006) (alterations and quotation marks omitted). Credibility determinations are findings of fact reviewed under the substantial evidence test and \u201c[we] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. Further, \u201cwe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Restrepo contends that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the IJ found virtually all of her testimony consistent, except for two unimportant details: the date of the mayoral election in which she was involved and the last name of the therapist who treated her in Medellin. She further contends that she established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her past persecution by FARC. The government responds that the BIA properly affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the IJ provided specific, cogent reasons for his determination and the record does not compel reversal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">An alien present in the United States may be granted asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afu\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that she is a refugee. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">To be eligible for asylum based on the applicant\u2019s political opinion, the applicant must offer \u201cspecific, detailed facts\u201d showing that she will be <em>\u201csingled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 those political beliefs. <em>Id. </em>Demonstrating past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Although an applicant\u2019s credible testimony may be sufficient to justify eligibility for asylum, \u201c[i]f the applicant produces no evidence other than his testimony, an adverse credibility determination is alone sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d, 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). When making an adverse credibility determination, an IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for that determination. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, where an applicant submits evidence in addition to her own testimony, the IJ must also consider that evidence and may not deny an application based \u201csolely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cm. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Here, the IJ offered specific, cogent reasons for his adverse credibility determination. First, the IJ was justifiably troubled by Restrepo\u2019s testimony that the mayoral elections took place on October 29, 2002, when Escobar\u2019s letter stated that they took place on June 30, as well as her inability to explain that discrepancy. According to the IJ, it would be reasonable \u201cto assume that an individual with her background would recall that date[,] having spoken to farmers on a once a week basis\u201d in support of the campaign. The IJ also listed Restrepo\u2019s inability to remember the name of the therapist who treated her in Medellin as further calling into question both the veracity of her claims and the authenticity of the documents that she submitted in support of her claim. Thus, it appears that the IJ reviewed all of the evidence submitted by Restrepo, although he did so in light of his belief that Restrepo was not a credible witness. Our review of the record reveals that Restrepo\u2019s testimony was often difficult to follow and internally inconsistent. This may have been because Restrepo\u2019s story was fabricated to some extent or it may have been because Restrepo was nervous, confused, and testifying through an interpreter. Reviewing a cold record, we simply cannot tell. We must defer to the IJ\u2019s conclusions in that regard. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to affirming the agency\u2019s decision, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Given that determination, nothing in the record compels us to overturn the BIA\u2019s holding that Restrepo failed to establish a well-founded fear of future prosecution. Because we accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we need not consider the IJ\u2019s alternative finding that, even assuming Restrepo\u2019s allegations were true, they were insufficient to satisfy the requirements for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Turning to Restrepo\u2019s claim for withholding of removal, we conclude that she cannot show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that her life or freedom would be threatened upon her return to Colombia. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>We have recognized that \u201c[t]his standard is more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. And we have repeatedly held that where an applicant failed to satisfy the lesser standard for asylum, the applicant cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>See, e.g., id.; see also Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Finally, Restrepo cannot prevail on her claim for relief under the CAT. To be eligible for relief under the CAT, Restrepo must demonstrate that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that she will be tortured upon her return to Colombia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Further, the torture must be \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1239 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting 8 \u00a7 C.F.R. 208.18(a)(1)). Although it is clear from the State Department\u2019s Country Report on Colombia\u2019s human rights practices that FARC has a significant presence in Colombia and a history of widespread violence and intimidation, we have previously held that an applicant cannot establish relief under the CAT based on the conduct of FARC. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1239 (citing <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Accepting the credibility determination of the IJ, the record does not compel us to reverse the BIA\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
