He was sentenced to a term of 310 months imprisonment. Fugit appeals his sentence, arguing that (1) the district court erred in making two-level enhancements for distribution and use of a computer, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), (b)(6) (2007); (2) the district court erred in making a five-level enhancement for en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>gaging in a pattern of behavior involving sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor, USSG \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5); and (3) the sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AbH\">Fugit first maintains that the base offense level set out in \u00a7 2G2.2 accounted for his distribution of child pornography and use of a computer to do so because those two actions were charged in the indictment. Therefore, he argues that the enhancements amounted to impermissible double counting. The district court\u2019s interpretation of a guideline is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 195 (4th Cir.2000) (issue that turns primarily on legal interpretation of guidelines is reviewed de novo); <em>see also United States v. Butner, </em>277 F.3d 481, 488 (4th Cir.2002) (where facts not contested, issue is legal one and review is de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">Double counting of sentencing factors is generally permitted under the guidelines unless expressly prohibited. <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 158-60 (4th Cir.2004). Here, the district court correctly noted that \u00a7 2G2.2, the base offense level applicable to the offense of conviction, did not account for Fugit\u2019s distribution of child pornography or his use of a computer because \u00a7 2G2.2 covers many different offenses, a number of which could be committed without distribution or use of a computer. The guideline accounts for the particular acts a defendant has committed by means of the specific offense characteristics enhancements set out in \u00a7 2G2.2(b). Therefore, no double counting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AVP\">The district court\u2019s determination that Fugit engaged in a pattern of activity involving sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor is also a legal issue which is reviewed de novo. <em>Kinter, </em>235 F.3d at 195. Fugit contends that his history of computer chats and prior telephone calls to minors does not constitute \u201csexual abuse or exploitation\u201d as defined in Application Note 1. He argues that, apart from the count of coercion and enticement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422 to which he pled guilty, none of the conduct described in the Presentence report falls within any of the statutes listed in Application Note 1, and that the district court erred in 80 fmdinS(Appellant s Br. at 27). He relies on <em>United States v. Pharis, </em>176 F.3d 434, 436 (8th Cir.1999), which held that four obscene telephone calls to young girls and a conviction for child molestation involving exposure \u00b0t [the defendant\u2019s] genital area to three female children on separate occasions\u201d did not amount to sexual abuse or exploitation under the definition then contained in Application Note 1, which did not include coercion or enticement as described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422.</p>\n<p id=\"AL9\">However, in 2004, Amendment 664 revised \u00a7 2G2.2 and its commentary. The definition of \u201csexual abuse or exploitation\u201d in use when Fugit was sentenced includes conduct described in \u00a7 2422 (coercion or enticement), <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.l), making Fugit\u2019s reliance on <em>Pharis </em>inapposite. In this case, the district court did not err in finding a pattern of activity involving sexual abuse or exploitation because the telephone call underlying the \u00a7 2422 count to which Fugit pled guilty was very similar to the prior computer chats and telephone calls that were the basis for the enhancement. Fugit\u2019s contention of error is thus without merit,</p>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">Last&gt; Fugit contends that his sentence is greater than necessary and) therefore, unreasonable. A sentence is reviewed for reasonableness, applying an abuse of dis-cretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008). The appellate court must first determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>S.Ct. at 597, and then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, applying a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the guideline range. <em>Go, </em>517 F.3d at 218; <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding this court\u2019s presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Fugit argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence within the guideline range that was greater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense and satisfy the sentencing goals. He claims that the court applied a presumption of reasonableness to the guideline sentence when it refused his request for a downward departure. The record does not support this claim. In fact, the court noted that Fugit had not shown any grounds for a downward departure and was thus not entitled to a departure. The court then observed that Fugit was really requesting a variance. The court considered whether a variance was warranted, and decided that it was not, stating that, \u201c[a]lthough the defendant can make a compelling case that the guidelines as calculated for these types of offenses are draconian, ... the facts in this particular case are, in my opinion, particularly egregious.\u201d The court discussed the details of the offense, said it had considered the positive facts in Fugit\u2019s history and the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and then concluded that a variance was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Fugit asserts that the court failed to consider adequately his history and characteristics, and that the guidelines for child pornography offenses overstate the seriousness of the offense and provide unjustly harsh sentences. He also asserts that the district court failed to consider adequately the need to avoid sentencing disparity among defendants convicted of similar conduct, as evidenced by four cases submitted to the court by Fugit in which lower sentences were imposed for child pornography offenses. Although the district court discussed the cases and distinguished them, Fugit argues that the court did not explain why a higher sentence was called for in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">However, \u201cwhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. Fugit has not shown any procedural or substantive error in the sentence and we conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
