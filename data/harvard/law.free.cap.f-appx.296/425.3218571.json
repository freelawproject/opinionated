Godoy-Jimenez contends that the district court erred in applying an eight-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on his two prior state convictions for possession of a controlled substance. Citing <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Godoy-Jimenez argues that the eight-level enhancement was not warranted because he was not convicted as a recidivist for the second state conviction for possession of a controlled substance and therefore that the offense did not qualify as an aggravated felony under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\"><em>Lopez </em>has not altered our holding in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572 (5th Cir.2005), that a second state conviction for simple possession qualifies as an aggravated felony sufficient to support the imposition of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, regardless of how Godoy-Jimenez\u2019s state possession offense would be characterized under state law, his second state conviction for possession is punishable as an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes. <em>See id.; Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-20\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
