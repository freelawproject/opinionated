Christman brought a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging deprivation of his Fourth Amendment and due process rights when Pietrzak arrested him for DUI. The district court granted Pietrzak\u2019s motion for summary judgment, based on qualified immunity. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">On 17 August 2005, Christman was pulled over by Officer Cotterman, another officer with the Port St. Lucie Police Department. Cotterman was responding to a 911 call about a white Mustang being driven in an erratic fashion when Christman, driving a white Mustang, nearly collided with Cotterman\u2019s patrol car. Pietrzak appeared at the scene shortly thereafter, approached Christman\u2019s vehicle, asked him for his paperwork, and performed a field sobriety test. The field sobriety test was videotaped. During the course of the stop, Pietrzak observed many indicators suggesting that Christman was intoxicated. Pietrzak noted that Christman smelled strongly of an alcoholic beverage, his speech was slurred and his eyes were bloodshot and watery. When exiting his vehicle in order to execute the field sobriety test, Christman stumbled and nearly fell to the ground. Prior to the sobriety test, Christman denied having any physical problems or medical conditions. R2-70, Exh. B at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">After failing the roadside field sobriety test, Christman was arrested at the scene. Pietrzak attested in his affidavit that, following the arrest, he \u201cread Mr. Christman the implied consent law, however, Mr. Christman refused to submit to a breath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Christman denied that Pietrzak read him the implied consent law and claimed that Pietrzak refused his offer to undergo blood or urine tests at the police station after his arrest. R 1-19 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Christman filed a \u00a7 1983 claim with the district court against Pietrzak and Bobby Beams, a hearing officer with the Bureau of Administrative Reviews of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, related to his DUI arrest and the subsequent suspension of his driver\u2019s license. In his complaint, Christman also raised an issue regarding medical treatment, contending that law enforcement\u2019s priority is the DUI investigation procedure and not providing medical care. Christ-man claimed that his erratic driving and behavior may have been the result of a medical condition, \u201ccardiac problems,\u201d although he offered no evidence to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Pietrzak and Beams each filed a motion for summary judgment. Both claimed qualified immunity and cited Christman\u2019s failure to state a claim under which relief can be granted under \u00a7 1983. The magistrate judge recommended to the district court that both motions for summary judgment be granted. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granted summary judgment for both Pietrzak and Beams, finding that Pietrzak was entitled to qualified immunity and that Beams was entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity. The district court found no merit in Christ-man\u2019s medical health claim, noting the lack of any evidence that Christman had an actual cardiac condition or was suffering from one at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Christman now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Pietrzak.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Christman raises three arguments on appeal: (1) the district court erred in granting summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact which precludes summary judgment; (2) Pietrzak was not entitled to qualified immunity; and (3) Pietrzak deprived Christman of his due process rights by ignoring his offer to take a blood or urine test at the police station following his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding summary judgment on a \u00a7 1983 claim <em>de novo. Cagle v. Sutherland, </em>334 F.3d 980, 985 (11th Cir.2003)(per curium). We use the same legal standards as the district court and draw evidentiary inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>We now address each of Christman\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">A. <em>Whether a Genuine Issue of Material Fact Precluded the District Court from Granting Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">A moving party is entitled to summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact, leaving final judgment to be decided as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56; <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355-56, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The facts, and any reasonable inferences therefrom, are to be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, with any doubt resolved in the non-movant\u2019s favor. <em>See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1609, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). Once met by the moving party, however, the burden shifts to the non-moving party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>to come forward with evidence to establish each element essential to that party\u2019s case sufficient to sustain a jury verdict. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Earley v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.1990). In addition, the non-moving party\u2019s evidence on rebuttal must be significantly probative and not based on mere assertion or be merely colorable. <em>See </em>Rule 56(e); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All </em>U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Christman has not met his burden as the non-moving party. He argues that Pietrzak did not offer him a Breathalyzer test at the scene on 17 August 2005. This directly contrasts with Pietrzak\u2019s assertion in his affidavit that he both read Christ-man the implied consent law and offered him a breathalyzer test. Christman points to no evidence supporting his version of events, in the form of an affidavit or otherwise, other than a recitation of allegations in his amended pleading. Given the complete lack of evidence in support of Christ-man\u2019s argument, the district court properly disregarded Christman\u2019s argument that the previously discussed discrepancy constituted a genuine issue of material fact precluding the district court from granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">B. <em>Whether Pietrzak was Entitled to Qualified Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>government official who is sued under \u00a7 1983 may seek summary judgment on the ground that he is entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Crosby v. Monroe County, </em>394 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2004). Eligibility for qualified immunity is a well-settled area of the law in this circuit. We have held that \u201c[t]o be eligible for qualified immunity, ... [an] official must first establish that he was performing a \u2018discretionary function\u2019 at the time the alleged violation of federal law occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>In order to do so, \u201cthe plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the defendant has committed a constitutional violation and (2) that the constitutional right the defendant violated was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time he did it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Pietrzak met the threshold requirement for qualified immunity \u2014 establishing that he was performing a discretionary function at the time the alleged violation of federal law occurred. Making an arrest is clearly within the official responsibilities of a police officer. <em>Id. </em>We now turn to the question of whether qualified immunity entitled Pietrzak to summary judgment insofar as the Fourth Amendment and due process claims brought against him are concerned. First, we address Christman\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The district court correctly characterizes \u201carguable probable cause\u201d as dis-positive to questions of both Pietrzak\u2019s claim of qualified immunity and Christ-man's Fourth Amendment rights. R2-81 at 6. It is well established in our circuit that when there is \u201carguable probable cause for an arrest,\u201d \u201cqualified immunity applies\u201d \u201ceven if actual probable cause did not exist.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>394 F.3d at 1332; <em>Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1283 n. 3 (11th Cir.l999)(\u201cArguable probable cause, not the higher standard of actual probable cause, governs the qualified immunity inquiry.\u201d). The record in this case contains ample evidence that Pietrzak met the standard of arguable probable cause for an arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted by the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>there was the interview with the private citizen who called in the 911 report, Officer Cotterman\u2019s observations of erratic driving and physical signs of intoxication, Pietrzak\u2019s own observations of physical signs of intoxication, Christman\u2019s denial of any medical condition, and the failed roadside sobriety test.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">As Pietrzak clearly had arguable probable cause to arrest Christman, Christman\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. As such, Christman\u2019s challenge of Pietrzak\u2019s entitlement to qualified immunity as regards his Fourth Amendment argument fails on the first prong and the inquiry need go no further. We now consider Christman\u2019s final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">C. <em>Whether Pietrzak Deprived Christ-man of his Due Process Rights by Ignoring his Offer to Take a Blood or Urine Test at the Police Station Following his Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Christman argues that Pietrzak ignored his request to take a blood or urine test at the police station following his arrest. He reasons that such a test, if performed, would have provided objective evidence that he was not intoxicated at the time of his arrest and so the subsequent one-year suspension of his driver\u2019s licence would not have occurred. Thus, Christ-man argues, Pietrzak violated his due process rights. Furthermore, Christman argues that Pietrzak was not entitled to qualified immunity as regards his due process claim because Pietrzak was not exercising a discretionary function when he ignored Christman\u2019s request to take the blood or urine test.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Christman\u2019s argument is misplaced. Although more properly styled as a procedural due process claim, our analysis need not proceed that far.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pietrzak was entitled to qualified immunity when he arrested Christman at the scene on 17 August 2005. The district court correctly found that Pietrzak was not accountable for the constitutionality or the conduct of any of the proceedings against Christman as a consequence of his DUI arrest. R2-81 at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Christman appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Pietrzak. Christman argued both that the district court overlooked a genuine issue of material fact and that Pietrzak was not entitled to qualified immunity concerning his Fourth Amendment and due process claims. We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision is without error. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">.
