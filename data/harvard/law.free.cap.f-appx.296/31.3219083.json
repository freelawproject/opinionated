Footland appeals a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board dismissing his two appeals for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Footland v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>Nos. DC-3443-07-0595-I-1, <em>7 </em>DC-3443-07-0614-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Dec. 19, 2007). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"At7\">Footland is employed as a patent examiner at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). In May 2007, he filed two appeals challenging the USPTO\u2019s failure to select him for positions ag a Quajjty Assurance Examiner and an Administrative Patent Judge. Footland alleged that the USPTO did not select him for these positions because it improperly gave preference to minority and female candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"A1p\">In a decision dated August 30, 2007, an administrative judge determined that the board lacked jurisdiction over Footland\u2019s appeals. This decision became the final decision of the board when the board denied Footland\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"AcP\">Whether the board has jurisdiction over , . ,. . . ,, , an appeal is a question of law that we . 7 <em>t i j. n/r 'j. a </em>review <em>de novo. Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed.Cir.2008). The board\u2019s jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been granted jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <em>Id </em>Because no law&gt; rale or regulation gives the board jurisdiction over a non-selection for promotion, the board properly dismissed Footland\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512 (describing appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>personnel actions); <em>Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed.Cir.1993) (\u201c[N]o law, rule, or regulation authorizes a direct appeal to the Board respecting a nonseleetion for promotion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Footland contends that the board has jurisdiction over his appeal because 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104(a) gives it authority to review an agency\u2019s \u201cemployment practices.\u201d That regulation, however, expressly limits the board\u2019s jurisdiction to employment practices that are applied or administered by the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d). <em>See Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed.Cir.1998). As the administrative judge correctly determined, Footland failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that OPM had any involvement with the USPTO\u2019s alleged practice of granting preferences to women and minorities when making promotion decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Footland argues that the administrative judge should have ordered the board to conduct a study of the federal civil service. We disagree. Although the board has authority to conduct studies of the civil service, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(a)(3), an individual has no right to compel the board to conduct such studies. We have considered Footland\u2019s remaining arguments, but find them unpersuasive.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
