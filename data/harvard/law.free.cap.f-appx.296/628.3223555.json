GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Joseph Flores, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit against defendants, alleging his constitutional rights were violated when prison officials failed to transfer him to voluntary segregation and he was thereafter assaulted by fellow inmates. The magistrate judge assigned to this case recommended that the suit be dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, pursuant to 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1997e(a). After entertaining Mr. Flores\u2019s objections, the district court ultimately adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, Jernigan, v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2002); aware that Mr. Flores is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we review his pleadings and other papers with special solicitude. <em>Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007). Even with these standards in mind, we find ourselves compelled to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">Under applicable prison administrative procedures, Mr. Flores was required to take certain steps to secure voluntary segregation. <em>See </em>New Mexico Corrections Department Policy CD-143001, R. at 138-39. Pertinent to this case, Mr. Flores was obliged to file a written request for voluntary segregation and, in that request, he had to identify the prisoners who, he thought, constituted a threat to him. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Flores refused to name those he feared might attack him, on the ground that he did not wish to be a \u201crat[ ]\u201d <em>see </em>Compl., R. at 9, and in accordance with its procedures, <em>see </em>CD-143001, R. at 138-39, the prison declined to act on Mr. Flores\u2019s request for voluntary segregation. Notably, Mr. Flores\u2019s appellate brief does not discuss, let alone contest, any of this but proceeds instead to argue the merits of his constitutional claims. Before us, then, it is undisputed that Mr. Flores failed to exhaust the procedures available to him to secure voluntary segregation and, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1997e(a), we must affirm the dismissal of his lawsuit. Congress has firmly instructed that no claim may be brought in federal court unless all \u201cavailable\u201d administrative remedies are exhausted, <em>id., </em>and this remains true even if \u201cthe relief sought \u2014 monetary damages \u2014 cannot be granted by the administrative process,\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 85,126 S.Ct. 2378,165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Separately, we grant Mr. Flores\u2019s motion to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>filing fee in partial payments, but he is reminded that he must continue making payments until the full balance of the appellate filing fee in this matter is paid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\">. <em>After </em>the assault in question, Mr. Flores did file a complete application seeking voluntary segregation naming those fellow inmates he feared, but his lawsuit includes no complaint about the disposition of this later application or any treatment he received from prison officials or fellow inmates after he completed it. In fact, it appears that, after Mr. Flores completed the administrative process available to him, he was promptly granted voluntary segregation. R. at 250-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
