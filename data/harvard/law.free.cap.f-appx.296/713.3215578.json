Because Mondier has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses\u2019 this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Mondier was convicted by an Oklahoma jury of endeavoring or attempting to manufacture a controlled drug, unlawful possession of a controlled drug, maintaining a place resorted to by users of controlled drugs, and unlawful possession of a radio set capable of receiving police frequencies. He brought a direct appeal in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d), raising twelve claims of error. The OCCA denied relief on all claims except a double jeopardy claim and two claims related to Mondier\u2019s conviction and sentence for maintaining a place resorted to by users of controlled drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Mondier then filed three applications for state post-conviction relief. All three were denied. He filed the instant \u00a7 2254 federal habeas petition on August 16, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his federal petition, Mondier raised eleven claims of error, including numerous due process claims relating to his prosecution and trial, ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and a claim of factual innocence. Specifically, Mondier alleged: (1) he is factually innocent, (2) the drug-identification protocol used by the prosecution violated due process, (3) he was convicted on the basis of a duplicitous information sheet, (4) he was tried and convicted based on a defective and invalid complaint, (5) the burden of proof was unconstitutionally shifted to him, (6) prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial, (7) the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on a lesser included offense, (8) the trial court failed to give his counsel adequate time to prepare for trial, (9) his trial counsel was ineffective, (10) his appellate counsel was ineffective, and (11) his due process and equal protection rights were violated by Oklahoma\u2019s appellate and post-conviction procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Applying the standard set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the district court concluded the OCCA\u2019s adjudication of three of Mondier\u2019s claims was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The court next determined that Mondier\u2019s claim relating to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on a lesser included offense did not raise a federal constitutional question. <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004). Finally, the court concluded Mondier\u2019s remaining claims were procedurally defaulted in Oklahoma state court. The court determined it was procedurally barred from considering the claims because Mondier failed to show cause for the default and actual prejudice or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>failure to review his claims would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In his appellate brief, Mondier presents nineteen arguments, including assertions he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and the district court improperly denied him the right to amend his federal habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be entitled to a COA, Mondier must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted); <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (holding that when a district court dismisses a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a petitioner is entitled to a COA only if he shows both that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether he had stated a valid constitutional claim and debatable whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct). In evaluating whether Mondier has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Mondier need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">This court has reviewed Mondier\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s orders, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes that Mondier is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Mondier\u2019s claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Because Mondier\u2019s claims were capable of being resolved on the record, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Torres v. Mullin, </em>317 F.3d 1145, 1161 (10th Cir. 2003). Further, the district court did not err in refusing to permit Mondier to amend his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition because the claims he sought to add were time barred. Neither did the court err in concluding it was prohibited by Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b) from granting Mondier\u2019s motion for extension of time to file a Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Because Mondier has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d he is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This court denies Mondier\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">. Mondier filed a fourth application for post-conviction relief on June 18, 2007. He then filed a motion seeking to amend his \u00a7 2254 petition to include claims raised in that fourth application. The district court denied the motion. This court subsequently denied Mondier\u2019s request for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. To the extent Mondier attempts to raise new claims not properly presented to the district court, we do not consider those claims. <em>Parker v. Scott, </em>394 F.3d 1302, 1307 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
