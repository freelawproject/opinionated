For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-20\">Since we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with this case, we need not recite the factual or procedural history in detail. Boone argues that his conviction should be vacated because of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and because the district court erred in assessing criminal history points for a juvenile probation in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">Since Boone did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing, we review for plain error. In order to show plain error, Boone must show: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, we may exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>cise our discretion to address the error if, (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) Error is plain when it is clear or obvious. Error affects substantial rights of the accused if it affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Boone\u2019s intent was the central issue at trial. During the trial, the district court repeatedly instructed the prosecutor not to elicit testimony about that ultimate issue. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Evid. 704(b) (\u201cNo expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto. Such ultimate issues are matters for the trier of fact alone.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Detective Palmer was called as a witness for the prosecution and testified that Boone did not possess the drugs in question in a manner that was consistent with personal use. In referring to that testimony during the closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that the government\u2019s expert had testified that \u201cthese [drugs] were possessed with intent to deliver.\u201d Boone argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing constituted plain error and that the statement was sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial. The government maintains that the prosecutor was merely summarizing Detective Palmer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Although we agree that the prosecutor\u2019s closing could have been more carefully worded, the record simply does not support a finding that that single statement was so egregious as to affect the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770,123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The statement constituted only a single sentence in a lengthy closing, and trial counsel did not think it sufficiently egregious to warrant an objection at the time. <em>See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 238, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940) (\u201c[c]ounsel for the defense cannot as a rule remain silent, interpose no objections, and after a verdict has been returned seize for the first time on the point that the comments to the jury were improper and prejudicial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Moreover, the district court explicitly informed the jury that the closing arguments were not to be considered as evidence. \u201cOur theory of trial relies upon the ability of a jury to follow instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Newby, </em>11 F.3d 1143, 1147 (3d cir.1993). Accordingly, Boone cannot satisfy his burden of showing that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Boone also argues that the district court erred in factoring his juvenile offenses into the Guideline calculation. He claims that the record does not establish a sentence of confinement for the juvenile transgressions. However, since Boone did not contest the PSR\u2019s conclusions when asked if he had any objection, the sentencing court was entitled to accept the factual conclusions in the PSR as established fact. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A). <em>See also, United States v. Iglesias, </em>535 F.3d 150 (3d Cir.2008); and <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>477 F.3d 87 (3d Cir.2008). Accordingly, any challenge to the trial court\u2019s reliance on the juvenile convictions has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">For the reasons noted above, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
