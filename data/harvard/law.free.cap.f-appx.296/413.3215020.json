The district court held that Westerby\u2019s complaint was barred by the limitations period. Westerby has failed to brief the limitations issue on appeal, and, therefore, its review is waived. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Westerby\u2019s motion to remand the case is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">Westerby\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is, thus, frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir. 1983). Accordingly, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Westerby is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
