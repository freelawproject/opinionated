The district court held that Coleman failed to allege facts in support of his claim that he was the subject of retaliatory disciplinary action and certified that Coleman\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">Our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith and the appeal is frivolous, we may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Although Coleman contends that, \u201cafter [he] filed litigation against prison officials, [the defendants] retaliated against [him] with false disciplinary punishment,\u201d he fails to provide specific facts to establish a claim of retaliation or from which a retaliatory motive may be inferred. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161,1166 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Whittington v. Lynaugh, </em>842 F.2d 818, 819 (5th Cir.1988). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Coleman has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Accordingly, Coleman\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Coleman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Coleman has one previous strike. <em>Coleman v. Wortham, </em>No. 5:00-CV-181-C (N.D.Tex. Aug. 17, 2001), <em>aff'd, </em>2002 WL 1860327 at *1 (5th Cir. June 18, 2002). Because Coleman has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
