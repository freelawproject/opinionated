PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">Appellant Nikka Callieoatt appeals from an order of the magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny her third application for social security disability and supplemental security income benefits, arguing that the administrative law judge (ALJ) improperly failed to consider her obesity in combination with her other impairments. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">Appellant was born in January 1963, making her forty-five years old now. Aplt. App., Yol. II at 344. She has a high school education. <em>Id. </em>at 346. Her past work included light and medium work as a convenience store cashier and house cleaner. <em>Id. </em>at 365-66. She filed her third application for disability benefits in January 2004, asserting a disability beginning on December 4, 2000, due to \u201crheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, depression, reflux disease, and hypothyroidism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. An April 2004 summary of her application shows that she was 5'3\" tall and weighed 230 pounds, but this report also shows that she did not claim obesity as one of the \u201cillnesses, injuries or conditions that limit[ed her] ability to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">After a hearing, the ALJ found at step two that appellant had severe impairments of \u201cdiabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, and degenerative joint disease of the bilateral hips[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26 (finding 3). He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>decided that her other claimed impairments, \u201crheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, reflux disease, and depression,\u201d were not severe. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. He concluded at step three that her impairments did not meet or equal any listings because \u201c[n]o treating or examining physician has mentioned findings equivalent in severity to the criteria of any listed impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. He found at step four that appellant could perform a full range of sedentary work, but that this precluded her return to her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>at 25. At step five, he relied conclusively on Rule 201.28 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, for the conclusion that there were other jobs that appellant could do. <em>See </em>Aplt.App., Vol. II at 25-26. The ALJ did not mention appellant\u2019s weight in his decision. <em>See id. </em>at 18-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">This court \u201creviews the ALJ\u2019s decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Salazar v. Barnhart, </em>468 F.3d 615, 621 (10th Cir. 2006). \u201cThe scope of our review, however, is limited to the issues the claimant properly preserves in the district court and adequately presents on appealf.]\u201d <em>Berna v. Chater, </em>101 F.3d 631, 632 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Appellant challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision in only one respect: she argues that he committed reversible legal error by failing to consider her obesity in combination with her other impairments, citing Social Security Ruling 02-01p, 2000 WL 628049, and the corresponding regulation at 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 1.00Q. Although she never specified obesity as one of the conditions limiting her ability to work, she contends that under the ruling, the regulation, and this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Grogan v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir.2005), and <em>Salazar, </em>468 F.3d 615, the ALJ had a duty to consider that condition because its presence was evident from references to her height and weight in the medical record.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">There are, indeed, references to appellant\u2019s high weight in the medical records. We believe, however, that even if an ALJ has an affirmative legal duty to consider a claimant\u2019s obesity when it was not asserted by the claimant \u2014 a point we need not and do not decide-the error was harmless in this case. <em>See Hamlin v. Barnhart, </em>365 F.3d 1208, 1214 (10th Cir.2004) (stating that the ALJ\u2019s decision is reviewed \u201cto determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied\u201d and defining substantial evidence as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d). Appellant points to no evidence in the medical record (or in her hearing testimony for that matter), showing that her obesity exacerbated her other impairments. Without some evidence that her obesity was relevant to her other alleged impairments during the relevant time frame, the ALJ was not required to consider the claimant\u2019s obesity.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Moreover, the Commissioner argued that \u201cfa]n ALJ is not obligated to investigate a claim not presented at the time of application for benefits and not offered at the hearing as a basis for disability.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 13. Appellant replied that she was \u201cnot arguing that the ALJ committed legal error by not further developing the record to investigate the effects of Callicoatt\u2019s obesity.\u201d Aplt. Reply Br. at 3. We think this is a critical admission. We find no real distinction between \u201cinvestigating\u201d her obesity and \u201cdeveloping\u201d the record as to her obesity as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Any asserted difference is merely semantical. Indeed, appellant\u2019s admission makes moot and removes the issue of the development of her obesity claim from our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-20\">.
