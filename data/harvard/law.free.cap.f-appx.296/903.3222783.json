We granted Butler\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) for the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">Whether, in light of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), the district court failed to address Butler\u2019s claim that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence in the form of an officer\u2019s report that Butler had confessed, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The scope of our review is limited to this issue. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing a \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">In <em>Clisby, </em>out of \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners,\u201d we exercised our supervisory authority, and instructed district courts \u201cto resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d 960 F.2d at 935-36. \u201cA claim for relief\u2019 is \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. \u201c[A]n allegation of one constitutional violation and an allegation of another constitutional violation constitute two distinct claims for relief, even if both allegations arise from the same alleged set of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cvacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">In the case at hand, the district court apparently overlooked our ruling in <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address all of the claims asserted in Butler\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The record reveals, and the state concedes, that the district court failed to resolve Butler\u2019s claim that the prosecution violated <em>Brady </em>by withholding a police report stating that Butler had confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
