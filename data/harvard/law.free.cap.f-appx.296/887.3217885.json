After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In 2007, Potts pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to manufacture at least 50 grams of crack cocaine base and to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine and at least 5 kilograms of powder cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(a) and 846. At sentencing, Potts\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, because Potts\u2019s offense involved over 50 grams of cocaine base, Potts was subject to a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and the low end of her guideline range was reset to 120 months under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2) (prohibiting a guidelines sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence). The government moved pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for a reduction in Potts\u2019s sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum based on Potts\u2019s substantial assistance. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion on March 30, 2007 and imposed a 60-month sentence based on Potts\u2019s substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">In February 2008, Potts filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582 motion to reduce her sentence, citing Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 706 reduced the offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for offenses involving crack cocaine and was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend 706, 713; <em>United States v. Stratton, </em>519 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2008). Under Amendment 706, Potts\u2019s base offense level would be reduced by two levels, yielding a potential guidelines range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, even with Amendment 706, the low end of Potts\u2019s actual guidelines range still would be 120 months\u2019 imprisonment because of the ten-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>year statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The district court denied Potts\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion. The district court acknowledged that Amendment 706, made retroactive by Amendment 713, reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses. The district court concluded, however, that Potts was ineligible for a sentence reduction because Potts\u2019s advisory guidelines range was derived not from the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), but from the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, Amendments 706 and 713 did \u201cnot affect the statutory minimum that ultimately determined [her] sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Potts filed this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) prohibits a court from modifying a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed except \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). However, a reduction is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(e)(2) if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">This Court recently explained that \u201ca reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline </em>or statutory provision (e.g. a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d\u2019 <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (Supp. May 1, 2008)) (omission in original). In <em>Moore, </em>this Court concluded that although Amendment 706 would have reduced the defendants\u2019 base offense levels calculated under the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, \u201cit does not have the effect of lowering their applicable guideline ranges because of the application of the career offender guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">Under the particular circumstances of Potts\u2019s case, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in denying Potts\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. There is no dispute that Amendment 706 is applicable to Potts and that it reduced her base offense level. However, due to the operation of the applicable statutory mandatory minimum ten-year sentence, Amendment 706 did not give the district court any more discretion to impose a lower sentence. In other words, even after Amendment 706, Potts\u2019s guidelines sentencing range could not dip below 120 months absent the substantial assistance \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3 (Supp. May 1, 2008) (providing that a sentencing court shall not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the minimum of the amended guidelines range). As the district court acknowledged in ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Potts\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Potts\u2019 guidelines sentencing range was driven by her statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The fact that the district court granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure motion also does not change the outcome. In <em>Moore, </em>both Moore and Law-ton also received \u00a7 5K downward departures. The <em>Moore </em>court pointed out that the sentencing court did not use the offense level to calculate the guidelines range but used the career offender designation to determine the guidelines range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1329. Similarly, here the low end of Potts\u2019s guidelines range was driven by the statutory mandatory minimum and not her offense level. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Potts\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-13\">. The presentence investigation report (\"PSI\") calculated Potts's base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(4), based on the amount of drugs involved in her offense. After adjustments, Potts\u2019s total offense level of 29 and criminal history category of II yielded an advisory guidelines range of 97 to 121 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-19\">. Under the amended drug quantity tables, Potts\u2019s base offense level would be 30, rather than 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b913-11\">. As a threshold matter we note that, although Potts filed her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion before March 3, 2008, the date Amendment 713 took effect and made Amendment 706 retroactively applicable, both the district court and this Court have jurisdiction over Potts's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the district court ruled on the motion after March 3, 2008. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b913-15\">.
