He filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings in May 2007 claiming, inter alia, that he had not understood the removal process in January 2006, and that gang-related circumstances in El Salvador had worsened sufficiently to warrant reopening proceedings despite the untimeliness of his motion. In his petition for review, Alvarado argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) abused its discretion by dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) order denying that motion. He challenges only the BIA\u2019s holding that he had failed to show materially changed conditions in El Salvador, and he has abandoned his claim that his failure to attend the January 2006 hearing was justified. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">This court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We have jurisdiction to review the denial of an untimely motion to reopen based on changed circumstances in the alien\u2019s home country. <em>Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). The denial of the motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and the factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>There is no abuse of discretion where the BIA\u2019s decision is not \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are not favored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">A party must ordinarily file a motion to reopen proceedings following the issuance of an in absentia removal order no later than 180 days after the date of the order. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The alien must also demonstrate that the failure to appear was because of \u201cexceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These limitations do not apply, however, to motions to reopen based on \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Contrary to Alvarado\u2019s assertions, the BIA\u2019s dismissal reflects that it considered the evidence submitted by Alvarado to show worsened conditions in El Salvador, and found that those materials do not show material worsening of gang-related conditions in El Salvador since January 2006. His case is thus unlike those upon which he relies, including <em>Gebreeyesus v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 952, 955 (7th Cir.2007), where the BIA was found to have rejected documents offered in support of a motion to reopen \u201cwithout any explanation.\u201d The BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ing Alvarado\u2019s appeal. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
