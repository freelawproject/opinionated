Jerdine, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition for failing to state a cognizable claim. Jerdine argues that the district court that convicted him in his underlying criminal case did not have subject matter jurisdiction because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281, which establishes the district courts\u2019 exclusive original jurisdiction in federal criminal cases, never actually became law. Jerdine further argues that his conviction is void because he was tried in a biased district court and that the Supreme Court would be a fairer environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Federal prisoners may file \u00a7 2241 petitions to collaterally attack the manner in which their convictions or sentences are executed. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363,1365 (11th Cir.2003). These collateral attacks, however, are typically brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>Section 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under limited circumstances. The savings clause provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) (emphasis added). The prisoner has the burden of presenting \u201cevidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. ...\u201d <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (citations omitted). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">[t]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim when: 1) that claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-11\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Because Jerdine attacks the validity of his underlying conviction and sentence, not the manner in which they were executed, he has failed to state a claim for \u00a7 2241 habeas relief or to show that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Jerdine\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
