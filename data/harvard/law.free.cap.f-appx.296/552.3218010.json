Nielsen filed a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the district court, arguing that his sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court dismissed the petition, and Nielsen brought this appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-22\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Bean v. Calderon, </em>163 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir.1998). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a petitioner seeking habeas relief must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision on the merits was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law under United States Supreme Court precedent, or that the decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 70-73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-23\">Homicide by abuse is a Class A felony in Washington, carrying a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9A.32.055(3), 9A.20.021(l)(a). In Nielsen\u2019s case, Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ington\u2019s Sentencing Reform Act provided a separate standard sentencing range of 240 to 320 months. The trial judge imposed an exceptional sentence of 640 months, applying enhancements under the Sentencing Reform Act for the abuse of a position of trust, the vulnerability of the victim, and deliberate cruelty. It is uncontested that the sentencing court violated the rule of <em>Blakely </em>by applying sentence enhancements under Washington\u2019s Sentencing Reform Act when the facts supporting those enhancements had not been found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. <em>See Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531. Nielsen\u2019s conviction became final in 2003, however, before the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely. Blakely </em>\u201cdoes not apply retroactively to a conviction that was final before the decision was announced.\u201d <em>Schardt v. Payne, </em>414 F.3d 1025, 1038 (9th Cir.2005). <em>Blakely </em>itself therefore has no effect on the constitutionality of Nielsen\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Nielsen argues, however, that the rule of <em>Blakely </em>was functionally anticipated and applied by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348, which was decided before Nielsen\u2019s conviction became final. <em>Schardt </em>forecloses this argument. <em>Schardt </em>pointed out that it was not \u201capparent to all reasonable jurists\u201d that a sentence such as Nielsen\u2019s was unlawful under <em>Apprendi. Schardt, </em>414 F.3d at 1035. To the contrary, \u201c[ejvery circuit court of appeals that addressed the question presented in <em>Blakely </em>reached the opposite conclusion from the rule subsequently announced by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Most state courts were in harmony with the pre-<em>Blakely </em>federal consensus. <em>See, e.g., State v. Dilts, </em>336 Or. 158, 82 P.3d 593, 601 (2003). Thus, when <em>Blakely </em>was decided, it announced a new rule that was not \u201cdictated by precedent,\u201d including the precedent of <em>Apprendi. Schardt, </em>414 F.3d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Contrary to Nielsen\u2019s contention, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), which was decided before Nielsen\u2019s conviction became final, did not establish that <em>Apprendi </em>rendered Nielsen\u2019s sentence unconstitutional. Nothing in <em>Ring </em>clearly established that Washington\u2019s Sentencing Reform Act would serve as a relevant statutory maximum for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes. <em>Ring, </em>like <em>Apprendi, </em>thus did not render Nielsen\u2019s sentence unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Finally, there is no merit to Nielsen\u2019s argument that the holding of <em>Schardt </em>conflicts with two subsequent Ninth Circuit cases interpreting <em>Apprendi, Kaua v. Frank, </em>436 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir.2006) and <em>Stokes v. Schriro, </em>465 F.3d 397 (9th Cir. 2006). The sentences in both of these cases exceeded the statutory maximum for the underlying criminal offense, in direct violation of <em>Apprendi. </em>The sentence in <em>Schardt, </em>like Nielsen\u2019s, did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>Schardt, </em>414 F.3d at 1032-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b576-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
