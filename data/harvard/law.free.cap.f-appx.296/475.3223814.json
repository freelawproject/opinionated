FORESTER, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">This is an appeal of the district court\u2019s sentence of the defendant-appellant, Mark Andrew Nelson. Nelson pled guilty to false acquisition of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) pursuant to a plea agreement. The district court subsequently sentenced him to 120 months imprisonment, two years of supervised release, a $2,000 fine and a $100 special assessment. The district court applied an upward departure based on Chapter 5 of the Sentencing Guidelines resulting in a Guidelines calculation that was 33 months greater than the applicable Guidelines range for the offense of conviction. Nelson argues on appeal that the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Upon review of the record and applicable law, we find that the district court did not err when it sentenced Nelson and will AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">On February 16, 2005, Nelson attempted to purchase a firearm from Robert Cook and completed ATF Form 4473. Nelson was denied by the National Instant Criminal Background System because he was under indictment for a felony. Despite knowing that he was prohibited from purchasing and acquiring firearms, Cook transferred the gun to Nelson. Since 2005, Nelson has enlisted various individuals to straw purchase firearms on his behalf. He then sold the firearms at gun shows and out of his car. Undercover agents conducted several transactions with Nelson and purchased 26 firearms, 9 of which were traced to Cook as the original firearms dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">On November 8, 2005, Nelson met with a confidential informant who told Nelson that he had prior felony convictions. Despite knowing that he was a convicted felon, the next day Nelson sold firearms to the informant. Nelson made three other sales to the informant in December 2005, and on December 28, 2005, Nelson made arrangements with the informant for the sale of $1,655 of firearms. When Nelson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>arrived at the agreed sale location, ATF agents approached him. During the transactions with the confidential informant, Nelson wore a bulletproof vest. At the last sale, ATF agents found a loaded, nine-millimeter, semi-automatic pistol on the floor of his car on the driver\u2019s side, a loaded, .38 caliber revolver on the front passenger\u2019s seat of his car and five more firearms in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On August 8, 2006, pursuant to a plea agreement, Nelson entered a plea of guilty to making a false statement in the acquisition of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(2). Nelson was scheduled for sentencing on February 1, 2007. The plea agreement provided that the base offense level was at least 12 and that the government reserved the right to argue that the offense involved a machine gun which would result in a range 6 levels higher. It also provided that the offense involved over 200 firearms, the highest number contemplated by the sentencing guidelines, which resulted in a 10-level increase. The plea agreement also provided for a four-level increase because Nelson possessed and transferred firearms with reason to believe that they would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense and a four-level increase for Nelson\u2019s aggravating role in the offense. Prior to the sentencing, the Probation Office completed a presentence investigation report (\u201cPIR\u201d). In the PIR, the Probation Office determined Nelson\u2019s total offense level was 33 and recommended a sentence of 120 months. This calculation was based on a base offense level of 18 rather than 12 because the STEN rifle recovered during the search of Nelson\u2019s residence was a machine gun. While the Guidelines calculated in the PIR provide for a sentence of 135 to 168 months, the Probation Office recommended a sentence of 120 months because 120 months is the statutory maximum for this offense of conviction. Nelson objected to the PIR on three grounds. At the initial sentencing hearing, Nelson withdrew two of his objections and the district court overruled the third objection. None of those objections is relevant to this appeal. The district court also questioned at the initial hearing whether relevant conduct for Nelson\u2019s offense of conviction would encompass his possession of a machine gun. Upon posing this question, the district court continued the hearing to allow the parties adequate opportunity to consider its question.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Prior to the second sentencing hearing, the district court gave notice to the parties that if the machine gun enhancement did not apply, it would consider an upward departure or variance based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2 for significant physical injury, \u00a7 5K2.6 for creating an unusually dangerous situation and/or \u00a7 5K2.14 for significantly endangering public safety and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and 3553(a)(2)(B) for the \u201cnumber of guns involved in the offense of convictions, the danger to the community and the extent and scope of the crime.\u201d JA 21. At the second hearing, the Government filed its Exhibit 1 listing the firearms purchased and/or sold by Nelson and information on where those weapons were subsequently found. The Government\u2019s Exhibit 1 was admitted without objection and Nelson admitted the facts contained therein. JA 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">At the hearing, the parties informed the district court that they agreed that the machine gun enhancement did not apply and the district court heard argument on the appropriateness of upward departures pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.2, 5K2.6 and 5K2.14. After hearing argument, the district court determined that the first two sections of Chapter 5 should not be applied but found that an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.14 was appropriate because Nelson\u2019s crime significantly endangered public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>health and safety. In support of this conclusion, the district court explained that the Government\u2019s Exhibit 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">[Indicates ... the risk to the public was substantial and actual, not just a risk but there were actually people injured, and that all of this was something that was predictable given the method of sale, given the number of guns; and while I wouldn\u2019t base the enhancement on this alone, the bulletproof vest worn by the defendant is another indication that he even knew that the matters he was involved in created a danger to public safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">JA 86-87. Based on Chapter 5 of the Guidelines, the district court departed by adding 6 points which resulted in an adjusted offense level of 33. The Guidelines imprisonment range for an offense level of 33 is 135 to 168 months. Since a statutory maximum applied, however, the range could not exceed the maximum of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Noting that the Guidelines are advisory, the district court heard arguments from the parties regarding the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and discussed them in its ruling. The district court reviewed the nature and circumstances of the offense, noting that while there was a one-count charge, there were in excess of 200 guns, each of which would essentially represent an additional crime. JA 98. Further the district court noted that while the charged offense was completed when Nelson completed the purchase of the firearm, Nelson continued committing crimes when he sold the guns to others, including known felons.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The district court also reviewed Nelson\u2019s history and character noting that it \u201ccut both ways.\u201d The district court found that Nelson should not be entitled to a pass for his service as a police officer but that he should not be more severely punished either. JA 98-99. The district court looked at the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the offense and found that the offense of conviction was most serious. JA 99. The court also looked at whether the sentence provided adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and noted that there needed to be deterrence with regard to further criminal conduct by Nelson and others. JA 99. The district court then considered protecting the public from further crimes by Nelson and found that when Nelson was not in custody, he presented a great risk to the public with regard to placing firearms in commerce. JA 99. The district court reviewed Nelson\u2019s need for education or vocational training, medical care or other correctional treatment, finding that the Bureau of Prisons can provide for those conditions. JA 99-100. The district court considered the types of sentences available and the range for the particular crime along with policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. JA 100. Finally, the court reviewed the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities with defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct, noting that the case seemed to turn on what sentence Cook, a co-defendant, was to receive from the court. JA 100-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">After discussing all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court found that the aggravated nature of the offenses, the number of sales, the types of sales, the defendant\u2019s past, and the fact that Nelson wore a bulletproof vest (indicating that he knew of the dangerousness of the criminal conduct that he was engaged in) outweighed the mitigating factors of Nelson being a first-time offender, not having an extensive criminal past and not going to trial. JA 101. Accordingly, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>court sentenced Nelson to the statutory maximum of 120 months. JA 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The district court had jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. This court has jurisdiction over Nelson\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. \u201cCourts of appeals must review all sentences inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly applies the governing law or uses an erroneous legal standard. <em>United States v. Lineback, </em>330 F.3d 441, 443 (6th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">An appellate court must follow a two-step analysis to determine whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence. First, the reviewing court must ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Second, if the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. The appellate court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness; however, a presumption of unreasonableness does not apply if the sentence is outside of the Guidelines range. The appellate court may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the sentencing court. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. <em>See also United States v. Grossman, </em>513 F.3d 592, 595 (6th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Erpenbeck, </em>532 F.3d 423, 430 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Nelson argues on appeal that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">A. Procedural Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">The district court determined that Nelson\u2019s applicable Guidelines range for the one-count indictment was 70 to 87 months of imprisonment, but concluded that a departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.14 applied, taking the range to 135 to 168 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court noted the statutory maximum of 120 months would supercede the higher calculated range. After it calculated the Guidelines range, the district court discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and announced a sentence of 120 months, deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>mining that the mitigating factors were outweighed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Nelson\u2019s procedural objection is that the Guidelines calculation that the district court employed was improper. Specifically, Nelson objects to the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.14 arguing that the upward departure amounts to improper double counting because the danger to public safety alleged in the case was already accounted for in the Guidelines provisions related to the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Guidelines provisions related to the offense of conviction provide for punishment for making a false statement in the acquisition of a firearm and provide for increases in levels for the total number of firearms involved in the offense and for possession of firearms that are used in connection with other felony offenses by the defendant or that are transferred or possessed with knowledge that they will be used in connection with a felony offense. Both of these increases were applied without objection resulting in an initial range under the Guidelines of 70-87 months, which the district court properly acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Section 5K2.14, however, provides that a sentencing court may increase the range \u201cto reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d The departure is appropriate if \u201cnational security, public health, or safety was significantly endangered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court distinguished the offense of conviction, which had to do with obtaining firearms Nelson was not permitted to possess based on false information given by Nelson, and Nelson\u2019s additional conduct. The district court noted that more than 200 firearms were involved in the offense and found that although Nelson completed the charged offense when he received the firearms, he continued beyond that offense with the sale of weapons to the confidential informant whom Nelson knew to be a convicted felon. The Government\u2019s Exhibit 1 and Nelson wearing a bulletproof vest during the transaction with the confidential informant, moreover, provide the basis for the departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.14 as these facts demonstrate \u201cthe risk to the public was substantial and actual\u201d and that such risk/danger was \u201cpredictable.\u201d Additionally, while the district court did not specifically recite these facts, the record before the district court reflects that Nelson conducted multiple transactions with the informant and at the last transaction Nelson carried loaded firearms in his car. These are legitimate justifications for applying the departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upward under \u00a7 5K2.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Nelson also argues that the district court did not consider certain \u00a7 3558(a) factors when it sentenced him. While he classifies this argument as a \u201csubstantive\u201d challenge, it is more correctly classified as \u201cprocedural\u201d because Nelson is arguing that the district court did not follow proper procedure when it failed to consider one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the factors. Specifically, Nelson argues that the court failed to consider his status as a police officer as a mitigating factor as such status subjects him to a greater risk of harm while incarcerated. The district court specifically considered Nelson\u2019s status as a former police officer and found that it \u201ccut both ways.\u201d JA 98. The district court is not required to consider whether he is at a greater risk for harm while incarcerated and there is no evidence in the record that Nelson would be at any greater risk of any supposed danger if he is incarcerated 70 months or 120 months. Moreover, defense counsel did not raise this issue at the hearing. It is not incumbent on the district court to raise every conceivably relevant issue on its own initiative. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We find that the district court committed no procedural errors. As explained <em>supra, </em>the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range and applied the departure. It also allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, considered the \u00a7 8553(a) factors, acknowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines, did not select erroneous facts and thoroughly documented its reasoning for the selected sentence, including the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">B. Substantive Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Nelson argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because (1) it was based on an impermissible Guidelines calculation and (2) the court gave unreasonable weight to certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors. While the procedural error review is abuse-of-discretion <em>per se, </em>the substantive review is \u201cfar more ambiguous \u2014 it is an error so serious that the decision is not entitled to deference, just as if the court had relied on a clearly erroneous finding of fact, clearly misapplied the law or applied the wrong law.\u201d <em>United States v. Funk, </em>534 F.3d 522, 526 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Lineback, </em>330 F.3d at 443). The reviewing court must also be sure to grant the appropriate level of deference to the district court\u2019s decision. If it is an atypical case, outside the Guidelines \u201cheartland\u201d of cases, the district court\u2019s decision is entitled to the \u201cgreatest respect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If it is a \u201cmine-run case,\u201d however, it warrants a closer review. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007)). <em>\u201cGall </em>made clear that even a significant departure could be warranted so long as the sentencing court, \u2018[ajfter settling on the appropriate sentence, ... adequately explain[s] the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Erpenbeck, </em>532 F.3d at 438 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Nelson asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly relied on a Guidelines departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.14. \u201cThe Guidelines policy statement on departures, however, makes clear that departures are discretionary and a sentencing court \u2018may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable\u2019 Guidelines when there are circumstances of a kind or degree that are \u2018not adequately taken into consideration\u2019 under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Erpenbeck, </em>532 F.3d at 439 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 5K2.14 was not substantively unreasonable. As discussed <em>supra </em>this section allows departure when \u201cnational security, public health, or safety was significantly endangered.\u201d The district court\u2019s discussion details why it found these requirements were met and the district court carefully explained the grounds for applying the enhancement. Giving due deference to the district court\u2019s reasoned decision, we cannot say that this application was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Nelson also argues that the district court gave \u201cunreasonable\u201d weight to certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We find that the court carefully balanced the factors and did not abuse its discretion in doing so. From the district court\u2019s detailed discussion of the facts specific to this case, we find it clear that the district court considered all the concerns embodied in \u00a7 3553 and simply determined that the departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.14 was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Additionally, Nelson argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the court did not give adequate consideration to the factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(6)-disparity in sentences among defendants convicted of similar crimes. First, Nelson argues that his sentence is unreasonable because one of his co-defendants, Cook, who was in front of a different district judge, received a lower sentence. \u201c \u2018Subsection 3553(a)(6) is concerned with <em>national </em>disparities among the many defendants with similar criminal backgrounds convicted of similar criminal conduct.\u2019 This factor is designed to \u2018ensure nationally uniform sentences among like offenders.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Houston, </em>529 F.3d 743 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>501 F.3d 620, 626 (6th Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted)). While this factor is concerned with national disparities, it is not inappropriate for the sentencing court to consider disparities between the sentences of co-defendants as the district court considered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Nelson argues that the district court was given inaccurate information about Cook\u2019s sentence and, that, if the district court had accurate information, it might have altered its ruling. We find that the district court did not have inaccurate information before it. At the second sentencing hearing, the district court discussed the chance that Cook would receive a lesser sentence. The district court was informed that Cook was \u201cpotentially looking at a maximum of 36 months.\u201d JA 91. This was represented as the <em>maximum </em>that Cook would receive, not a minimum or a definite sentence. The district court reasoned that Cook receiving a lesser sentence would not create an unwarranted disparity because Cook merited a downward departure for providing substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of others, Nelson received more profit from the transactions and Nelson, as a police officer, had specialized knowledge of firearms and the laws governing them. We find that the district court considered the disparity factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In his reply brief Nelson, for the first time on appeal, argues that the sentencing court failed to consider the disparity between his sentence and other defendants across the nation. An appeals court will generally not hear issues raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>United States v. Crozier, </em>259 F.3d 503, 517 (6th Cir.2001). This Circuit has been clear that an appellant cannot raise new issues in a reply brief and can only respond to arguments made the first time in the appellee\u2019s brief. Nonetheless, we find that the district court \u201ccorrectly calculated and carefully reviewed the Guidelines range\u201d thereby giving \u201csignificant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 599. Giving appropriate deference to the district court\u2019s determination, we cannot say that the district court failed to consider any potential national disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Nelson, and the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-10\">. This determination is a \"Guideline departure\u201d rather than a variance as it was based on Chapter 5 of the Sentencing Guidelines and not on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Cousins, </em>469 F.3d 572, 577 (6th Cir.2006) (discussing the difference between a departure and a variance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3), \u201c[a] departure may be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration in determining the guideline range, if the court determines that such circumstance is present in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of, or substantially below, that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.\u201d Thus, while the district court departed for reasons separate from the considerations of the Guidelines provisions related to the offense of conviction, a further consideration of factors used to determine the Guidelines was appropriate in the departure context if the case fell within \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3). Nelson's double-counting argument both mischaracterizes the basis for departure here and wrongly assumes the impermissibility of double counting in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
