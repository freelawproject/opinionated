Jan. 11, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conelusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">As an initial matter, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Feng\u2019s proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>because such a decision is \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Mariuta v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 361, 365 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Feng failed to establish changed circumstances warranting the reopening of his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">An individual must file a motion to reopen within ninety days of the issuance of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This limitation, however, does not apply when the motion to reopen is filed in order to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances arising in his country of nationality, if the evidence submitted is material and was unavailable and undiseoverable at the time of his hearing before the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Here, it is undisputed that Feng\u2019s motion to reopen was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>untimely. Feng argues that the BIA nevertheless abused its discretion when it concluded that the Lianjiang County Donghu Town Standard Policy for Married Couples did not establish changed circumstances in China. As the BIA concluded, however, this was the only evidence Feng submitted relevant to his changed circumstances argument, and it is insufficient to show \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) where it is undated. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the BIA erred in denying Feng\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
