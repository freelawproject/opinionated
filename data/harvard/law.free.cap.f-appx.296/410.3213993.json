Turcios argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not apply a two-level downward adjustment in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) based on his status as a \u201cminor participant\u201d in his offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutietrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). We continue to review a district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its factual findings, such as its determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, for clear error. <em>Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">To be eligible for a minor-role adjustment, a defendant \u201cmust have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 447 (5th Cir.2001). Turcios participated in the instant offense by relaying directions to the location of the transaction, conducting what appeared to be counter-surveillance while his co-defendant met with an informant, and ensuring that the transaction took place. The district court\u2019s finding that Turcios was not a minor participant is plausible in light of the record as a whole and therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">Turcios does not contend that his sentence is otherwise procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. Nor has Turcios shown that his sentence, which falls within a properly calculated sentencing guidelines range, is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
