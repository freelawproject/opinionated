Hurtado\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) brief, Hurtado filed a pro se supplemental brief, and the Government has declined to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Hurtado argues that his plea was involuntary because he believed he would receive one less drug felony in the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) information and the Government would file a <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2006) motion. He requests a sentence below the statutory minimum. He does not request that his guilty plea be invalidated, however. Hurtado\u2019s plea agreement does not contain a promise that the Government would file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing transcript clearly indicates that the plea was based on leaving off one of Hurtado\u2019s drug felonies in the \u00a7 851 information but that the Government would not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Hurtado agreed with the summary of the plea agreement and that no other agreements were made outside the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Hurtado\u2019s plea agreement did not obligate the Government to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure even if Hurtado provided substantial assistance. Hurtado does not allege, and the record does not disclose, any evidence that the Government refused to make the motion based on any unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840,118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (holding that \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d). Therefore, Hurtado\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hurtado\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court .and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
