Premising jurisdiction on the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Snyders brought various tort claims against the United States based upon its alleged misconduct in disposing of waste at a Marine Corps base in the early 1970s. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (2006) We have carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the pertinent portions of the record. The district judge entered a thorough and thoughtful opinion styled as an Order and Reasons Dismissing Case for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
