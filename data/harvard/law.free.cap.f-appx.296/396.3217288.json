The government responds that this appeal is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in the plea agreement. We review the validity of an appeal waiver <em>de novo. See United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The record shows that Speights\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary, and he has not raised an issue on appeal that falls within the exceptions to the waiver. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the waiver bars review of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Speights can pursue a reduction in sentence in the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. We express no opinion on the viability of such relief as it pertains to Speights.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
