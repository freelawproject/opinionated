Our review is plenary. Our jurisdiction stems from a final order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">Czop was the contractor responsible for performing roadside inspection services on behalf of the Department of Transportation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (\u201cPennDOT\u201d). It held two insurance policies: one payable by Erie under policy number Q48 0150571 A, and one payable by Lumbermens under policy number QL016315-00. The Erie policy was a general liability policy that <em>excluded </em>coverage of claims arising from \u201cservice[s] of a professional nature,\u201d including \u201csupervisory, inspection, or engineering services.\u201d The Lumbermens policy, conversely, <em>provided </em>coverage only for claims regarding \u201cprofessional services,\u201d which was defined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>include \u201cthose services that the [i]nsured is legally qualified to perform for others in the [ijnsured\u2019s capacity as an architect, engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect, construction manager or as defined by endorsement to the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Lumbermens now claims it should not have to pay for Czop\u2019s liability because the task of inspecting and maintaining roadside safety does not qualify as a \u201cprofessional service.\u201d This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">David Riley, the employee hired by Czop to conduct the roadside inspections, performed specialized tasks. <em>See Harad v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>839 F.2d 979, 984 (3d Cir.1988). He conducted inspections and made arrangements for other contractors to perform any necessary labor; he did not clear the roads himself. Lumbermens\u2019s efforts to minimize Riley\u2019s education, training, and job function do not diminish the fact that the services he performed were professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Accordingly, we \u00ab411 affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. Erie is incorrectly identified as \u201cErie Insurance Company\u201d in the caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">. Cuthbertson was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Michael Donovan, who collided with another vehicle when he did not see \u201can obstructed and otherwise difficult to observe stop sign ... due to a combination of factors, including tree branches, vegetation, bushes, brush and grass which obstructed visibility of eastbound drivers west of the stop sign.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 2-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
