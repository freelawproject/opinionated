After reviewing the briefs and the record, we AFFIRM the judgment for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order dated October 11, 2007, 2007 WL 3286758.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-16\">. In particular, we are unpersuaded that appellant was constructively discharged because she was told \"horrible things\u201d would happen to her if she did not retire. This isolated remark, even if believed by a factfinder, does not rise to the level of severe or pervasive conduct that would support a hostile work environment claim, much less create such intolerable conditions that a reasonable person would be compelled to resign, as required for constructive discharge. <em>See, e.g., Hipp v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., </em>252 F.3d 1208, 1231 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted) (constructive discharge requires a showing of greater severity or pervasiveness than hostile work environment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
