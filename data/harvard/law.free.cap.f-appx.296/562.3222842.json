We review questions of law and constitutional questions de novo. <em>See Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review. The facts of the case are known to the parties and we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b586-25\">Petitioners argue that withdrawal of their applications for admission to the United States is similar to the turn-around at the border experienced by the alien in <em>Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997 (9th Cir. 2005). We disagree. Their decisions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>withdraw their applications for admission is more akin to the voluntary departure granted to the alien in <em>Vasquez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>343 F.3d 961 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, we accord <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(A) in <em>In re Avilez-Nava, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 799, 800-01 (BIA 2005) (holding that an alien\u2019s continuous physical presence is broken if the alien \u201cwas offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw an application for admission\u201d). The BIA\u2019s \u201cstop-time\u201d rule is a permissible construction of \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Petitioners also argue that (1) they were denied due process by the IJ\u2019s pretermission of their applications and (2) the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2) is impermissibly retroactive. Petitioners did not raise these issues to the BIA. Failure to exhaust an available administrative remedy deprives us of jurisdiction to hear the matter. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Petition for review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b586-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-26\">. Petitioners are joined on their petition for review by two of their daughters whose ability to stay in the United States depends wholly on relief being granted to Petitioners. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
