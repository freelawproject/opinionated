R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b604-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">This is a petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen removal proceedings as untimely and barred by numerical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in construing petitioner\u2019s \u201cmotion for administrative closure\u201d as a motion to reopen. In this motion, petitioner sought administrative closure to pursue possible amnesty relief should Congress pass amnesty legislation. The BIA stated correctly that the motion was filed after the final administrative decision had been entered, thus, there were no administrative proceedings to close.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The regulations provide that \u201ca party may file only one motion to reopen,\u201d and that the motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A review of the administrative record demonstrates that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred because it was petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen and was filed on March 10, 2008, more than 90 days after the December 23, 2005 final administrative decision was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
