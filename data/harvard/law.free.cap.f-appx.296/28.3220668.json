The award denied his grievance. He claims that he was improperly removed from his position with U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( agency ), an agency withm tee Department of Homeland Secu^y, ^or testing positive for a controlled substance in a random drug test. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AEg\">Salas began working for the agency as a border patrol agent in January 2002. In May 2005 he became a canine handler. On , \u201e , , August 1, 2006, Salas and other agents were notffied ^ they had been selected for a random dmg tegt During hig test&gt; galag handed Mg ungea]ed gample to the gpedmen collectoi. who walked out of the restroom ^ it. Salas then washed his handSj rejoined the spedmen collector&gt; and Mtialed a strip that the specimen collector then placed on the cap and body of a sample container. The agency sent the samPle to an outside testinS laboratory, which found that the samPle tested Posi' tive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">0n September 7, 2006, the agency propoged to remove galas from his position for his positive drug test. On October 19, 2006, Salas, through counsel, objected to the agency\u2019s proposed removal, inter alia, on the ground that Salas\u2019s sample had been collected improperly because the specimen collector had removed the sample from Salas\u2019s sight before sealing it. The agency removed Salas from his position on November 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Salas subsequently filed a grievance, and the arbitration hearing was held on June 20, 2007. Test results from a urine sample were introduced. Counsel for both parties described the test results as being from Salas\u2019s sample. At this hearing, the agency called one of Salas\u2019s supervisors as a witness, who testified that Salas partieipated in a random drug test on August 1, 2006. The agency also called as a witness the medical review officer who had interpreted the report prepared by the outside laboratory that analyzed the sample. The medical review officer testified that the laboratory report showed that the sample tested positive for cocaine, and that another laboratory\u2019s analysis reconfirmed this positive test</p>\n<p id=\"ABI\">TT ... , However, the agency did not present , .. .... ; . testimony regardmg the chain of custody \u201e \u201e . , . \u00b0 . , ,._ , ,, , . of Salass sample. Salas testified that he . , , . ,. lost sight of his unsealed sample when the .. , , specimen collector walked out of the rest- ^ , room. On cross-examination, the medical . ,, , . review officer admitted that a sample , .. . ,. . , ... ...... should not leave the donor s sight until it is , . T . . , , . . . \u201e \u201e . sealed. In his post-hearing brief, Salas asserted that his loss of sight of the sample raised questions about whether the sample was his. On August 8, 2007, the arbitrator denied Salas s grievance, finding Salas s testimony regarding his brief loss of sight of his sample to be insufficient to justify disregarding the test results,\u201d and concluding that the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Salas tested positive for cocaine in a random drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"AT0\">Salas timely appealed to this court, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a)(1), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ARH\">We review the arbitrator\u2019s decision under the same standards that apply to appeals from decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f); <em>Dixon v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>8 F.3d 798, 803 (Fed.Cir.1993). We must affirm the arbitrator\u2019s decision unless it was \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). \u201cSubstantial evidence ... means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"AzI\">Salas asserts that, because he briefly lost sight of his sample, the agency ... <em>\\ </em>\u00b0 ,, ,,, did not meet its burden of proving that the , , ,. . , . \u00b0 sample testing positive was his. The possibihty that Salas s sample was misidentitied or tampered with while he lost sight of , ........ it is speculative. Salas described his brief . . , , loss of sight of his sample but presented ,, .. , no other testimony or evidence at the , . , hearing suggesting that the sample was</p>\n<p id=\"ABE\">On review, Salas asserts for the time that the agency was required to present witnesses at his arbitration hearjng t0 testify to his sample\u2019s chain of custoc|y un(jer <em>Boykin v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>51 M.S.P.R. 56; 58 (M.S.P.B.1991) (finding an agenCy \u00bfy not meet its burden of showing a drug test was valid when the testimony of its witnesses was insufficient to prove the chain of custody). We have held that a drug test sample\u2019s \u201cchain of custody must be strong enough so that, on the record as a whole, the decision of the arbitrator can be found to be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Frank v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>35 F.3d 1554, 1557 (Fed.Cir.1994) (citing <em>Dixon, </em>8 F.3d at 804). Salas did not raise this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>at the hearing or in his post-hearing brief, Indeed, at the hearing his counsel referred to the test results as being from Salas\u2019s sample. Because \u201cwe do not consider issues that were not raised in the proceedings below,\u201d <em>Frank, </em>35 F.3d at 1559, Salas cannot for the first time on review chailenge the agency\u2019s failure to present witness testimony to the proof the chain of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Y\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AZV\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"Al-\">.
