R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34Q). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed February 29, 2008, dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, be affirmed. Appellant\u2019s claim for damages against a federal magistrate judge is barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity. <em>See Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 225, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988) (a judge is absolutely immune from a damages suit for actions taken in his or her judicial capacity). A judge will be deprived of immunity only if he or she acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). Because the record contains no evidence, other than appellant\u2019s unsubstantiated assertions, that appellee \u201cacted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction,\u201d there was no error by the district court in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
