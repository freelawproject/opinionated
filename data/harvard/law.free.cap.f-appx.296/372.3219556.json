Jackson appeals the district court\u2019s final order entering judgment in the Government\u2019s favor after it granted the Government partial summary judgment in its forfeiture action against Jackson, thereby forfeiting seized currency and a vehicle to the United States.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo, drawing reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Hooven-Lewis v. Caldera, </em>249 F.3d 259, 265 (4th Cir.2001). Summary judgment may be granted only when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Summary judgment will be granted unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party on the evidence presented. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 983(c)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), the Government must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the property sought is subject to forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u00a7 983(c)(3) provides that \u201cif the Government\u2019s theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a criminal offense, or was involved in the commission of a criminal offense, the Government shall establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Jackson\u2019s vehicle facilitated unlawful drug activity and that the currency found constitutes proceeds of unlawful drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s final judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"><em> </em>The Government's remaining claims were eventually disposed of by the parties and are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
