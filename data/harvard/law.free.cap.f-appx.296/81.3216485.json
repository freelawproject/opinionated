The district court properly dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it is not a civil action arising under federal law, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, or between citizens of different states with an amount in controversy of more than $75,000, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; nor does the complaint allege any other basis for the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
