Nov. 28, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719,116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zequiraj\u2019s motion to reopen. It is undisputed that the motion was untimely where it was filed more than one year after the BIA\u2019s March 2006 decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the BIA properly found that Zequiraj failed to show that his motion to reopen met an exception to the time limitation based on \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d in Kosovo. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-19\">In this regard, the BIA found that while Zequiraj\u2019s evidence \u201creflects the growing international concerns about how any plans for Kosovo\u2019s independence will affect the political and ethnic stability both within Kosovo and in its neighboring countries,\u201d it concluded that \u201cspeculation as to future problems in Kosovo does not comprise changed conditions.\u201d We find no error in this reasoning. Speculation about how conditions might change is not sufficient to establish changed country conditions pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Furthermore, Zequiraj\u2019s argument that he fears future persecution in Kosovo based on the increase in Muslim radical attacks against moderate Muslims like him is without merit. Contrary to Zequiraj\u2019s argument, evidence he relies upon details only a developing \u201cpotential for trouble\u201d between Muslim radicals and moderate Muslims. Thus, the BIA\u2019s finding that Zequiraj submitted no evidence of changed country conditions was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Finally, to the extent Zequiraj argues that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to consider the supporting documentation he submitted with his motion to reopen, we find that this argument is without merit. The BIA is not required to \u201c \u2018expressly parse or refute on the record\u2019 each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner.\u201d <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 160 n. 13 (2d Cir.2006)). To the contrary, \u201c[wjhile the BIA must consider such evidence, it may do so in summary fashion without a reviewing court presuming that it has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA noted that Zequiraj \u201csubmitted a number of background reports and news articles\u201d and concluded that this evidence failed to establish his claim that country conditions in Kosovo had changed. While the BIA considered Zequiraj\u2019s evidence in \u201csummary fashion,\u201d it did not abuse its discretion in doing so where Zequiraj has failed to explain how any piece of documentary evidence submitted with his motion established changed country conditions in Kosovo material to his claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The BIA\u2019s finding that Zequiraj\u2019s motion to reopen is untimely and that he did not meet the exception to the one-year time limitation by demonstrating changed country conditions in Kosovo is dispositive to his petition for review. Accordingly, we need not consider Zequiraj\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in finding that some of his evidence was not previously unavailable. We decline to consider Zequiraj\u2019s due process argument where that argument is merely a challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen cloaked in constitutional garb. <em>Cf. Saloum v. USCIS, </em>437 F.3d 238, 243-44 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-16\">. We take judicial notice that Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008. <em>See Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 186 n. 5 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
