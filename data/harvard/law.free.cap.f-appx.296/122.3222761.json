Petitioner conceded deportability, but argued that he had been continuously present in the United States for a sufficient period of time to be eligible for suspension of deportation. On August 27, 2007, however, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Petitioner\u2019s admitted absence from the United States in 1985-1986 served to break his physical presence, so that he did not meet the requirements of suspension of deportation. King-Lipsitt appealed the IJ\u2019s decision, which the BIA affirmed on November 3, 2005. Petitioner did not appeal that decision to our Court, and hence it is not before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On June 21, 2007, Petitioner filed a motion with the BIA to \u201creopen and/or reconsider\u201d the denial of his application for suspension of deportation. In this motion, Petitioner argued, as he does here, that the IJ \u2014 by giving retroactive applicability to new immigration laws \u2014 had applied the wrong standard for suspension of deportation to his case, and that, had the IJ applied the correct standard, he would be eligible for relief. On July 24, 2007, the BIA denied this motion as untimely, and noted, in the alternative, that the IJ had in fact applied the correct standard for suspension of deportation. Petitioner now appeals this denial of his motion to reopen or reconsider. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the additional underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As an initial matter, it is important to note that in the case of an alien, such as King-Lipsitt, who is ordered deported for commission of an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense, this Court is limited in reviewing the petition to consideration of its own jurisdiction and to the review of constitutional issues and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) and (D); <em>see Maiwand v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 101, 104 (2d Cir.2007). Because Petitioner did not appeal the BIA\u2019s initial determination that he was ineligible for suspension of deportation, we only review the BIA\u2019s order as to the motion for reopening and/or reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The BIA denied King-Lipsitt\u2019s motion to reconsider and/or reopen because it was untimely. The BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s order was entered on November 3, 2005. To be considered timely, a motion to reconsider would have been due December 3, 2005, thirty days after the original decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). A motion to reopen would have been due February 1, 2006, ninety days after the decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Petitioner filed his motion on June 21, 2007, well past these deadlines. King-Lipsitt does not address the question of timeliness in his brief or argue that any exceptions to these time bars should apply. Given the manifest fact that Petitioner\u2019s motion was filed after the deadlines, the BIA did not commit legal or constitutional error in denying his motion as untimely. As a result, we do not have jurisdiction to review this appeal. Just as the BIA did, we note in passing that even if Petitioner\u2019s claim had been timely, and we had jurisdiction, his argument that the incorrect standard was applied to his application for suspension of deportation is without merit. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(2) (repealed 1996); <em>Tablie v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 60, 61-62 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Rojas-Reyes v. INS, </em>235 F.3d 115,120-21 (2d Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">We have reviewed all of Petitioner\u2019s arguments and find that we lack jurisdiction to consider them. The petition for review is, therefore, DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
