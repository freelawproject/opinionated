The District Court sentenced Hough to sixty months\u2019 incarceration, followed by five years of supervised release. Hough appeals his judgment of sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">In June 2004, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at David Hough\u2019s residence and seized his computer and hard drive, which contained images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. On January 3, 2007, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment, charging Hough in Count One with knowingly receiving visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), and in Count Two with knowingly possessing visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">Hough entered into a written plea agreement with the Government in which he agreed to plead guilty to Count One charging him with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). The offense carried a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment; consequently, the Presentence Investigation Report calculated the federal Sentencing Guidelines recommendation, originally thirty-three to forty-one months, to be sixty months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1. Under the plea agreement, the Government agreed to withdraw Count Two. Hough agreed to waive his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s sentence, except if the Government appealed from the sentence, the sentence exceeded the statutory limit as stated in the United States Code, or the sentence unreasonably exceeded the federal Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">At the District Court sentencing hearing, Hough did not contest the length of the statutory mandatory five-year minimum, but instead requested that the sentence be split between incarceration and home detention with electronic monitoring. The District Court sentenced Hough to sixty months\u2019 incarceration, followed by five years of supervised release. One of the conditions of the supervised release is that Hough is prohibited from associating with children under eighteen years of age, except where a responsible adult, approved by Hough\u2019s probation officer and aware of Hough\u2019s background and offense, is present. Hough did not object to this condition at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Hough timely appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The District Court had jurisdiction over Hough\u2019s case pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Hough\u2019s appeal, even though he agreed to an appellate waiver in his plea agreement. <em>United States v. Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d 200, 203 (3d Cir.2007). However, we may refuse to exercise that jurisdiction upon a finding that the appellate waiver is valid. <em>Id. </em>We make a de novo determination as to the validity of Hough\u2019s appellate waiver. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>523 F.3d 234, 237 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Hough raises two issues on appeal. First, he contends that the District Court erred in refusing to impose a sentence split between incarceration and home detention. While he does not contest that the statutory mandatory minimum for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) is five years\u2019 imprisonment, he argues that the District Court erred by interpreting the statutory term \u201cimprisoned\u201d as referring exclusively to incarceration and not home detention. Second, Hough asserts that the District Court violated his constitutional right to procreate and associate with his children by imposing in Hough\u2019s supervised release terms a condition prohibiting him from having unsupervised visits with children under the age of eighteen. In response to Hough\u2019s arguments, the Government asserts that the appellate waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes Hough from raising these issues. Alternatively, the Government maintains Hough\u2019s claims are without merit. We conclude that the appellate waiver is valid and therefore do not reach the merits of Hough\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">This Court will find an appellate waiver to be valid \u201cif entered into knowingly and voluntarily,\u201d provided that the resulting waiver does not \u201cwork a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 562-63 (3d Cir.2001). We approach this determination in three steps. <em>See Jackson, </em>523 F.3d at 243-44. First, we analyze whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the appellate waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 243. If so, our attention then turns to the scope of the appellate waiver, looking specifically at the applicability of any exceptions set forth in the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 244. Finally, where the defendant has knowingly and voluntarily entered into the waiver and no enumerated exceptions allow the appeal, we examine whether invoking the waiver would result in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although this Court has chosen not to attach a specific definition to \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d we have included several factors to guide our analysis. Prior to \u201crelieving the defendant of the waiver,\u201d we consider \u201c[t]he clarity of the error, its gravity, its character (e.g., whether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing guideline, or a statutory maximum), the impact of the error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the error on the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\u201d <em>Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 563 (quoting <em>United States v. Teeter, </em>257 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir.2001)) (internal quotations omitted). With these analytical principles, we turn to Hough\u2019s appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">First, Hough does not contest that he knowingly and voluntarily entered into the appellate waiver. Second, neither of the two issues Hough raises on appeal fall into one of the three exceptions to the appellate waiver. The waiver provision of the plea agreement allows Hough to directly appeal his conviction or sentence only if the Government first appeals the sentence, the sentence exceeds the statutory limit as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>indicated in the United States Code, or the sentence unreasonably exceeds the federal Guidelines range. This appeal was initiated by Hough, not the Government; thus, the first exception is inapplicable. The remaining two exceptions pertain to Hough challenging the length of his sentence. Hough does not dispute the length of the statutory five-year mandatory minimum, but rather takes issue with the \u201cmanner\u201d of serving that sentence since the District Court dismissed his request for home detention. Such an assertion does not fit into any waiver exception. Additionally, Hough\u2019s constitutional challenge to a term of his supervised release does not question the length of the District Court\u2019s sentence. Therefore, because Hough\u2019s sixty-month sentence of imprisonment does not exceed the statutory maximum of twenty years, nor does it unreasonably exceed the range provided in the federal Guidelines, none of the appellate waiver exceptions apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Finally, enforcing the waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice. As for Hough\u2019s split-sentence argument, we do not find that the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant home detention in the face of a statutory mandatory five-year minimum amounts to one of those \u201cunusual eircumstance[s]\u201d that would nullify an otherwise valid waiver. <em>Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 562. Regarding Hough\u2019s constitutional challenge to a condition of his supervised release, enforcing a waiver that results in the infringement upon one\u2019s constitutional rights certainly may amount to a miscarriage of justice. However, we do not construe the term of Hough\u2019s supervised release to bring about such harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Defendants convicted of crimes similar to Hough\u2019s may \u201close custody of their children or have restrictions placed on their parental rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Loy, </em>237 F.3d 251, 269 (3d Cir.2001). Nevertheless, such interference with the familial relationship must be supported by evidence \u201cthat children are potentially in danger from their parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269-70. Where a sentencing court has not indicated that it intended a supervised release condition restricting a defendant\u2019s contact with children under eighteen to extend to that defendant\u2019s own children, we will interpret the condition as applying only to the children of others. <em>Id. </em>at 270. In this case, there is no indication that the District Court intended the supervised release condition to apply to Hough\u2019s own family, including any children he may have during his supervised release term. We will presume that the District Court intended the order to apply only to the minor children of other people. Accordingly, enforcing the appellate waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">For the reasons discussed, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
