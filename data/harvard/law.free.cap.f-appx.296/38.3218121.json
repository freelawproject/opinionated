Because Mr. Fields raises no issue over which this court has jurisdiction, we <em>dismiss </em>Mr. Fields\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Agf\">In 1993 Mr. Fields filed a claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include paranoid schizophrenia. After extended proceedings regarding Mr. Fields\u2019 claim, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals ultimately denied the claim in 2003 together with his claim of service connection for sarcoidosis. Although the Board found that the evidence of record supported a finding that Mr. Fields had a psychiatric disability, the Board found insufficient evidence that his disability was related to his service. The Board also concluded that the evidence failed to show service connection for sarcoidosis. Mr. Fields appealed to the Veterans Court, which affirmed. Mr. Fields then filed an appeal to this court, asserting that the Board had erred in finding that the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) had been satisfied. We remanded the case to the Veterans Court for further proceedings consistent with our decision in <em>Mayfield v. Nicholson, </em>444 F.3d 1328 (Fed.Cir. 2006)</p>\n<p id=\"AXe\">On remand, the Veterans Court held that Mr. Fields had not been provided with proper notice because he was not given notice of the information necessary to substantiate his claim for service connection, The court nevertheless ruled that Mr. Fields was not prejudiced by the notice error because he was aware that he needed to submit medical nexus evidence to substantiate his claim. The court reached that conclusion because Mr. Fields had been notified that his claim was denied for a lack of evidence showing a medical nexus between his psychiatric disability and his military service. The court additionally observed that Mr. Fields had in fact submitted evidence in an effort to demonstrate the presence of the required nexus, The court further noted that Mr. Fields was provided with a compensation and pension examination in August 2002 and that blowing that examination, the medica^ examiner found no basis for concluding ^hat Mr. fields psychiatric disability was service connected.</p>\n<p id=\"AcA\">^ ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"AlsC\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Veterans Court committed legal error in finding that the failure by the Department of Veterans Affairs to comply with section 5103(a) was not prejudicial. When notice is defective under section 5103(a), the Secretary can show that the error was not prejudicial by demonstrating (1) that any defect in notice was cured by actual knowledge on the part of the claimant, (2) that a reasonable person could be expected to understand from the notice provided what was needed, or (3) that a benefit could not possibly have been awarded as a matter of law. <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881, 889 (Fed.Cir.2007), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2935, 171 L.Ed.2d 863 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">In this case, the Veterans Court concluded from the record that \u201c[i]t would be disingenuous for Mr. Fields to claim that he did not understand that medical nexus evidence was necessary to establish his claim.\u201d That is, the court inferred from Mr. Fields\u2019 submission of medical nexus evidence and from notifications sent to Mr. Fields regarding the denial of his claim that Mr. Fields knew or should have known that medical nexus evidence was required to substantiate his claim for service connection. In reaching that conclusion, the Veterans Court conducted the inquiry required under <em>Sanders. </em>Mr. Fields does not argue that the Veterans Court misapplied a statute, regulation, or legal rule when it determined that the flaw in the section 5103(a) notification process was not prejudicial. To the extent that Mr. Fields challenges the finding that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>knew or should have known what was required to substantiate his claim, his contention is not within our jurisdiction in reviewing decisions of the Veterans Court, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4V\">Mr. Fields also appears to argue that the decision denying him service connection for sarcoidosis was erroneous. As in the case of his argument regarding the prejudicial effect of the notification error, we lack jurisdiction over that fact-based claim, which appears to reflect simply a disagreement by Mr. Fields with the conclusion reached by the Board after weighing the evidence regarding that claim. Because Mr. Fields\u2019 arguments challenge factual determinations made by the Board and the Veterans Court, and do not appear to raise any legal issue that is within our jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AlO\">. Although several cases cited by the Veterans Court stand for the proposition that the burden is on the veteran to show prejudicial error, a proposition that is contrary to our decision in <em>Sanders, </em>the Veterans Court satisfied itself, by reviewing the record on appeal, that \"the purpose of the notice was not frustrated.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>487 F.3d at 889. The court's decision therefore plainly did not turn 0n the allocation of the burden with regard to showing prejudice,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
