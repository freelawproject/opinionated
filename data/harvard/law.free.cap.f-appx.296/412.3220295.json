Citing <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), he contends that the more recent state drug possession conviction could not constitute an aggravated felony because the State did not plead and prove that he was a recidivist when it obtained the conviction, as is required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(a) and 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Lopez </em>has not altered our holding in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572 (5th Cir.2005), that a second state conviction for simple possession qualifies as an aggravated felony sufficient to support the imposition of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335 (5th Cir.2008). The State\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 844(a) and 851(a) in obtaining the second drug possession conviction does not prohibit the distinct court from enhancing a sentence on this basis. <em>Id. </em>at 336 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
