Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The regulations provide that \u201ca party may file only one motion to reopen,\u201d and that the motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, filed more than 5 years after the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in determining that petitioners failed to allege changed circumstances in Guatemala that would exempt them from the time limits for filing a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-22\">The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate with respect to petitioner Irma Yolanda Palacios-de Castro.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AbF\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
