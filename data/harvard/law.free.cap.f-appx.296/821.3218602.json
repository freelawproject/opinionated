Moore appeals a decision of the U.S. Tax Court finding that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue did not abuse his discretion in determining that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may proceed to collect Moore\u2019s unpaid tax liabilities by levy and imposing a $25,000 penalty for advancing frivolous positions and maintaining the proceedings primarily for delay. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">Moore did not file federal income tax returns for the years 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2001. He filed returns for the years 1998 and 2002, but he did not pay the taxes due for those years. He was audited by the IRS, which issued notices assessing deficiencies, penalties, and interest against him. He did not file petitions in the Tax Court for redetermination. He also failed to pay the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Moore later submitted tax returns for the years 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Based on those returns, the IRS abated Moore\u2019s liability, but Moore still failed to pay. Accordingly, the IRS sent, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6331(d), a final notice of intent to levy and of Moore\u2019s right to a collection due process hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">Moore requested a hearing. He indicated on his hearing request form that he did not agree with the proposed levy because he \u201c[did] not make sufficient money to ... support [him]self.\u201d During his hearing, Moore reiterated his financial hardship, which was the only non-frivolous issue that he raised. He did not otherwise challenge his underlying tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">The IRS officer then discussed collection alternatives with Moore. The officer reviewed Moore\u2019s financial information, which indicated that Moore owned two houses, one of which he rented out; that he used an inaccurately small value for the houses; and that he overstated the amount of encumbrances on those houses. The officer suggested that Moore immediately sell the rental house and apply the net proceeds to the tax liabilities. Moore apparently refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">The IRS subsequently mailed Moore a \u201cnotice of determination concerning collection action(s) under section 6320 and/or 6330.\u201d The IRS attached to its notice a written statement by the officer. The officer indicated that he received more financial information from Moore\u2019s accountant. According to the accountant, Moore was receiving net business income, but was not making his estimated tax payments. Thus, the officer noted that Moore was not entitled to a collection alternative unless and until he became current with his estimated tax payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-17\">Moore timely filed a petition in the Tax Court for review of the notice. Before trial, Moore had refused to cooperate with the IRS\u2019 attempt to establish stipulated facts and exhibits pursuant to Tax Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Rule 91(a). At trial, Moore attempted several times to ask whether the judge and opposing counsel were \u201crequired to take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States\u201d and whether the judge was \u201crequired to abide by [his] oath in performing [his] official duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Anc\">After the court replied multiple times to Moore\u2019s questions by asking whether Moore had any evidence to present, Moore remarked, \u201cI\u2019d just like the citizen-witnesses to make note that the Judge has refused to answer the second question and also the court reporter, I wish I had a silver dollar or something to give you because this is good stuff.\u201d Moore introduced no evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AEC\">The court found that the IRS could proceed with its collection of Moore\u2019s unpaid tax liabilities. The court further imposed a $25,000 penalty pursuant to \u00a7 6673(a) for displaying an \u201cobvious pattern of delay and extensive waste of\u2019 governmental and judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"A_gf\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AHJ\">te Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficieney is presumed correct, and the taxpayer has the burden of proving it is incorrect. The Tax Court\u2019s findings must stand unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Webb v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>872 F.2d 380, 381 (11th Cir.1989) (citations omitted), \u201c[W]here the validity of the underlying tax liability is not properly at issue, the Court will review the Commissioner\u2019s administrative determination for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sego v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>114 T.C. 604, 610 (2000). \u201cReview of the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of statutory damages against a taxpayer is for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>872 F.2d at 381 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AhV\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AuY\">The Tax Court properly found that the IRS Appeals Office did not abuse its discretion in determining that the eollection action could proceed. Tax Court Rule 91(a)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he parties are required to stipulate, to the fullest extent to which complete or qualified agreement can or fajrjy should be reached, all matters not privileged which are relevant to the pending case, regardless of whether such matters involve fact or opinion or the application of law to fact.\u201d If a party refuses 0r fails to stipulate as to \u201cany matter within the terms of [Rule 91], the party proposing [stipulation] may ... file a motion with the Court for an order directing the delinquent party to show cause why the matters covered in the motion should not be deemed admitted for the purposes of the case \u00bb Tax Ct r. 91(f)(1). \u201c[i]f the response is evasive or not fairly directed to the proposed stipulation or portion thereof, that matter or portion thereof will be deemed stipulated for purposes of the pending case, and an order will be issued accordingly.\u201d Tax Ct. R. 91(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">Here, instead of providing \u201cfairly direct ]\u201d responses to the proposed stipulation, <em>see </em>Tax Ct. R. 91(f)(3), Moore asserted that the income tax is unconstitutional; that the income tax applies only to public employees; that the IRS is not a federal agency; that the IRS has no power outside the District of Columbia or \u201cfederal enclaves\u201d; and that the Paperwork Reduetion Act relieves taxpayers from the statutory requirements of filing tax returns and paying taxes. Because Moore\u2019s response to the order to show cause is \u201cnot fairly directed to the proposed stipulation, the Tax Court properly deemed the proposed stipulation established. <em>See </em>Tax Ct. R. 91(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"A9f\">To the extent that Moore seeks in this appeal to challenge his underlying tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>liability documented in the stipulation, he may not do so now. <em>Giamelli v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>129 T.C. 107, 115 (2007) (holding \u201cthat [the Tax Court] do[es] not have authority to consider section 6630(c)(2) issues that were not raised before the Appeals Office\u201d). The parties were limited to the administrative record before the IRS officer, and Moore has failed to show that the officer\u2019s determinations were unsupported by that record. Therefore, we must presume, as the Tax Court did, that the Commissioner\u2019s determinations as to Moore\u2019s tax liability are correct and that the collection action may proceed. <em>See Webb, </em>872 F.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Furthermore, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in assessing a $25,000 penalty against Moore. Section 6673(a) authorizes the Tax Court to impose a penalty not exceeding $25,000 if the taxpayer \u201cmaintain[s] [a proceeding] ... primarily for delay,\u201d \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(A), or \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s position in such proceeding is frivolous.\u201d \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Moore has delayed the resolution of his tax liabilities by providing frivolous, evasive responses to the proposed stipulation. Although Moore was given multiple opportunities to present evidence during his trial, he failed to do so and acted disrespectfully. He</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">belligerently shouted, yelled, and screamed irrelevant questions repeatedly at the Court. [He] repeatedly interrupted the Court and directed disrespectful statements to the Court. Additionally, rather than directing his attention to his case or the Court, [he] shouted and called out to approximately a dozen persons in the gallery disrespectful and irrelevant remarks impugning the integrity of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZP\">Moore characterizes his behavior as a jurisdictional defense, which can be raised at any time during the proceedings. His characterization is implausible. In reality, Moore created a courtroom spectacle by attacking the Tax Court\u2019s integrity, causing further delay. Thus, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing on Moore the maximum penalty under \u00a7 6673(a). <em>Cf. Stearman v. Commissioner, </em>436 F.3d 533, 538 (5th Cir.2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of a $25,000 penalty pursuant to \u00a7 6673(a) on a taxpayer who maintained a frivolous proceeding primarily for delay). For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
