Alep\u00edn raises two challenges to his sentence: (1) whether the district court erred in applying a three-level enhancement to his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (2005) for defendant\u2019s perceived role as a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d in the criminal activity; and (2) whether the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, and excessive, in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Alep\u00edn contends in this latter regard that the district court failed to consider adequately his voluntary withdrawal from the conspiracy years before the charges were brought, his cooperation with authorities, and his subsequent crime-free life. For the reasons stated below, we affirm Ale-pin\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Defendant Alep\u00edn was born and raised in Canada and came to the United States in 1999 to play professional hockey. He retired from hockey in 2004 and is currently a Tennessee resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">On February 27, 2006, the government filed a one-count information charging Ale-pin with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute in excess of 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846. The charge stems from defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>participation, in 2001 and 2002, in the distribution and sale of marijuana brought into the states of New York and Pennsylvania from a source in Quebec, which he then transported, or paid truck drivers to transport, to his residence in Tennessee. Alep\u00edn sold the marijuana to three middlemen, who in turn sold it to a network of other customers. Alep\u00edn ceased his participation in the conspiracy in 2002, although he did not voluntarily turn himself in. The marijuana ring continued to operate, and Alep\u00edn was criminally charged in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On June 21, 2006, Alep\u00edn entered into a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to the one-count information. He cooperated fully with the government in its investigation. Alep\u00edn admitted that he personally received and sold at least 100 kilograms, but less than 400 kilograms, of marijuana while participating in the conspiracy. The parties stipulated to a \u201cFactual Basis\u201d underlying the plea, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJF\">Defendant Alep\u00edn is personally responsible for at least one-hundred (100) kilograms, but less than four-hundred (400) kilograms, of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">From approximately January, 2001, defendant Alep\u00edn received quantities of hydroponic marijuana, also known as \u201ckind bud,\u201d from Jean Claude Dubois and S\u00e9bastien Flocari. Dubois and Flocari arranged for the transportation of this marijuana from sources of supply in Quebec, Canada.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">In 2001, defendant Alep\u00edn traveled to New York City to obtain twenty-to-fifty pound loads of marijuana from couriers who were sent by Dubois and Flocari. Alep\u00edn would then transport this marijuana to his residence in the Eastern District of Tennessee. Defendant Ale-pin paid approximately $2,800 to $2,900 per pound and sold the marijuana for approximately $8,200 per pound to customers in the Eastern District of Tennessee. Luc Hebert, who was known to defendant Alep\u00edn as Poppy, worked for Dubois and Flocari in arranging transportation of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Defendant Alep\u00edn engaged individuals in the Eastern District of Tennessee to transport marijuana from New York and other locations to the Eastern District of Tennessee. Sam Latham went to upstate New York in the summer of 2002 to obtain loads of marijuana from defendant Alepin\u2019s source of supply and transport it to the Eastern District of Tennessee. Dwight Newport made at least one trip to New York to obtain multiple-pound quantities of this marijuana and transport it to the Eastern District of Tennessee. Dwight Newport and Jason Kiser were two of defendant Alepin\u2019s customers in Knoxville, Tennessee. Defendant Alep\u00edn paid Dwight Newport to make trips to Pennsylvania to obtain marijuana. Dwight Newport met a semi tractor trailer at a location in Pennsylvania and obtained approximately 15-20 pounds of hydroponic marijuana and transported it to the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of defendant Alep\u00edn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Coconspirator Flocari arranged for semi tractor trailer deliveries of \u201ckind bud\u201d marijuana to defendant Alep\u00edn in the Eastern District of Tennessee. Co-conspirator Flocari paid drivers to transport the marijuana in hidden compartments located on the trucks. Sometimes, defendant Alep\u00edn met the deliveries of this marijuana by tractor trailer trucks at least three times at locations in Strawberry Plains, Tennessee. Dwight Newport accompanied defendant Alep\u00edn on at least one of these trips.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">A presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared and provided to the parties. In light of the stipulated amount of marijua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>na, Alepin\u2019s base offense level was set at</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">26. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), the probation officer added four levels for Ale-pin\u2019s involvement as an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of a criminal activity involving five or more participants, but made a three-level downward adjustment for defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. His post-adjustment total offense level was therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">27. With a criminal history category of I (no prior criminal record), the resultant advisory Guidelines range was 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), the applicable statutory minimum sentence is 5 years, with a maximum of 40 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Defendant objected to the recommended four-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), arguing that he had no leadership role in the conspiracy. The government filed a motion for downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Based on Alepin\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation and his lack of criminal history, the government recommended a sentence of 42 months, a forty-percent reduction from the bottom end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">At the sentencing hearing held on November 29, 2006, defense counsel objected to Alepin\u2019s classification as an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d and resultant sentence enhancement. Defense counsel emphasized that he was not challenging the Factual Basis for the guilty plea, but argued that defendant was not a leader or organizer, particularly in light of the fact that the conspiracy continued for quite some time without him, until the other participants were finally arrested. Defense counsel urged leniency based on defendant\u2019s voluntary withdrawal from the criminal activity, his cooperation with the government\u2019s investigation, his lack of criminal history and concomitant low risk of recidivism, strong family support, and his reformed, exemplary behavior since 2002. Numerous letters from local friends and family were introduced, attesting to Alepin\u2019s positive contributions to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Alep\u00edn testified at the sentencing hearing, confirming the undisputed facts underlying his guilty plea. He testified that he lost his construction and landscaping business as a result of his incarceration in this case and expressed remorse for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The district court ultimately assessed a three-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for defendant\u2019s role as a \u201cmanager or supervisor,\u201d rather than the recommended four-level enhancement as an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). In doing so, the court noted in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">Mr. Alep\u00edn, according to the factual basis agreed upon by you and the Government concerning the actual criminality you\u2019ve been charged here with, you made trips to various places \u2014 New York, maybe Pennsylvania, maybe up here at Straw Plains \u2014 on numerous occasions; and you obtained marijuana in large quantities, 15 to 20 to 30 pounds at a time. And you divided that up among some other people, local people here; and they sold it to local consumers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">You were, therefore, a \u2014 in the Court\u2019s opinion \u2014 a manager or supervisor of this conspiracy. And a three-level increase pursuant to [\u00a7 3Bl.l(b)] is warranted, but not as ... an organizer or leader but as a manager and supervisor only so that your base offense level is 26. With a criminal history category of I, the advisory guideline range is 63 to 78 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">Taking into consideration the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure of forty percent based on defendant\u2019s substantial assistance and the nature and circumstances of the offense and defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>history, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and sentenced Alep\u00edn to thirty-eight months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Alep\u00edn now timely appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">First, Alep\u00edn maintains that the factual findings set forth by the district court at the sentencing hearing do not support the application of the managerial role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). He argues that the court neither made the requisite findings of fact regarding the number of people involved in the conspiracy nor determined whether he engaged in a leadership or managerial role over another participant. Alep\u00edn further suggests that there is no proof in the record that he exercised control over his customers\u2019 sales of marijuana to others (in terms of price, quantity, or customer) or that he received a larger share of the fruits of the crime than other members in the conspiracy, so as to support the enhancement. He contends that although he conceded, per the Factual Basis, that he would \u201cengage others\u201d to transport marijuana, he made no admission that he <em>directed </em>others in the operation. In short, Alep\u00edn argues that his relationship with the other coconspirators was merely that of buyer and seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Although the appropriate standard of review of a Guidelines role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 remains an open question in our court, <em>see United States v. Moncivais, </em>492 F.3d 652, 660 (6th Cir. 2007), we need not settle the issue here because the present circumstances support affirmance of the enhancement under either option \u2014 a deferential or de novo standard of review. The burden lies with the government to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a particular sentencing enhancement applies. <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>323 F.3d 480, 491 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, increase the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">(a) If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">(b) If the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">(c) If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 (2005). Application Note 1 to \u00a7 3B1.1 defines a \u201cparticipant\u201d as \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">Application Note 2 of the Commentary accompanying this Guideline further explains that \u201c[t]o qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d <em>See also Moncivais, </em>492 F.3d at 661 (\u201c\u2018[Tjhere need only be evidence to support a finding that the defendant was a manager or supervisor of at least one other participant in the criminal activity, and that the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Henley, </em>360 F.3d 509, 517 (6th Cir.2004)). Application Note 4 to \u00a7 3B1.1 sets forth the factors to be considered in classifying the defendant\u2019s role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\">In distinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision, titles such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201ckingpin\u201d or \u201cboss\u201d are not controlling. Factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning and organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">It is not necessary that a defendant meet each of these requirements. <em>United States v. Gates, </em>461 F.3d 703, 709 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Ospina, </em>18 F.3d 1332, 1337 (6th Cir.1994)). \u201cThe key issue is not direct control or ultimate decision-making authority, but rather the defendant\u2019s \u2018relative responsibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henley, </em>360 F.3d at 517 (citing <em>United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, </em>148 F.3d 577, 595-96 (6th Cir.1998)). \u201c \u2018Merely playing an essential role in the offense is not equivalent to exercising managerial control over other participants and/or the assets of a criminal enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lalonde, </em>509 F.3d 750, 765 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Vandeberg, </em>201 F.3d 805, 811 (6th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In the present case, Alep\u00edn concedes that the conspiracy involved five or more participants. Defense counsel admitted that defendant played an \u201cintegral part\u201d in the conspiracy because he \u201cbrought dope from Point A to Point B.\u201d He nonetheless maintained that defendant was not a leader or supervisor of the dope-smuggling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">However, as the government argues persuasively, the Factual Basis clearly indicates that Alep\u00edn was the link between his Canadian suppliers \u2014 Dubois and Flocari \u2014 and the three Tennessee distributors \u2014 Latham, Newport, and Kaiser. During a two-year period, he was responsible for the delivery of between 100 and 400 kilograms of marijuana from Canada to Tennessee. He paid the Canadian sources $2,800 to $2,900 a pound and resold the marijuana to the three distributors for $3,200 a pound. Alep\u00edn was notified when a shipment from Canada was ready to be delivered and, if he was unable to pick it up in person, he sent someone else to do so. The Factual Basis details specific instances in which Alep\u00edn \u201cengaged\u201d both Latham and Newport to travel to upstate New York to retrieve and transport a load of marijuana from defendant\u2019s Canadian sources, and another separate occasion when Newport met a semi-tractor trailer in Pennsylvania and transported the marijuana to Tennessee \u201con behalf of Alep\u00edn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">This is consistent with a managerial or supervisory role. Alep\u00edn received a call from Canada, determined how the marijuana was going to be picked up, sent another participant in the conspiracy to retrieve it if he was unavailable, and handled the distribution among the three dealers, making a profit on each pound. We have affirmed a district court\u2019s imposition of managerial role sentencing enhancements under similar circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Henley, </em>360 F.3d at 517 (evidence sufficient to support \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement where the defendant controlled as many as four other persons in the flow of drugs and to help him collect drug debts); <em>United States v. Solorio, </em>337 F.3d 580, 601 (6th Cir.2003) (supervisory-role enhancement affirmed where uncontroverted evidence showed that the defendant recruited another participant as an accomplice in a drug conspiracy, planned and directed all of recruit\u2019s drug activities, and recruit delivered bags of cocaine and money and kept records for the defendant); <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>233 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir.2000) (finding no error in application of \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement where evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>showed that the defendant \u201cwas in repeated contact with the informant [in scheduled drug deal] and played a role in coordinating both the delivery of and payment for the amphetamine.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bingham, </em>81 F.3d 617, 629-30 (6th Cir.1996) (imposition of managerial-role enhancement not clearly erroneous where evidence showed that the defendant was source of supply of crack cocaine, contacted supplier, negotiated purchase price, and made arrangements for couriers to transport cocaine from New York to Ohio).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Most recently, in <em>United States v. Jeross, </em>521 F.3d 562 (6th Cir.2008), we held that the district court did not err in imposing the \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement in light of testimony establishing that one of the defendants handled drug transactions with individual distributor-sellers, received drugs from Canada, permitted pills to be repackaged for distribution in her home, doled out the repackaged pills to four or five distributors, kept financial and transactional records, collected profits that distributors returned to her, and passed profits on to another participant. \u201cHer role as a distributor may have placed her \u2018in the middle of the drug distribution chain\u2019 as she asserts, but it was no less important for that reason, and does not preclude the finding that she was a manager who exercised decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Here, Alepin\u2019s managerial status in the conspiracy is likewise supported by the stipulated Factual Basis and the district court\u2019s sufficient factual findings pertaining to his role in the offense. A \u201creasonable reading of the district court\u2019s discussion of the evidence on this issue\u201d justifies the court\u2019s application of the three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). <em>United States v. Caseslorente, </em>220 F.3d 727, 735 (6th Cir.2000) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We therefore conclude that enhancement of Alepin\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was pi\u2019oper.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Alep\u00edn next contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable and excessive under the circumstances. His claim of unreasonableness is based upon the district court\u2019s alleged failure to consider adequately, and address expressly, all of the relevant sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, including Alepin\u2019s post-offense, pre-arrest rehabilitation, his cooperation with authorities, the loss of his business and damage to his reputation, and his admission of guilt. Alep\u00edn notes that it is undisputed that he voluntarily stopped his illegal activities and withdrew from the conspiracy in 2002. Alep\u00edn further asserts that his sentence is excessive in view of the statutory requirement that the sentence be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to fulfill the statutory sentencing goals, as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentencing determination for procedural and substantive reasonableness, using a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Houston, </em>529 F.3d 743, 753 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). When we undertake reasonableness review of a sentence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0v\">we first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.]\u00a7 3553(a) factors ... or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. Assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. For a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>sentence to be substantively reasonable, it must be proportionate to the seriousness of the circumstances of the offense and offender, and sufficient but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><em>United States v. Curry, </em>536 F.3d 571, 573 (6th Cir.2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u201cSection \u00a7 3553(a) mandates that a district court imposing a sentence consider the defendant\u2019s guideline range; the nature of the offense; the characteristics of the defendant; the need to deter criminal conduct, protect the public, and provide the defendant with appropriate treatment; and the need to avoid sentencing disparities with defendants who have been found guilty of the same conduct and who have similar criminal histories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573-74. A ritual incantation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to affirm a sentence is not required. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 709 (6th Cir.2006). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Alepin\u2019s below-the-Guidelines sentence is presumed not to be unreasonably severe. <em>Curry, </em>536 F.3d at 573. Moreover, because Alep\u00edn made no objection to the sentence after the district court announced it, the procedural reasonableness of the sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>516 F.3d 479, 486-87 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc)). Thus, Alep\u00edn must show (1) error, (2) that was obvious or clear, (3) that affected his substantial rights, and (4) that affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>516 F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir.2008). This is a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>id., </em>which Alep\u00edn has not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The sentencing record reflects that the district court listened to Alepin\u2019s arguments and testimony and interspersed pertinent questions and comments throughout the hearing. The district court acknowledged, albeit in general terms, the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained that these factors supported a sentence at the bottom of the recommended Guidelines range. The court acknowledged Alepin\u2019s good behavior and community reputation, but further noted that defendant did not withdraw \u201csoon enough\u201d and did not turn himself in. The court carefully considered Alepin\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement and accepted his argument in part, recalculating the advisory Guidelines range in light of its determination that defendant was a manager/supervisor, not an organizer or leader in the conspiracy. The district court then departed downward forty percent from the applicable Guidelines range of 63 to 78 months based upon Alepin\u2019s substantial assistance and imposed a 38-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In sum, the record demonstrates that the district court considered each of defendant\u2019s arguments in mitigation, but found that these arguments did not merit a lower sentence. Alep\u00edn has not shown that the district court\u2019s statement of reasons was plainly erroneous or that any omissions in the court\u2019s sentencing analysis affected his substantial rights. Notwithstanding Ale-pin\u2019s good behavior since pulling out of the marijuana distribution conspiracy, he was involved in and profited from a sizeable drug operation. We therefore conclude that Alepin\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
