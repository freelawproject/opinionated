R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen removal proceedings after he was ordered removed in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen \u201cfor an abuse of discretion, although de novo review applies to the BIA\u2019s determination of purely legal questions.\u201d <em>Mejia v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 873, 876 (9th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">A motion to reopen an in absentia removal order based on lack of notice must be filed before the Immigration Judge in the first instance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b); <em>In Re: Guzman-Arguera, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The BIA thus did not err in finding that it lacked, jurisdiction in the first instance to consider petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen asserting that he had not received proper notice of the hearing. In addition, to the extent that petitioner\u2019s \u201cmotion to reopen and rescind\u201d sought reopening of the denial of petitioner\u2019s first motion to reopen his in absentia removal order, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the second motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). This petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
