Office of Pers. Mgmt. </em>108 M.S.P.R. 154 (2008). Because the Board did not abuse its discretion or otherwise commit legal error in its decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">On July 1, 1982, Wonsock, who at that time was employed as a patrol officer for the U.S. Capitol Police, cancelled her enrollment in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (\u201cFEHBP\u201d). At some point after retiring from her job in 1998, Wonsock sought to enroll in FEHBP as a retiree. In a letter dated April 7, 2005, the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) denied Wonsock\u2019s request because she did not meet the statutory requirements for reenrollment, nor was she eligible for a waiver of those requirements. The letter informed Wonsock that she had thirty days in which to appeal OPM\u2019s decision. She did not do so for nearly two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">On March 16, 2007, Wonsock appealed OPM\u2019s denial to the Board. In her appeal, she claimed that her delay in filing an appeal was due to the fact that she had been \u201cmore or less forced\u201d to opt out of FEHBP by her husband and that she had found her paperwork only after being subjected to \u201cone of the Florida hurricanes.\u201d The administrative judge assigned to the case found that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.110. <em>Wonsock v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>AT-0831-07-0802-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 22, 2007). The AJ then affirmed OPM\u2019s denial of Wonsock\u2019s appeal, finding that OPM\u2019s decision was not unreasonable or an abuse of its discretion. <em>Id. </em>Wonsock timely appealed the AJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">While Wonsock\u2019s appeal to the Board was pending, OPM filed a cross-petition, arguing for the first time that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Wonsock did not file a response to OPM\u2019s cross-petition. On February 20, 2008, the Board vacated the initial decision of the AJ, granted OPM\u2019s cross-petition, and dismissed Wonsock\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board found that OPM\u2019s decision not to grant Wonsock a waiver was unreviewable by the Board pursuant to 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 8905(b) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Wonsock timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Whether the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate a particular appeal is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Conyers v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>388 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2004) <em>(citing Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir. 1998)). The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to actions specifically made appealable by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a); <em>see Todd v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>55 F.3d 1574, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1995). Wonsock, as the appellant, must show by a preponderance of evidence that the Board had jurisdiction over her claim. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">On appeal Wonsock resumes her claim that she was injured on duty as a police officer and that her injury led to her retirement. She again requests to be allowed to enroll in FEHBP. She does not address the jurisdictional issues underlying the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In response, the government contends that whether or not Wonsock was injured on duty is irrelevant because OPM\u2019s decision not to waive the statutory requirements for FEHBP eligibility is unreviewable by the Board. The government urges this court to uphold the Board\u2019s decision finding lack of jurisdiction over Wonsock\u2019s case. It is undisputed that Wonsock was not statutorily eligible for FEHBP and, according to the government, OPM\u2019s decision not to waive the statutory requirements in Wonsock\u2019s case is unreviewable by the Board. In support of its argument that OPM\u2019s waiver determination is not reviewable by the Board, the government points to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8905(b) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306(a)(1). Thus, the government argues, the Board lacks jurisdiction to review OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision dismissing Wonsock\u2019s appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">We agree with the government. Although the Board\u2019s decision might preferably be affirmed on the ground that Won-sock\u2019s appeal was untimely, we affirm on the ground that the Board ultimately adopted. Wonsock has not argued that the Board\u2019s analysis was incorrect. Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations details the eligibility requirements for FEHBP benefits. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306 is entitled, \u201cWhen can annuitants ... reenroll.\u201d That section lists three situations in which an annuitant can reenroll in FEHBP: \u201chaving been covered by a plan under this part for the 5 years of service immediately before retirement,\u201d or having been covered \u201cfor all service since his or her first opportunity to enroll,\u201d or if \u201cOPM waives the requirement under \u00a7 890.108.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306(a)(1) (2008); <em>see also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8905(b) (2004). Wonsock does not contend that she was covered for the 5 years immediately preceding her retirement in 1998, nor that she was covered during her entire period of eligibility. Thus, she relies only on the third manner of reenrollment, namely, OPM waiving the eligibility requirements pursuant to \u00a7 890.108.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.108(a) details the process by which OPM can waive an annuitant\u2019s FEHBP eligibility requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">... OPM may waive the eligibility requirements for health benefits coverage as an annuitant for an individual when, <em>in its sole discretion, </em>it determines that due to exceptional circumstances it would be against equity and good conscience not to allow a person to be enrolled in the FEHB Program as an annuitant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.108(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">The Board has consistently held that the phrase \u201cin its sole discretion\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00a7 890.108(a) places OPM waiver determinations beyond the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>82 M.S.P.R. 149 (1987). In this case the Board was compelled by its own precedent to dismiss Wonsock\u2019s appeal, absent a preponderance of evidence demonstrating that the Board did indeed possess jurisdiction. Wonsock has not disputed this long-standing precedent, nor otherwise attempted to convince this court that the Board was incorrect in finding that it lacked jurisdiction. Therefore, Wonsock has not demonstrated that the Board abused its discretion or otherwise committed legal error. Because the Board lacks jurisdiction to review OPM\u2019s decision in this case, we need not and cannot address the untimeliness of Wonsock\u2019s appeal, or the merits of her case. Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>No costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
