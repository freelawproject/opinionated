He appeals his sentence of 90 months in custody followed by three years of supervised release. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Cabrera argues for the first time on appeal that the district judge unreasonably rejected his mitigation argument by considering <em>ex parte </em>information. We review for plain error, which is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, we need not decide whether the judge erred, because Cabrera has failed to show that he would have received a different sentence if the judge had not considered the <em>ex paite </em>information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge did not rely on the <em>ex parte </em>information when calculating the guideline range or tailoring Cabrera\u2019s sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The record shows that the judge\u2019s reasons for rejecting Cabrera\u2019s mitigation arguments did not rely on the <em>ex parte </em>communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">Cabrera also argues that the judge placed undue weight on the advisory Guideline range. The district judge expressly stated that she recognized that the Guideline range was a \u201cstarting point.\u201d After correctly calculating the Guideline range, the judge carefully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and gave reasons for rejecting each of Cabrera\u2019s mitigation arguments. For Cabrera\u2019s within-Guideline sentence, this explanation was sufficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-19\">The condition that requires Cabrera to report to a probation officer \u201cwithin 72 hours of release from any custody or any reentry to the United States during the period of Court-ordered supervision\u201d does not violate the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is premature to decide Cabrera\u2019s Fifth Amendment challenge to the additional condition requiring him to \u201canswer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>United States v. Abbouchi,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nothing prevents Cabrera from asserting his Fifth Amendment privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>lege should the situation arise. We therefore decline to reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
