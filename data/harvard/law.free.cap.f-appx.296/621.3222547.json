R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Plaintiff-Appellant Christopher Koch filed this <em>pro se </em>action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that 1997 and 1998 amendments to the Oklahoma parole statutes resulted in ex post facto punishment and violated his due process rights. The district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">In 1981, Koch was tried for and convicted of Murder in the First Degree in Oklahoma state court. He received a life sentence with the possibility of parole, which he is currently serving with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Under the parole system in existence at the time of Koch\u2019s conviction, the Pardon and Parole Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) would annually consider for parole any inmate serving forty-five years or longer, including a life sentence, after he or she had served fifteen years. <em>See Shirley v. Chestnut, </em>603 F.2d 805, 806-07 (10th Cir.1979) (describing the features of this system). Accordingly, Koch first became eligible for parole in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">As a response to prison overcrowding, in 1988 the Oklahoma legislature created a system known as prepar\u00f3le conditional supervision (\u201cprepar\u00f3le\u201d). <em>See </em>1988 Okla. Sess. Laws 310, \u00a7 8. In <em>Young v. </em>Harper; 520 U.S. 143, 117 S.Ct. 1148, 137 L.Ed.2d 270 (1997), the Supreme Court described the essential features of prepar\u00f3le:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">[Prepar\u00f3le] was in effect whenever the population of the prison system exceeded 95% of its capacity. An inmate could be placed on prepar\u00f3le after serving 15% of his sentence, and he was eligible for parole when one-third of his sentence had elapsed. The Pardon and Parole Board (Board) had a role in the placement of both parolees and preparolees. The Board itself determined who could participate in [prepar\u00f3le], while the Governor, based on the Board\u2019s recommendation, decided whether a prisoner would be paroled.... [Participants in prepar\u00f3le were released subject to constraints similar to those imposed on parolees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 145, 117 S.Ct. 1148 (citations omitted). According to Koch, he was initially considered for and denied prepar\u00f3le in 1995. He further alleges that from 1996 to 1998, the Board considered him for and denied him both parole and prepar\u00f3le annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">In 1997, the Oklahoma legislature enacted the Truth in Sentencing Act, which amended the statute authorizing prepar\u00f3le and replaced prepar\u00f3le with \u201cspecialized parole.\u201d <em>See </em>1997 Okla. Sess. Laws 133, \u00a7 28. The eligibility requirements for specialized parole differ from the eligibility requirements for prepar\u00f3le in several key respects. The availability of specialized parole does not depend on prison capacity. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 365. Under the new regime, only inmates within one or two years of their projected release dates are eligible for specialized parole. <em>Id. </em>As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>a result of this amendment, Koch was no longer considered for prepar\u00f3le beginning in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In 1998, the Oklahoma legislature further amended the parole statutes, authorizing the Board to defer parole consideration for up to three years for any individual who had been convicted of a violent crime and who had been denied parole previously. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 332.7(D)(1). As a result of this amendment, after being considered for and denied parole in 1998, Koch was considered again only in 2001 and 2005, rather than annually, and was denied parole both times.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">On January 4, 2007, Koch filed this \u00a7 1983 action against J.D. Daniels in his official capacity as Deputy Director of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. Koch alleged that the 1997 and 1998 amendments to the parole statutes constituted ex post facto punishments and violated his due process rights. Koch\u2019s complaint was referred to a United States magistrate judge for preliminary review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Before Daniels had filed an answer to the complaint, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation determining that Koch\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and recommending that the complaint be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A&lt;b)(l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the Report and Recommendation concluded that the 1997 and 1998 amendments did not produce a sufficient risk of increasing Koch\u2019s punishment and thus did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, and that Koch had no constitutionally-cognizable liberty interest in annual consideration for parole or in consideration for prepar\u00f3le. The Report and Recommendation also concluded that Koch\u2019s claims accrued no later than 2001, when he should have known that he was no longer being considered for prepar\u00f3le or for parole on an annual basis, and that the claims were thus barred by Oklahoma\u2019s two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Koch filed an objection to this Report and Recommendation. On July 10, 2007, the district court, having considered Koch\u2019s objections, adopted the Report and Recommendation and dismissed Koch\u2019s claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">A. Jurisdiction and the Mailbox Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">\u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement,\u201d and in the absence of a timely notice of appeal, a case \u201cmust be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) and Rule 4(a)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Koch\u2019s notice of appeal was due within thirty days of entry of judgment. The final judgment from which Koch appeals was entered on July 10, 2007, and Koch\u2019s notice of appeal was therefore due by August 9, 2007. His</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>notice of appeal, however, was not filed in the district court until August 10, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Due to the untimely filing of Koch\u2019s notice of appeal, this court issued an order directing Koch to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed. In response, Koch filed a response stating that he placed his notice of appeal into the prison\u2019s \u201clegal mail box ... located within the prison law library\u201d on August 8, 2007. Aplt. Resp. to Show Cause Order at 1 111. Attached to the response as Exhibit B was a document titled \u201cRequest to Staff,\u201d which stated that Koch deposited an envelope addressed to the district court into the prison\u2019s mail system on August 8. This document was signed by an unidentified person, presumably an employee of the prison\u2019s mail room.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">As an inmate confined in an institution, Koch\u2019s filings are subject to the \u201cprison mailbox rale\u201d set foi'th in Rule 4(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which provides that \u201c[i]f an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution\u2019s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing.\u201d Thus, under this rule, \u201ca notice of appeal filed by a prisoner is deemed filed on the date the prisoner deposits the notice in the prison mail system, and not on the date when it is received by the clerk of the court.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Jones, </em>507 F.3d 640, 643 (7th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 275-76, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988)). Rule 4(c)(1) also provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">[i]f an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rale. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">We have read Rule 4(c)(1) to provide two ways for an inmate to establish timely filing under the prison mailbox rule. <em>Price v. Philpot, </em>420 F.3d 1158, 1165 (10th Cir. 2005). An inmate can show timely filing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARp\">by either (1) alleging and proving that he or she made timely use of the prison\u2019s legal mail system if a satisfactory system is available, or (2) if a legal system is not available, then by timely use of the prison\u2019s regular mail system in combination with a notarized statement or a declaration under penalty of perjury of the date on which the documents were given to prison authorities and attesting that postage was prepaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWY\"><em>Id. </em>at 1166 (citing <em>United States v. Ceballos-Martinez, </em>387 F.3d 1140,1144-45 (10th Cir.2004)). The appellant bears the burden of proving compliance with the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">After Koch filed his response to the show cause order, this court appointed counsel to represent him on appeal. Appointed counsel subsequently filed, and this court granted, a motion to supplement the record with (a) a \u201cjoint stipulation of jurisdictional facts\u201d wherein the parties agreed that Koch had deposited his notice of appeal in the prison\u2019s legal mail system on August 8, 2007; (b) a copy of the prison\u2019s legal mail log showing that Koch deposited his notice of appeal on August 8; and (c) a description of the prison\u2019s legal mail procedures. In addition, Koch filed a \u201csupplemental declaration of compliance\u201d in this court. In this declaration, which is notarized, Koch swears \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d that his notice of appeal was placed in the prison\u2019s legal mail system on August 8, 2007 \u201cwith first-class postage prepaid.\u201d <em>See </em>Aplt. Br., Attach. A. These documents, taken together, are sufficient to establish that Koch used the legal mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>system under the first test. Thus, Koch has proven that his notice of appeal was timely filed in accordance with the \u201cprison mailbox rule,\u201d and that we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">B. The District Court\u2019s Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A and/or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c)(l). <em>McBride v. Deer, </em>240 F.3d 1287, 1289 (10th Cir.2001). \u201c[I]n reviewing the dismissal of a complaint, all well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from eonelusory allegations, must be taken as true. In addition, we will take the allegations in the plaintiffs objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation, quotations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">1. Alleged Ex Post Facto Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The United States Constitution prohibits states from passing any \u201cex post facto Law.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. As the Supreme Court explained, this clause \u201cforbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 30, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981). \u201cRetroactive changes in laws governing parole of prisoners, in some instances, may be violative of this precept.\u201d <em>Garner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 250, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000). A retroactive change to a parole law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it creates \u201ca sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 509, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">A retroactive law may not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause on its face, yet may still be applied in a way that increases a convict\u2019s punishment and therefore violates the Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 255-57, 120 S.Ct. 1362. Where, however, \u201cthe rule does not by its own terms show a significant risk\u201d of heightened punishment, to succeed on an as-applied challenge, \u201cthe petitioner must demonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule\u2019s practical implementation, that its retroactive application will result in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier rule.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Scott, </em>260 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.2001) (citation, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). In prior decisions, this court has concluded that the amendments to the Oklahoma parole system that are at issue in Koch\u2019s appeal do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. While these cases do not address the specific circumstances of Koch\u2019s case, they provide a starting point for addressing his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">In <em>Powell v. Ray, </em>301 F.3d 1200 (10th Cir.2002), this court considered whether the 1997 amendment that eliminated prepar\u00f3le violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. \u201c[T]he controlling inquiry\u201d for this purpose was whether \u201cthe elimination of [prepar\u00f3le] created more than a speculative risk that [an inmate\u2019s] prison term would be increased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203. We noted that under the pre-1997 statute, \u201cthe determination of whether a prisoner would be entitled to [prepar\u00f3le] was wholly discretionary\u201d on the part of the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 1204. As a result, it was \u201cpure speculation\u201d for Powell to argue that the elimination of prepar\u00f3le increased the term of his incarceration or prolonged his punishment, particularly where he had been denied parole just over a year after he would have been considered for prepar\u00f3le. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Similarly, in <em>Henderson, </em>260 F.3d at 1216-17, this court rejected an ex post facto challenge to the 1998 amendment lengthening for violent criminals the period between parole reviews from one to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>three years. Noting that the Supreme Court had previously rebuffed similar challenges to California and Georgia statutory amendments, <em>see Garner, </em>529 U.S. at 254, 120 S.Ct. 1362; <em>Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 510-11, 115 S.Ct. 1597, this court concluded that the Oklahoma amendment also passed constitutional muster. In reaching this conclusion, we specifically noted that the amendment: (1) \u201cdoes not change the length of the sentence in any way\u201d; (2) \u201cdoes not affect the timing of the initial parole consideration, only of subsequent parole consideration dates\u201d; (3) \u201creserves the Board\u2019s discretion to reconsider parole before the three-year period has expired\u201d; and (4) permits the Board to \u201cmodify parole consideration dates if the Board receives new information.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>260 F.3d at 1216-17; <em>see also Seegars v. Ward, </em>124 Fed.Appx. 637, 638-39 (10th Cir.2005) (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim; change to plaintiffs parole eligibility dates \u201ccould not have altered the definition of criminal conduct nor increased punishment for a crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Koch acknowledges these cases. He argues, however, that they do not foreclose relief in the present case because these prior cases considered the elimination of prepar\u00f3le and the lengthening of parole consideration periods from one to three years <em>in isolation, </em>and did not consider \u201cthe cumulative impact\u201d of the 1997 and 1998 amendments. Aplt. Br. at 36. He argues that even if the 1997 and 1998 amendments, taken alone, do not give rise to an ex post facto violation (either facially or as applied to the facts of his case), when they are taken together they create a risk of increased punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Even assuming that the cumulative impact of otherwise enforceable laws can constitute an ex post facto violation, this theory does not aid Koch. As stated, the Ex Post Facto Clause \u201cforbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 30, 101 S.Ct. 960 (emphasis added). Prepar\u00f3le did not exist until it was created by statute in 1988, long after Koch\u2019s 1981 conviction. By later eliminating prepar\u00f3le, the legislature did not increase Koch\u2019s potential punishment beyond what it had been when he committed his crime in 1981, but at most returned it to what it was in 1981. Thus, even under Koch\u2019s \u201ccumulative impact\u201d theory, the only impact that matters for ex post facto purposes is the impact of the 1998 amendment, which lengthened the period between parole reviews from one year, as was the practice at the time of Koch\u2019s crime and conviction, to three years. As discussed, this court held in <em>Henderson </em>that the 1998 amendment does not constitute a facial ex post facto violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">2. Alleged Due Process Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, concluded that Koch\u2019s due process claims should be dismissed because Koch had no constitutionally-protected liberty interest in either prepar\u00f3le consideration or in annual consideration for parole. The Due Process Clause \u201conly applies when government action deprives a person of liberty or property.\u201d <em>United States v. Hampshire, </em>95 F.3d 999, 1005 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Cofr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979)). Thus, although the Due Process Clause provides both substantive and procedural protections, as an essential component of any due process analysis under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we must first address whether the plaintiff has identified a liberty or property interest of which he or she has been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>prived. <em>Nichols v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>506 F.3d 962, 969 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u201cA liberty interest may arise from the Constitution itself, by reason of guai'antees implicit in the word \u2018liberty,\u2019 or it may arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 221, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005) (citations omitted). Here, Koch claims that the 1997 and 1998 amendments violated his \u201cliberty interest in parole and in participation in the parole consideration process.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 38. He admits that \u201c[t]here is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence,\u201d and concedes that he therefore has no constitutionally-derived interest in the parole and prepar\u00f3le consideration procedures. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Greenholtz, </em>442 U.S. at 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100). He argues, however, that the statutes relating to prepar\u00f3le and parole <em>created </em>such an interest. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (\u201c[S]tates may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d). We disagree with Koch\u2019s characterization of the statutes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A statute that \u201cholds out the <em>possibility </em>of parole provides no more than a mere hope that the benefit will be obtained,\u201d and this hope \u201cis not protected by due process.\u201d <em>Greenholtz, </em>442 U.S. at 11, 99 S.Ct. 2100 (emphasis in original). A plaintiff may establish more than \u201cmere hope\u201d in a particular outcome where a decisionmaker\u2019s discretion is limited by rule or statute, requiring a particular outcome in given circumstances. <em>Nichols, </em>506 F.3d at 970. Where, however, the decisionmaker \u201cretains discretion and the outcome of the proceeding is not determined\u201d in advance, \u201cno property interest is implicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Koch concedes that this court has concluded that the Oklahoma statutes governing parole and prepar\u00f3le create no liberty or property interest: the decision whether to grant parole or prepar\u00f3le to an inmate lies firmly within the discretion of the Board, the Department of Corrections, and/or the governor. <em>See Boutwell v. Keating, </em>399 F.3d 1203, 1213-15 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding inmate had no due process interest in prepar\u00f3le where statute placed no limitations on the Board\u2019s decision to recommend prepar\u00f3le placement or Department of Corrections\u2019 decision to grant or deny prepar\u00f3le); <em>Shirley, </em>603 F.2d at 807 (holding inmate had no due process interest in parole where statute placed no limitations on Parole Board\u2019s decision to recommend parole or governor\u2019s decision to grant or deny parole). Koch responds to these cases by arguing that \u201cthe framework which these cases apply is fundamentally flawed by overreliance on the discretionary nature of the statutory scheme and thus insufficiently protects rights properly secured to the inmates by the Due Process Clause.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 39. We are, however, \u201cbound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding decision by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Shubargo v. Astrue, </em>498 F.3d 1086, 1088 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993)). Koch suggests that these precedential cases should be overruled, but he points to no authority upon which we could base such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The result is no different if Koch\u2019s asserted interest is not the grant of parole or prepar\u00f3le, but merely his annual consideration for those programs. If Koch has no constitutionally-protected liberty interest in parole or prepar\u00f3le, he can have no interest in how often he is considered for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>them, oi\u2019 even whether he is considered for them at all. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 251 n. 12, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (\u201c[A]n expectation of receiving process is not, without more, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d). Rather, \u201ca liberty interest ... is a substantive interest of an individual; it cannot be the right to demand needless formality. Process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250,103 S.Ct. 1741 (citations omitted); <em>see also Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 763, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005) (stating that an entitlement to \u201cnothing but procedure\u201d cannot be \u201cthe basis for a property interest\u201d). Because there are no constitutionally-protected interests in the process at issue, and because he failed to show an entitlement to a liberty interest in parole or prepar\u00f3le, Koch\u2019s due process claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">3. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Having concluded that there is no merit to Koch\u2019s ex post facto or due process claims, we need not consider the district court\u2019s application of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
