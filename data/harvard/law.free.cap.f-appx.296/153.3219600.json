Jan. 11, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). Here, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Wu\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. An alien seeking to reopen proceedings must file his motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Wu\u2019s August 2007 motion to reopen was untimely where the BIA issued a final order in July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-21\">Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Wu\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not excuse the untimeliness of his motion where Wu failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s purportedly ineffective assistance, particularly in light of <em>In Re J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G. 2008), or that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his claim for the two years he took to find new counsel.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Cekic v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Rabiu v. INS, </em>41 F.3d 879, 882-83 (2d Cir. 1994). Additionally, Wu does not challenge the BIA\u2019s decision insofar as it found that he failed to demonstrate changed country conditions excusing the time limitation for filing his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-16\"> The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider Wu\u2019s argument that he did not learn of his former counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance before hiring a new attorney. However, Wu\u2019s failure to exhaust this particular argument implicates judicially imposed exhaustion requirements, which are mandatory but not jurisdictional. <em>See Lin Zhong v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Regardless, we decline to consider this argument because Wu failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>Id. </em>at 107 n. 1 (\"If the government points out to the appeals court that an issue relied on before that court by a petitioner was not properly raised below, the court must decline to consider that issue, except in those extraordinary situations in which we have held that such issues can be considered even when exhaustion is a jurisdictional matter.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
