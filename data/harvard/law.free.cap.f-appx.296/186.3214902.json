We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-20\">In order to grant Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court was required to find that \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact [existed] and that the movant [wa]s entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A \u201cgenuine\u201d dispute is one for which \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>Nabisco, Inc. v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>220 F.3d 43, 45 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), and a \u201cmaterial\u201d fact is one that \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Overton v. N.Y. State Div. of Military &amp; Naval Affairs, </em>373 F.3d 83, 89 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The summary judgment inquiry requires viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and resolving all ambiguities against the moving party. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We find that the District Court properly viewed the record in the light most favorable to Appellant and correctly applied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to the facts of the case. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). We agree with the District Court that Appellant had established a prima facie case of race and age discrimination under Title VII and the ADEA, respectively, <em>see Pinkney v. EMI Music Pub., </em>No. 02 Civ. 1944(LMM), 2006 WL 2456815, at *8, *12 (S.D.N.Y.2006). We also agree that Appellee articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the treatment Appellant complained of and for her termination. <em>See id. </em>at *8-10, *12. As we held in <em>James v. New York Racing Ass\u2019n, </em>once the defendant employer moving for summary judgment in an employment discrimination case proffers its nondiscriminatory reason, \u201cthe employer will be entitled to summary judgment ... unless the plaintiff can point to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination.\u201d 233 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir.2000). We agree with the District Court that Appellant\u2014 while not required to prove pretext at the summary judgment stage \u2014 failed to adduce sufficient evidence that could reasonably support a finding of prohibited race or age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
