The district court correctly applied existing law in sentencing Dees. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">On 2 October 2007, Dees entered a plea of guilty to one count of possession of ammunition by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). During the sentencing phase, the Middle District of Florida determined that he had more than three prior violent felony convictions, thus making him an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). This conclusion resulted in his final offense level being raised from 25 to 30. Dees objected to the armed career criminal classification as a violation of his right to have all relevant issues, including proof of prior convictions, determined by a jury. The district court overruled his objection and sentenced him to 163 months and 17 days, the statutory minimum sentence less time served for a related offense. On appeal, Dees repeats his objection, arguing that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because the prior convictions supporting his sentence enhancement were neither admitted by him nor proven to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the constitutionality of an enhanced sentence. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). \u2018We will reverse the district court only if any error was harmful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">The Supreme Court has held that the government need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions or allege those prior convictions in its indictment in order to use those convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under the Guidelines. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Dees notes that members of the Supreme Court have questioned the rationale behind this principle. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26-27, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263-64, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring). However, the Court has so far declined to overrule the precedent. <em>See Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2536, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (finding fact of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>prior conviction to be exception to general requirement of jury submission for facts increasing penalty beyond statutory maximum). Accordingly, we are \u201cbound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Based on this controlling precedent, the district court properly overruled Dees\u2019s objection. Dees concedes as much, noting that he primarily is bringing his appeal to preserve the issue in case the Supreme Court decides to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we thus discern no reversible error by the district court in its sentencing of Dees.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Dees appeals the district court\u2019s sentencing based on prior convictions that had not been proven to a jury or otherwise admitted by him. Since Supreme Court and our own precedent hold that prior convictions need not be proven to a jury nor admitted by the defendant to enhance a sentence, Dees\u2019s argument is without merit. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
