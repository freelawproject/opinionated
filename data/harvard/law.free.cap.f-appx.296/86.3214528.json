The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court dismissing the Privacy Act claim be affirmed, and the case be remanded to the district court for consideration of the alleged ex post facto violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">\n<em>MEMORANDUM OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">In connection with the denial of parole, Powers appeals the dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) of his complaint under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Strict liability is not imposed \u201cfor every affirmative or negligent action that might be said technically to violate the Privacy Act\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Albright v. U.S., </em>732 F.2d 181, 189 (D.C.Cir.1984). Accordingly, to state a claim under the Privacy Act, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant acted \u201cintentionally]\u201d or \u201cwillfulfly].\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4). Liability is imposed \u201conly when the agency ... commit[s] the act without grounds for believing it to be lawful, or by flagrantly disregarding others\u2019 rights under the Act.\u201d <em>Albright, </em>732 F.2d at 189. \u201cSomething greater than gross negligence\u201d must be shown. <em>Tijerina v. Walters, </em>821 F.2d 789, 799 (D.C.Cir. 1987); <em>see, e.g., Toolasprashad v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>286 F.3d 576, 583-84 (D.C.Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">Viewing the amended complaint and opposition to the motion to dismiss, <em>Warren v. District of Columbia, </em>353 F.3d 36, 38 (D.C.Cir.2004), we find that Powers fails to allege the requisite willfulness. Powers alleges that the United States Parole Commission failed to respond to his requests to resolve discrepancies in his records, Am. Compl. 113, and, upon setting forth those discrepancies, Powers states: \u201cPlaintiff is not asking the Parole Commission to correct P.S.R., [b]ut only to keep Parole Commission record[s] correct as [to] matters contested ...,\u201d Am. Compl. 115. Although Powers alleges that the Commission \u201chas not maintained] correct records ... and is liable under the Privacy Act,\u201d <em>id., </em>he claims only that the Commission acted \u201cintentionally,\u201d PL\u2019s Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss Compl. at 5, and that its \u201cnegligence\u201d violated his Privacy Act rights, <em>id. </em>The amended complaint thus imputes at most \u201cgross negligence\u201d to the Commission with regard to its maintenance and use of inaccurate records. His opposition memorandum cannot cure this defect by contradicting the complaint. <em>See Henthorn v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>29 F.3d 682, 687-88 (D.C.Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the Privacy Act claim; the claim to add parties is moot. With respect to a claim not addressed by the district court, we remand because Powers sufficiently alleges an ex post facto violation based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>status as a District of Columbia prisoner, Am. Compl. 1f 5, and was not required to proceed by a writ of habeas corpus, <em>Anyanwutaku v. Moore, </em>151 F.3d 1053, 1056 (D.C.Cir.1998); <em>see Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). Powers is considered a District of Columbia prisoner because, although detained in a federal facility, he was convicted and sentenced in the D.C. Superior Court for violations of the District of Columbia Code. <em>Cf Fletcher v. Reilly, </em>433 F.3d 867 (D.C.Cir.2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
