Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred. <em>See id. </em>Petitioner\u2019s arguments as to why the time and numerical limits should not apply to her motion to reopen are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Accordingly, we deny this petition for review because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
