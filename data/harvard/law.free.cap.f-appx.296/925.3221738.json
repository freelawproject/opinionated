Innocent (\u201cInnocent\u201d) petitions for review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing his petition for review as untimely. <em>Innocent v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>108 M.S.P.R. 453 (M.S.P.B. 2008) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision </em>\u201d). Because Innocent has failed to identify any basis for us overturn the Board\u2019s decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">Innocent was a custodial worker with the U.S. Army Garrison in West Point, New York. He was terminated on November 16, 2006, after the Office of Personnel Management discovered that he had made intentional false statements concerning his criminal history. Specifically, Innocent answered \u201cno\u201d to an employment application question asking whether he had been convicted, imprisoned, on probation, or on parole during the preceding ten years. In fact, he had been convicted twice, put on probation once, and incarcerated twice during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">Innocent appealed his termination to the Board on June 22, 2007, and the Board dismissed his appeal as untimely in an initial decision dated September 27, 2007. <em>Innocent v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>NY-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>0731-07-0274-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 27, 2007). Innocent filed a petition for further review on November 24, 2007 \u2014 fifty-eight days after the initial decision. The Board dismissed the petition for further review as untimely, because it was filed more than thirty-five days after the initial decision issued, with no showing of good cause for the delay. <em>Final Decision </em>at 453-54. Innocent petitions for review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">\u201cOur scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Abell v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>343 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)). \u201cThe petitioner bears the burden of establishing error in the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463,1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(d), \u201c[a]ny petition for review must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision [unless] the petitioner shows that the initial decision was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance.\u201d Innocent does not dispute that he filed the petition for review later than thirty-five days after the Board issued its initial decision, and he has not argued that he received the decision more than five days after it issued. His petition is therefore untimely under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The Board has the authority to waive the filing deadline for a petition for review on a showing of good cause for the untimely filing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1201.114(f). \u201cThe [B]oard has held that to establish good cause, the [petitioner must show] that the delay was excusable under the circumstances where diligence or ordinary prudence had been exercised.\u201d <em>Phillips v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (Fed.Cir.1982). \u201c[W]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board\u2019s discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed.Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Innocent argued to the Board that his failure to file a timely petition should be excused because he was confused about the filing deadline and because he was unable to obtain counsel. The Board rejected both arguments, reasoning that the initial decision clearly informed Innocent of the deadline for filing a petition for review, and that Innocent\u2019s inability to obtain counsel could not excuse his untimely filing. <em>Final Decision </em>at 455-56. The Board therefore concluded that Innocent had failed to show good cause for his untimely petition. <em>Id. </em>at 456. Innocent has not identified any reason for us to disturb the Board\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Because the remainder of Innocent\u2019s arguments on appeal concern the merits of his underlying claim \u2014 which are not before us \u2014 rather than the Board\u2019s determination that his petition for review was untimely, we need not and do not address those arguments. We <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
