The district court properly calculated Rivera-Nava\u2019s advisory Sentencing Guidelines range to be 57 to 71 months of imprisonment and sentenced him to 66 months in prison. Rivera-Nava appeals, alleging his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">We review a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). To determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion, we undertake a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). First, we examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural errors,\u201d and second, we evaluate the substance of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Significant procedural errors include improperly calculating the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008) factors, or failing to adequately explain the given sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. Substantive reasonableness entails a review of the totality of the circumstances, and we may presume that a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>Id.; see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">Here, the district court followed the necessary steps in sentencing RiveraNava. The Guidelines range was properly calculated, the court heard from both parties regarding the Guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the court noted that it considered all the factors and concluded that the Guidelines range provided an appropriate basis for determination of sentence. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that court need not \u201crobotically tick through\u201d every subsection of \u00a7 3553(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007). In addition, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to sentence Rivera-Nava in the middle of the Guidelines range, especially when Rivera-Nava himself argued for a sentence within the Guidelines range, noted that the presentence report covered most of the statutory factors, and did not move for a variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
