On appeal, Harris argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court did not exercise individualized discretion and did not consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) in sentencing him. In addition, Harris argues in his reply brief that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), because his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon would no longer be considered a crime of violence for purposes of classifying him as a career offender. We do not reach Harris\u2019s last argument as his failure to properly preserve it in his initial brief on appeal forecloses our present consideration of it. As regards Harris\u2019s remaining arguments, we conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">On 3 January 2008, Harris pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. The district court adjudged him guilty and sentenced him to 151 months of imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the district court calculated Harris\u2019s offense level at 29 with a criminal history category of VI, yielding an advisory guideline range of 151-188 months imprisonment. Hams did not object to the district court\u2019s calculation of the guideline range but did object to his classification as a career offender, claiming that his 2001 conviction for carrying a eoncealed firearm should not be considered by the court as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purpose of enhancing his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harris also renewed his previous request for a sentence below the advisory guideline range, arguing that a sentence within the range would be unreasonable based on his criminal history and in light of the sentences received by his codefendant (Adia Hudson) and co-conspirator (Eric Vandyke).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">On appeal, Harris argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively unreasonable. Specifically, Harris contends that his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his past crimes, his sentence was the product of racial disparities inherent within the guidelines, and his sentence creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity when compared to the sentences of his codefendant and co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">As an initial matter, to the extent that Harris attempts to raise arguments for the first time in his reply brief, we cannot consider them. <em>United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1276 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that \u201cthis Court ... declines to consider issues raised for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief\u201d). We have stated that it is a \u201cwell established rule ... that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). As such, we do not consider Harris\u2019s argument that he does not qualify for sentencing as a career offender because carrying a concealed weapon is no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>considered a crime of violence. We now turn to Harris\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">We review a criminal sentence for reasonableness. Uni<em>ted States v. </em>Booker; 543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In so doing, we employ an abuse-of-discretion standard and follow the two-step process outlined by the Supreme Court in carrying out that review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we must ensure the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate the guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, failing to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\u201cAssuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound,\u201d we \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a sentence is substantively reasonable, we must \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Although we do not presume a sentence within the guidelines is reasonable, we have held that the use of the guidelines remains central to the sentencing process. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Throughout our reasonableness review, we must consider the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the sentencing guidelines\u2019 range; (5) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants with similar records; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (7). When applying these factors to a particular sentence, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.) (internal punctuation and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007). Although the district court must consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when sentencing a defendant, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Because Harris does not allege any procedural error by the district court, we address his arguments regarding the alleged substantive unreasonableness of the district court\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, Harris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>argues that his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his past crimes. He contends that the district court did not properly exercise its sentencing discretion and failed to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its sentencing decision. Harris\u2019s argument is not supported by the record. The district court acknowledged its discretion in imposing a sentence above or below the guidelines. Moreover, the court expressly stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes.... \u201d The district court correctly considered the parties\u2019 statements, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and ultimately found that a sentence at the lowest point of the advisory guideline range was warranted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Harris\u2019s second argument concerns alleged racial disparities inherent in the guidelines. Harris contends that his sentence was the product of such racial disparities and was therefore unreasonable. This argument is misplaced. In condemning the guidelines in general, Harris fails to demonstrate how the district court erred in considering those guidelines, as one of many factors, in fashioning his sentence. Defining and fixing penalties for federal crimes is a Congressional, not a judicial, function. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>333 U.S. 483, 486, 68 S.Ct. 634, 636, 92 L.Ed. 823 (1948). Absent a showing that the guidelines are unconstitutional in general or as applied to Harris \u2014 and here there is no such showing \u2014 Harris\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Finally, Harris argues that his sentence creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity when compared to the sentences of Hudson and Vandyke. Harris contends that the district court did not consider the length of their sentences and that this failure resulted in an unreasonable sentence for him. Again, Harris\u2019s argument is not borne out by the record. First, the district court did consider Hudson and Vandyke\u2019s sentences before determining Harris\u2019s sentence. Second, Harris does not show that either Hudson or Vandyke shared his status as a career offender. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (providing that the court shall consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants <em>with similar records </em>who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Harris appeals his 151-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Because the district court considered the recommended guideline range, along with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and because Harris failed carry his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable, the district court did not err.
