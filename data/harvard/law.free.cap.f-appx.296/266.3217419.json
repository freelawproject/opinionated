Rule of Civ. Pro. 41(b). We will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-21\">In a series of orders entered on March 3 and March 5, 2008, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. In particular, the District Court dismissed the majority of J\u2019Nai\u2019s claims with prejudice. But, concluding that J\u2019Nai\u2019s complaint \u201clack[ed] clarity\u201d and \u201csufficient detail,\u201d the District Court in part disposed of the motions to dismiss without prejudice, granting J\u2019Nai leave to amend her complaint on or before April 3, 2008. <em>See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224 (3d Cir.2008) (discussing Fed.R.Civ.P. 8\u2019s pleading standards in light of <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). J\u2019Nai failed to file an amended complaint. The District Court dismissed the action for failure to prosecute on April 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">We review the District Court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. <em>See Emerson v. Thiel College, </em>296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cWhile we defer to the District Court\u2019s discretion, dismissal with prejudice is only appropriate in limited circumstances and doubts should be resolved in favor of reaching a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have emphasized that \u201cdismissal is a drastic sanction and should be reserved for those cases where there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Donnelly v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>677 F.2d 339, 342 (3d Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-23\">Before entering a punitive dismissal, the District Court is required to make explicit findings regarding the factors enumerated in <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 863, 869 (3d Cir.1984). <em>See Emcasco Ins. Co. v. Sambrick, </em>834 F.2d 71, 74 (3d Cir.1987); <em>see also United States v. $8,221,877.16 in U.S. Currency, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>330 F.3d 141, 161 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201cWe have opined that [the <em>Poulis </em>factors] must be weighed by a District Court in determining whether the harsh sanction of dismissal is justified.\u201d). The <em>Poulis </em>factors that the District Court must consider are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">(1) the extent of the party\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders ...; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party ... was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><em>Poulis, </em>747 F.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This Court\u2019s function is to determine whether the District Court properly balanced the <em>Poulis </em>factors and whether the record supports its findings. <em>See Livera v. First Nat. State Bank of New Jersey, </em>879 F.2d 1186, 1194 (3d Cir.1989) (citing <em>Hicks v. Feeney, </em>850 F.2d 152 (3d Cir.1988)); <em>see also Emcasco, </em>834 F.2d at 74 (noting that \u201c[i]n order that we may properly exercise our function of reviewing for abuse of discretion, we have [] required the district court to make explicit findings concerning the factors it must consider in rendering judgment by ... dismissal\u201d). Here, however, the District Court did not conduct any <em>Poulis </em>analysis. We thus conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing N\u2019Jai\u2019s complaint without making the requisite findings. <em>Livera, </em>879 F.2d at 1193. Given the record presented, we will forego the opportunity to conduct our own <em>Poulis </em>test as it would require factual findings not within the parameters of our review. <em>See id. </em>at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">By failing to conduct a <em>Poulis </em>balancing test, the District Court abused its discretion; therefore, a remand to the District Court for consideration of the <em>Poulis </em>factors is necessary. <em>See id. </em>at 1188. Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order entered April 4, 2008 and will remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. On remand, the District Court may wish to consider J'Nai\u2019s notice of appeal and her \"Response ... Regarding Frivolousness,\u201d filed in this Court on June 20, 2008, in which she alleges that she attempted to submit a timely motion for an enlargement of time in which to file her amended complaint. We express no opinion on the merit of this allegation or the evidence submitted in support of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
