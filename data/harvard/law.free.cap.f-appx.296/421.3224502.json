The district court determined that Gutierrez\u2019s second prior California conviction for possession of methamphetamine qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-23\">Gutierrez argues that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), his second conviction for simple possession of methamphetamine under California law does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d He contends that his two prior drug possession convictions did not establish a prior aggravated felony conviction because the Government did not plead and prove the prior convictions, and he was not convicted under California recidivist enhancement procedures. He recognizes that the Court in <em>Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 630 n. 6, observed in a footnote that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) makes a second possession conviction a federal felony if the Government shows knowing possession and proves a prior possession conviction through the procedures specified in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. However, he argues that under <em>Lopez, </em>the second state possession conviction must be brought under state recidivist procedures that conform to the procedures in \u00a7 844 and \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-24\">We recently rejected the argument raised by Gutierrez. <em>See United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008). The district court properly determined that Gutierrez\u2019s second prior California conviction for possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>methamphetamine was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
