Gates </em>in these actions, with modification. With petitioners\u2019 consent, the cases were removed from the court\u2019s calendar by order filed August 20, 2008. Upon consideration of the Government\u2019s motion for judgment, the response thereto, and the reply; and the Government\u2019s motion to designate as \u201cprotected information\u201d non-classified information in the record on review, the response thereto, the reply, and the Government\u2019s request (contained in the motion for judgment) that it be given a further opportunity to designate and support the designation of protected information, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment in <em>Parhat v. Gates, </em>532 F.3d 834 (D.C.Cir.2008), is hereby entered in these actions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">We direct the Government to release or to transfer the petitioners, or expeditiously to hold a new Combatant Status Review Tribunal. This disposition is without prejudice to petitioners\u2019 right to seek release immediately through a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boumediene v. Bush, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">We note, however, the Government\u2019s representation that \u201c[i]n light of its determination not to expend its limited resources to continue litigating the enemy combatant status of these detainees, the Government will now treat these petitioners ... as if they are no longer enemy combatants.\u201d Accordingly, the Government has assured the court and petitioners\u2019 counsel that it will use \u201cits best efforts to place them in a foreign country.\u201d We note, however, that no issue regarding the places to which these petitioners may be released is before this panel. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">FURTHER ORDERED that the motion to designate be denied without prejudice. Respondents are directed to file, within 30 days of the date of this judgment, a renewed motion in each case, accompanied by a copy of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal record for each petitioner, identifying the specific information for which the Government seeks protected status and pleadings explaining why such designations are warranted in each case. <em>See Parhat, </em>532 F.3d at 836-37, 851-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
