For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">For each fiscal year from 1999 to 2005, ICC through its sole owner Lance Queer entered into a one-year contract with Westmoreland County to provide therapeutic services to special needs children ages 0-3 years old as part of the County\u2019s participation in the Early Intervention (El) Program established under Part C of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Under the IDEA, the County is required to offer families of eligible children a choice among qualified service providers and is required to monitor the performance of the service providers. The County\u2019s El Program is administered through the County\u2019s Mental Health and Mental Retardation Department (MH/MR). Prior to the start of the 2005-2006 fiscal year, the County\u2019s MH/MR Administrator Kathleen Wohlgemuth notified Queer on April 1, 2005, that ICC\u2019s contract would not be renewed. Wohlgemuth informed Queer that he would have the opportunity to meet with the County Commissioners prior to the public meeting at which a vote on whether to renew ICC\u2019s contract would take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">The parties vigorously dispute the basis for the County\u2019s decision not to renew ICC\u2019s contract. In Wohlgemuth\u2019s notification letter to Queer, she indicates that her nonrenewal recommendation \u201cwas based on the unacceptable content in your Plan of Correction dated March 17, 2005.\u201d Queer contends that the real reason ICC\u2019s contract was not renewed was because of comments he made to a state official in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>2004. In March 2004, Queer informed a state official that the County\u2019s MH/MR Program Specialist, Chris Loughner, was improperly denying El services. This criticism was brought to the attention of the County in April 2004. In June 2004, Loughner and his supervisor, Corrine Zecchini, the MR Program Coordinator, met with Queer to discuss various issues pertaining to ICC, including an email in which Queer referred to a County employee as a \u201cshe wolf\u2019; an email sent by Queer to Loughner that contained pornography; promotional activities conducted by Queer and ICC; and training deficiencies. Queer alleges that at the beginning of the meeting Zecchini told him that the County was informed \u201cby a representative of the State that they were contacted by a staff member of [ICC] ... and that they felt wounded and that they wanted to find out through the front door, not the back door.\u201d The County nonetheless renewed ICC\u2019s contract for the 2004-2005 fiscal year, and although the amount of the contract was reduced by about 25%, the County later obtained additional funding to ensure that ICC would be paid for any services it provided beyond the contracted amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In October 2004 the County prepared a report regarding ICC\u2019s performance in which the County identified concerns, strengths, and compliance issues. The County delivered the report to ICC in February 2005 and instructed ICC to provide a \u201cPlan of Correction\u201d to remedy the problems identified in the report. The County also met with Queer in March 2005 to discuss the report in an effort to ensure that Queer was aware of the County\u2019s concerns. Queer\u2019s response to the monitoring report is found in a written letter dated March 17, 2005. The County reacted with alarm to this letter and in particular to the following reference: \u201cIF, there is ever an [ICC] Therapist that defmably demonstrates non alignment to this item of issue, by, or through, error, or omission, or due to a flagrant disregard, i[sic] will probably personally shoot them as this item has[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Upon receipt of this letter, Zecchini shared her concerns with her supervisor, Austin Breegle, the Deputy Administrator of the MH/MR Department. Breegle met with Wohlgemuth who asked Breegle to recommend whether ICC\u2019s contract should be renewed. Breegle conducted an investigation and ultimately recommended that ICC\u2019s contract not be renewed. In an April 21, 2005 memorandum, Breegle listed the following reasons for his recommendation: (1) the \u201cshe-wolf\u201d email; (2) the pornographic email; (3) an incident Breegle witnessed at a County meeting in October 2004 where Queer interrupted the meeting dressed in a hula skirt and coconut bra, and proceeded to make comments about being \u201clei\u2019d by a Queer\u201d as he placed leis around the necks of various individuals; (4) continuing regulatory compliance issues; and (5) the March 17, 2005 letter. Breegle noted that \u201c[t]his lack of insight to the inappropriateness of his behavior and results from it should not be exposed to the families and children of Westmoreland County.\u201d Breegle and Wohlgemuth then met with the County Commissioners and recommended that ICC\u2019s contract for the following year not be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Queer subsequently brought this suit in the District Court, and following the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the County, Queer timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is plenary. <em>Carter v. McGrady, </em>292 F.3d 152, 157 (3d Cir.2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Summary judgment may be granted where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and \u201cthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). We draw \u201call reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>Bailey v. United Airlines, </em>279 F.3d 194, 198 (3d Cir.2002), but the nonmoving party cannot simply rely on unsupported allegations in attempting to survive a summary judgment motion. <em>Williams v. Borough of West Chester, </em>891 F.2d 458, 460 (3d Cir.1989) (citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">To prove that the County retaliated against Queer for communicating with a state official in March 2004, Queer must show that: (1) he engaged in protected First Amendment speech; (2) the County responded with retaliation sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her rights; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected First Amendment speech and the retaliation. <em>Lauren v. Deflaminis, </em>480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir.2007); <em>Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 512 (3d Cir.2003). Queer can establish a causal connection by proving either \u201c(1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity and the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to establish a causal link.\u201d <em>Lauren, </em>480 F.3d at 267. In the absence of such proof, Queer \u201cmust show that from the \u2018evidence gleaned from the record as a whole\u2019 the trier of fact should infer causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 281 (3d Cir.2000)). If Queer establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the County can defeat the claim by demonstrating that it would have taken the same action even if Queer had not engaged in the protected activity. <em>Id.; Ambrose v. Twp. of Robinson, </em>303 F.3d 488, 493 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Queer argues that the District Court erred by ignoring evidence that establishes a causal nexus between Queer\u2019s protected First Amendment speech<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the County\u2019s nonrenewal of ICC\u2019s contract, and thus improperly granted summary judgment as to his retaliation claim. Based on our review of the record, we cannot accept this contention. First, there is nothing unusually suggestive about the timing between Queer\u2019s protected First Amendment activity and the County\u2019s refusal to renew his contract. Queer contacted the state official to complain of the County\u2019s practices in March 2004 and over a year later the County decided not to renew ICC\u2019s contract. The fact that the County renewed ICC\u2019s contract for the 2004-2005 fiscal year following Queer\u2019s exercise of his protected speech substantially undermines Queer\u2019s assertion that the facts present an unusually suggestive temporal proximity. To the contrary, when we construe the facts in the light most favorable to Queer, taking into consideration his \u201ctimeline\u201d of events, it is difficult to discern <em>any </em>temporal proximity between Queer\u2019s protected speech in March 2004 and the County\u2019s nonrenewal decision more than a year later, much less an unusually suggestive temporal proximity. In April 2004 when the County learned of Queer\u2019s contact with the state official it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>not immediately terminate ICC\u2019s then-existing contract, nor did it decline to renew ICC\u2019s contract for the following year; rather it honored its contract with ICC for the remainder of the 2003-2004 fiscal year and for an entire year after that. If there is any event in the record where the timing could be characterized as unusually suggestive of the County\u2019s cause for not renewing ICC\u2019s contract, it is Queer\u2019s March 17 \u201cPlan of Correction\u201d letter, which the County received a mere two weeks before reaching its nonrenewal decision, not Queer\u2019s protected activity a year earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Second, the record does not reveal a pattern of antagonism that, when coupled with the timing of Queer\u2019s protected speech and the County\u2019s nonrenewal decision, establishes a causal link between the two. Queer attempts to demonstrate a pattern of antagonism by pointing to (1) his June 2004 meeting with the County at which time MH7MR Department employees told him they \u201cfelt wounded\u201d by the accusations he made to the state and \u201cthat they wanted to find out through the front door, not the back door,\u201d about such concerns; and (2) the \u201cirregular\u201d and \u201cextensive\u201d review of ICC that the County undertook beginning in October 2004. But Queer\u2019s argument that these incidents demonstrate the County\u2019s animus towards him is diminished by both his own description of the June 2004 meeting with the County, which he says was \u201cvery pleasant,\u201d and the fact that the County is required by law to monitor its El service providers. Thus, it is a stretch to characterize the June 2004 meeting and the October 2004 review as antagonistic, and in any event these occurrences certainly do not establish a pattern of antagonism that gives rise to an inference of a causal connection between Queer\u2019s protected activity in March 2004 and the County\u2019s nonrenewal decision in April 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Third, the record as a whole, including a review of circumstantial evidence that might suggest that the County\u2019s stated reasons for nonrenewal were pretextual, does not establish a causal connection. There simply is not enough evidence from the record as a whole for a reasonable jury to infer that the cause for the County\u2019s nonrenewal decision was Queer\u2019s exercise of his free speech rights one year earlier. Although Queer sets forth unsupported assertions, conclusory allegations, and mere suspicions of pretext on the part of the County, this is insufficient to survive a summary judgment motion, <em>see Williams, </em>891 F.2d at 460, and thus Queer fails to carry his burden of demonstrating a causal connection between his protected activity and the County\u2019s alleged retaliatory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Even if Queer could establish a causal connection, his claim would nonetheless fail because the record demonstrates that the County would have still decided not to renew ICC\u2019s contract even without a retaliatory motive. Contrary to the conflated arguments made by Queer, this step in the analysis only arises after the plaintiff demonstrates a prima facie case of retaliation. Queer failed to establish the prima facie elements of retaliation, but even if he had, the County would still prevail because it can easily show that its decision not to renew ICC\u2019s contract would have been made in the absence of Queer\u2019s protected activity. The County had ample, documented reasons for not renewing ICC\u2019s contract including Queer\u2019s inappropriate emails and inappropriate behavior, ICC\u2019s noncompliance with regulations, and most notably, Queer\u2019s admittedly \u201cunprofessional\u201d March 17, 2005 letter in which he made a reference to personally shooting his employees if they failed to meet expectations. This letter alone provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the County\u2019s decision not to continue to allow Queer and ICC access to the families and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>young children who are the recipients of El services. Construing the facts in a light most favorable to Queer and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, we cannot conclude that the County\u2019s decision with respect to ICC\u2019s contract would have been different if Queer had not engaged in protected speech a year earlier but had provided the County with the same \u201cwoefully inadequate and unprofessional\u201d Plan of Correction. Therefore, Queer\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Queer also contends that the District Court erred in dismissing his claim against two particular County employees \u2014 Loughner and Zecchini. As we have previously noted, \u201c[a] defendant in a civil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs.\u201d <em>Rode v. Dellareiprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195,1207 (3d Cir.1988). Personal involvement can be shown when a supervisor either personally directs the retaliatory action or has actual knowledge of, and acquiesces in, the retaliatory action. <em>Id. </em>With respect to Loughner and Zecchini, the record does not reflect that they were personally involved in the decision not to renew ICC\u2019s contract. To the contrary, the record reflects that these individuals were left out of the decisionmaking process. Thus, in addition to the problems with Queer\u2019s claim that we have already discussed, he faces an additional obstacle in bringing suit against these individuals in light of the fact that the record does not establish that either Loughner or Zecchini were personally involved in the County\u2019s decision not to renew ICC\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. Although the record reveals a dispute as to whether Queer actually contacted a state official, for the purposes of this appeal only, the County does not challenge Queer's assertion that he exercised his First Amendment right to free speech. Therefore, we do not analyze the first element of a retaliation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
