The government has moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely. In criminal cases, the defendant must file a notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>4(b)(1)(A). The district court may, upon a showing of excusable neglect, with or without a motion for extension of time, extend the time for filing a notice of appeal by thirty days. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In this ease, the district court\u2019s judgment was entered on March 20, 2008. On July 10, 2008, the district court received an undated letter from Thomas in which she stated her intent to appeal. Under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), the notice of appeal is considered filed when it is given to prison officials for mailing. Because it is not clear from the record whether Thomas\u2019 appeal was timely noted, we remand the case to the district court for a factual finding of when Thomas\u2019 notice of appeal was given to prison officials for mailing. Further, if the district court finds that the notice of appeal was given to prison officials within the excusable neglect period, the court should also determine whether there was excusable neglect justifying Thomas\u2019 delay in noting an appeal. <em>See Reyes, </em>759 F.2d at 353-54 (appeal may be remanded for determination of excusable neglect when such neglect is not apparent from the face of the record; motion for extension of time to appeal not prerequisite to district court\u2019s excusable neglect determination in direct criminal appeal). The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
