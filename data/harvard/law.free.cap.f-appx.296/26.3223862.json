Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>No. CH-0752070243-I-1 (M.S.P.B. June 7, 2007). We <em>affirm </em>the final decision of the Board</p>\n<p id=\"AHn\">Prior to his removal, Mr. Cheney was employed as the resident agent in charge \u00b0f Cleveland resident office of DEA. Mr. Cheney was removed from DEA following an investigation into allegations that he engaged in a course of conduct that included: instructing his subordinates to issue subpoenas outside of the scope of business; discussing an investigation into his conduct with DEA personnel after be-Mg instructed not to do so; and making false statements to DEA internal affairs investigators. Mr. Cheney appealed his removal to the Board. On June 7, 2007, the Board issued an initial decision, which became final on July 12, 2007, affirming Mr. Cheney\u2019s removal based upon findings of: (1) misuse of office; (2) conduct unbecoming a DEA Supervisory Special Agent; and (3) making false, misleading, and/or inaccurate statements. The Board further found that Mr. Cheney\u2019s misconduct was connected to the efficiency of the service and that his removal did not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness,</p>\n<p id=\"AEA\">Mr. Cheney appeals the final decision, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)' 0ur review is l\u00fcnited to settinS aside flndinSs or conclusions of the MSPB that we fmd to be \u201c(1) arbitrarY caPrfcious\u2019 an abuse of discietion\u2019 or otherwise not in accordance ^ law\u2019 (2) obtained without Procedures recluired ^ law\u2019 rule&gt; or reSulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">Mr. Cheney asserts that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. The Board\u2019s conelusions were supported by physical evidence as well as testimony from other DEA agents. To the extent that Mr. Cheney provided testimony on his own behalf, the Board found this testimony to be neither truthful nor credible, and \u201ccredibility determinations are virtually unreview<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>able.\u201d <em>Chambers v.
