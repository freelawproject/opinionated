A jury convicted Smith of conspiracy to defraud the United States, to cause the submission of false claims and to receive health care kickbacks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; conspiracy to commit health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349; and solicitation and receipt of kickbacks, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-24\">The issues presented on appeal are (1) whether the government and the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>court improperly caused a defense witness to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, thereby depriving Smith of her Sixth Amendment right to present a defense; and (2) whether the district court correctly calculated Smith\u2019s advisory guideline range when it (a) determined the loss amount and (b) imposed a four-level enhancement for Smith\u2019s role as an organizer or leader of the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on the invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>141 F.8d 1042, 1049 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">This court reviews for clear error the district court\u2019s determination regarding the amount of loss under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>431 F.3d 760, 762 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">\u201cThis court reviews a sentencing court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the crime for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182,1197 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2446, 167 L.Ed.2d 1132 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we first conclude that Smith was not deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to present her defense, which was that she had nothing to do with Smith Medical Equipment, Inc., and was unaware of any billings or claims made by her husband\u2019s company. More specifically, Smith complains that she was unable to present the testimony of one witness, Dr. Misael Gonzalez, due to the fact that the government and the district court improperly caused Dr. Gonzalez to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, thereby depriving Smith of her Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">The record belies Smith\u2019s argument that Dr. Gonzalez refused to testify because of threats and intimidation by either the prosecutors or by the district court. The prosecutors communicated only with Dr. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney and merely informed his counsel of the trial evidence potentially implicating Dr. Gonzalez in the Medicare scheme. It was after the government\u2019s consultation with Dr. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney that Dr. Gonzalez invoked his Fifth Amendment right. In sum, the record demonstrates that there was no interference by either the government or the district court in Smith\u2019s presentation of her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">We also conclude from the record that the district court did not err in determining the amount of loss attributable to Smith, or in enhancing Smith\u2019s offense level based on its finding that Smith was an organizer or leader of the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Because there is no merit to any of the arguments that Smith makes in this appeal, we affirm her convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
