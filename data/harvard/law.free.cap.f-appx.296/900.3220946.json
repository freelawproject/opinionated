(\u201cBuckeye\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment and order granting a discharge to Debtor Peter Osterman, Jr. (\u201cOsterman\u201d). Buckeye asserts that the bankruptcy court erred by finding that Osterman did not act with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors when he transferred money, automobiles and jewelry to family members within one year of filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the bankruptcy court and district court did not err in finding that Osterman made these transfers without the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The following facts are undisputed on appeal: Osterman is the former owner of ProJr., Inc., which did business until 2001 as LK Erectors. Osterman financed his acquisition of LK Erectors with a $750,000.00 Small Business Administration Loan (\u201cSBA Loan\u201d), for which Osterman signed a personal guaranty. In late 2000, Osterman sold his business; however, Osterman was required to retain his guaranty. Shortly after this sale, LK Erectors defaulted on the SBA Loan and ceased doing business, leaving a large balance on the SBA Loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">In October 2004, Buckeye, as the assignee of the SBA Loan, sued Osterman in state court for breach of guaranty. Osterman filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on September 30, 2005. In the year prior to filing, Osterman made the following transfers on the advice of counsel, which are the basis of Buckeye\u2019s objection to discharge: (1) in June 2005, Osterman transferred $38,000 from his wage account to his wife, who then gave the money to their eldest son as a down payment for the purchase of his first home; (2) in December 2004, Osterman, with his wife, transferred a 1998 Nissan Maxima and a 1999 Honda Accord to their sons; and (3) in August 2005, Osterman sold jewelry to his wife\u2019s company for fair market value of $4,550, and put the proceeds of the sale in the wage account.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">On January 13, 2006, Buckeye filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court, arguing that because Osterman transferred property out of his bankruptcy estate in an attempt to defraud his creditors, his discharge should be denied. After a four day trial, the bankruptcy court found that Buckeye did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Osterman acted with an intent to defraud. Accordingly, it denied Buckeye\u2019s objection and granted discharge. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">We review the district court\u2019s decision affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of facts for clear error. <em>In re Williamson, </em>15 F.3d 1037, 1038 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see </em>Fed. R. BankivP. 8013 (stating that \u201c[findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d). The burden of establishing clear error is on the party seeking to overturn the findings of the bankruptcy court. <em>In re Caribbean K Line, Ltd., </em>288 B.R. 908, 911 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2002). The district court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>In re Bateman, </em>331 F.3d 821, 825 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">Section 727(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor shall be granted a discharge unless \u201cthe debtor, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property under this title; has transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed, or has permitted to be transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed ... property of the debt- or, within one year before the date of the filing of the petition.\u201d The creditor opposing discharge must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) a transfer occurred; (2) the transfer was of debtor\u2019s property; (3) the transfer was within one year of the petition, and (4) the transfer was done with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or the trustee. <em>In re Ross, </em>217 B.R. 319, 323 (Bankr.M.D.Fla. 1998) (citations omitted). In order to find fraudulent intent, the court can consider circumstantial evidence or can infer it from the debtor\u2019s action. <em>In re Ingersoll, </em>124 B.R. 116,121 (M.D.Fla.1991). Courts have identified certain \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d which are strong indicators of fraudulent intent. <em>Id. </em>These \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d include: (1) lack of adequate consideration for the property transferred; (2) a family or close relationship between the parties; (3) retention of possession for use and benefit; (4) financial condition of the transferor before and after the transfer; (5) cumulative effect of the transactions and course of conduct after onset of financial difficulties or threat of suit; and (6) general chronology and timing of events. <em>Id. </em>at 121-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">In this case, it is undisputed that Osterman transferred his property at issue within one year of his petition; therefore, the only issue is whether Ostennan performed the transfer with the requisite intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors. On appeal, Buckeye asserts that it presented evidence of multiple \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d associated with these transfers such that the bankruptcy court was required to shift the burden of proof to Osterman to prove that he did not have the intent to defraud. The bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to shift the burden, Buckeye asserts, is an error of law which this court must review <em>de novo. </em>Buckeye did not, however, argue that it was entitled to this shift in the burden of proof in either the bankruptcy court or the district court below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if meritorious, Buckeye\u2019s failure to press the argument before the bankruptcy or district court foreclosed its right to present it on this appeal. <em>See First Ala. Bank of Montgomery, N.A. v. First State Ins. Co., Inc., </em>899 F.2d 1045, 1060 n. 8 (11th Cir.1990). Admittedly, our rule foreclosing review of issues not presented below is not jurisdictional and may be abrogated in our sound discretion. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1332 (11th Cir.2004). Nonetheless, we reject Buckeye\u2019s suggestion that the alleged error is so fundamental and risk of miscarriage of justice so high as to call for the rule\u2019s abrogation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that an issue first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>raised on appeal may be outcome determinative does not require us to consider it. This approach \u201cwould swallow our general rule of waiver, further impeding the efficient administration of justice.\u201d <em>First Ala. Bank of Montgomery, </em>899 F.2d at 1060 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Because the burden-shifting argument was not preserved for appeal, we must limit our review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual finding that Osterman did not act with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditor under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>In re Jennings, </em>533 F.3d 1333, 1338 (11th Cir.2008). Deference to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings is \u201cparticularly appropriate\u201d because the intent determination will often depend on that court\u2019s \u201cassessment of the debtor\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Krehl, </em>86 F.3d 737, 743 (7th Cir.1996)). \u201cWhen the district court has affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings ... we will apply the clearly erroneous doctrine with particular rigor.\u201d <em>In re Wines, </em>997 F.2d 852, 856 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The bankruptcy court, in its written opinion, expressly considered each of the three questioned transfers and their associated \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d but found Osterman\u2019s and his wife\u2019s testimony, in which they gave legitimate and legal reasons for the transfers, to be credible. Specifically, it believed Osterman when he testified that he transferred $38,000 to his wife, who then gave it to their son for the purchase of a house, for legitimate estate and gift tax reasons. It also believed Osterman\u2019s testimony that the transfer of the vehicles to his sons was motivated by a legitimate desire to limit his and his wife\u2019s potential liability under Florida law. Finally, it believed Osterman when he testified that the jewelry sale was not to defraud Buckeye, \u201cbut to preserve the jewelry for future generations, as it has significant sentimental value to him and his family.\u201d We conclude that the bankruptcy court properly considered the \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d that its credibility determinations are not clearly erroneous and that its factual findings, therefore, are well supported by the record. For these reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-4\">. In its Reply brief to this court. Buckeye asserts that it did raise this issue below when it mentioned in its reply brief to the District Court that the existence of badges of fraud gives rise to a \"permissible inference of fraudulent intent.\u201d Even assuming this \"permissible inference\u201d argument were the same as Buckeye's current argument for burden-shifting, a passing reference to an issue in a reply brief, offered without substantive argument in support, is insufficient to constitute raising the issue. <em>See APA Excelsior III L.P. v. Premiere Technologies, Inc., </em>476 F.3d 1261, 1269-70 (llth Cir.2007) (deeming issue waived where litigant did not clearly raise issue in initial brief and made only passing reference to it in reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. Buckeye, citing cases from the Second and Third Circuits, argues that where a district court's error is fundamental, we may consider the error on appeal even if not raised below. Whether the error is \"fundamental,\u201d however, is not the test we use. We have permitted issues to be raised for the first time on appeal under five circumstances: (1) where the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>involves a \"pure question of law\u201d and the refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice; (2) where the appellant had no opportunity to raise it at the trial level; (3) where strict application of the rule would result in patently unjust results; (4) where the proper resolution is beyond doubt; and (5) where the issue presents significant question of general impact or great public concern. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1332. As we see it, none of these exceptional conditions is found in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
