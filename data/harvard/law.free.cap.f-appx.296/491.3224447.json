He argues: (1) the district court erred in using parole documentation to determine the nature of a prior conviction; (2) the district court erred in finding that the prior conviction was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d; and (3) the government breached its plea agreement with him. Because the government failed to satisfy its obligation under the plea agreement, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing before a different district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In 2005, Jackson was indicted on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). A plea agreement was filed, and Jackson pled guilty to the charged offense. If Jackson continued to accept responsibility through the time of sentencing, the government agreed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">[T]he United States will <em>notify </em>the District Court pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) stating to that [sic] the defendant has timely notified authorities of his intention to plead guilty; and (2) pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) <em>the defendant committed the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction for a crime of violence resulting in a base offense level of 20.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anp\">(emphasis added). The plea agreement then cautioned that \u201cthese agreements are not binding on the Court and the final determination of the applicable guideline range for Defendant\u2019s sentence rests solely with the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">A probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSR) and discovered a prior drug offense that the plea agreement did not take into account. As a result of this offense, the PSR stated that Jackson\u2019s base offense level was 24, minus three levels for acceptance of responsibility. Based on the offense level in the PSR, Jackson\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 77 to 96 months of imprisonment. Jackson objected to the PSR and argued that his base offense level should be 20. The district court ruled that the PSR correctly calculated the Guidelines range and sentenced Jackson to 96 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">\n<em>A. Prior Controlled Substance Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">The district court properly found that Jackson was subject to a sentencing enhancement because he had a prior controlled substance offense. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a controlled substance offense is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkC\">an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Mere possession without proof of intent to \u201cmanufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense\u201d is not a controlled substance offense. <em>United States v. Montanez, </em>442 F.3d 485, 488 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">The offense at issue here is a 1992 conviction for \u201caggravated trafficking\u201d under Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2925.03(A). The version of \u00a7 2925.03 in effect at the time of Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>son\u2019s conviction contained multiple subsections that criminalized several different activities, including mere possession of drugs in excess of a certain \u201cbulk amount.\u201d Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(4), (6), (9) (West 1993). In <em>Montanez, </em>this court applied a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and held that a defendant\u2019s convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 2925.03(A)(6) and (9) did not qualify as controlled substance offenses under the Sentencing Guidelines. 442 F.3d at 489, 494. \u201cGenerally speaking, only the fact of the prior conviction and the statutory definition of the predicate offense are used to determine whether a prior conviction is a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489 (quoting <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>439 F.3d 320, 322 (6th Cir.2006)). If a statute criminalizes both conduct that qualifies as a controlled substance offense and conduct that does not, then the categorical approach is not determinative. <em>See id. </em>at 493 (discussing <em>United States v. Wright, </em>43 Fed.Appx. 848 (6th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In this case, we know only that Jackson was convicted under \u00a7 2925.03(A), which criminalizes both qualifying and non-qualifying conduct. When the categorical approach fails to resolve the inquiry, \u201ca sentencing court may look to the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented\u2019 in order to determine whether the prior crime qualifies as a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489 (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 15, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)) (internal citation omitted). In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court limited sentencing courts to examining the aforementioned documents or \u201csome comparable judicial record of this information\u201d in evaluating whether a prior offense satisfies the requirements to be an aggravating factor. <em>See </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor mistakenly referred to parole documentation in support of the PSR\u2019s finding that Jackson had committed a controlled substance violation. However, the district court made clear that its decision was based on official court documents, not the parole records. Specifically, the district court relied on the indictment that charged Jackson \u201cwith knowingly selling, or offering to sell, a controlled substance.\u201d Under <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Montanez, </em>it is appropriate for a sentencing court to consider the charging document to evaluate the nature of a prior conviction when the categorical approach is not determinative. Therefore, the district court properly determined that Jackson had been convicted of a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>B. Breach of the Plea Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). In this case, the government agreed that if Jackson continued to accept responsibility through the time of sentencing, it would notify the district court that \u201cthe defendant committed the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction for a crime of violence resulting in a base offense level of 20.\u201d We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Fitch, </em>282 F.3d 364, 366 (6th Cir.2002). We also review de novo whether the government violated the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>278 F.3d 644, 646 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">At Jackson\u2019s sentencing, the prosecutor never stated that Jackson had \u201ccommitted the instant offense subsequent to sustain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ing one felony conviction for a crime of violence resulting in a base offense level of 20.\u201d The government argues that it did not breach the plea agreement because when asked to respond to defense counsel\u2019s arguments, the prosecutor merely agreed with the probation officer\u2019s findings. It also stresses that the plea agreement made clear that it was not binding on the sentencing court. This argument ignores the fact that the plea agreement created an affirmative obligation upon the government to \u201cnotify\u201d the district court of certain information. Whether Jackson understood that he could receive up to the statutory maximum sentence is not relevant to whether the government upheld its end of the plea agreement. The propriety of the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is also a separate issue from whether the government violated the plea agreement. A district court\u2019s statements about how it reached a sentencing decision do not negate the government\u2019s obligations under a plea agreement. <em>See Barnes, </em>278 F.3d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The plea agreement in this case did not require the government to recommend or advocate a specific sentence or offense level. It simply required the government to notify the court that Jackson had a specific base offense level. If the prosecutor had simply acknowledged and restated what the government agreed to in the plea agreement, the requirement to notify would have been satisfied. If the district court then wanted to impose a higher sentence, the prosecutor would have been free to provide facts to support the reasonableness of that sentence. The government does not breach a plea agreement merely because a prosecutor \u201crecite[s] many of the damning facts\u201d to support the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>See United States v. Fouse, </em>250 Fed.Appx. 704, 711-12 (6th Cir.2007) (unpublished opinion) (\u201cA neutral recitation of facts does not breach a plea agreement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">When the government breaches a plea agreement, \u201cthe fundamental fairness and integrity of the judicial proceeding [are] compromised.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>278 F.3d at 648. Further, \u201c[t]he harmless error rule does not apply to the law of contractual plea agreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Myers, </em>32 F.3d 411, 413 (9th Cir.1994)). Therefore, when the government breaches a plea agreement, we must vacate the district court\u2019s sentencing decision and remand for re-sentencing before a different district judge. <em>See id. </em>at 649 (citing <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon, </em>228 F.3d 978, 981 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Wje remand to a different judge for re-sentencing because the case law requires us to do so. We intend no criticism of the district judge by this action, and none should be inferred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
