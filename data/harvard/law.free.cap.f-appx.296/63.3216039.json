After her removal, Ms. Cirella chose to file a grievance and pursue arbitration as provided by her union contract rather than appeal her removal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board). Seven months after the arbitrator upheld the agency\u2019s action, and twenty-six months after her removal, she filed an appeal with the Board seeking review of both the agency\u2019s removal action and the arbitration decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The administrative judge dismissed both aspects of the appeal. Ms. Cirella then filed a petition for review by the full board of the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision dismissing the appeal from the agency\u2019s removal action. She also filed a request for review by the full Board of the arbitrator\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board denied the petition for review of the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision and found no error in the arbitrator\u2019s affirmance of the removal. <em>Cirella v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>108 M.S.P.R. 474 (2008). Ms. Cirella timely appealed here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Our scope of review of Board decisions is limited by statute. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In her brief filed with the court, Ms. Cirella states that she is requesting de novo review of her case. As this is an appellate court, we have no authority to conduct such a review, and therefore we cannot consider Ms. Cirella\u2019s many fact-based arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">With regard to Ms. Cirella\u2019s request for direct review by the Board of the agency\u2019s removal decision, the Board correctly held that avenue is no longer available to her. An employee who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement may challenge an adverse action such as a removal either by filing an appeal with the Board or by filing a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(e)(1); <em>Rodriguez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>804 F.2d 673, 675 (Fed.Cir.1986). Once Ms. Cirella elected to pursue arbitration, she waived her right to appeal her removal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Although we have jurisdiction to review directly an arbitrator\u2019s final decision regarding an adverse action, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f), Ms. Cirella did not appeal the arbitration decision to this court; that decision, therefore, is not before us for review. Ms. Cirella did file a request for review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision with the Board. While ordinarily the Board does not have jurisdiction to review an arbitrator\u2019s decision, there is an exception. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(d), the Board has jurisdiction to review an arbitration decision when \u201cthe subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant has alleged discrimination as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action, and a final decision has been issued.\u201d <em>De Bow v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>97 M.S.P.R. 5, 7-8 (2004); <em>see also Jones v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>898 F.2d 133, 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>(Fed.Cir.1990). The Board gives substantial deference to arbitrators and will \u201cmodify or set aside an arbitration decision only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. Absent legal error, the Board cannot substitute its conclusions for those of the arbitrator, even if it would disagree with the arbitrator\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>De Bow, </em>97 M.S.P.R. at 8 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">After determining that the jurisdictional requirements had been met, the Board reviewed the arbitratoi\u2019\u2019s decision and concluded that there was no error by the arbitrator in sustaining the charge against Ms. Cirella or in determining the appropriate penalty. Applying our deferential standard of review, we see no error in the Board\u2019s affirmance of the arbitrator\u2019s decision sustaining Ms. Cirella\u2019s removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">. The Board has held that an arbitration decision that is before the Board for review is properly reviewed by the full Board, not an administrative judge. <em>See Brent v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>100 M.S.P.R. 586, 589 (2005). In Board terminology, a petitioner submits to the full Board a \"request for review\u201d of an arbitrator's decision, whereas she submits a \"petition for review\u201d of an administrative judge\u2019s initial decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-18\">. The Board concluded that, though sufficiently alleged for jurisdictional purposes, Ms. Cirella failed to prove her discrimination claim. That issue is not before us for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
