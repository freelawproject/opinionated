The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">\n<em>I. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under ERISA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">\u201c[A] federal court has no jurisdiction to hear a civil action under ERISA that is brought by a person who is not a \u2018participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>26 F.3d 930, 933 (9th Cir.1994). Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, we have not held that all common law employees are entitled to benefits under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461. Instead, we look to the terms of the plans at issue to determine who is entitled to coverage. <em>See, e.g., Burrey v. Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>159 F.3d 388, 392-96 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., </em>120 F.3d 1006, 1013-14 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1098, 118 S.Ct. 899, 139 L.Ed.2d 884 (1998) <em>(\u201cVizcaino II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">\n<em>A. Retirement Plans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Plaintiffs were not eligible to participate in the retirement plans. The retirement plans restrict enrollment to those \u201cwhom the Employer treats as subject to federal wage withholding by the Employer for purposes of Section 3401.\u201d In the complaint, Plaintiffs admit that they were on the payroll of Kelly Services and not paid by McGraw-Hill directly. These admissions are binding. <em>See Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., </em>861 F.2d 224, 226 (9th Cir.1988). Because Plaintiffs were on the payroll of Kelly Services, Plaintiffs were not subject to federal wage withholding by McGraw-Hill. Thus we affirm the district court as to the retirement plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">\n<em>B. Health, Welfare, and Cafeteria Plans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-18\">The health and welfare plans restrict eligibility to employees \u201con the U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>payroll of the company.\u201d As this court persuasively reasoned in <em>Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., </em>employees \u201con the United States payroll of the employer\u201d are those \u201cpaid from its United States accounts.\u201d 97 F.3d 1187, 1194 (9th Cir.1996) <em>(\u201cVizcaino I\u201d), opinion withdrawn by </em>105 F.3d 1334 (9th Cir.1997). By Plaintiffs\u2019 own admissions, they were payrolled by a third party agency and not paid directly from McGraw-Hill\u2019s United States accounts. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Plaintiffs were not eligible for the health, welfare, and cafeteria plans because Plaintiffs were not on the U.S. payroll of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>II. Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cERISA does not preempt the claims of parties who do not have the right to sue under ERISA because they are neither participants in nor beneficiaries of an ERISA plan.\u201d <em>Miller v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>504 F.3d 1102, 1106 (9th Cir.2007). However, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over the state law claims was dependent on the ERISA claims, which the court did not have jurisdiction to consider. Thus, we affirm the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims because the district court lacked federal subject matter jurisdiction. We vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims with instructions that the district court modify its order to dismiss those claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">AFFIRMED. JUDGMENT VACATED FOR MODIFICATION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b589-8\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2L\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The majority holds that we have no jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claims based on \u201cadmissions\u201d in the complaint that they were payrolled through a third party agency used by Defendants. The statements in the complaint on which the majority relies are at least ambiguous. They do not make clear, for purposes of determining eligibility for participation in the retirement plan, whether Defendants treated Plaintiffs \u201cas subject to federal wage withholding by the Employer for purposes of Section 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Nor do they state whether Defendants actually withheld Plaintiffs\u2019 wages, or did so in practical effect, or whether they played no part in such withholding. In fact, the complaint is silent on the subject of withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The complaint also does not make clear whether Plaintiffs were \u201con the U.S. payroll of the Company\u201d for the purposes of determining eligibility for participation in health and welfare plans. Plaintiffs alleged that although they were on a third party agency\u2019s payroll, Defendants \u201cprovided the compensation for the Class members.\u201d Plaintiffs may well have been \u201con the U.S. payroll\u201d of McGraw-Hill, given <em>Vizcaino I\u2019s </em>definition of the phrase as \u201cthose persons who are on the list of, or are among the total number of, persons employed by [the employer] and paid from its United States accounts.\u201d 97 F.3d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Although the district court was correct to dismiss these claims, Plaintiffs should have been granted leave to amend the complaint in order to clarify the ambiguities created by it. \u201c[I]n a line of cases stretching back nearly 50 years, we have held that in dismissing for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), \u2018a district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Doe v. United States, </em>58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th Cir.1995)). <em>See also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>States ex rel. Lee v. SmithKline Beecham, Inc., </em>245 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2001). In this case, it appears that it might not have been futile for Plaintiffs to amend the complaint. <em>See id. </em>I would therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of the ERISA claims, and direct it to allow Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
