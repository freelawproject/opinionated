The sentence appealed was imposed after remand from the 240-month sentence initially imposed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-17\">The underlying facts in this case are set forth in French\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See United States v. French, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 774 (10th Cir.2006) (unpublished). French and co-defendants Jason Read, Brandon Jones, Jessica Gutierrez, Gregory Smith, and Ryan Cole were indicted for conspiring to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(viii), 846. In a separate count, only French was charged with maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and using methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). French pleaded guilty to this charge, and the government dismissed the conspiracy charge against her pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-18\">During French\u2019s initial sentencing in 2004, the district court determined French was responsible for 1,007 grams of methamphetamine and 71.2 grams of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, and was thus subject to a base offense level of 32 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4). The district court calculated an adjusted offense level of 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>and a criminal history category of III. The district court\u2019s calculations included: (1) a six-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(8)(C) for creating a substantial risk of harm to a minor because an eleven-month old infant received second-degree burns during the manufacture of methamphetamine; (2) a two-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice because French threatened to burn down the house of Elsa Marlin if she told authorities how the infant was burned; and (3) a three-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Based on these determinations, the resulting guideline range was 262 to 327 months of imprisonment, which exceeded the statutory maximum of 240 months for French\u2019s offense of conviction. The district court sentenced French to 240 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">French appealed her sentence, and we reversed and remanded for resentencing on two grounds: (1) the district court erred by relying on judicially found facts to mandatorily enhance her sentence, in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 246, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (making the guidelines advisory, rather than mandatory); and (2) the district court erred by including the weight of waste water in its calculation of the total weight of methamphetamine used for calculating the base offense level, contrary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 1 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On remand, the district court again sentenced French to 240 months of imprisonment. When resentencing French, the district court determined that she was responsible for 1,320 grams of methamphetamine, and was subject to the same base offense level of 32 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4). It again arrived at an adjusted offense level of 37 by imposing the same enhancements as it had previously for endangering a minor, and obstruction of justice, and also granting a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The guideline range, with a criminal history category of III, was again 262 to 327 months, which was above the 240 month statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">On remand, French raised numerous objections to her revised presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), including an objection to the PSR\u2019s new drug quantity calculation of 1,320 grams of methamphetamine. French also disputed the revised PSR\u2019s factual findings that supported the enhancements for endangering the life of a minor, and for obstructing justice. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on February 28 and March 2, 2007, where the government offered one witness and French offered nine witnesses. The court also considered the evidence previously presented at the 2004 sentencing, which included testimony from French and three government witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">French raises seven arguments on appeal. We first address French\u2019s argument that her resentencing was unfair because the district court was predisposed to reimpose its prior sentence. Next, we address the procedural reasonableness of French\u2019s sentence, including her arguments concerning the district court\u2019s reliance on the hearsay testimony of Agent Abowd and the credibility of co-defendant Gutierrez\u2019s testimony concerning drug quantities, as well as the sentencing enhancements for endangering a minor and obstructing justice. Finally, we address the substantive reasonableness of French\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">A. Predisposition</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">French argues that the district judge\u2019s decision to impose the same sentence on remand indicates that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>prejudged the evidence and was predisposed to impose the same sentence. French did not raise this \u201cpredisposition\u201d error before the district court. As a result, we may only review for plain error. <em>United States v. Burbage, </em>865 F.3d 1174, 1180 (10th Cir.2004). \u201cPlain error occurs when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>265 F.3d 1097,1107 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">When resentencing after a <em>Booker </em>remand, nothing precludes a sentencing court from imposing the same sentence, or even a greater sentence, than it did initially. <em>See United States v. Medley, </em>476 F.3d 835, 840 (10th Cir.2007) (affirming a longer term of imprisonment on resentencing after a <em>Booker </em>remand); <em>United States v. Huber, </em>462 F.3d 945, 949 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] sentence is not invalid simply because the district court came to the same conclusions both pre-and <em>post-Booker.\u201d). </em>To arrive at a reasonable sentence after a <em>Booker </em>remand, a sentencing court must individualize the sentence by consulting the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and adequately explaining the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 803 (10th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">French is correct that a district court violates its duty to engage in individualized sentencing when it reflexively imposes the same sentence on remand. Yet, in this case, there is no evidence that the district judge in this case took this approach. To the contrary, the district court\u2019s actions during the resentencing process represent a near model example of <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing. The court held an evidentiary hearing to allow the government and French to resolve disputed factual questions regarding specific enhancements. At the hearing, the government presented one witness and French presented nine witnesses. During sentencing, the court addressed each of French\u2019s objections to the revised PSR and provided a basis for its ruling on each objection. After allowing French and her attorney to address the court, the court announced that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors including \u201cthe nature and circumstance of the offense, as well as the personal characteristics of the defendant and her criminal history,\u201d ROA, Vol. XI, at 12, provided its final guideline calculation, recognized the advisory nature of the guidelines under <em>Booker, </em>identified the factual basis for the sentencing enhancements, and imposed a sentence. On this record, we cannot conclude that the court reimposed the same sentence without any individualized consideration of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Further, French\u2019s resentencing is distinguishable from the sentencing in <em>United States v. Crowell, </em>60 F.3d 199 (5th Cir. 1995), the only case cited by French in support of her predisposition argument. <em>See Crowell, </em>60 F.3d at 201 (where, prior to sentencing, the district court expressed concern over the sentence allowable under the plea agreement, \u201cwhich was too light a sentence, in the district court\u2019s opinion\u201d). In the present case, we have no overt statement from the district court to indicate its predisposition regarding the appropriate sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>French argues the district court failed to decide each sentencing issue de novo. French points to the fact that the court in some instances overruled her objections to the revised PSR by summarily referring to the prior rulings it made when French was initially sentenced. <em>See, e.g., </em>ROA, Vol. XI, at 7 (\u201c[T]he court previously found by a preponderance of the evidence that the [PSR] was accurate and a two-level increase was applicable. The court previously found by a preponderance of the evidence that [French] threatened to burn Elsa Marlin\u2019s house if she, Marlin, told the police the truth about how the child was burned on August 26, 2003. Therefore, the court overrules these objections.\u201d) Although the court clearly referred to its prior rulings on these fact issues, it was permitted to do so. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>83 F.3d 1231, 1234 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201c[D]e novo resentencing permits the receipt of any relevant evidence the court could have heard at the first sentencing hearing.\u201d) (quotation marks and emphasis omitted). That the district court reached the same conclusions after hearing more evidence does not indicate the court\u2019s initial rulings were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Additionally, the district court did not restrict the evidence or argument that French could present at resentencing. In fact, French took ample advantage of this opportunity and presented nine witnesses. The court also acknowledged the receipt of new evidence, at one point noting that \u201c[n]o new evidence has been presented to the court that would warrant a change to this previous finding.\u201d ROA, Vol. XI, at 4. The court\u2019s rulings reflect that it considered French\u2019s arguments and evidence in reaching its ultimate conclusions. French has not shown plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">B. Procedural Sentencing Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">French argues that the district court committed several procedural errors in the imposition of her sentence. \u201cIn reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, this court reviews factual findings for clear error and legal determinations de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Redcap, </em>505 F.3d 1321, 1322 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">1. Hearsay Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">French argues that the district court improperly considered hearsay evidence provided by Agent Abowd because the out-of-court statements to which he referred were made by drug dealers with numerous criminal convictions, and were thus unreliable. However, we have previously held that district courts may consider reliable hearsay testimony when sentencing. <em>United States v. Bustamante, </em>454 F.3d 1200, 1202 (10th Cir.2006). French argues that the district court gave no reasoned explanation for admitting and considering Agent Abowd\u2019s hearsay testimony. However, the district court noted at sentencing that the statements corroborated one another and were supported by the fact that French attempted \u201cto cover up what really happened at her residences.\u201d ROA, Vol. XI, at 5. The district court\u2019s ruling that the hearsay statements were sufficiently reliable is supported by the record, and, thus, the district court properly considered these statements at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">2. Witness Credibility and Drug Quantity Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The base offense level for the unlawful manufacturing, importing, exporting, trafficking or possession of illegal narcotics is based on the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is responsible. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. When narcotics are not seized, the district court may estimate the drug quantity for sentencing, \u201cso long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the information relied upon has some basis of support in the facts of the particular case and bears sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Verdin-Garcia, </em>516 F.3d 884, 896 (10th Cir.2008) (citation and quotations omitted); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 12 (\u201cWhere there is no drug seizure ... the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The district court adopted the drug quantity findings in the revised PSR at resentencing. The revised PSR estimates</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATP\">... that Jason Read manufactured methamphetamine at the defendant\u2019s residence approximately one hundred times. Fifty percent of the time, these cooks would produce at least 28 grams of methamphetamine (1,400 grams). The remaining cooks produced at least five grams of methamphetamine (250 grams). The defendant knowingly and intentionally offered this residence for, and was aware that, Read was manufacturing methamphetamine at her residence eighty percent of the time or on eighty occasions, and therefore is responsible for 1,320 grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">ROA, Vol. III, 2007 PSR, at 8 \u00b618.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In adopting the drug quantity suggested by the revised PSR, the district court based its finding on the 2004 sentencing testimony of co-defendant Jessica Gutierrez. ROA, Vol. XI, at 7. Gutierrez testified that Jason Read manufactured methamphetamine 100 times at French\u2019s residence, that on 50-75% of those occasions Read manufactured at least 28 to 30 grams of methamphetamine, and that the other times Read produced between 5 and 10 grams at a time. ROA, Vol. VI, at 53-54. Gutierrez indicated that French became angry with Read for manufacturing methamphetamine about 20 times, but did not object on other occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 96. She also indicated that French would purchase and provide pseudoephedrine to be used in producing methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">French objected to the revised PSR\u2019s calculation, arguing that Gutierrez was not a credible witness and that the district court failed to offer a reasoned explanation for crediting Gutierrez\u2019s testimony. In particular, French argues that Gutierrez was facing prison time and therefore had an incentive to lie to obtain a lesser sentence for herself. French also cites Gutierrez\u2019s drug use as a reason for not crediting her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">While French\u2019s arguments regarding Gutierrez\u2019s credibility are noted, this court has made clear that \u201cthe district court\u2019s determination of a witness\u2019s credibility at a sentencing hearing is virtually unreviewable on appeal,\u201d and will only constitute grounds for reversal where testimony is \u201cunbelievable on its face, i.e., testimony as to facts that the witness physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendez-Zamora, </em>296 F.3d 1013, 1018 (10th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and brackets omitted). Gutierrez\u2019s testimony relates to events she could have heard, and it appears credible on its face. We have no basis for concluding the district court erred in considering her testimony when determining drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">3. Enhancement for Endangering a Minor</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">The district court applied a six-level enhancement to French\u2019s base of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>fense level for committing an offense that \u201c(i) involved the manufacture of ... methamphetamine; and (ii) created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(C). The district court adopted the following facts from the revised PSR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">On August 26, 2003, a child between the age of one and two years was burned in a flash fire related to methamphetamine manufacture at French\u2019s residence.... French, Read, and Gutierrez were outside of the residence when the child was burned. French had been boiling some used coffee filters in acetone in an attempt to recover a minuscule amount of methamphetamine which might be present in the filters. When the contents of the pan and the kitchen stove flared into an open fire, Brandon Jones, Read\u2019s friend and co-conspirator, was standing nearby and tried to put the burning pan in the kitchen sink. Some of the burning liquid sloshed out of the pan and landed on the child. French argued against taking the child to the hospital because authorities would recognize the child\u2019s wounds as chemical burns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">ROA, Vol. III, 2007 PSR, at 7 K 14; <em>see </em>ROA, Vol. XI, at 6 (finding this account of events to be \u201caccurate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">French argues that the district court\u2019s factual finding that she did not want the child to be taken to the hospital was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree. Gutierrez testified that French was concerned the authorities would recognize a chemical burn and conduct a follow-up investigation. ROA, Vol. VI, at 63. Elsa Marlin testified that French was concerned about being \u201cbusted\u201d if the child was taken to the hospital. ROA, Vol. VI, at 107-08. This corroborating testimony provided an adequate factual basis to support the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">French again argues that the district court made clearly erroneous witness credibility determinations. She argues that Gutierrez and Marlin were not credible, while the testimony of her sister and a coworker, neither of whom were at the residence on the day the child was burned, should have been given more consideration by the district court. The testimony of Gutierrez and Marlin is credible on its face, and we will not disturb the district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See Mendez-Zamora, </em>296 F.3d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">4. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The district court imposed a two-level enhancement against French because it found she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">(A) ... willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4i\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court found at French\u2019s initial sentencing that French threatened to burn down Elsa Marlin\u2019s house if she told the police the truth about how her child was burned. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>court reaffirmed this finding on remand. ROA, Vol. XI, at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">French contends that the district court erred in imposing this enhancement for two reasons. First, she claims that this court should use a beyond a reasonable doubt standard in imposing this enhancement. This argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Magallanez, </em>408 F.3d 672, 683-85 (10th Cir. 2005), which made clear that <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing courts may make factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence, so long as they do not apply the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. Second, she argues that the district court was unreasonable in applying the enhancement based on Marlin\u2019s testimony because she was not a credible witness. We disagree. The district court had the opportunity to hear Marlin\u2019s testimony and to assess her credibility. French has not shown her testimony to be unbelievable on its face. <em>See Mendez-Zamora, </em>296 F.3d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">C. Substantive Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Finally, French appeals the substantive reasonableness of her sentence. French was sentenced within the guidelines,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so this court applies a deferential standard of presumptive reasonableness to the sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Angel-Guzman, </em>506 F.3d 1007, 1014 (10th Cir.2007). French may rebut the presumption of reasonableness on appeal by showing that the sentence is unreasonable when viewed in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">As her primary argument, French cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) to argue that there is an unwarranted disparity between her sentence of 240 months of imprisonment and the sentences of her co-defendants Gutierrez, Jones, and Cole. We have said, however, that \u201c[ojrdinarily, the disparity between co-defendants\u2019 sentences is not grounds for relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>471 F.3d 1136, 1140 (10th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). \u201cWhile similar offenders engaged in similar conduct should be sentenced equivalently, ... disparate sentences are allowed where the disparity is explicable by the facts on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Goddard, </em>929 F.2d 546, 550 (10th Cir. 1991) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">French\u2019s calculated guideline range included enhancements for creating a substantial risk of harm to a minor, and for obstruction of justice. These enhancements were not found to apply to her co-defendants. Without those enhancements, her offense level would have been 29, and, with a criminal history category of III, her guideline range would have been 108-135 months of imprisonment. This hypothetical guideline range would have been comparable to the sentences of co-defendant Jones (125 months); Cole (130 months); and Gutierrez (79 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">French raises two final points to support her argument that her 240-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. First, she contends that her sentence is far greater than it would have been if based solely on drug quantities she specifically admitted to using or distributing at her initial sentencing hearing. This argument is essentially a repetition of her claim that the district court\u2019s drug quantity calculation was erroneous, a claim which we again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>reject. To the extent French argues that our current sentencing system \u201cdoes nothing to further the goals of the Sixth Amendment,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 57, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held otherwise. <em>See, e.g., Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270,127 S.Ct. 856, 863-68,166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (summarizing cases). Second, French claims the district court erred in failing to consider her unique individual characteristics as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Specifically, she notes that she has been continuously employed for over thirty years, which she claims is unusual for a person convicted of a narcotics offense. She also emphasizes that, since her incarceration, no disciplinary action has been taken against her. While French\u2019s employment history and unblemished prison record are to her credit, these considerations fail to overcome the presumption of reasonableness which applies on appeal to sentences within the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">. French argues that the district court\u2019s decision to reduce her attorney fees is overt evidence of predisposition. As the order reducing attorney fees is currently pending in a separate appeal, No. 07-5147, we express no opinion as to the propriety of that decision. However, even if the district court erred in reducing the attorney fees, under a plain error standard of review, that alone would be insufficient evidence of predisposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">. French argues for the first time in her reply brief that the district court should have used the estimate provided by Brandon Jones of six or seven cooks, rather than the one hundred cooks estimated by Jessica Gutierrez. Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief on appeal are deemed waived. <em>See Stump v. Gates, </em>211 F.3d 527, 533 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\">. French actually argues that the enhancement for endangering a child should not apply to French if it did not apply to Brandon Jones, who was also present when the child was burned. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 53 (\u201cOn this record, the court cannot adopt Jones' plea agreement and hold the burning of the child was unforeseeable to him but find the enhancement for injury to a minor child applied to [French].\u201d). However, the district court based its decision to apply the enhancement on French's insistence that the baby not be taken to the hospital for treatment of the burns, and not on whether the manufacture of methamphetamine foreseeably could cause injury to a minor.
