Swann asserts that he did not receive timely notice of the second conviction, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000). However, because this issue was not raised at trial, it is reviewable only for plain error. <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>495 F.3d 142,148 (4th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1471, 170 L.Ed.2d 296 (2008). Moreover, Swann\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Beasley </em>that a district court that accepts an \u00a7 851 information after the jury was selected but before it was sworn has not plainly erred. <em>Id. </em>at 149-50. Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Swann\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
