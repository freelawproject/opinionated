An immigration judge found Solorzano removable, denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture, and ordered him removed. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed Solorzano\u2019s appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s order. We deny Solorzano\u2019s petition for review in part and dismiss it in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">Solorzano, a native of Colombia, entered the United States in June 1995 and became a lawful permanent resident in August 1999. Less than four months later, in December 1999, he was indicted for sexual assault in violation of section 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code. The indictment laid the following charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-18\">RUBEN SOLORZANO, defendant, ... on or about September 9, 1999, in Nueces County, Texas, did then and there intentionally and knowingly cause the penetration of the female sexual organ of [M.R.]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by Ruben D. Solorzano\u2019s finger, without the consent of [M.R.] and the actor is a mental health service provider, who caused [M.R.], who is a patient of the defendant to submit and participate by exploiting [M.R.j\u2019s emotional dependency on the defendant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZI\">Solorzano admitted providing services to M.R. intended to help people \u201chaving problems in love.\u201d Specifically, he acknowledged directing M.R. in a \u201ccleansing ritual\u201d that involved the use of an egg \u201cto cleanse through the outside of the body\u201d and explained that \u201cwhat the egg was doing was retaining all those negative vibes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the body had.\u201d Despite denying that he had ever touched M.R., Solorzano pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>and was placed on deferred adjudication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated removal proceedings against Solorzano. An immigration judge determined (1) that Solorzano had committed both an aggravated felony and a crime involving moral turpitude and was therefore removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) and (iii); (2) that Solorzano was ineligible for voluntary departure under section 1229c because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony; (8) that Solorzano was ineligible for withholding of removal under section 1231(b)(3) because he had been convicted of a \u201cparticularly serious\u201d crime; and (4) that Solorzano was not eligible for a deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. Solorzano appealed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture, but not the judge\u2019s determination that he had committed a crime involving moral turpitude and was therefore removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the immigration judge had properly considered \u201cthe nature of the conviction, the circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction, the type of sentence, and whether the respondent poses a danger to the community\u201d in determining that Solorzano had been convicted of a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d. The BIA declined to address whether Solorzano\u2019s crime also constituted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of section 1101(a)(43)(A), as resolution of the issue was unnecessary given the determination that Solorzano had committed a \u201cparticularly serious\u201d crime. Solorzano subsequently filed a petition seeking relief from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions relating to our jurisdiction to consider challenges to a final order of the BIA. <em>Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2001). The same standard of review applies to constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">As the government notes in its brief, Solorzano\u2019s petition to this court does not challenge (1) the BIA\u2019s determination that he has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and is therefore removable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i); (2) the BIA\u2019s finding that he is ineligible for voluntary departure; or (3) the BIA\u2019s denial of his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Nor does Solorzano challenge the denial of his asylum application. Solorzano instead argues (1) that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony and is therefore not removable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); and (2) that he did not commit a \u201cparticularly serious\u201d crime within the meaning of section 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii) and is therefore eligible for withholding of removal. We need not consider the first argument, as an alternative, independent ground exists for the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Solorzano is removable, and we are without jurisdiction to consider the second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The immigration judge determined that Solorzano was removable for two indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>dent reasons: his crime (1) was an aggravated felony, and (2) involved moral turpitude. Either of these findings is alone sufficient to support the judge\u2019s determination that Solorzano was removable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A). Solorzano challenges only the finding that his crime was an aggravated felony; he does not address the immigration judge\u2019s finding that it involved moral turpitude. Because the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Solorzano was removable under section 1227(a)(2)(A) would stand even if we were to decide that his crime was not an aggravated felony, we need not address the issue. <em>See, e.g., Capital Concepts Props. 85-1 v. Mut. First, Inc., </em>35 F.3d 170, 176 (5th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">With respect to Solorzano\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for withholding of removal, the immigration judge\u2019s uncontroverted determination that Solorzano was placed on deferred adjudication for a crime involving moral turpitude limits our jurisdiction to constitutional claims and questions of law. Section 1252(a)(2)(C) provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2)....\u201d Among the criminal offenses covered in section 1182(a)(2) are \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only exception to section 1252(a)(2)(C)\u2019s jurisdictional bar is that the section does not \u201cpreclud[e] review of constitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Thus, in the present case we have jurisdiction to consider only constitutional claims or questions of law raised in Solorzano\u2019s petition. <em>See, e.g., Balogun, </em>270 F.3d at 279 (dismissing petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of application for protection under the Convention Against Torture); <em>see also Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 923 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to review whether petitioner\u2019s felony convictions \u201cconstituted particularly serious crimes\u201d where petitioner was \u201cremovable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Solorzano, however, raises no constitutional claims or questions of law relating to the denial of his application for withholding of removal. Instead, he argues that the immigration judge placed too much \u201cfocus\u201d on the likelihood of future serious misconduct and \u201crelied on hysteria and emotion rather than conducting a dispassionate evaluation of [Solorzano\u2019s] offense and [its] aftereffects.\u201d These claims, which amount to an argument that the immigration judge \u201cabused [her] discretion in weighing the multiple desiderata made relevant by the [BIA\u2019s] definition of a \u2018particularly serious crime,\u2019 \u201d do not present questions of law and therefore are not reviewable under section 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See Petrov v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 800, 802 (7th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we DENY Solorzano\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he is removable under section 1227(a)(2)(A) and DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction Solorzano\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-19\">. We substitute the victim\u2019s initials to preserve her privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">. Deferred adjudication is the equivalent of a conviction for purposes of immigration law, <em>Moosa v. I.N.S., </em>171 F.3d 994, 1006 (5th Cir. 1999), and Solorzano does not argue to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-5\">. Notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar discussed below, we have jurisdiction to deny this challenge because \"the question of whether an offense constitutes an aggravated felony is a purely legal one.\u201d <em>Patel v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 800, 802 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. Section 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii) contains certain exceptions inapplicable to Solorzano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">. We need not address the government's alternative jurisdictional argument that section 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes our review of the immigration judge's finding under section 1231(b)(3) that Solorzano's crime was \"particularly serious.\u201d This argument, which posits that whether an alien has been convicted of a \"particularly serious\u201d crime is a matter of \"discretion\" within the meaning of section 1252(a)(2)(B), is the subject of a circuit split. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Compare, e.g., Villegas v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 984, 987 (9th Cir.2008) (holding that whether a crime is \u201cparticularly serious\" is a \"determination [ ] committed by statute to the Attorney General's discretion, so this court lacks jurisdiction to review it\") <em>with Nethagani v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 150, 154-55 (2d Cir.2008) (reaching the contrary conclusion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
