His sole contention is that the district court enhanced his sentence in violation of the Sixth Amendment because it relied on past convictions that were neither included in the indictment nor proven to a jury. Specifically, Gonzalez argues that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), any consideration of his prior convictions violates his Sixth Amendment rights. He also argues that, under <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), most judicial fact-finding that increases a sentence based on prior convictions violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-20\">The Supreme Court has explicitly held that the government need not allege in its indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to use those convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Further, in <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325,1329 (11th Cir.2005), we held that the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was \u201cleft undisturbed\u201d by the decisions in <em>Apprendi, Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), so that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-21\">The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Cunningham </em>decision does not support Gonzalez\u2019s position. The Court did reiterate there that \u201cthe Federal Constitution\u2019s jury-trial guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>proscribes a sentencing scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, <em>other than a prior conviction, </em>not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. at 860 (emphasis added). The \u201cother than\u201d language preserves the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>rule. Moreover, as the Supreme Court has reminded lower courts, its \u201cdecisions remain binding precedent until [it] see[s] fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.\u201d <em>Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 252-53, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 1978, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
