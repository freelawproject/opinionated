R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Appellant Gerald Lamont Olden, a <em>pro se </em>litigant and federal inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 for the purpose of modifying his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) and denial of his request for appointment of counsel, which he asserts violates his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On February 17, 2005, Mr. Olden pled guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with knowing possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (crack), a schedule II controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Olden and the government stipulated he qualified as a Guidelines career offender as contemplated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C), which provided for a base offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of VI. They also stipulated to a three-level reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility, for a final offense level of 29, which, with a criminal history category of VI, resulted in a Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">After Mr. Olden pled guilty, a federal probation officer prepared a presentence report, in conjunction with the 2004 Guidelines, to determine his sentence. Based on Mr. Olden\u2019s possession of 28.53 grams of cocaine base, the probation officer determined the base offense level for the instant crime of possession with intent to distribute was 28 and that an increase of two levels was warranted because he possessed a firearm in connection with the offense, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 30. However, because Mr. Olden was twenty-nine years old at the time of the commission of the instant offense and had two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence for car-jacking and conspiracy to commit robbery with a firearm, the probation officer classified Mr. Olden as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(c), which provides for an offense level of 32. After applying a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the probation officer calculated Mr. Olden\u2019s total offense level at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">With respect to Mr. Olden\u2019s criminal history computation, the probation officer determined he had nine criminal history points, establishing a criminal history category of VI. The officer also determined that because Mr. Olden was a Guidelines career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), his career offender criminal history category was also VI, which, together with his total offense level of 29, resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of 151 to 188 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Mr. Olden filed an objection to the presentence report, arguing against the two-level offense enhancement for possession of a firearm during the instant offense. The probation officer responded by explaining the factual circumstances warranting the two-level firearm enhancement, but also noted that even if the district court sustained the objection, the base offense level would remain the same, given Mr. Olden\u2019s offense level was ultimately determined on the applicable Guidelines career offender provisions and not on the lower alternative offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>calculations for the drug quantity he possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Prior to sentencing, Mr. Olden filed a motion for downward departure, admitting he stipulated to being a career offender and that he was technically a career offender, but requesting the court consider whether his career offender status was overstated, especially since he had just turned eighteen at the time of the carjacking offense, and based on his claim he was not an extensive participant in either that crime or the armed robbery. After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court denied Mr. Olden\u2019s motion for downward departure. It further determined a firearm was, in fact, found in connection with the instant offense, but regardless of the firearm enhancement, Mr. Olden was a career offender, resulting in an offense level of 32, which, with a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and a criminal history category of VI, resulted in a total offense level of 29, for a Guidelines sentencing range of 151 to 188 months imprisonment. After stating it had considered the applicable advisory sentencing Guidelines and the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court sentenced Mr. Olden near the bottom of the 151- to 188-month sentencing range to 156 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Thereafter, Mr. Olden filed a letter with the district court seeking appointment of counsel for the purpose of filing a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 based on \u201cthe retroactivity of the new crack cocaine amendments.\u201d After the district court denied his request for counsel, Mr. Olden filed a \u201cMotion for Clarification,\u201d asking it to clarify its denial of his request for appointment of counsel for the purpose of seeking a two-level reduction under the new crack cocaine amendments. The district court construed Mr. Olden\u2019s letter as a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a reduction of sentence based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), which modified the Drug Quantity Table contained therein downward two levels for crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706. It then <em>sua sponte </em>denied Mr. Olden\u2019s motion, finding Amendment 706 applied to Mr. Olden\u2019s offense of possession of crack cocaine, reducing his adjusted offense level to 28, but that his offense level remained at 29 \u201cby virtue of application of the career offender enhancement procedures as set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d R., Supp. Vol. 1 (4/8/08 Order). In denying the motion, it explained the offense level for his career offender status \u201ctrump[ed]\u201d the otherwise applicable offense level under the Guidelines because it was greater. It also denied Mr. Olden\u2019s request for clarification concerning its denial of appointment of counsel, relying on other circuit court precedent that no right to appointment of counsel exists when pursuing relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Mr. Olden now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for clarification, claiming the district court erred in denying his motion for a two-level offense reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and his request for appointment of counsel, which he asserts denied him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As Mr. Olden asserts, Amendment 706 modified the drug quantity thresholds in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and the Drug Quantity Table so that \u201c[cjrack cocaine offenses for quantities above and below the mandatory minimum threshold quantities ... [were] adjusted downward by two levels.\u201d U.S.S.G., Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706 (Reason for Amend.). Amendment 706 became retroactive on March 3, 2008, following the passage of Amendments 712 and 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and (c), Amends. 712 and 713 (March 3, 2008 Supp.). Amend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>merit 712 includes an exclusion to the reduction of a sentence by amendment by providing, in part: \u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... an amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), Amend. 712 (March 3, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">With this in mind, \u201c[w]e review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute or the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation marks and citation omitted). When a \u201cmotion for sentence reduction is not a direct appeal or a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the viability of [the] motion depends entirely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). Section 3582(c) allows the court to modify a sentence if the sentencing range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Applying these principles, we have little to add to the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Olden\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion. As the district court noted, retroactive application of a two-level reduction to Mr. Olden\u2019s adjusted base offense level, as prescribed by Amendment 706, would not result in a lesser sentence. This is because the offense level applied in calculating his sentence was not based on the quantity of crack cocaine he possessed, but on his career offender status, to which he stipulated and which the district court determined applied. As a result, \u201ca reduction\u201d in Mr. Olden\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cis not consistent with\u201d the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201cand therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d because a two-level reduction in the offense level under Amendment 706, as listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(b), Amend. 712 (March 3, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">We also reject Mr. Olden\u2019s claim he has a constitutional right to assistance of counsel in pursuing his \u00a7 3582 motion. \u201cThere is no constitutional right to counsel beyond the direct appeal of a criminal conviction.... \u201d <em>Coronado v. Ward, </em>517 F.3d 1212, 1218 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 134, 172 L.Ed.2d 102 (2008). As the district court indicated, other circuits have applied this principle to the issue presented here, holding no constitutional right to appointed counsel exists for the purpose of bringing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence. <em>See United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 730 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>178 F.3d 946, 949 (7th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>98 F.3d 510, 512-13 (9th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>United States v. Reddick, </em>53 F.3d 462, 463-65 (2d Cir.1995). Given no right to counsel exists and Mr. Olden\u2019s request for a sentencing reduction is clearly foreclosed by law, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his request for counsel. <em>See Engberg v. Wyoming, </em>265 F.3d 1109,1121-22 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Mr. Olden\u2019s motion for clarification filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); in addition, we GRANT Mr. Olden\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AWSZ\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.
