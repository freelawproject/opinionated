For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">It is well-settled that \u201ca Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from a final judgment is not a substitute for a timely and proper appeal.\u201d <em>Dowell v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>993 F.2d 46, 48 (4th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Ackermann v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 193, 198, 71 S.Ct. 209, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950)). Thus, in cases where a petitioner makes a \u201cconsidered choice\u201d not to appeal, he cannot be relieved of that choice merely because hindsight demonstrates that his decision to forego a timely appeal was probably wrong in light of subsequent rulings by the court. <em>See Ackermann, </em>340 U.S. at 198, 71 S.Ct. 209. There is no dispute here that Wadley failed to appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on which his Rule 60(b) motion is based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Ackermann, </em>\u201cBy no stretch of imagination can the voluntary, deliberate, free, untrammeled choice of [a Petitioner] not to appeal\u201d constitute a sufficient basis for Rule 60(b) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 71 S.Ct. 209; <em>see also Dowell, </em>993 F.2d at 47 (affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion where movant \u201cknowingly and voluntarily chose not to appeal the district court\u2019s [underlying] decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Moreover, a motion under Rule 60(b) must be filed within \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1); <em>McLawhorn v. John </em>W. <em>Daniel &amp; Co., </em>924 F.2d 535, 538 (4th Cir.1991) (finding Rule 60(b) motion untimely when delay in filing was three to four months). In this case, Wadley waited almost two years after the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment in favor of Equifax to file his Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That he chose to wait for the litigation in this court as to the related appeal to become final so he unnecessarily would not have to pay additional fees and costs for an appeal as to Equifax is not a sufficient justification supporting the relief he now seeks. Under these circumstances, we find this passage of time was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Pursuant to the standards articulated by this court relative to considering the merits of a Rule 60(b)(4) motion, a judgment is \u201cvoid\u201d only where \u201cthe court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. United States, </em>976 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1992). Wadley makes no argument, nor is there any to be made, that the district court lacked subject matter or personal jurisdiction when it granted Equifax\u2019s summary judgment motion. Nor did the district court act in a manner inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>due process. \u201cA judgment is not \u2018void\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(4) merely because it is erroneous.\u201d <em>Cromer v. Kraft Foods No. Am., </em>890 F.3d 812, 817 (4th Cir.2004). Hence this court\u2019s subsequent action in vacating and remanding the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the related appeal, which rested upon the same analysis as its grant of summary judgment in favor of Equifax, is not, contrary to Wadley\u2019s contention, a legitimate basis for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Neither has Wadley established \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d supporting entitlement to relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), because \u201cstrategic decisions made during the course of litigation provide no basis for relief under 60(b)(6).\u201d <em>See Schwartz, </em>976 F.2d at 218. Nor was the change in the decisional law on which the district court based its decision to grant Equifax\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which was brought about by our decision to vacate and remand the grant of summary judgment as to the party in the related appeal, sufficient to establish \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). <em>See Dowell, </em>993 F.2d at 48 (affirming denial of Rule 60(b)(6) motion where basis for relief was subsequent change in law).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Finally, Wadley\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is a clear attempt to require the district court to revisit its previous decision dismissing Equifax from the underlying litigation, based upon this court\u2019s subsequent decision to vacate and remand the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in the related case. This he simply cannot do. <em>See In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 3 (4th Cir.1992). Wadley may not use Rule 60(b) as a vehicle to excuse his failure to seek review of the final judgment granted to Equifax almost two years earlier and from which he chose not to take an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The district court did not err in denying Wadley\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. Not only does Wadley concede that he failed to timely and properly notice an appeal as to Equifax, but he also agreed to dismiss Equifax with prejudice from a related appeal, when Equifax inadvertently was included as a party in that appeal, based in part on his reluctance to pay the additional fees and costs associated with having Equifax included in that prior appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\">. While Wadley argues on appeal that he filed promptly after we issued our remand in <em>Wadley v. Experian Info. Solutions, Inc., </em>241 Fed. Appx. 132 (4th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (unpublished), the related appeal, our actions in that case have no bearing on the summary judgment order against Equifax because Equifax, as Wadley himself concedes, was never a proper party to that appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
