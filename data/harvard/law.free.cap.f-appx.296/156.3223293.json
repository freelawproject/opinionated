Breytman initially filed a complaint against the New York Public Library, the Inwood Branch of the Library, Jane Doe and John Doe (employees at the Inwood Branch), and Ms. Rodriguez (the manager of the Inwood Branch), alleging, among other things, that defendants violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when they informed him that he would not be permitted to plug his laptop computer into an electrical outlet at the library. Appellee\u2019s App. at 40. Breytman further alleged that defendants violated Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a), because he was subsequently \u201cdiscriminatory force [sic] out\u201d of the library, and because, Breytman claimed, the hiring practices at the library were discriminatory. Appellee\u2019s App. at 38-39. On appeal, Breytman argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court and the New York Public Library \u201cconspired\u201d to deny him the \u201cdamages\u201d he should have received since the Library filed its motion to dismiss late and therefore \u201cwaived any right to motion to dismiss,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3-4, as well as that the District Court \u201cdiscriminated\u201d against him by denying his motion for reconsideration, \u201cbased\u201d on the fact that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>was written predominantly in Latin. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7-8. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See, e.g., Cooper v. Parsky, </em>140 F.3d 433, 440 (2d Cir.1998). In so doing, we construe the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Upon a review of the record and the relevant case law, we conclude that the District Court correctly dismissed Breytman\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim, and properly denied Breytman\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We reject Breytman\u2019s remaining arguments as lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">We reject all of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claims on appeal. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
