The judge denied petitioner\u2019s simultaneous applications for a waiver of removability pursuant to former Immigration and Nationality Act section 212(c), and cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-21\">Respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). This court has held that an alien cannot simultaneously receive a waiver under \u00a7 212(c) and cancellation of removal. <em>See Garcia-Jimenez v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 1082 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-22\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
