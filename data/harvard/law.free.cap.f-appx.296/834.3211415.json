Padr\u00f3n argues that the arresting officer lacked jurisdiction to make a traffic stop of Padr\u00f3n; Padr\u00f3n did not voluntarily consent to the search of his vehicle; his consent was invalid because it was given after the traffic stop ended or should have ended; and he was arrested for a traffic misdemeanor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">On denial of a motion to suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2924, 168 L.Ed.2d 253 (2007). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1235-36. Arguments that are not raised in the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212,1221 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-21\">The district court did not err when it denied Padron\u2019s motion to suppress. Officer Robbie Autrey stopped Padr\u00f3n within the officer\u2019s jurisdiction for driving an automobile without a registered license plate; Padr\u00f3n volunteered to a search of his vehicle and consented a second time after he had received a written warning for driving without a license and was free to leave; and Autrey discovered a firearm in Padron\u2019s vehicle and arrested Padr\u00f3n for possession of the weapon. At the suppression hearing, Padr\u00f3n did not challenge Au-trey\u2019s testimony, which supports the findings of the district court that the traffic stop, consent to search, and arrest were lawful. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 ll-40-10(a); <em>Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1236-40; <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277-82 (11th Cir.2001). The district court did not clearly err in its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
