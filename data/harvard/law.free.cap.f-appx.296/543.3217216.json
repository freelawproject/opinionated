The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">To survive summary judgment on his claim of retaliatory termination, Dillon bears the burden of establishing that a triable issue exists concerning whether the Secretary\u2019s proffered explanation for his termination is \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d or that \u201ca discriminatory reason more likely motivated [the Asylum Office].\u201d <em>Snead v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1080, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Tex. Dept. of Comty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). The Secretary explained that he terminated Dillon because he exhibited \u201cinsubordinate\u201d and \u201cparticularly vexing\u201d behavior during his tenure with the Asylum Office, rather than because of his opposition to the Asylum Office\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practices. Dillon is unable to point to an employee who was retained by the Asylum Office despite exhibiting similar behavior, nor has he proffered any \u25a0 other evidence that his termination was : pretextual. Accordingly, we are satisfied 'that no triable issue exists as to whether \u00a1the Secretary\u2019s explanation is pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">'  While Dillon also argues the Asylum Office violated Title VII when it re\u25a0fused to provide him with a performance (appraisal, here again he bears the burden [of showing that a triable issue exists as to (the veracity of the Asylum Office\u2019s proffered explanation. <em>Id. </em>The Asylum Office (avers that it withheld the appraisal solely because, once Dillon was no longer employed, he was, not entitled to an appraisal under its internal regulations. Dillon has provided no evidence suggesting that the decision not to provide an appraisal was motivated by retaliatory animus, nor has he presented evidence of a former employee who was provided with a performance appraisal after having left the Asylum Office. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that Dillon has presented insufficient evidence to rebut the Asylum Office\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AYN\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>SELNA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHC\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">I concur in the court\u2019s decision to affirm summary judgment on Dillon\u2019s claim that he was denied a performance appraisal out of retaliation. However, I respectfully dissent <em>from </em>the court\u2019s decision to affirm summary judgment on Dillon\u2019s retaliatory termination claim, because I believe that Dillon has presented sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury finding that the Asylum Office terminated him because he opposed its allegedly discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">As the court notes, the Asylum Office contends it terminated Dillon because of specified instances of insubordinate conduct. However, each of the examples of purported insubordination also represents an incident in which Dillon voiced his opposition to the policies he perceived to discriminate against Latino applicants. Thus, the actions the Asylum Office describes as insubordination are actions Dillon interprets as his ethical and conscientious pursuit of the correct and fair application of immigration law. In my view, the ambiguity inherent in the Asylum Office\u2019s proffered examples of insubordination permits an inference in Dillon\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Moreover, Dillon provides additional supporting evidence of impermissible motive, including a few instances in which his disagreements with his superiors at the Asylum Office regarding legal issues impacting Latino applicants were not well received. For example, Dillon broached his concern that the \u201cone year rule\u201d and its exceptions had a discriminatory effect on applicants of Latin American origin with the director of the Asylum Office and \u201cimmediately felt that [he] had made a mistake in bringing the issue to her\u201d and that she was \u201chostile\u201d to it. That director testified, describing a disagreement over a particular asylum application from a Mexican petitioner, that \u201cMr. Dillon didn\u2019t want to follow the office policy. He ... believed that headquarters was wrong and ... didn\u2019t want to make the changes that we did, that[,] by policy[,] we\u2019ve always made in our office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">All of Dillon\u2019s disagreements with his supervisors related to his concern that Latino asylum applications were not being handled properly. This common thread could be viewed by a jury as circumstantial evidence of the fact that the Asylum Office\u2019s true motive for terminating him was that he opposed the Asylum Office\u2019s discriminatory policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In cases where, as here, the dispute centers on the employer\u2019s real reasons for taking a particular adverse action, those motives present an \u201celusive factual question.\u201d <em>Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>797 F.2d 727, 733 (9th Cir.1986). For this reason, \u201cthe decision as to any employer\u2019s time motivation plainly is one reserved to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Lowe v. City of Monrovia, </em>775 F.2d 998, 1008 (9th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Peacock v. DuVal, </em>694 F.2d 644, 646 (9th Cir.1982)). Moreover, \u201cvery little evidence is necessary to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding an employer\u2019s motive.\u201d <em>McGinest v. GTE Service Corp., </em>360 F.3d 1103, 1124 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 1406, 1409 (9th Cir.1996)). I believe that Dillon has provided sufficient evidence create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the Asylum Office\u2019s proffered reason for terminating him was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Asylum Office on Dillon\u2019s retaliatory termination claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
