Pena-Lopez argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider that he re-entered the United States illegally to support his family. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-23\">We review a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-26\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence within the guideline range. Pena-Lopez entered the country illegally, which violated a term of his supervised release. The district court stated that Pena-Lopez\u2019s recidivist conduct was \u201can act of defiance or [a] deliber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ate violation of the law\u201d that it found \u201cdisturbing.\u201d The nature and circumstances of an offense and the history and characteristics of a defendant are relevant to fashion an appropriate sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e)(3); <em>United States v.
