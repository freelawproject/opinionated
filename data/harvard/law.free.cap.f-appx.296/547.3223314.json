We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-20\">T.M. contends Starr does not qualify as a \u201cvictim\u201d to whom T.M. can be ordered to pay restitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663, 3663A. The relevant statute defines \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201ca person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). In determining who qualifies as a victim, the sentencing court may take into account only the offense(s) of which the defendant was convicted. <em>Hughey v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 411, 413, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990). Thus, restitution may be ordered \u201conly for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>T.M. contends she cannot be held liable for losses Starr incurred while searching for Red Dog, because T.M. pleaded guilty only to assaulting Red Dog with a dangerous weapon; she did not plead guilty to his murder. Thus, according to T.M., the specific conduct underlying her offense of conviction did not \u201cdirectly and proximately\u201d cause Starr\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We have previously held, however, that restitution awards may include losses \u201cat least one step removed from the offense conduct itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Gamma Tech Indus., Inc., </em>265 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir.2001). We have affirmed restitution awards even where there were \u201cmultiple links in the causal chain\u201d between the conduct underlying the offense and the costs for which restitution was ordered. <em>United States v. Hackett, </em>311 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, \u201cDefendant\u2019s conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss, but any subsequent action that contributes to the loss, such as an intervening cause, must be directly related to the defendant\u2019s conduct. The causal chain may not extend so far, in terms of the facts or the time span, as to become unreasonable.\u201d <em>Gamma Tech, </em>265 F.3d at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Here, T.M. and two other individuals\u2014 her brother Jordan and her then-boyfriend Bearcub \u2014 committed the assault during which Red Dog was killed. T.M. admits she hit Red Dog twice with a baseball bat during the assault. She then accompanied Jordan and Bearcub to a nearby bridge and helped them push Red Dog\u2019s body off the bridge into a river. Red Dog\u2019s body was never recovered. Starr subsequently missed seven months of work while searching for her missing son.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">While T.M.\u2019s conduct was not the sole cause of Starr\u2019s loss, Starr\u2019s search for her missing son was a reasonably foreseeable reaction to T.M.\u2019s conduct, in combination with the conduct of Jordan and Bearcub; thus, Starr\u2019s actions were \u201cdirectly related\u201d to T.M.\u2019s conduct. <em>See Gamma Tech, </em>265 F.3d at 928. Accordingly, the \u201ccausal chain\u201d between the conduct underlying T. M.\u2019s offense and the lost wages incurred by Starr does \u201cnot extend so far, in terms of the facts or the time span, as to become unreasonable.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Thus, we hold Starr qualifies as a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the payment of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">T.M. further contends Starr\u2019s lost wages are not recoverable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4). Section 3663A(b)(4) provides that the order of restitution for a defendant convicted of a qualifying offense \u201cshall require that such defendant \u2014 \u25a0... in any case, reimburse the victim for <em>lost income </em>and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses <em>incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense </em>or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.\u201d 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">\u201cThis circuit has adopted a <em>broad </em>view of the restitution authorization for investigation costs [under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) ]. Generally, investigation costs ... incurred by private parties as a direct and foreseeable result of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct may be recoverable.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>393 F.3d 1044, 1056-57 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">T.M. contends that because the FBI undertook its own efforts to search for Red Dog\u2019s body, Starr\u2019s decision to take seven months off from work to search for her missing son was not a \u201cdirect and foreseeable result\u201d of T.M.\u2019s conduct. We rejected a nearly identical contention in <em>United States v. Cummings, </em>281 F.3d 1046, 1053 (9th Cir.2002) (affirming a restitution award for attorney\u2019s fees incurred during civil proceedings brought by a mother to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>recover her stolen child, notwithstanding the separate criminal proceedings independently brought by the government).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Cummings, </em>\u201ca parent deprived of her children does not have the same choices [as other victims] about what sums are appropriately spent to rectify the harm done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because Starr\u2019s lost income was a direct and foreseeable result of T.M.\u2019s offense, we hold this lost income is recoverable under \u00a7 3663A(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering T.M. to pay restitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">. In <em>Cummings, </em>we addressed a restitution order issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(b)(4) (a provision of the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d)); here, the governing provision is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) (a provision of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d)). The provisions, however, are substantially the same. Moreover, in <em>Cummings, </em>we applied precisely the same test to \u00a7 3663(b)(4) as we apply here to \u00a7 <em>3663A(b)(4) </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the expenses at issue were a \u201cdirect and foreseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s offense. <em>See also Gordon, </em>393 F.3d at 1048 (holding that because of the similarities between the VWPA and MVRA, \u201ccourts interpreting the MVRA may look to and rely on cases interpreting the VWPA as precedent.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-15\">. Because we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering T.M. to pay restitution, we need not reach the government\u2019s alternative argument that restitution was mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b574-6\">BERZON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AY2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">I respectfully dissent, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">First, Ms. Starr was not a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the restitution statute. The statute defines a \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201ca person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of the offense....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Ms. Starr was undoubtedly harmed, by her son\u2019s death, but she was harmed indirectly, not directly, by the offense here at issue. The statute does not, in my view, contemplate that adult relatives of victims <em>automatically </em>become victims themselves for restitution purposes. I am aware of no case so holding. <em>Cf. United States v. Wilcox, </em>487 F.3d 1163, 1176-77 (8th Cir.2007) (holding that \u201c[b]ecause only [the child victim], not [her mother], suffered bodily injury, [her mother] is not a victim who may be reimbursed for lost income under \u00a7 3663A(B)(2)(C)\u201d); <em>compare United States v. Checora, </em>175 F.3d 782, 795 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that victim\u2019s minor sons were \u201cvictims\u201d within the meaning of the MVRA because \u201c[t]hey have been directly and proximately harmed as a result of their father\u2019s death because they have lost, among other things, a source of financial support.\u201d). Although grief-stricken spouses, parents, grandparents, and close friends of the direct victims of crimes are certainly, in the colloquial sense, \u201cvictims\u201d themselves, making them <em>statutory </em>victims eligible for restitution potentially unendingly. That is the obvious reason for the statutory limitation to those \u201cdirectly harmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Further, even if a statutory victim, Ms. Starr is not eligible for restitution of her seven months\u2019 lost income. For one thing, as far as the record shows, that income was not lost \u201cduring participation in the investigation of prosecution of the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3663A(b)(4). Rather, Ms. Starr lost income because, after spending time searching for her son, she lost her job. The record does not show that she was investigating the offense for seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">For this same reason, Ms. Starr was not \u201cproximately\u201d harmed with regard to her lost wages. Although it was a foreseeable result of the offense that Ms. Starr would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>look for her son, it was not a foreseeable result of the offense that she would do so during work hours and would lose her job as a consequence. <em>Compare United States v. Follet, </em>269 F.3d 996, 999 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[Sjexual abuse of a minor ... may\u2014 indeed, usually will \u2014 result in psychological harm to the girl abused. That the girl will seek ... counseling ... is not, though, assured ..., and that she will seek such counseling, if she does, from a free clinic rather than one for which she pays ... is certainly not something one can foresee from the fact that the crime was committed. So the connection ... is simply too attenuated to bring the Crisis Center within the statutory definition of \u2018victim.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Meksian, </em>170 F.3d 1260, 1263 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that \u201cit was not Meksian\u2019s false statements that caused the bank\u2019s loss, but the [bank\u2019s] intervening reliance ... on a third party\u2019s inaccurate environmental risk report\u201d); <em>United States v. Tyler, </em>767 F.2d 1350, 1352 (9th Cir.1985) (holding that defendant need not reimburse the government for the loss in value of the timber defendant stole from a national forest, because \u201c[a]ny reduction in [the timber\u2019s] value stems from the government\u2019s decision to hold the timber during a period of declining prices, not from [the defendant\u2019s theft].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Most importantly, it seems plain to me that <em>\u201cthe </em>investigation\u201d for which restitution is available under \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) is the government\u2019s official investigation, not an entirely separate one engaged in by the victim\u2019s relatives. The two cases the majority cites to the contrary are entirely off point.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>United States v. Gordon, </em>393 F.3d 1044 (9th Cir.2004), involved investigation costs incurred by the company from which the defendant embezzled \u201cin response to five grand jury subpoenas and a number of government requests\u201d which <em>\u201crequired </em>[Cisco] to analyze vast amounts of information\u201d and <em>\u201cforced </em>[Cisco] to identify and reconstruct hundreds of sales and acquisitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057. There is no indication that Cisco recovered restitution for investigations it undertook independently of government subpoenas and information requests. <em>Gordon </em>therefore reinforces my conclusion that it is participation in <em>the </em>investigation \u2014 the government\u2019s investigation \u2014 that is subject to restitution, not costs incurred when striking out on one\u2019s own.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"><em>United States v. Cummings, </em>281 F.3d 1046 (9th Cir.2002), involved, as the majority notes, a different statute. Although similar, that statute differs in a respect critical here: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(b)(4) provides for discretionary restitution of \u201clost income ... and other expenses <em>related to </em>participation in the investigation ... of the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added). The statute here at issue is stricter: The \u201clost income ... and other expenses\u201d must be incurred <em>\u201cduring </em>participation in the investigation ... of the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) (emphasis added). The difference is both obvious and significant. Whether or not Ms. Starr\u2019s investigative activities were \u201crelated to\u201d participation in the government\u2019s investigation, they did not occur \u201cduring participation\u201d in it. <em>Cf. United States v. Douglas, </em>525 F.3d 225, 254 (2d Cir.2008) (holding that the father of the victim was entitled to restitution for the father\u2019s lost income under \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) \u201cfor the days on which [the father] assisted in the investigation and attended court proceedings\u201d); <em>United States v. Hayward, </em>359 F.3d 631, 642 (3d Cir.2004) (holding that \u201cthe [minor victims\u2019] parents are entitled to restitution under\u201d \u00a7 3663A(b)(4) because they \u201cincurred reasonable costs in obtaining the return of their victimized children from London and in making their children available to participate in the investigation and trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>For all these reasons, I would reverse the restitution order, and therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
