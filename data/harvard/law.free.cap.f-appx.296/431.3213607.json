The district court found Cade to be a career offender but sentenced him below the advisory guideline range to 216 months of imprisonment on Count 1. The court sentenced Cade to the statutory minimum 60-month sentence on Count 2, to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Cade argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on a finding that his Texas conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Cade correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 44, 172 L.Ed.2d 51 (2008), and he raises it solely to preserve it for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, which is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s motion for dismissal of the appeal and alternative motion for an extension of time for filing an appellate brief are DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
