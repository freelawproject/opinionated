The plaintiff raises this issue by his request for ruling that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">1. A written contract between plaintiff and \u201cJoseph Lam-pert, Lampert Shoes, Inc., 37 Vaughan Street, of Portsmouth, N. H. and doing business under the firm name of Lampert Shoes, Inc., party of the second part and hereinafter designated as advertiser\u201d, signed by Joseph Lampert in a space above the printed words \u201cFor the Advertiser\u201d is, as a matter of law, the personal undertaking of Joseph Lampert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The trial judge disposed of this request as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">Denied. Consideration of all of the evidence including the fact that plaintiff\u2019s ledger card and original salesman\u2019s memo identified the account as \u201cLampert Shoes, Inc.\u201d warrants the conclusion that the contract was with the corporation and not with the individual defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">The Court also denied other requests as not applicable to the facts found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">We cannot say that there was any error committed by the trial judge in his action on the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings of law, nor can we say there was any error committed by the trial judge in the conclusion reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>by him upon a consideration of all the evidence.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b92-7\">Wasserman &amp; Salter, of Boston, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b92-8\">Charles J. Austin, of Boston, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">Requests are properly denied where founded in part upon facts not found to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">The finding for the defendant imports a finding of all the subsidiary facts necessary to support it. <em>Moss v. Old Colony Trust Co., </em>246 Mass. 139; <em>McDonald v. Adamian, </em>294 Mass. 189, 190, 191.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">There being no prejudicial error committed by the trial judge in his disposition of the various requests for rulings of law filed by the plaintiff and no error in the finding of the trial judge, the report is dismissed and the finding for the defendant is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
