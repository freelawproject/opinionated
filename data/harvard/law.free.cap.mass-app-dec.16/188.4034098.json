The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>plaintiff alleged the breach of an implied warranty of fitness. The defendant pleaded general denial and contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">A representative of the defendant sold the plaintiff a cosmetic known as \u201cAvon Cotillion Cologne Stick\u201d and the plaintiff applied the product to her body from time to time without ill effect from late December, 1956, until April 15, 1957. On this occasion the plaintiff said she dressed for work and rubbed the end of the stick on her throat and upper chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">During the day she noted a mild irritation on her upper breast and that night she discovered that a piece or lump of the cologne stick had become lodged against her breast and was held there by her brassiere. The area thus covered was inflamed and sore and had become infected and she was later treated by a physician who testified that the infection was caused by \u201ca piece of cosmetic becoming attached to the flesh in the manner described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Neither the stick nor the holder appear to have been marked as an exhibit and we have no adequate picture or description of them excepting that the plaintiff while testifying was permitted to show how pieces of the stick could break away and fall to the bottom of the container and into the clothes. It was the contention of the plaintiff that in normal use the \u201ctin prongs\u201d which hold the stick to the container tended to break away pieces of the stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff filed requests for rulings which were denied and the court found for the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b196-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Gilmore G.

Jordan Marsh Co., </em>319 Mass. 690: \u201cThe burden was on the plaintiff to prove that the <em>[cold] cream </em>was unfit for use by a normal person.
