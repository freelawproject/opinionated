Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On March 23, 2004, Denise Taylor, Petitioner, and Diane Miskimon,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a complaint against Kristi and William Biedenback in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking custody of, or in the alternative visitation with, Taylor\u2019s grandchildren, Tristian and Memorie Biedenback. Taylor, the maternal grandmother, alleged that the children, while in the physical custody of the Biedenbacks, had been physically and sexually abused and neglected. The Biedenbacks filed an answer to the complaint denying the allegations of physical and sexual abuse, asking the court to dismiss Ms. Miskimon as a plaintiff, and requesting the court to order that the minor children remain in the custody and care of the Biedenbacks and to deny Taylor visitation. The Biedenbacks also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint to which Taylor filed a memorandum in opposition seeking denial of the Biedenbacks\u2019 motion and requesting pendente lite custody of the children, a home study, a guardian ad litem for the children, and an emergency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">When the Biedenbacks failed to answer Taylor\u2019s requests for pendente lite custody of the children, a home study, a guardian ad litem for the children, and an emergency hearing, Taylor filed a request for an order of default iterating her request for a guardian ad litem and a home study. Taylor also filed a motion for an order compelling discovery, asking the court to order the Biedenbacks to file answers to interrogatories that had been served earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Without a hearing, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted Taylor\u2019s motion to compel discovery, entered an order of default, appointed Marc E. Mandel, Esquire, Respondent, as guardian ad litem for the children, and ordered that a home study be completed; subsequently, Mandel, himself, submitted an amended order containing information regarding the fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of the guardian ad litem, which was signed by the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">THE ORDER OF THIS COURT dated September 15, 2004 appointing Marc E. Mandel, Esquire, Guardian Ad Litem for the minor children is this 18th day of October, 2004 amended as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">1. To consent or not to the release of privileged medical and/or psychiatric/psychological information regarding the minor children pursuant to <em>Nagel v. </em>Hooks; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">2. To represent the best interests of the minor children as their <em>guardian ad litem </em>regarding the issues of custody and visitation, and in that regard to participate fully in pre-trial discovery, hearings and trial on the merits; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">ORDERED that Marc E. Mandel, Esquire, as attorney for the minor children, shall have access to copies of the case file and all records regarding this action including, but not limited to, access to the records and/or evaluations of any therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health professional as well as any Department of Social Services records regarding the minor children; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aox\">ORDERED that the Court hereby reserves for future determination the award of reasonable counsel fees to Marc E. Mandel, Esquire, upon the filing of a Petition for Counsel Fees by said counsel; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">ORDERED that each party shall advance to her or his counsel of record the sum of $1,000.00, which said sum shall be held in escrow subject to further Order of this Court regarding apportionment between the parties of their respective obligations to pay the reasonable counsel fees of the attorney for the minor children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Taylor did not file an objection to the amended order, request a hearing, or file a motion to reconsider, but rather complied and deposited $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Taylor and the Biedenbacks eventually reached an agreement, putting the settlement on the record in April of 2005. Mandel subsequently filed his petition for guardian ad litem fees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and filed an amended petition for guardian ad litem fees two days later, seeking $9,041.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Taylor filed an Opposition to Guardian Ad Litem\u2019s Amended Motion for Counsel Fees in which she challenged the hourly rate charged, the amount of time billed and the proposed apportionment of the bill. Primarily, though, she asserted that Mandel could not recover guardian ad litem fees from her because she was not a \u201cparent\u201d within the purview of Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1999, 2004 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, Taylor contended that guardian ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>litem fees could not be awarded under Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1999, 2004 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because that Section refers to \u201ccounsel fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The circuit court granted Mandel\u2019s motion for guardian ad litem fees without a hearing and awarded him $7,041.73: Taylor and Ms. Miskimon were ordered to pay $5,962.13, and the Biedenbacks were ordered to pay $1,079.60. Taylor filed a motion requesting that the court reconsider its Order Granting Guardian Ad Litem\u2019s Amended Motion for Counsel Fees, or in the alternative, to hold a hearing to ascertain what fees were fair and reasonable and how the fees should have been apportioned; Taylor again argued that the circuit court did not have the authority to assess guardian ad litem fees against her. The Biedenbacks filed a similar motion for reconsideration, seeking the same relief as Taylor had requested. Ms. Miskimon subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, asserting that the parties had agreed to a stipulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>dismissal of Ms. Miskimon as a plaintiff, and therefore, she should not have been assessed guardian ad litem fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On July 18, 2005, the circuit court struck the May 26th order granting guardian ad litem fees and scheduled a hearing. At the hearing, Taylor argued that the guardian ad litem fees were excessive and also contended that the guardian ad litem did not have the ability to recover fees from Taylor because she was not a \u201cparent\u201d under Section 1-202, and because Section 12-103 did not pertain to guardian ad litem fees. Nevertheless, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion, awarding guardian ad litem fees to Mandel and rejecting Taylor\u2019s argument that there was no statutory authority allowing a guardian ad litem to collect fees from Taylor because this argument had been waived when Taylor requested the appointment of the guardian ad litem without objecting to the payment of fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">The Court\u2019s authority to award attorneys fees to a Guardian Ad Litem is not limited to awards against \u201cparents\u201d under Md.Code Ann., Family Law Art., Sec. 12-103 or 1.202, particularly in circumstances where the party advancing that argument is the party who asked for the appointment of the GAL in the first place without registering any objection to paying the GAL\u2019s fees in connection with the order appointing the GAL. To the extent that there is some argument to be advanced here, it has plainly been waived by the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The court also concluded that \u201caccording to the Family Division Guidelines,\u201d the Biedenbacks were \u201cexempt from having to pay GAL\u2019s legal fees\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and even if that was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>case, given the financial circumstances of the parties, \u201cit is clear that the GAL\u2019s fees should be borne by [Taylor].\u201d A judgment in favor of Mandel against Taylor in the amount of $6,821.73 was filed and docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Subsequently, Taylor filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment or in the Alternative Amend and Stay Judgment Pending Appeal requesting that the court either vacate the judgment against her, vacate the judgment and order her to pay the guardian ad litem fees, or stay the judgment pending the appeal. Mandel then filed a motion for reconsideration requesting that the court award him the full amount of his guardian ad litem bill, $9,041.73, as well as prejudgment and post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The circuit court granted Taylor\u2019s Motion to Vacate or in the Alternative Amend and Stay Judgment Pending Appeal. The court vacated the judgment against Taylor but ordered that she pay Mandel $6,821.73.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Taylor noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, before which she argued that the circuit court erred in assessing guardian ad litem fees against her because she was not a \u201cparent\u201d within the purview of Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article, and because Section 12-103 only involves \u201ccounsel fees.\u201d In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the imposition of guardian ad litem fees against Taylor and concluded that although neither Section 1-202 nor Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article \u00e1uthorized the lower court to impose guardian ad litem fees against Taylor, Taylor had \u201cimpliedly consented to the court\u2019s action\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>because of her request to appoint a guardian ad litem and deposit of $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">The court did not expressly state the basis for its order requiring appellant to pay appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant correctly observes, however, that the only possible bases are the statutes contained in Md.Code (2006), \u00a7 1-202 and \u00a7 12-103 of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d). Appellant contends that neither authorizes a court to order the grandmother of minor children, involved in a custody dispute with the parents, to pay the fees of counsel appointed to represent the minor children. Appellant also contends, because the issue is one of subject matter jurisdiction, the issue cannot be waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">Section 1-201 of the Family Law Article provides that an equity court has jurisdiction over the custody, visitation, guardianship, and support of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">Section 1-202 provides that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">[i]n an action in which custody, visitation rights, or the amount of support of a minor child is contested, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">(1) appoint to represent the minor child counsel who may not represent any party to the action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">(2) impose against either or both parents counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">We agree with appellant that the statute does not authorize the court to impose fees against appellant. The plain language is that the court can impose fees against parents, not grandparents. <em>See In re Ramont K., </em>305 Md. 482[, 505 A.2d 507] (1986) (grandparent does not come within the term \u201cparents\u201d as used in Md.Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-829 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article pertaining to restitution on behalf of children involved in certain delinquent acts).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article provides that a court \u201cmay award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances\u201d in a custody proceeding. Generally, this section applies when a party requests a court to order another party to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>party\u2019s counsel fees. We must read F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 1-202 and 12-103 as being consistent with each other, if at all possible. It is questionable whether \u00a7 12-103 encompasses the payment of fees incurred by counsel for minor children, <em>see Goldberg v. Miller, </em>371 Md. 591 [, 810 A.2d 947] (2002), but assuming it does when a parent is ordered to pay, <em>see Carroll County Department of Social Services v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150[, 577 A.2d 14] (1990), it does not expressly authorize an order requiring a grandparent to pay such fees. \u00a7 1-202 expressly limits such orders to parents. Consequently, \u00a7 12-103 did not authorize the order requiring appellant to pay appellee\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Despite the above, we shall affirm the court\u2019s order because appellant impliedly consented to the court\u2019s action. Unquestionably, the court had subject matter jurisdiction to determine issues of custody and visitation, and it had personal jurisdiction over the parties and the children. The court had statutory authority to appoint counsel for the children and apportion fees, and while it did not have authority to award fees against appellant, appellant consented to apportionment of fees, between the parties, by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">Appellant requested the court to appoint a guardian ad litem/counsel. After the court entered an order reserving for future determination the appropriate apportionment of fees between the parties, appellant not only failed to object but complied with the order by depositing $1,000 into an escrow account. Appellant impliedly consented to the apportionment of appellee\u2019s fees. <em>See Van Schaik v. Van Schaik, </em>90 Md.App. 725[, 603 A.2d 908] (1992) (a party was held to have consented to appointment of counsel for a minor even though proceeding was uncontested).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The intermediate appellate court also rejected Taylor\u2019s arguments that the guardian ad litem bill was excessive, that the bill did not reflect services provided to the children, and that the circuit court failed to consider the circumstances of the parties mandated by statute. Additionally, the panel concluded that Taylor \u201cwas not deprived of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>We granted Taylor\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Taylor v. Mandel, </em>398 Md. 314, 920 A.2d 1059 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Taylor argues that the circuit court erred in assessing guardian ad litem fees against her because there is no statute or contractual understanding into which she entered to support such an assessment. Taylor contends that the plain language of Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article only permits the court to assess guardian ad litem fees against a parent, not a grandparent; Taylor also argues that Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article is inapplicable because it involves the payment of \u201ccounsel fees\u201d for the benefit of an aggrieved party, and not payment of guardian ad litem fees. Taylor contends that she did not waive her right to object to the guardian ad litem fees by depositing $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account and by failing to contest the fees until Mandel filed his petition because she did not intend to waive her objection to the guardian ad litem fees and because she deposited the money into her attorney\u2019s escrow account involuntarily pursuant to a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Conversely, Mandel argues that the circuit court did not err in imposing guardian ad litem fees against Taylor, contending that such authority exists under either Section 1-202 or Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article. Mandel contends that the Legislature did not intend to limit the term \u201cparent\u201d in Section 1-202 to just a father and a mother, and that Taylor could be assessed fees as a \u201cperson acting as a parent.\u201d Section 12-103, Mandel asserts, authorizes a court to assess guardian ad litem fees against any party, citing <em>Carroll County Department of Social Services v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 577 A.2d 14 (1990), for support. Mandel also argues that because Taylor impliedly consented to the appointment of the guardian ad litem and the payment of guardian ad litem fees by depositing $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account, she therefore waived her right to object to the fees, citing <em>Van Schaik v. Van Schaik, </em>90 Md.App. 725, 603 A.2d 908 (1992), for support. Mandel further argues that in the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Taylor did not preserve the statutory issue relating to the term \u201cparent\u201d under Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article because she did not object to the initial amended order of October 18, 2004 and did not argue that the court exceeded its statutory authority until Mandel had filed his petition for fees after the case had ended.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">If we agreed with Mandel that Taylor did not adequately preserve her statutory argument, that decision could be initially dispositive. Although we do not agree with Mandel, we shall address the preservation issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The general rule of preservation is that a party will only be permitted to raise on appeal an error to which he has interposed a seasonable objection. Maryland Rule 2-517(c) (\u201cFor purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court. The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless these rules expressly provide otherwise or the court so directs. If a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection at that time does not constitute a waiver of the objection.\u201d). <em>See also Tierco Md., Inc. v. Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 416, 849 A.2d 504, 527 (2004); <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 106 n. 29, 792 A.2d 288, 308 n. 29 (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(\u201c[A] contemporaneous objection made at the time of the ruling ordinarily preserves the issue for appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While it is apparent that Taylor, in both the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals, argued that she could not be held responsible for payment of the guardian ad litem fees because she was not a \u201cparent\u201d under Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article and because Section 12-103 only pertains to \u201ccounsel fees,\u201d Mandel argues, nevertheless, that Taylor\u2019s objection to the guardian ad litem fees was too late, ergo, untimely. In effect, Mandel contends that Taylor had to object at that time to the October 18, 2004 amended order appointing the guardian ad litem, requiring Taylor to deposit $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account, and reserving to the court the power to determine the apportionment of the guardian ad litem fees at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">For support, Mandel cites <em>Steinhoff v. Sommerfelt, </em>144 Md.App. 463, 798 A.2d 1195 (2002). In that case, Steinhoff obtained a judgment of divorce from his wife, Sommerfelt, and the court reserved the issues of alimony, marital property, attorney\u2019s fees and litigation costs. Following the court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order in which the court granted Sommerfelt a monetary award of $191,403.00, Steinhoff moved to alter and amend the judgment, arguing that \u201cthe trial court erred by refusing to grant a Qualified Domestic Relations Order\u201d to Sommerfelt, which would have allowed the court to transfer retirement assets to Sommerfelt as part of her award. Because the husband had failed to raise the issue of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order earlier, Sommerfelt argued that Steinhoff had not preserved the issue for appeal. The Court of Special Appeals agreed, referring to the husband\u2019s motion to alter or amend as \u201ca Stab at Belated Preservation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 798 A.2d at 1206. The intermediate appellate court concluded that because the issue was not preserved for appeal during the pendency of the divorce action, it could not be preserved for appeal by raising it for the first time in a post-trial motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">The appellant may not exploit an appeal from a post-trial procedure as a device to outflank the non-preservation bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to an appeal from a trial procedure. One may not preserve an issue <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">The appeal as to this contention, whatever it is, does not turn square corners. If, indeed, it is the ... monetary award itself that is being appealed from, we will not allow the appellant\u2019s reference to raising the issue in a post-trial motion to serve as a smokescreen obscuring the earlier and fatal non-preservation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 798 A.2d at 1206-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On the <em>Steinhoff </em>foundation, Mandel argues that Taylor\u2019s failure to object after the October 18th amended order was entered is fatal because guardian ad litem fees were addressed in that order. Taylor argues that she was not required to object to the amended order because it did not define what, if any, would be her liability for the guardian ad litem fees and because it was issued without a hearing and without giving her an opportunity to object. Taylor essentially contends that the issue to which she subsequently objected was not ripe on October 18th in order to require her to raise any objection. To the October 18, 2004 amended order we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">We are in accord with our intermediate appellate court colleagues that court orders are construed in the same manner as other written documents and contracts, <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey Communications, Inc., </em>110 Md.App. 493, 518, 678 A.2d 55, 67 (1996), and if the language of the order is clear and unambiguous, the court will give effect to its plain, ordinary, and usual meaning, taking into account the context in which it is used. <em>Hosain v. Malik, </em>108 Md.App. 284, 310-11, 671 A.2d 988,1001 (1996). Ambiguity exists, however, if \u201cwhen read by a reasonably prudent person, it is susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 436, 727 A.2d 358, 363 (1999). <em>See also Cheek v. United Healthcare of Mid-Atlantic, Inc., </em>378 Md. 139, 162-63, 835 A.2d 656, 670 (2003). We have stated that \u201clanguage can be regarded as ambiguous in two different respects: 1) it may be intrinsically unclear ...; or 2) its intrinsic meaning may be fairly clear, but its application to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>particular object or circumstance may be uncertain. Thus, a term which is unambiguous in one context may be ambiguous in another.\u201d <em>See Liverpool v. Balt. Diamond Exch., Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, 318, 799 A.2d 1264, 1272 (2002). If ambiguous, the court must discern its meaning by looking at the circumstances surrounding the order to shed light on the ambiguity, including the motion in response to which it was made. <em>See Carpenter Realty Corp. v. Imbesi, </em>369 Md. 549, 561-62, 801 A.2d 1018, 1025 (2002); <em>Balducci v. Eberly, </em>304 Md. 664, 670, 500 A.2d 1042, 1045 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The October 18, 2004 amended court order, with its three basic provisions, was submitted by Mandel and signed by the circuit court without a hearing. The first aspect of the court order was the appointment of Mandel as guardian ad litem. Although Mandel was not suggested by Taylor, she has not disputed his appointment as the guardian ad litem, because she requested the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The second aspect of the court order required Taylor to deposit $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account. Mandel argues that the order for Taylor to deposit $ 1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account should have triggered an objection by Taylor, at which time she would have had to raise her statutory argument. In this regard, while \u201ca voluntary act of a party which is inconsistent with the assignment of errors on appeal normally precludes that party from obtaining appellate review,\u201d <em>Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 69, 427 A.2d 1002, 1004 (1981), a party is not precluded from pursuing an appeal when he or she merely complies with a court order, because such action is not voluntary. <em>See Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 199-200, 725 A.2d 1027, 1032 (1999); <em>Farmers\u2019 &amp; Merchants\u2019 Nat\u2019l Bank v. Harper, </em>153 Md. 128, 132, 137 A. 702, 706 (1927). Thus, Taylor\u2019s deposit of the $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account pursuant to court order does not in and of itself preclude appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The $1,000.00 was to be held \u201csubject to further Order of this Court regarding apportionment between the parties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>their respective obligations to pay the reasonable counsel fees of the attorney for the minor children,\u201d and the court \u201creserve[d] for future determination\u201d the assessment of guardian ad litem fees. Mandel argues that these final provisions should have initiated Taylor\u2019s statutory objection to the assessment of guardian ad litem fees against her. The amended court order, in its ambiguity however, failed to define Taylor\u2019s liability, if any, at all. Apportion is defined as \u201cto divide and share out according to a plan,\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 61 (11th ed.2005), or to divide the \u201crights and liabilities between two or more persons or entities,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 109 (8th ed.2004), but the amended order, however, contained no plan to divide the liability for the guardian ad litem fees. The order was silent as to the specific liability and stated only that the apportionment would occur in the future; pursuant to statute, the court could have determined that Taylor could not have been assessed guardian ad litem fees. Certainly, not until Taylor\u2019s liability was fixed would she have been required to object, which she did. Thus, she has preserved the issues involving assessment of guardian ad litem fees for appellate review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Guardian ad litem fees may be assessed pursuant to statutory authority or express contractual provision. The statutory justification for the award of guardian ad litem fees against Taylor as the maternal grandmother, Mandel argues, can be found in Sections 1-202 and 12-103 of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1999, 2004 ReplYol.). It is well established' that in conducting statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Kane v.

Further, whenever possible, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions which does not lead to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>absurd consequences. <em>See Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 53, 912 A.2d 658, 673 (2006); <em>So. Easton Neighborhood </em>Assoc. <em>v. Town of Easton, </em>387 Md. 468, 495, 876 A.2d 58, 74 (2005); <em>Smack v.

If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v.

If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose. <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Mayor and Town Council of Oakland v.

The term \u201cparent\u201d is not defined in Section 1-202 nor anywhere in Title 1 of the Family Law Article, although when the General Assembly has intended a specific definition of parent, it has provided such.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>occasion, in another context in which the Legislature has not defined parent, to give it its ordinary meaning. In <em>In re Ramont K., </em>305 Md. 482, 505 A.2d 507 (1986), we addressed whether a grandmother was a \u201cparent\u201d within the meaning of Section 3-829 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In that case, the grandmother of a young man was ordered to pay restitution after the grandson assaulted a victim The grandmother, who had raised the juvenile from his tender years, contested the restitution order on the basis that she was not his parent within the meaning of the statute. We agreed with the grandmother, holding that the \u201ccommon, ordinary understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ing of the term \u2018parent\u2019 does not include a grandparent,\u201d and that \u201c[w]here the General Assembly has desired to make one standing in loco parentis responsible it has known how to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 505 A.2d at 511. The <em>In re Ramont K. </em>opinion noted on two prior occasions, <em>In re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. 515, 521, 471 A.2d 313, 316 (1984) (\u201cWe think it fully evident that the plain and popularly understood meaning of the term parent is ... \u2018a father or a mother.\u2019 \u201d), and <em>In re James D., </em>295 Md. 314, 327, 455 A.2d 966, 972 (1983) (\u201cThe term \u2018parent\u2019 is commonly understood to mean a father or a mother .... \u201d), we had interpreted parent as a mother and father. <em>In re Ramont K., </em>305 Md. at 485-89, 505 A.2d at 509-11. Moreover, we iterated in <em>In re Ramont K. </em>that if this Court were to interpret the term \u201cparent\u201d in Section 3-829 to have included the grandparent, it \u201cwould constitute writing words into the statute,\u201d contrary to the rules of statutory interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 505 A.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Given that we presume that the Legislature has acted with full knowledge of prior and existing law, legislation and policy, <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316, 896 A.2d at 1045; <em>Burch v. United Cable Television of Balt. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>391 Md. 687, 702, 895 A.2d 980, 988 (2006), it becomes evident that \u201cparent\u201d means only a mother or father against whom guardian ad litem fees can be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The legislative history surrounding Section 1-202 is also instructive. Contrary to Mandel\u2019s assertion, the term \u201cparent\u201d has been included in Section 1-202 since its inception. Section 1-202 was originally enacted as Section 3-604 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">The court, for good cause, may appoint an attorney to represent a minor in any action brought under this subtitle in which the issue of custody, visitation rights, or the amount of support is contested and may levy counsel fees against <em>either or both parents </em>as is just and proper under all the circumstances. An attorney appointed to represent a minor may not represent any party to the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Maryland Code (1974, 1976 Supp.), Section 3-604 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, as enacted by 1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 250 (emphasis added). Section 3-604 was recodified in 1984 without substantive change as Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article. In 2006, Section 1-202 was amended in response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fox v. Wills, </em>390 Md. 620, 890 A.2d 726 (2006) (holding that attorney appointed to represent minor child as guardian ad litem was not entitled to immunity from legal malpractice action), \u201cto restore the authority of the courts to appoint a best interest attorney who would provide an independent assessment of what is in the child\u2019s best interest____\u201d Department of Legislative Services, Fiscal and Policy Note, House Bill 700 (2006). That amendment did not, however, expand a court\u2019s authority to order payment of guardian ad litem fees against third parties even though third parry custody issues had had some notoriety prior to 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Certainly, third party custody issues have been before this Court for many years. In <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A.2d 582 (1977), we announced that the best interest of the child standard is always determinative in child custody disputes, and that when the dispute involves a third party, \u201cit is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest is subserved by custody in the parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 372 A.2d at 587. Additionally, we concluded that the parental custody presumption can be overcome by showing that the parent is \u201cunfit to have custody\u201d or that there are such \u201cexceptional circumstances as to make such custody detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In 2003, we considered another third party custody issue in <em>Shurupoff v. Vockroth, </em>372 Md. 639, 814 A.2d 543 (2003), and held that a clear and convincing evidence standard to show the best interest of the child is not constitutionally required nor appropriate in third party custody disputes. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 814 A.2d at 556. In response to <em>Shurwpoff, </em>House Bill 1092 (2004) and Senate Bill 602 (2004) were filed, which would have allowed a third party to establish himself or herself as a \u201cde facto custodian,\u201d defined as \u201can individual who has been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>primary caretaker and financial support of a child,\u201d and obtain the same standing in custody matters as a parent. House Bill 1092 (2004). Although the legislation did not become law, it clearly demonstrates that the General Assembly is cognizant of third party custody issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">One of our recent cases, <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005), involved an extensive discussion of third party custody and relied on <em>Shurupoff. </em>In <em>McDermott, </em>we concluded that the presumption in favor of parental custody is not overcome by a mere showing that the parent has sought assistance in raising the child or that the parent\u2019s work schedule requires him to leave the state for months at a time. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 869 A.2d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">As a result, we agree with both the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals and hold that the circuit court did not possess the authority to assess guardian ad litem fees against Taylor, the maternal grandmother of the children, under Section 1-202 of the Family Law Article because the use of the term \u201cparent\u201d only permits the court to assess the fees on a mother or a father.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Although the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals disagreed, Mandel also continues to argue that the authority to assess guardian ad litem fees against Taylor exists pursuant to Section 12-103(a) of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1999, 2004 RephVol.), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">[t]he court may award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in any case in which a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">(1) applies for a decree or modification of a decree concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">(2) files any form of proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">(i) to recover arrearages of child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">(ii) to enforce a decree of child support; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">(iii) to enforce a decree of custody or visitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Mandel asserts that we have sanctioned the award of guardian ad litem fees under Section 12-103 in <em>Carroll County Department of Social Services v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. at 150, 577 A.2d at 14. In that case, a mother filed a petition to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights. The Department of Social Services, which had intervened to recover unpaid child support as the mother\u2019s assignee, successfully petitioned the court to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor child. After the case concluded, without conducting a hearing and without assigning any reasons, the trial court awarded the guardian ad litem\u2019s fees against DSS. This Court reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 177-78, 577 A.2d at 27. After quoting both Section 1-202 and Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article, we opined that \u201cSection 12-103(b) requires the court, in exercising its discretion, to consider the financial status of the parties, the needs of the parties, and whether there was substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 577 A.2d at 27. Noting that \u201c[t]here is no indication in this record that the court considered any of those factors ... [,] without the benefit of a hearing and without any evidence as to [the father\u2019s] financial status,\u201d we remanded the case for the court to \u201cdetermin[e] who shall pay [the guardian ad litem] fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Mandel\u2019s argument, however, we did not hold that guardian ad litem fees could be assessed under the purview of Section 12-103(a). Instead, we held that whenever a court assesses guardian ad litem fees under Section 1-202, the court should consider various factors, such as those articulated in Section 12-103(b) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Rather, we recently have held in <em>Goldberg v. Miller, </em>371 Md. at 591, 810 A.2d at 947, that Section 12-103(a) <em>did not </em>encompass awards of guardian ad litem fees. In that case, a guardian ad litem who was awarded fees against the father sought to have his fees characterized as \u201cin the nature of \u2018child support\u2019 \u201d in order to be able to garnish the father\u2019s federal retirement benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 810 A.2d at 949. We determined, however, that Section 12-103 pertained to \u201ccounsel fees,\u201d not guardian ad litem fees, and that because \u201ccounsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>fees\u201d are for the benefit of the party and not the child, they could not be treated as child support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Section 12-103(a) allows the court, at its discretion, to award counsel fees to \u201ceither party\u201d of a domestic case where issues of child support, custody, or visitation are involved. Code, \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Family Law Article. Section 12-103(a), though, does not concern attorney\u2019s fees that a court may award to a guardian ad litem. <em>See Petrini [v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 467-68, 648 A.2d 1016, 1022-23 (1994) ]. Rather, it refers to any counsel fees accrued by one <em>party </em>in applying for or defending a matter involving child support, child custody, or visitation. Code, \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Family Law Article. The party, therefore, rather than the child, receives the immediate benefit from an award under this section, unlike the expenses the Legislature addressed under Section 12\u2014101 (d)(ii), which governs medical support and neonatal expenses, and Section 12-102(b), which governs orders to required health insurance coverage for a child. Thus, courts may not treat an award under Section 12-103(a) as child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 606, 810 A.2d at 956 (emphasis in original). Therefore, Taylor is not liable for guardian ad litem fees under Section 12-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In the absence of statutory authority for the imposition of guardian ad litem fees against Taylor, Mandel alternatively argues that Taylor waived her right to challenge the guardian ad litem fees because she requested the appointment of the guardian ad litem and in fact deposited $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account. The circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals agreed with Mandel; we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We have defined waiver as the intentional relinquishment of a known right. <em>In re Blessen H., </em>392 Md. 684, 698, 898 A.2d 980, 988 (2006); <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 205, 892 A.2d 520, 530 (2006). Waiver rests upon the intention of the party, <em>Gould v. Transamerican Assocs., </em>224 Md. 285, 295, 167 A.2d 905, 909 (1961), and therefore, acts relied upon as constituting waiver must unequivocally demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>waiver is intended. <em>Myers, </em>391 Md. at 205, 892 A.2d at 530-31; <em>Gold Coast Mall, Inc. v. Larmar Corp., </em>298 Md. 96, 109, 468 A.2d 91, 98 (1983). The right or advantage waived must be known; \u201c[t]he general rule is that there can be no waiver unless the person against whom the waiver is claimed had full knowledge of his rights, and of facts which will enable him to take effectual action for the enforcement of such rights.\u201d <em>Armour Fertilizer Works v. Broum, </em>185 Md. 273, 278-79, 44 A.2d 753, 755 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Mandel\u2019s argument, built on the premise that Taylor waived her right to object to the assessment of the guardian ad litem fees because she requested the guardian ad litem appointment and deposited $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account, relies upon <em>Van Schaik v. Van Schaik, </em>90 Md.App. at 725, 603 A.2d at 908. <em>Van Schaik </em>was a divorce proceeding that concluded in a separation, custody and property settlement agreement. Thereafter, the trial court, sua sponte, appointed a guardian ad litem for the parties\u2019 minor child; the guardian ad litem subsequently moved for a psychological and orthodontic evaluation of the child. In response, the father <em>expressly </em>consented to the evaluations and the appointment of the guardian ad litem, as well as agreed that the costs of the evaluation and attorney fees should be determined by the court after a hearing in a responsive pleading: \u201cRobert Van Schaik has no objection to the appointment of an attorney to represent the interests of the minor child and no objection to the procuring of an independent psychological evaluation \u2014 That the costs of the matter related to the appointment of an attorney and any other costs related to psychological evaluation should be determined by the Court after a proper hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 603 A.2d at 911-12. When the guardian ad litem moved to recover fees, the father objected. The issue before the Court of Special Appeals was only whether the court had the authority to order the payment of guardian ad litem fees where there were no contested issues of custody, visitation rights or child support, not waiver, because the father had expressly consented to the assessment of guardian ad litem fees. There is no express waiver in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals, however, determined that Taylor had impliedly consented to the assessment of guardian ad litem fees against her. Implied consent, however, cannot be found on these facts. At the time Taylor requested the appointment of the guardian ad litem, there was no hearing regarding fees. The original order appointing Mandel as guardian ad litem did not contain any reference to fees, and the Amended Order Appointing Counsel for Minor Children reserved the determination of fees to a later date and stated that the $1,000.00 was to be held in escrow \u201csubject to further Order o f this Court regarding apportionment between the parties <em>of their respective obligations </em>to pay the reasonable counsel fees of the attorney for the minor children.\u201d (emphasis added). Without apportionment of liability, however, Taylor could not be found to have impliedly consented to the assessment of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Her deposit of $1,000.00 into her attorney\u2019s escrow account in compliance with a <em>court order, </em>moreover, was not voluntary relinquishment of a right, ergo waiver, as we noted in <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. at 188, 725 A.2d at 1027. In that case, the Board of Physician Quality Assurance restored Dr. Levitsky\u2019s license to practice medicine in order to conform with a circuit court order, prior to appealing the court\u2019s decision. We rejected Dr. Levitsky\u2019s argument that the Board had waived its right to challenge the order, noting that for the Board to have waived its right to appeal, it must have done so voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>at 199-200, 725 A.2d at 1032. Considering that the Board had no choice \u201cbut to act in conformance with the circuit court\u2019s order,\u201d we concluded that the Board\u2019s action was not voluntary or inconsistent with its position on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">There was no voluntary act here on the part of the Board inconsistent with its position that the circuit court erred in vacating its order. The Board filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, sought a stay from the circuit court, and even petitioned for <em>certiorari </em>in this Court. When the stay was denied, the Board had no choice but to act in conformance with the circuit court\u2019s order; any further withholding of Dr. Levitsky\u2019s license would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>been patently unlawful and may have subjected the Board and its members to serious legal consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 200, 725 A.2d at 1082. <em>See also Farmers\u2019 &amp; Merchants\u2019 Nat\u2019l Bank v.

Wills, </em>390 Md. 620, 890 A.2d 726 (2006), \"the term 'guardian <em>ad litem \u2019 </em>has been rarely used by the Maryland General Assembly or by this Court,\u201d and that \u201cit usually has been synonymous with \u2018next friend\u2019 or <em>\u2018prochein ami,\u2019 </em>which is one who brings suit on behalf of a minor or disabled person because the minor or disabled person lacks capacity to sue in his or her own right, or synonymous with one who defends a suit against a minor or disabled person lacking the capacity to defend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 890 A.2d at 729. Both the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals used the term \"guardian ad litem,\u201d however, and in order to avoid confusion, we will do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-12\">. \u201cGAL\u201d refers to guardian ad litem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-13\">.

The Biedenbacks argued that they were exempt from paying the guardian ad litem fees under Maryland Rule l-325(a), which provides in relevant part that \"[a] person unable by reason of poverty to pay any filing fee or other court costs ordinarily required to be prepaid may file a request for an order waiving the prepayment of those costs,\u201d and Maryland Rule 2-603(e), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">(e) Waiver of costs in domestic relations cases\u2014Indigency.

The party may seek the waiver at the conclusion of the case in accordance with Rule l-325(a). If the party was granted a waiver pursuant to that Rule and remains unable to pay the costs, the affidavit required by Rule 1-325(a) need only recite the existence of the prior waiver and the party\u2019s continued inability to pay.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\">. After noting her appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Taylor sent a check for $6,821.73 to Mandel \"to be deposited and kept in your escrow account\" pending the appeal. The circuit court subsequently recorded a judgment against Taylor. Taylor filed a motion to vacate in response, which is still pending in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. Mandel contends that there is a discrepancy between Taylor's Notice of Appeal and her Civil Appeal Information Report. He asserts that it is unclear what order Taylor was appealing, because the Notice of Appeal stated that Taylor was appealing the January 31, 2006 order granting guardian ad litem fees to Mandel, but the Civil Information Report provided that Taylor was appealing the May 5, 2005 motion by guardian ad litem to recover fees. However, not only did Mandel acknowledge in his own Civil Appeal Information Report that Taylor was appealing from the January 2006 ruling, but also pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-205(f), the information contained in the information report should not \u201c(1) be treated as admissions, (2) limit the disclosing party in presenting or arguing that party\u2019s case, or (3) be referred to except at a prehearing or scheduling conference.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b159-5\">. The preservation argument also implicates the doctrine of acquiescence on Taylor's part, i.e., whether her silence during the term of Mandel\u2019s work constitutes agreement to payment. We have opined that, \" '[acquiescence ... has been described as a quasi-estoppel,\u2019 \u201d <em>Alvey v. Alvey, 220 </em>Md. 571, 575, 155 A.2d 491, 493 (1959), quoting 3 John Norton Pomeroy, <em>A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence </em>245 (5th ed.1941), so that to constitute acquiescence, the elements of estoppel must be present. <em>Id. </em>The elements of estoppel enunciated by Pomeroy are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">1. There must be conduct\u2014acts, language, or silence\u2014amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">2. These facts must be known to the party estopped at the time of his said conduct, or at least the circumstances must be such that knowledge of them is necessarily imputed to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">3. The truth concerning these facts must be unknown to the other party claiming the benefit of the estoppel, at the time when such conduct was done, <em>and at the time when it was acted upon by him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\"><em>4. </em>The conduct must be done with the intention, or at least with the <em>expectation, </em>that it will be acted upon by the other party, or under such circumstances that it is both natural and probable that it will be so acted upon. There are several familiar species in which it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>simply <em>impossible </em>to ascribe any <em>intention </em>or even <em>expectation </em>to the party estopped that his conduct will be acted upon by the one who afterwards claims the benefit of the estoppel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">5. The conduct must be relied upon by the other party, and, thus relying, he must be led to act upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">6. He must in fact act upon it in such a manner as to change his position for the worse; in other words, he must so act that he would suffer a loss if he were compelled to surrender or forego or alter what he has done by reason of the first party being permitted to repudiate his conduct and to assert rights inconsistent with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Pomeroy, <em>supra, </em>at 191-92 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Acquiescence, however, requires knowledge of liabilities, which, as we have discussed above, Taylor did not have. <em>See City of Bowie v.
