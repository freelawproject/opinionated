Although we cannot state conclusively that no conceivable set of facts that may be developed on remand, based on the analysis here, could support disposition of this dispute by summary judgment, we suggest that it is quite likely that this litigation presents triable issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Mary Sasso acquired the residential property at 533 S. Chester Street in Baltimore City (the \u201cProperty\u201d) on 28 March 1991. Approximately six months later, she conveyed the Property to her daughter, Kathleen Hill, reserving for herself, however, a life estate with the power to encumber the Property. In 1999, Sasso obtained a home equity loan from Provident Bank (\u201cProvident\u201d) using the Property as security for the loan. Provident recorded among the land records of Baltimore City on 22 April 1999 the Deed of Trust associated with that loan. Sasso refinanced the loan with Provident, and a new Deed of Trust was executed, on 25 October 2002. Provident issued a certificate of satisfaction for the 1999 loan and properly recorded the new Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Sasso died on 18 May 2003. Provident continued to receive from Hill regular payments on the 2002 loan until a last payment on 25 June 2004. In June 2004, Adedayo Mseka (the \u201cBuyer\u201d) agreed with Hill to purchase the Property for $175,000. Cross Country Settlements, LLC (\u201cCross Country\u201d), was engaged by the Buyer to conduct the closing. During its title search, Cross Country discovered the outstanding 2002 Deed of Trust in favor of Provident. Cross Country contacted Provident to obtain payoff information. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>this point in time, the only relevant information Cross Country had was the name of the borrower (Sasso) and other self-explanatory information revealed by the four corners of the recorded Deed of Trust. The record does not contain written documentation of the initial communications between Provident and Cross Country. The communications were characterized, however, in an affidavit of Cross Country\u2019s President, Rebecca L. Raras, submitted in support of Cross Country\u2019s motion for summary judgment, as \u201cdifficult.\u201d In essence, Cross Country was unable to obtain payoff information from Provident.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">At some point after Cross Country contacted Provident initially, with no success, Cross Country asked for further information from Hill about the 2002 Deed of Trust loan. Hill gave Cross Country what she thought was the correct account number at Provident, number 96021899. This account number, as it turns out, was for the original 1999 loan on the Property, not the 2002 loan. Hill also supplied to Cross Country Sasso\u2019s death certificate, which contained such information as Sasso\u2019s Social Security Number.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Cross Country, using the account number provided by Hill, contacted Provident again in an effort to obtain payoff information for the 2002 loan. Provident responded on 6 July 2004 with a letter stating \u201cthe above referenced loan was paid in full on October 30, 2002. Deed and Certificate of Satisfaction sent to customer on January 24, 2003.\u201d Cross Country nonetheless deemed it odd that a loan would be paid in full only five days after it had been executed and recorded. Cross Country renewed its request to Provident for payoff information for the 2002 loan. Provident responded by faxing a copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of the 6 July 2004 letter to Cross Country, with a cover sheet that said, \u201c[tjhis was faxed to you on 7-6-04. PS Loan has been pd in full.\u201d There is nothing in the record to indicate that Cross Country solicited a confirmatory release or certificate of satisfaction from Provident regarding the 2002 loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The Hill-Mseka closing on the Property occurred on 15 July 2004. At settlement, Raras claimed, in her summary judgment affidavit, that Hill inquired about a Provident account being paid off. Raras showed Hill the 6 July 2004 payoff letter from Provident and inquired as to whether there were outstanding mortgages on the Property. Hill responded that the Provident account she had in mind when earlier she supplied the number 96021899 was a credit card account in her mother\u2019s name. Raras also claims that Hill informed her that the payoff letter from Provident was accurate. The form \u201cOwner\u2019s Affidavit\u201d signed by Hill at closing states, \u201cTHAT no agreement or contract for conveyance, or deed, conveyance, written lease, or writing whatsoever, is in existence, adversely affecting the title to said premises, except that in connection with which this Affidavit is given.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The settlement proceeded, with Hill receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Property without deduction for any amount due on the 2002 Provident loan. Cross Country, as agent for Stewart Title Guaranty Company (\u201cStewart\u201d), issued a title insurance policy to the Buyer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On 16 September 2004, two months after the closing and the last payment on the 2002 loan, Provident faxed Cross Country a pay off sheet for the outstanding loan, account number 96038807. The amount of the payoff was $70,261.26. On 21 September 2004, Cross Country sent a letter to Hill demand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ing that Hill \u201cforward to Cross Country Settlements, LLC a certified check [for $70,261.26] made payable to Provident Bank____\u201d Hill did not respond to the demand letter. On 22 December 2004, Provident informed the Buyer that the Property would be sold at foreclosure in early 2005. Provident initiated foreclosure proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Buyer made a claim against her title insurer, Stewart. Stewart paid the $70,261.26 to Provident, without apparent protest or mounting a defense to the foreclosure on behalf of the Buyer, its insured. Because the title insurance policy was not made a part of the record here, there is no basis upon which to evaluate Stewart\u2019s decision to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Stewart then made demand upon its issuing agent, Cross Country, for reimbursement of the funds paid to Provident. Cross Country paid Stewart on 18 February 2005. Cross Country claims it was required to reimburse Stewart by the terms of an underwriting agreement between them, although that agreement also was not made part of the record. The sole basis in the record in support of Cross Country\u2019s claim that it was obligated by contract to reimburse Stewart is a bare assertion to that effect in the affidavit of Raras.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Cross Country filed its first Complaint against Hill on 12 November 2004 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a series of dismissals and amended complaints, the Fourth Amended Complaint (the final complaint) and Cross Country\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment were filed on 8 March 2005, after Cross Country paid Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The Fourth Amended Complaint contained five counts: intentional misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation\u2014 concealment, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and monies had and received. The misrepresentation counts were dismissed by the Circuit Court on Hill\u2019s motion on 5 October 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Upon the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Circuit Court granted summary judgment to Cross Country on Count IV, unjust enrichment, on 2 December 2005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hill filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court, in a reported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, LLC, </em>172 Md.App. 350, 914 A.2d 231 (2007). We granted certiorari, on Hill\u2019s petition, to consider whether the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to Cross Country. <em>Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, </em>398 Md. 314, 920 A.2d 1058 (2007).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Maryland law is well settled regarding the appellate standards to be applied in reviewing a grant of summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d and \u201cthe party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Maryland Rule 2\u2014501(f). \u201cIn granting or denying a motion for summary judgment, a judge makes no findings of fact.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608, 615 (1985). The appellate court will \u201creview the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u201d <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520, 529 (2006). \u201cIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Md. Rule 2-501, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. v. Neal, </em>398 Md. 705, 714, 922 A.2d 538, 543 (2007) (quoting <em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 9-10, 862 A.2d 33, 38 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">As iterated above, if there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact, summary judgment is improper. Even where the underlying facts are undisputed, \u201cif they [are] susceptible of more than one inference, the party against whom inferences [are] to be drawn ... [is] entitled to the inferences most favorable to his contentions.\u201d <em>Roland v. Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc., </em>221 Md. 11, 14, 155 A.2d 691, 693 (1959) (citing <em>White v. Friel, </em>210 Md. 274, 285, 123 A.2d 303, 308 (1956)). If the facts are subject to more than one inference, those inferences should be submitted to the trier of fact. <em>Porter v. Gen. Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 413, 396 A.2d 1090, 1096 (1979); <em>Fenwick Motor Co. v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 138, 265 A.2d 256, 258(1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In 2000, this Court identified the elements of a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>unjust enrichment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> previously considered by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Everhart v. Miles, </em>47 Md.App. 131, 136, 422 A.2d 28, 31 (1980). Unjust enrichment consists of three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">1. A benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">2. An appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">3. The acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without the payment of its value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\"><em>Berry &amp; Gould, P.A. v. Berry, </em>360 Md. 142, 151-152, 757 A.2d 108, 113 (2000) (quoting <em>County Comm\u2019rs v. J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. 83, 95 n. 7, 747 A.2d 600, 607 n. 7 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Unjust enrichment is a claim, however, that may not be reduced neatly to a golden rule. <em>See </em>Daniel Friedmann, <em>Restitution of Benefits Obtained Through the Appropriation of Property or the Commission of a Wrong, </em>80 Colum. L.Rev. 504, 504-05 (1980) (\u201c[U]njust enrichment is notoriously difficult to define. It has on occasion been regarded as too indefinite and vague to be recognized as a general legal principle, with concern expressed that its adoption might undermine legal stability, confuse legal thinking, and jeopardize clear, systematic organization of the law.\u201d). A successful unjust enrichment claim serves to \u201cdeprive the defendant of benefits that in equity and good conscience he ought not to keep, even though he may have received those benefits quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>honestly in the first instance, and even though the plaintiff may have suffered no demonstrable losses.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev. v. Mullen, </em>165 Md.App. 624, 659, 886 A.2d 900, 921 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 Md. 579, 894 A.2d 546 (2006) (quoting Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.1). \u201cA person who receives a benefit by reason of an infringement of another person\u2019s interest, or of loss suffered by the other, owes restitution to him in the manner and amount necessary to prevent unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Berry &amp; Gould, P.A v. Berry, </em>360 Md. 142, 151, 757 A.2d 108, 113 (2000) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Restitution \u00a7 1 (Tentative Draft No. 1, 1983)). \u201cThe restitution claim ... is not aimed at compensating the plaintiff, but at forcing the defendant to disgorge benefits that it would be unjust for him to keep.\u201d <em>Mass Transit Admin, v. Granite Const. Co., </em>57 Md.App. 766, 775, 471 A.2d 1121, 1126 (1984). \u201cThe defendant who has received money from the plaintiff by mistake, even though the mistake is an honest one, may be compelled to make restitution of the money.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">A defendant, however, \u201cis not unjustly enriched, and therefore not required to make restitution where the benefit was conferred by a volunteer or intermeddler.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9 (citing Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 112 (1937)). This principle is based on the notion that \u201cone who confers a benefit upon another without affording that other the opportunity to reject the benefit, has no equitable claim for relief against the recipient of the benefit in the absence of some special policy....\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201cIf plaintiff pays defendant\u2019s debt under the mistaken apprehension that he was himself under a duty to do it ... there is less reason to treat him as being officious, and the courts will usually grant restitution.\u201d John W. Wade, <em>Restitution for Benefits Conferred Without Request, </em>19 Vand. L.Rev. 1183, 1201 (1996); <em>see Boney v. Cent. Mut. Ins. Co. of Chi, </em>213 N.C. 563, 197 S.E. 122 (1938) (holding that plaintiff insurance broker is entitled to recovery from defendant insurance carrier where the plaintiff paid claim denied by carrier out of moral responsibility); <em>but see Gallagher, Magner &amp; Solomento, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>214 Pa.Super. 233, 252 A.2d 206, 207 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(1969) (denying recovery where plaintiff insurance broker paid claim denied by insurance carrier because \u201cwhere the plaintiff is not liable for the debt, he has no right to volunteer a payment\u201d); <em>Gaul v. McLaughlin, </em>207 Pa.Super. 434, 217 A.2d 757 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">An unjust enrichment claim is \u201cequitable in nature, and the right to restitution is therefore subject to any counter-equities that the recipient of benefits may assert.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11.9. Although the basis for recovery in unjust enrichment is not based on fault, misconduct or fault of one of the parties is sometimes considered in determining whether to permit recovery. Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11.9.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The parties to the present case vigorously contest the application of the elements of unjust enrichment to the record. Hill argues that, as a matter of law, none of the required elements, especially the second element, can be satisfied, and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate. Cross Country contends that all three elements have been satisfied, and demands affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Regarding the first element, whether the plaintiff conferred a cognizable benefit on the defendant, Hill argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that Cross Country was not capable of bestowing a benefit, as it did not pay over to Hill monies belonging to Cross Country. As a settlement agent, Hill contends, Cross Country had no financial stake in the closing transaction, other than its own fees. Cross Country\u2019s role in the transaction essentially was to act as an intermediary and conduit for monies belonging to others. Cross Country counters by pointing out that a representative of Cross Country at the closing handed Hill a check drawn on a Cross Country checking account. Cross Country contends that there is no doubt that Hill received a benefit from Cross Country.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Both parties largely are incorrect. Although the consummation of the real estate closing did not constitute a conveyance of a benefit to Hill by Cross Country for the purposes of analysis of an unjust enrichment claim, the events alleged to have occurred subsequent to the closing may support a conclusion that a benefit was conferred. As a matter of law, the payment of the debt of another constitutes a benefit conferred, and thus may satisfy the first element of an unjust enrichment claim. The Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 76 (1937) states, \u201c[a] person who, in whole or in part, has discharged a duty which is owed by him but which as between himself and another should have been discharged by the other, is entitled to indemnity from the other, unless the payor is barred by the wrongful nature of his conduct.\u201d Thus, when a plaintiff pays the liability of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s balance sheet improves as a result of such payment. <em>See </em>Wade, <em>supra, </em>at 1186 (\u201cOne is enriched not only when he receives an asset but also when someone else performs for him a duty which would be a burden to him. The clearest case is that of one person paying another\u2019s debt. The elimination of this obligation is clearly a benefit....\u201d). Moreover, we have not required always that a benefit conferred in an unjust enrichment action come necessarily and directly to the defendant from the plaintiffs own resources. <em>See Plitt v. Greenberg, </em>242 Md. 359, 364, 219 A.2d 237, 241 (1966) (\u2018\u201cIt is immaterial how the money may have come into the defendant\u2019s hands, and the fact that it was received from a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>person will not affect his liability, if, in equity and good conscience, he is not entitled to hold it against the true owner.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Empire Oil Co. v. Lynch, </em>106 Ga.App. 42, 126 S.E.2d 478, 479 (1963))); <em>Plitt, </em>242 Md. at 364, 219 A.2d at 241 (\u201c[A] plaintiff could recover money from even an innocent transferee who was without knowledge that he possessed the plaintiffs money.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Cross Country, by reimbursing Stewart, paid an asserted debt which it contends is more properly chargeable to Hill. If Hill were found to be liable to Stewart, and as a result of the payment by Cross Country that liability was erased, Hill may be said to have received a benefit from satisfaction of that claim. By contrast, if Hill should be determined not to be liable to Provident or Stewart in an action brought directly against Hill, Hill received no benefit as Cross Country paid a debt that Hill did not owe.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Hill contends that the second element of an unjust enrichment claim is not present because, viewing the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to her as the nonmoving party, she was unaware of the 2002 mortgage at the time she received the overpayment at closing. This argument fails to for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">First, as discussed above, the alleged benefit being litigated in this case is Cross Country\u2019s reimbursement to Stewart. The essence of the requirement that the defendant have knowledge or appreciation of the benefit is that the defendant have an opportunity to decline the benefit. \u201cIt is quite appropriate to say ... that the opportunity may exist later; and that the defendant has a true opportunity to decline by insisting that he pay the debt himself. This would produce a ... result ... which should be encouraged.\u201d Wade, <em>supra, </em>at 1213. Hill apparently had knowledge and appreciation of that payment, as she received a written demand from Cross Country that she pay the balance owed on the mortgage to Provident. In fact, this litigation was initiated prior to the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>from Cross Country to Stewart. Hill had a fair opportunity to decline the alleged benefit ultimately conferred by Cross Country by making the payment herself.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Second, Hill misunderstands the purpose behind the requirement that the defendant against whom a successful unjust enrichment claim is lodged have knowledge or appreciation of the benefit conferred. When the benefit conferred is money, there is no requirement that a defendant necessarily have knowledge or appreciation of the benefit precisely at the time the benefit is conferred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Some courts have held that when a defendant declines a plaintiffs request to return a conferred benefit, the defendant has been afforded a fair opportunity to reject the benefit, and thus, recovery may be permitted. <em>See Consol. Fisheries Co. v. Consol. Solubles Co., </em>112 A.2d 30, 35 (Del.1955) (\u201cAs a general rule, also, even a volunteer who pays the obligation of another is entitled to reimbursement from the obligor when he takes advantage of the act of the volunteer.\u201d); <em>Beacon Homes, Inc. v. Holt, </em>266 N.C. 467, 146 S.E.2d 434 (N.C.1966) (holding that when plaintiff erroneously built a house on defendant\u2019s land, and defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>dant refused to permit plaintiff to remove the structure, plaintiff was entitled to recovery because defendant had a choice of retaining the benefit). In other words, restitutionary recovery may be permitted under a theory of unjust enrichment when the recipient of the benefit \u201cin fact retains a choice of keeping or returning it.... \u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9. If a plaintiff is mistaken as to the duties or rights that he or she owes another and \u201cbecause of his mistake confers a benefit upon another, that [plaintiff] is often entitled to recover the value of that benefit, in spite of the fact that the recipient was given no opportunity to decline it.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> The final element of an unjust enrichment claim is a fact-specific balancing of the equities. \u201cThe task is to determine whether the enrichment is unjust.\u201d Wade, <em>supra, </em>at 1185. In making fact-specific determinations, a reviewing court considers the facts in the record, and the reasonable inferences drawn from those facts, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, Hill in this case. <em>Harford County v. Saks, </em>399 Md. 73, 82, 923 A.2d 1, 6, (2007). Hill presents two related arguments. First, Hill argues that, because either Cross Country or Stewart could have avoided enforcement of any asserted liability owed to Provident by asserting the doctrine of equitable estoppel, Cross Country was a volunteer and therefore prohibited from recovery against her. Second, Hill argues that an unjust enrichment claim should not be allowed to be maintained in lieu of a subrogation claim which, if anything, was the more proper form of remedy, if any remedy existed. Under subrogation, Hill contends, she would be able to assert the defense of equitable estoppel against Cross Country and defeat recovery. We will address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">It is undisputed that once properly yoked with the label of \u201cmere volunteer\u201d or \u201cofficious payor,\u201d a plaintiff is prohibited from recovering under theories of unjust enrich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ment or subrogation. It less clear, however, precisely when a plaintiffs payment to a third party satisfying the liability of the defendant renders a plaintiff a volunteer and casts him or her \u201cinto legal outer darkness.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.3.

We agree with the Restatement (First) of Restitution (1937) \u00a7 79, that a plaintiff may recover for a payment or payments to a third party as long as the plaintiff was not officious in making such payment or payments. Although we shall not supply an exhaustive list of situations where a plaintiff would not be deemed officious, generally a plaintiff is not officious when he or she acts under a legal compulsion or duty, acts under a legally cognizable moral duty, acts to protect his or her own property interests, acts at the request of the defendant, or acts pursuant to a reasonable or justifiable mistake as to any of the aforementioned categories.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Applying the considered rules regarding volunteers to the present case, Hill would be allowed to defend on the ground that Cross Country was an officious payor, if Cross Country had no legal or moral obligation to pay Stewart or that any mistake by Cross Country regarding its legal obligations was unreasonable and unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Cross Country implied in the Circuit Court that its payment to Stewart was not voluntary by asserting baldly that the payment was required pursuant to an underwriting agreement between them.

Equitable estoppel, it seems, may be invoked as a defense to a foreclosure action, at least in concept. <em>See Schaller v. Castle Dev.

Stewart, viewing the facts on this record in a light most favorable to Hill, may have had a colorable equitable estoppel argument, which, if interposed and successful, might have precluded Provident from obtaining foreclosure relief. As noted above, however, payment, absent legal liability, does not necessarily make a payor officious. The payor, in order to be deemed a volunteer, must have been unreasonable in its mistake regarding the legal obligation to pay. Thus, Hill could emerge victorious from the suit against her by Cross Country if Cross Country was not liable to Stewart (either because Stewart was a volunteer or because the underwriting agreement did not require Cross Country\u2019s indemnification of Stewart) and Cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Country was unreasonably mistaken as to its legal liability to Stew art.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Hill contends that the proper remedy, if any, befitting Cross Country\u2019s claim is an action in subrogation or indemnification, not for unjust enrichment. Hill\u2019s argument has two implications: that Hill should be entitled to assert equitable estoppel as a defense against Cross Country; and Stewart, by not asserting equitable estoppel against Provident, was a mere volunteer when it paid Provident.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that Cross Country appears to have pleaded the elements required for a legal subrogation claim, albeit without mentioning subrogation by name. A plaintiff does not need to mention specifically subrogation in order to obtain relief under the doctrine. <em>See Bachmann v.

For example, in <em>Milholland v. Tiffany, </em>64 Md. 455, 2 A. 831 (1886), a husband with pre-existing debt purchased a piece of property financed by a purchase money mortgage. After the husband subsequently conveyed the parcel to his wife, he then convinced a friend to pay off the purchase money mortgage and accept a new mortgage in its place. The husband\u2019s creditors successfully petitioned the trial court to set aside the transfer of the property to the wife. This Court held, however, that the friend was entitled to be subrogated and hold the first mortgage position on the property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See also, e.g., Fin. Co. of Am. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>277 Md. 177, 353 A.2d 249 (1976). If the particular creditor enjoys preferred rights to that of a general unsecured creditor, subrogation becomes an attractive remedy to a plaintiff. In the present case, however, neither Provident nor Stewart has any special rights against Hill that are greater than those of an unsecured claimant. Cross Country is not seeking to obtain either Provident\u2019s or Stewart\u2019s security interest in the Property. <em>See </em>Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 162 cmt. g (1937) (\u201cWhere one person is entitled to be subrogated to the position of another, and the other had a claim which was not secured and not entitled to priority over the claims of other creditors, the person who is entitled to subrogation ordinarily derives no advantage from exercising his right to subrogation, since he thereby secures no advantage over other creditors, and his direct remedy against the obligor is just as good as his remedy by subroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tion.\u201d) Indeed, the only security interest figuring in this case was an interest in the Property that Hill no longer owned after the fateful closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Hill\u2019s argument implies that, if this case were to be decided under subrogation principles, she would be entitled to assert the defense of equitable estoppel against Cross Country. On this record, Hill is not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">As discussed above, equitable estoppel essentially consists of three elements: \u201cvoluntary conduct or representation, reliance, and detriment.\u201d <em>Mona Elec. Co. v. Shelton, </em>377 Md. 320, 334, 833 A.2d 527, 536 (2003) (citing <em>Creveling v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>376 Md. 72, 828 A.2d 229, 246 (2003)). Hill\u2019s claim of equitable estoppel, on this record, fails because she has suffered no detriment. As a result of Provident\u2019s errors in the main, Hill received $70,261.26 more at settlement than she otherwise would have received. While acknowledging she suffered no detriment, Hill, in the same breath, asserts that Cross Country or Stewart, had Provident brought an action against them, would have been at risk of suffering detriment and therefore could have asserted equitable estoppel as a defense. Hill implies that if Provident\u2019s theoretical claims were subrogated to Cross Country, then somehow the defense available to Cross Country would be available to her. Hill offers no support for this assertion. In fact, the Maryland cases relied on in her brief stand for quite the opposite conclusion. For example, to illustrate how equitable estoppel applies in real estate transactions, Hill quotes <em>Jurgensen v. New Phoenix Atl. Condo. Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 126, 843 A.2d 865, 876 (2004). The Court in <em>Jurgensen </em>noted \u201cthe party claiming to have been influenced by the conduct or declarations of another to <em>his injury </em>was himself ____\u2019\u2019(emphasis added). <em>Jurgensen </em>requires that the party asserting the defense of equitable estoppel actually suffer the injury. Hill, on this record, appears not to have suffered injury and thus could not assert that defense. Nowhere in Hill\u2019s brief could we find persuasive authority where a seller of real estate was allowed to assert equitable estoppel against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>mortgagee who gives an incorrect payoff amount. Nowhere in Hill\u2019s brief is there tendered legal support for the assertion that when an independent obligor-plaintiff pays a third-party creditor, a defendant is entitled to all defenses that the plaintiff had against the third-party creditor. In essence, Hill seeks to employ Cross Country\u2019s financial loss (an injury) as an equitable defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The second implication of Hill\u2019s argument that this case should have been brought in subrogation is that Stewart and Cross Country should be considered volunteers because they paid without asserting the defense of equitable estoppel. As discussed above, Hill may argue and attempt to prove on remand that Cross Country was a volunteer as to the unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BY THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">.

Where the lender described above forecloses against the property to collect the amount it claims to have erroneously left out of the payoff statements, and the buyer makes a claim against the title insurer, if the title insurer merely pays the lender instead of defending on the basis of estoppel, is the settlement company liable to indemnify the title insurer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">III. Where the settlement company described above merely reimburses the title insurer instead of defending on the basis that it did not commit any error in conducting the settlement, may the settlement company bring an unjust enrichment action against the seller of the house for reimbursement of the amount which the settlement company paid to the title insurer?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">. Because of chaotic and disjointed development in this area, the body of law of unjust enrichment, restitution, subrogation, and related causes and remedies is both voluminous and disorganized. <em>See </em>Daniel B.

The purpose behind this requirement is to prevent a true officious intermeddler from maintaining an action for unjust enrichment or quantum meruit when the intermeddler claims he should be compensated for services rendered or value provided to the defendant. Dobbs provides an apt example. While the homeowner is away, a house painter paints the entire house, without the owner's consent, thereby adding value to the homeowner\u2019s property. The added value of the home cannot be separated easily and returned to the house painter. Therefore, a court should not permit the house painter to recover. Dobbs notes that, although the homeowner is enriched, this result \"is preferable to payment of the intermeddler, who should not thus be encouraged to invade another\u2019s freedom of choice about his own affairs.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9. If, however, the benefit is something that can be easily returned, such as money or personal property, \"the fact that it is retained and used is a choice. When this choice is available, the choice principle is satisfied and restitution ... ought to be required.\u201d Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b335-11\">.

Palmer describes the two problems that arise when a plaintiff settles a claim brought by a third party where the defendant solely was liable for the claim. Palmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.2 The first question is whether the circumstances take the plaintiff out of the \"volunteer categoiy.\" Palmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.2. The second is whether the plaintiff may recover the entire amount that the plaintiff paid to settle the claim. Palmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.2. Because there is no dispute as to the amount of the underlying claim, we need not consider further the latter scenario.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\">. Public policy is best served by striving, where logical and fair to do so, to achieve consistency in the interpretation <em>and </em>application of the overlapping theories of subrogation and unjust enrichment. Consistent with that, we believe the definition of \u201cvolunteer\u201d must be identical, regardless of the case, in dealing with unjust enrichment or subrogation. It makes little sense to enable a plaintiff to choose between such closely related legal theories and obtain different results. <em>Beall v. Beall, </em>291 Md. 224, 234 n. 2, 434 A.2d 1015, 1021 n. 2 (1981) (interpreting the common law in such a way as to avoid \u201canomalous results\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Public policy also is best served by liberally permitting a plaintiff to be subrogated to the rights of a third-party creditor. In traditional insurance subrogation cases, a narrow definition of the volunteer rule serves to encourage insurers to defend their insured even where there is a dispute over liability or coverage, thus avoiding unnecessary delay in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>dle settlement of claims. \"[P]ayment is not voluntary if it is made with a reasonable or good faith belief in obligation or personal interest in making that payment.\u201d Couch on Insurance \u00a7 223:27 (3d ed.2005). \"If plaintiff pays defendant's debt under the mistaken apprehension that he was himself under a duty to do it ... there is less reason to treat him as being officious, and the courts will usually grant restitution.\u201d Wade, <em>supra, </em>at 1201.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">.

Maryland Rule 610 (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">. The Fourth Circuit recently summarized the difficulties facing a court in interpreting a contract in summary judgment analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">A court faces a conceptually difficult task in deciding whether to grant summary judgment on a matter of contract interpretation. Only an unambiguous writing justifies summary judgment without resort to extrinsic evidence, and no writing is unambiguous if susceptible to two reasonable interpretations. The first step for a court asked to grant summary judgment based on a contract\u2019s interpretation is, therefore, to determine whether, as a matter of law, the contract is ambiguous or unambiguous on its face. If a court properly determines that the contract is unambiguous on the dispositive issue, it may then properly interpret the contract as a matter of law and grant summary judgment because no interpretive facts are in genuine issue. Even where a court, however, determines as a matter of law that the contract is ambiguous, it may yet examine evidence extrinsic to the contract that is included in the summary judgment materials, and, if the evidence is, as a matter of law, dispositive of the interpretative issue, grant summary judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>that basis. If, however, resort to extrinsic evidence in the summary judgment materials leaves genuine issues of fact respecting the contract\u2019s proper interpretation, summary judgment must of course be refused and interpretation left to the trier of fact, (citations omitted). <em>Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Potomac Inv. Props., Inc., </em>476 F.3d 231, 235 (4th Cir.2007).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. Only legal subrogation could be relevant in the present case. Conventional subrogation arises by the operation of an agreement between the parties. Statutory subrogation, naturally, arises pursuant to a statute. <em>Fin. Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>277 Md. 177, 182, 353 A.2d 249, 252 (1976). In this case, only legal subrogation may apply because there is no relevant statute governing this situation or an agreement between Hill and Cross Country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. The overlap between the theories of unjust enrichment and legal subrogation are obvious when comparing the elements of each. The first element of unjust enrichment requires that the plaintiff convey a benefit to the defendant. By contrast, legal subrogation requires that the plaintiff pay an existing debt of the defendant. In that respect, legal subrogation is a more specific description for unjust enrichment generally where the value received by the plaintiff is that his obligation to a creditor has been discharged by a third party.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">Both legal theories prohibit a volunteer or officious payor from recovery. Both legal theories also conclude with a general \u201cbalancing of equities\u201d test. Both legal theories seek to obtain a fair, equitable result. In fact, the only significant difference between the two is the singular requirement in unjust enrichment that the defendant have some knowledge or appreciation of the benefit conveyed to her or him.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">. The nature of subrogation as a remedy may be illustrated best through the typical subrogation case. A homeowner enters into a contract with an insurer to insure the homeowner\u2019s property. A tortfeasor negligently or intentionally destroys the homeowner\u2019s property. The insurer compensates the homeowner for his loss and then is said to be subrogated (likely conventional subrogation by contract) to the homeowner's rights against the tortfeasor. The insurer could sue the tortfeasor under a theory of negligence or intentional torts, not under a theory of subrogation. There would be little confusion regarding the role of subrogation in this hypothetical.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">The situation becomes less clear, however, in a case such as the present one, where the underlying claim is framed as one of unjust enrichment, which shares overlapping principles with subrogation. Only adding to the confusion is the fact that restitutionary actions brought at common law in assumpsit also share many principles with an unjust enrichment actions. <em>See Ver Brycke v. Ver Brycke, </em>379 Md. 669, 698 n. 13, 843 A.2d 758, 775 n. 13 (2004) (\" \u2018[Sjome restitution claims were equitable. However, many were not. Many restitution claims were brought under the common law writ of assumpsit, using its common counts such as the count for money had and received.

If the friend in <em>Milholland </em>were not subrogated to hold the first mortgage on the property, the husband\u2019s creditors would have been unjustly enriched by permitting them to recover their pro rata share of both the unencumbered property and the disbursement of the loan as general unsecured creditors. In this respect, the remedy of subrogation prevented the unjust enrichment of the creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
