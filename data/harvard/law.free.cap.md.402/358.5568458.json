ELDRIDGE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AK7\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The Attorney Grievance Commission, by Bar Counsel, filed a petition for disciplinary action against the respondent, Thomas F. Kalil, on July 21, 2006. In the petition, the Attorney Grievance Commission alleged violations of Rules 3.3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 8.4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct. The matter was referred to Judge Durke G. Thompson of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a hearing and factual findings pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>752(a) and 16-757(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The facts, as found by Judge Thompson, are summarized as follows. On December 20,1983, Thomas Kalil was admitted to the Maryland Bar. He is not a member of the Bar of any other state or the District of Columbia. Kalil does not practice law and has never maintained an office for the practice of law. For the time period relevant to this matter, he worked for the United States Department of Agriculture as an Assistant to the Deputy Administrator of the Farm Loan Programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Department of Agriculture suspended Kalil for 14 days without pay, and Kalil believed that the suspension was retaliation for what he claimed was \u201cwhistleblowing.\u201d Kalil appealed his suspension to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(9). Administrative Judge Thomas P. Cook presided over a hearing on December 10, 2004, to determine whether the Department of Agriculture had, in fact, retaliated against Kalil in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act and whether the 14-day suspension was meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Judge Cook issued an Initial Decision finding partially in favor of Kalil and partially against him. The decision upheld Kalil\u2019s suspension and loss of pay. Kalil appealed the Initial Decision to the full Board, which affirmed Judge Cook\u2019s decision. Subsequently, Kalil filed an action for judicial re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>view in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which affirmed the MSPB decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Kalil believed that Judge Cook and some of the witnesses at his MSPB hearing committed acts that breached the applicable rules governing attorney conduct and that he had an ethical obligation to report such acts. While his judicial review action was pending, Kalil called the MSPB Washington Regional Office on at least three occasions. On June 21, 2005, a paralegal specialist for the office, Sheila Stanton, answered a call from a person who identified himself as \u201cJohn Ford\u201d and who asked to speak with \u201cTom Cook, an MSPB Judge.\u201d The caller, who was in fact Kalil, indicated that the phone call concerned a personal matter. Stanton put the call on hold and contacted Judge Cook who asked her to transfer the call to his voicemail, which she did. Judge Cook testified that he is reluctant to answer the phone because a large number of cases before him involve <em>pro se </em>litigants who seek to argue then-cases <em>ex parte. </em>In addition, Judge Cook does not speak to a litigant after his or her case has been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Soon after, Stanton answered another call, but the caller did not identify himself. Stanton, however, recognized the caller to be the same person who earlier had identified himself as \u201cJohn Ford.\u201d This time, the caller asked Stanton whether Judge Cook was a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia. Judge Cook is a member of the California Bar and is not admitted to the District of Columbia Bar. Stanton informed the caller that she was not sure and that he would have to ask Judge Cook. She then forwarded the call to Judge Cook\u2019s voicemail. The transcript of the voicemail reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cYes, Judge Cook, this is Thomas Cahill. If you could contact me at [telephone number] I would appreciate it. I have a technical question I have to obtain information from you. This is not related to the case, but I\u2019m calling on behalf of D.C. Bar Counsel. Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">When Judge Cook listened to his voicemail, he believed the voice to be that of Thomas Kalil and not a \u201cKayhill or Cahill.\u201d Judge Cook wrote a memorandum to memorialize the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Stanton answered a third call from Kalil who this time identified himself as \u201cThomas Cahill.\u201d \u201cThomas Cahill\u201d inquired whether P.J. Winzer, who is the Regional Director of the Washington Regional Offices and who also serves as the Chief Administrative Judge of the MSPB, was a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia. Placing the call on hold, Stanton contacted Judge Winzer, informed her about the inquiry, and also related that the same person had called earlier asking similar questions about Judge Cook. Judge Winzer accepted the call and informed the caller that she did so because of the nature of the bar status inquiry. When the caller stated that he was sure Judge Winzer was a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia, Judge Winzer answered that she was not. After further questioning, Judge Winzer stated that she was a member of the California Bar. After some casual conversation, the caller indicated that he wanted information in relation to an ongoing investigation. Judge Winzer did not recognize the caller, Kalil, as a litigant before the MSPB. Once she learned the identity of the caller, she prepared a memorandum about the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Soon after the third telephone call, Judge Cook asked Stanton to call the number left on his voicemail. Judge Cook informed Stanton that he believed the caller was one of the former litigants who appeared before him, named Thomas Kalil. When Stanton called the number, the person answering the call identified himself as \u201cMr. Kalil\u201d and indicated that she had reached either the \u201cFarm Bureau\u201d or \u201cFarm Programs.\u201d Again, Kalil inquired of Stanton whether Judge Cook was a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia, and Stanton responded that she could not reveal that type of information. Kalil told Stanton that he was gathering information for a response to the D.C. Bar about violations of ethics, and, if Judge Cook did not return his call, he would consider it a refusal to respond. Stanton recognized Kalil as the same person who called three times previously and prepared a memorandum to memorialize the four conversations with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The memoranda of the phone calls from and conversations with Kalil were sent to the MSPB general counsel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>incident was subsequently reported to the District of Columbia Bar Counsel and, because Kalil is not a member of the District of Columbia Bar, it was forwarded to the offices of the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission in July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The Office of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel never employed Kalil and never authorized him to act for the Office in any capacity. Kalil had previously filed two or three complaints with the Office of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel, and it is the practice of the Office to ask complainants to provide further information. The Office does not, however, authorize or permit others to investigate complaints. The records of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel\u2019s Office do contain two letters, dated August 25, 2005, and October 4, 2005, to Kalil concerning complaints which he had previously filed. These letters asked Kalil to provide information, but they did not authorize him to act for the Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The records of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel\u2019s Office also contained a memorandum written on September 29, 2005, by Joe Perry, a law clerk for the Office. The memorandum concerned a conversation with Kalil in which Kalil asked Perry to speculate about the meaning of the phrase \u201con behalf of.\u201d The memorandum also noted that Kalil complained about Bar Counsel\u2019s referral of the MSPB complaint to the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission. Kalil told Perry that he wanted the District of Columbia Bar Counsel to write a retraction or acknowledge that the referral was a mistake. Kalil also stated that he would sue the Office if the referral was not retracted. Kalil previously had made a similar attempt to have the MSPB complaint withdrawn. On August 10, 2005, a staff attorney memorandum stated that Kalil had demanded that someone order Wallace E. Shipp (District of Columbia Bar Counsel) to withdraw the referral of the complaint or to have Mr. Shipp disciplined for the referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Approximately three months after the calls to Judges Cook and Winzer, on October 14, 2005, Kalil delivered to the Office of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel the transcript of the hearing of his case before the MSPB. He included with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>transcript a document entitled \u201cConfirmation of Delivery and Receipt.\u201d Ms. Mayfield, the office receptionist, signed and date stamped the receipt. At some point, Kalil wrote on the receipt: \u201cAs part of Dr. Thomas F. Kalil, Esq.\u2019s continuing efforts on behalf of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation regarding disciplinary action in\u201d three docketed complaints that he filed with Bar Counsel. Neither Judge Winzer nor Judge Cook was the subject of those complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Judge Thompson found that Kalil\u2019s testimony on the nature and content of the receipt contradicted his testimony in his pretrial deposition. Testifying at his disciplinary hearing, Kalil claimed that he cleared the language on the receipt with \u201csomeone\u201d at the District of Columbia Bar Counsel\u2019s Office. During his deposition, Kalil stated that he had read the receipt to Judith Hetherton (Senior Assistant Bar Counsel) and drafted the document with the specific concurrence of Hetherton. He later recanted that testimony and said that he did not know to whom he spoke and read the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Judge Thompson found that Kalil did not violate Rule 3.3 but did violate Rule 8.4. Judge Thompson stated as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Court\u2019s belief that this personality trait is what led to Respondent\u2019s troubles with his employer, the MSPB, and the Office of Bar Counsel for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201cThe actions of the Respondent in this matter are largely undisputed. To understand exactly what happened and why it occurred requires some insight into the character and personality of the Respondent. During the hearing on this matter, with the Court\u2019s ability to observe the Respondent testify, it became clear that the Respondent is an intelligent career civil servant who has an inflated view of his role at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and his public responsibilities. He is also hampered by his selective interpretations of facts and their application to his situation together with an inability, on occasion, to acknowledge that he is wrong about matters with which he is dealing. An apt description of the Respondent is as an unappreciated gad fly. At times during his testimony, Respondent was argumentative or non-responsive to the questions asked, not because he was evasive, but because he elected to split hairs during his answer or to try to restate the question to fit what Respondent believed was appropriate. It is the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201cThe information sought by the Respondent when he made his calls to the MSPB Regional Office was a matter of public record. Apparently, Respondent was aware that his \u2018plan\u2019 to complain to bar authorities about the administrative law judge in his case was a risky professional undertaking. Thus, the Respondent sought to conceal his identity when making his telephone query. Perplexing is his effort to engage Chief Administrative Judge Winzer in conversation but it is apparently consistent with his belief that his multiple calls were not appreciated. However, there is little question that Respondent was not forthright with his representations to the receptionist.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe real issue is whether Respondent\u2019s misrepresentations by phone were material, as they must have been in order to constitute a violation of MRPC 3.3, which requires a \u2018false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.\u2019 It is the belief of the Court that they were not. Bar membership is a matter within the public domain and [is] publicly accountable in a regulated profession. The use of pseudonyms by the Respondent did nothing to mislead the call recipients to their detriment. Nor did the calls themselves involve anything that was before the MSPB forum. Instead the calls were an apparent prelude to the efforts by the Respondent to manipulate the grievance process in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201cThe actions of the Respondent do not seem to fit as a violation of MRPC 3.3. The actions of the Respondent involved a judicial forum or tribunal, but his telephone calls were not the part of any proceeding before the tribunal. The use of pseudonyms during his phone calls does not violate the rule. Far more troubling is the apparent attempt to invoke the authority of the Office of Bar Counsel while dealing with various persons at the MSPB. In these acts, it does appear that Respondent is in violation of MRPC 8.4, which prohibits a lawyer from \u2018engaging] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u2019 The Respondent represented to others that he was an agent of D.C. Bar Counsel when he made his telephone calls. The Respondent\u2019s position on these representations is, at best, inconsistent. The testimony of Respondent was that he volunteered to Bar Counsel\u2019s Office to find out about Judge Cook\u2019s Bar membership. Earlier, in his deposition, Respondent did not have any recollection of such a conversation. It was during the receipt of testimony on this point that Respondent\u2019s personality became apparent. He stresses that he was acting only for the \u2018benefit\u2019 of Bar Counsel, and not on behalf of Bar Counsel. Regardless of Respondent\u2019s intentions, his actions of representing that he was calling on behalf of Bar Counsel were deceitful and untrue. Thus, MRPC 8.4 has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u201cPetitioner asserts that the telephone calls were also a violation of Rule 8.4(d) because they were prejudicial to the administration of justice by disrupting the ordinary flow of work at the MSPB. Petitioner\u2019s view of the facts and interpretation of the rule are erroneous. Factually, the calls were minimally intrusive and there was no evidence that disruption of the MSPB or its work occurred. Further, something more than the three telephone calls, two of which were very brief, would be needed to constitute a rule violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The petitioner Attorney Grievance Commission filed two exceptions to Judge Thompson\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. First, the Commission excepts to Judge Thompson\u2019s conclusion that Kalil\u2019s use of pseudonyms did not violate Rule 8.4(c). According to the petitioner, \u201cin addition to representing that he was calling on behalf of Bar Counsel, respondent also falsely represented that his name was John Ford and Thomas Cahill/Kayhill during his calls to the MSPB.\u201d Petitioner asserts that this conduct involved \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d and therefore violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In addition, the Commission excepts to Judge Thompson\u2019s findings and conclusion that Kalil did not violate Rule 8.4(d) and argues that Kalil\u2019s representation, that he was acting on behalf of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel, is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. This conduct, according to the petitioner, \u201ccould negatively impact on the image- or perception of the legal profession and engender disrespect for the legal profession\u201d and therefore violates Rule 8.4(d). In support of its argument, the petitioner relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Painter, </em>356 Md. 293, 306-07, 739 A.2d 24, 31 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We overrule the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s exceptions. With respect to Rule 8.4(c), Judge Thompson found that Kalil\u2019s use of pseudonyms in his conversations with Stanton and Judge Winzer were not material and \u201cdid nothing to mislead the call recipients to their detriment.\u201d The record does not show that Judge Thompson\u2019s findings of fact pertaining to the use of pseudonyms were clearly erroneous, and these facts supported the conclusion that Kalil\u2019s use of alternate names did not rise to the level necessary for a violation of Rule 8.4(c). <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, </em>400 Md. 618, 629, 929 A.2d 576, 583 (2007) (\u201cWhen the factual findings are not clearly erroneous and the conclusions drawn from them are supported by the facts found, exceptions to conclusions of law will be overruled\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 700, 919 A.2d 669, 675 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006). We also note that Judge Thompson did conclude that Kalil\u2019s representation that he was working \u201con behalf of\u2019 Bar Counsel violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Likewise, Judge Thompson\u2019s findings that Kalil\u2019s telephone calls \u201cwere minimally intrusive\u201d and that they did not disrupt the work of the MSPB were not clearly erroneous. These findings supported the conclusion that the calls did not result in \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d as is required for a violation of Rule 8.4(d). Furthermore, the conduct at issue here is strikingly different from the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Painter, supra, </em>relied on by Bar Counsel. In Painter, the Court held that the subject attorney\u2019s conduct, which \u201cconsisted of abusing, physically, verbally, and psychologically, his wife and his children\u201d for a period of sixteen years violated Rule 8.4(d). <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Painter, supra, </em>356 Md. at 300, 302, 739 A.2d at 28, 29. Kalil\u2019s conduct certainly does not compare to that in <em>Painter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Kalil also filed exceptions to Judge Thompson\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. First, Kalil excepts to Judge Thompson\u2019s finding that some of Kalil\u2019s testimony at his hearing contradicted statements in his deposition. Specifically, Kalil points to Judge Thompson\u2019s finding that the \u201ctestimony of Respondent was that he volunteered to Bar Counsel\u2019s Office to find out about Judge Cook\u2019s Bar membership. Earlier, in his deposition, Respondent did not have any recollection of such a conversation.\u201d Kalil asserts that the hearing transcript is not inconsistent with his earlier deposition testimony that he could not recall the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Next, Kalil excepts to the factual finding that he \u201crepresented to others that he was an agent of D.C. Bar Counsel when he made his telephone calls.\u201d According to Kalil, the transcript contains no instance where a witness claimed that Kalil used the word \u201cagent.\u201d Rather, Kalil points to the evidence showing that he used the words \u201con behalf of Bar Counsel\u201d when making the telephone calls, and Kalil asserts that the phrase \u201con behalf of\u2019 is appropriate \u201cwhen a person provides assistance to another.\u201d Because his testimony did not contradict statements in his deposition, and because he never claimed to be an \u201cagent\u201d of the District of Columbia Bar Counsel, Kalil asserts that Judge Thompson erred in concluding that he violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Finally, Kalil excepts to Judge Thompson\u2019s failure to make any findings \u201cregarding the presence or lack of mitigation.\u201d In this regard, Kalil chiefly points to evidence at his disciplinary hearing concerning the aid he provided to Mohammed A1 Rehaief. Mr. A1 Rehaief was an attorney and citizen of Iraq <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>who provided information contributing to the recovery of a United States Army soldier, Jessica Lynch. Kalil helped to bring Mr. A1 Rehaief to the United States and spent approximately $30,000 to construct an apartment in his basement as a home for the A1 Rehaief family. Mr. A1 Rehaief testified for Kalil at his disciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Kalil also emphasizes that he has no disciplinary history and \u201cat all times relevant hereto, was motivated by an intent to report perceived disciplinary violations by other attorneys.\u201d Furthermore, he asserts that he \u201ccooperated throughout the disciplinary process and disclosed all information requested by the appropriate disciplinary authorities as demonstrated by the massive amounts of material he submitted to Bar Counsel in both Maryland and the District of Columbia.\u201d In addition, Kalil states that the record reflects that he has expressed regret for the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We also overrule Kalil\u2019s exceptions. Regarding his first exception, we determine that Judge Thompson accurately described Kalil\u2019s testimony at his hearing. The hearing transcript reveals that Kalil testified that he did in fact volunteer to District of Columbia Bar Counsel that he would investigate Judge Cook\u2019s bar membership. Specifically, the transcript contains the following exchange during Kalil\u2019s direct examination (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cA. And the Office of Bar Counsel asked me whether I had the intent of reporting Judge Cook, as well? And I said I didn\u2019t. It was my understanding that you cannot report a judge to Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201cQ. Okay, and what was the response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u201cA. I was told that ... because he\u2019s an administrative judge, that you can, and I was, as I recall, I was asked what bar he was with? I said, I don\u2019t know but <em>I\u2019ll be glad to find out.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The above-quoted testimony is inconsistent with his deposition testimony that he had no recollection of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Furthermore, Kalil\u2019s exception regarding his representation that he was calling \u201con behalf of Bar Counsel\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>without merit. Whether Kalil intended to deceive the recipients of his calls or misrepresent himself does not alter Judge Thompson\u2019s finding and conclusion that, \u201c[rjegardless of Respondent\u2019s intentions, his actions of representing that he was calling on behalf of Bar Counsel were deceitful and untrue.\u201d Judge Thompson\u2019s factual finding regarding the manner in which Kalil represented himself to the MSPB is not clearly erroneous, and the conclusion of law that Kalil violated Rule 8.4(c) is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Finally, we overrule Kalil\u2019s exception to Judge Thompson\u2019s lack of mitigation findings. Kalil has not demonstrated that Judge Thompson committed clear error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The petitioner asserts that the appropriate sanction to impose, in light of Kalil\u2019s dishonest conduct, is disbarment. Kalil argues that no sanction is appropriate because he lacked an intent to deceive and \u201chas demonstrated a lifetime of public service.\u201d In considering a sanction, it is appropriate to weigh the nature and gravity of the violations as well as the intent with which they were committed. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, supra, </em>400 Md. at 642, 929 A.2d at 590; <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Here we note that the gravity of Kalil\u2019s violations is minimal and that his intention, although misguided, was not to deceive. The proper sanction, therefore, is a reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST THOMAS FORD KALIL</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">.
