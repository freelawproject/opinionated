Mayor and City Council of Rockville. </em>The issues presented are fourfold. As a preliminary matter, we consider whether the Circuit Court was vested with jurisdiction to determine the validity of City Ordinances 7-03, creating by zoning ordinance text amendment the Commercial Transition zone (hereinafter the \u201cC-T\u201d zone), and 21-05, zoning the Anderson House property C-T in the course of a comprehensive zoning map amendment. Because we shall find that jurisdiction existed, we proceed to the question of whether the development standards of the C-T zone created in 2003, into which the City placed Anderson House\u2019s property in 2005, conforms to the principle of zoning uniformity under Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02, and the \u201cidentically requirement\u201d contained in Rockville City Code, \u00a7 25-1. Finally, we must decide whether Anderson House met the heavy burden of showing that the C-T rezoning of its property, accomplished as part of a comprehensive zoning, exceeded Rockville\u2019s power to zone in the public interest according to Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The structure on Anderson House\u2019s property, located at 39 West Montgomery Avenue in the Town Center area of the City of Rockville, began its existence as a private residence. Ultimately it was converted to a private office building, retaining its general appearance as a residence. The land area of the Anderson House property is 32,670 square feet, which makes it the largest tract zoned C-T in the City. The two-story structure improving the lot contains 3,600 square feet of floor area, with a \u201cfootprint\u201d of approximately 1,800 square feet on the parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Prior to the enactment of Ordinance 21-05, the Anderson House property was zoned \u201c0-2,\u201d or \u201cTransitional Office,\u201d a zone intended to provide a buffer between residential and commercial uses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After revision of the text of Rockville\u2019s zoning ordinance by Ordinance 7-03 to create the C-T zone, enacted on 28 April 2003, the Anderson House property was rezoned C-T by Ordinance 21-05, enacted 17 October 2005. The C-T zone requires that structures retain a residential character in order to transition between commercial uses and residential uses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The creation of the C-T zone and the placement of Anderson House\u2019s Property in it purported to carry out the recommendations of the City\u2019s 2001 \u201cTown Center Master <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Plan\u201d and the 2004 \u201cCity-wide Comprehensive Master Plan,\u201d respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each plan contained recommendations for changes to the zoning text and map for the orderly development of the City. To accomplish the legal mechanisms to make the recommended changes, the Mayor and Council declared initially a seven-month moratorium on development in non-residential zones adjoining residential zones in the City. As its initial implementation response, the Mayor and City Council of Rockville adopted the Commercial Compatibility Text Amendment through Ordinance 7-03.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As previously mentioned, among other things, Ordinance 7-03 created the C-T zone for potential application to properties containing dwellings converted to office use.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Specific provisions of the C-T zone address side and rear setback requirements, lot width requirements, minimum lot size, floor area, and building height, but in arguably nontraditional ways to some extent. Properties placed in the C-T zone already containing dwellings converted for office use must have side and rear yard setbacks and lot width restrictions comparable to a similarly sized lot for a dwelling zoned residential.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The minimum lot size for an office structure in the C-T zone is 5,000 square feet or the size of an existing lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>if greater than 5,000 square feet.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The height of an existing structure was to be the maximum height limit. Finally, the total floor area of a structure cannot exceed more than 50 percent of the building\u2019s existing condition as of 1 January 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The Mayor and Council soon put the new C-T zone to use. Comprehensive Map Amendment Application MAP200300087, tiled on 9 May 2003 by the City, proposed rezoning 21 properties throughout the City, including the Anderson House\u2019s property, to the new C-T zone. Upon notice that the City proposed to rezone its property from 0-2 to C-T, Anderson House perfervidly protested, concerned that the new zone would operate to deny resubdivision of its property and thus preclude additional development on the lot. The City acquiesced to a deferral of action concerning the Anderson House property, pending its consideration of the more localized Town Center Sectional Map Amendment (also a comprehensive zoning initiative), to be processed the following Fall. Thus, when the City adopted Ordinance 23-03 on 4 August 2003 approving the 2003 comprehensive map amendment, 20 properties were rezoned to C-T, but the Anderson House property was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On 7 October 2004, the Town Center Sectional Map Amendment was filed by the City, proposing anew that the Anderson House property be reclassified C-T, together with rezonings of many other properties. Anderson House countered that its property should be split-zoned so that the western portion of the property, which contained the existing house/office building be rezoned C-T, while the eastern portion remain zoned 0-2.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At a 10 January 2005 hearing before the Mayor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Council, the City\u2019s Chief of Long Range Planning testified that the Anderson House property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXR\">is somewhat of an anomaly in that it\u2019s very large compared to other properties in the CT zone and probably does allow for some additional development on the site----We have been discussing a potential split zoning to allow for redevelopment on the undeveloped portion of the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">And by \u201csplit zoning,\u201d I mean a portion that would remain in the 0-2, and the property that contains the Anderson House would be rezoned to the CT zone. So the practical effect would be that still the scale of development on the property would be in keeping with residential neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Additionally, the Rockville Planning Commission unanimously recommended that the property be split-zoned as requested by Anderson House. The Mayor and Council, however, rejected split-zoning. When adopted on 17 October 2005, the Town Center Sectional Map Amendment, embodied in Ordinance 21-05, rezoned the Anderson House property C-T in its entirety, while also rezoning approximately one hundred other properties in the Town Center area of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Anderson House promptly filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a petition for judicial review of the final action of an administrative agency (frequently mistakenly referred to as an administrative appeal) on 8 November 2005, pursuant to Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08(f),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Rock-ville City Code \u00a7 25-100.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The action, Case No. 266338-V, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>entitled <em>Petition of Anderson House LLC for Judicial Review of the Decision of the Mayor and Re: Ordinance No. 21-05 in the Case of Zoning Map Amendment 2005-00091, </em>challenged the rezoning of the Anderson House property to the C-T zone and attacked the underlying development standards created for the C-T zone by Ordinance 7-03. The City responded by contesting Anderson House\u2019s right to challenge the zoning ordinance text amendment through the modality of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Out of an abundance of caution, in light of the City\u2019s jurisdictional challenge to the text amendment aspect of the judicial review action, Anderson House filed, on 29 March 2006 in the Circuit Court, a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Procedure Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-403,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 3-406,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 3-409.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Anderson House claimed that the C-T zone regulations violated the uniformity requirement in Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This complaint was docketed as Case No. 270350-V, and captioned <em>Anderson House, LLC v. Mayor and Council </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>of Rockville. </em>The Circuit Court, at the request of Anderson House and with the consent of the City, consolidated the two proceedings under Case No. 266338-V on 30 March 2006. The records of the two cases were cross-adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On 31 March 2006, Anderson House amended its Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive relief. The Amended Complaint added an allegation that the minimum lot area, maximum building height, and floor area restrictions for the C-T zone violated an \u201cidenticality requirement,\u201d found in the generic definition of the word \u201czone\u201d in Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-1, that all requirements for each property within a zone be identical for the zone in which they apply.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Amended Complaint also contended that provisions of Ordinances 7-03, creating the C-T zone, and 21-05, rezoning the Anderson House property C-T, violated a requirement contained in Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, the pleading alleged that the Ordinances were arbitrary, capricious, and an invalid exercise of zoning authority and, thus, not rationally related to the general public interest. Anderson House sought an injunction permanently restraining and enjoining the enforcement, operation, and effect of the Ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The Circuit Court ruled on the consolidated cases on 29 December 2006 by Memorandum Opinion and Order, giving judgment for the City of Rockville. In its memorandum, the Circuit Court reviewed first whether it had jurisdiction to hear the cases. It held that it lacked jurisdiction to determine Anderson House\u2019s judicial review action concerning Ordinance 7-03, creating the C-T zone through text amendment. The court concluded, however, that it had jurisdiction in that action to consider Ordinance 21-05, which placed the Anderson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>House property into the C-T zone. The court rejected all of Anderson House\u2019s challenges to Ordinance 21-05. Without further comment as to jurisdiction, it also rejected Anderson House\u2019s challenges to the various development regulations of the C-T zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Anderson House filed a timely Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on 8 January 2007. Before that court could decide the appeal, this Court exercised its discretion to issue a writ of certiorari to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Jurisdiction existed for the Circuit Court to hear and decide the issues raised in the consolidated cases. Although the Circuit Court had some reservations as to how it should view or parse jurisdiction, we note that Anderson House assuredly properly invoked it by filing the two actions that were consolidated. <em>See Armstrong v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>169 Md.App. 655, 678, 906 A.2d 415, 428 (2006) (\u201cWhen uncertain, practitioners sometimes file two actions, one seeking statutory review and the other seeking non-statutory review, because if they file one action and are wrong, a court may not treat the action as if it had asserted the proper basis for review.\u201d). The Circuit Court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Anderson House\u2019s contentions as to Ordinance 7-03 in the judicial review action, but that it possessed jurisdiction to review Ordinance 21-05 in that case. The court, however, failed to articulate explicitly its views as to its jurisdictional basis to review the challenges to Ordinance 7-03, pursuant to Anderson House\u2019s Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, but decided those issues nonetheless in disposing of the consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, found in Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-403, 3-406, and 3-409, provides jurisdiction for a Circuit Court to \u201cdeclare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 3-403. Section 3-406 provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the Circuit Court with jurisdiction to determine the validity of municipal ordinances for persons whose legal relations are affected thereby and to provide such persons with a \u201cdeclaration of rights, status, or other legal relations under it.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 3-409 provides the court with the power to grant a declaratory judgment. This power is constrained, however, by \u00a7 3-409(b), which cautions that \u201c[i]f a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Regarding \u201cGeneral Land Use Regulations and Zoning,\u201d a special form of remedy in some cases is provided by Maryland. Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08, \u201cAppeals to Courts.\u201d Section 4.08(a) provides for judicial review of a \u201czoning action\u201d by a circuit court of the county. Additionally, \u00a7 4.08(f) provides that \u201c[i]n addition to the appeal provided in this section, a local legislative body may allow an appeal to the circuit court of any matter arising under the planning and zoning laws of the local jurisdiction.\u201d We held in <em>Josephson v. City of Annapolis, </em>353 Md. 667, 728 A.2d 690 (1998), that \u00a7 4.08(a) provides a special administrative remedy in accordance with Title 7, Chapter 200 the Maryland Rules. Thus, the general rule is that if review is available under the special statutory remedy of \u00a7 4.08(a), no declaratory judgment action is available. <em>Josephson, </em>353 Md. at 681, 728 A.2d at 696 (\u201c[T]he general rule, which applies in this case, remains that when administrative remedies exist in zoning cases, they must be exhausted before other actions, including requests for declaratory judgments, mandamus and injunctive relief, may be brought.\u201d); <em>see also Prince George\u2019s County v. Ray\u2019s Used Cars, </em>398 Md. 632, 922 A.2d 495 (2007) (finding that administrative remedies must be exhausted even where the constitutional issue exception is invoked if the administrative agency could provide relief on nonconstitutional grounds). Although we have not discussed this jurisdictional issue in the context of \u00a7 4.08(f), the same logic applies. \u201c[Wjhere a statute provides a specific form of remedy in a specific case then this remedy must be followed.\u201d <em>Gingell v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>249 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Md. 374, 377, 239 A.2d 903, 905 (1968). Thus, if a local jurisdiction invokes the power bestowed upon it by \u00a7 4.08(f) to recognize an action for judicial review beyond that embraced within \u00a7 4.08(a), such an action would be pre-eminent to any remedy a plaintiff might seek under the Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Ordinance 7-03, creating the C-T zone, was a zoning ordinance text amendment. As stated earlier, the universe of possible jurisdictional predicates argued for the Circuit Court to consider Anderson House\u2019s challenges were Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08(a) or (f) or the Declaratory Judgment Act. With regard to \u00a7 4.08(a), we held in <em>Md. Overpak Corp. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>395 Md. 16, 32, 909 A.2d 235, 244 (2006) that \u201can act constituting a \u2018zoning action\u2019 for those jurisdictions governed by Article 66B is subject to judicial review\u201d under that Section. Our analysis made explicit, however, that \u201camendments to the text of zoning regulations, comprehensive zonings, and other acts that are legislative in nature do not qualify for judicial review\u201d as a \u201czoning action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 909 A.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">With regard to \u00a7 4.08(f), whereby the Legislature granted local legislative bodies the power to allow an \u201cappeal\u201d \u201cof any matter arising under the planning and zoning laws of the local jurisdiction,\u201d the City of Rockville did not employ this power to grant to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County jurisdiction to review legal challenges to the adoption of text amendments via judicial review actions. In Article III, Amendments, of Chapter 25, Zoning and Planning, of the Rockville City Code, the City set out its regulations concerning map amendments and text amendments and also \u00a7 25-100, concerning \u201cappeals.\u201d Section 25-100 provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the Council on any application for an amendment to the zoning map or by any decision by the Council adopting or amending the Plan may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court for the County in accordance with the Maryland Rules.... \u201d Both Anderson House and the City agree that this Section of the Rockville City Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>does not provide a litigant with a right to seek judicial review of an action adopting a zoning ordinance text amendment. Thus, no \u201cspecial form of remedy\u201d for judicial review of Ordinance 7-03 exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Anderson House\u2019s claims regarding Ordinance 7-03 satisfy the requirements of the Declaratory Judgment Act. Anderson House alleges that the City overstepped the powers conferred upon it by failing, in its enactment of the C-T zone, to conform to the uniformity requirement found in Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b)(2). Whether that allegation has merit, as a matter of law, Anderson House is entitled to have the Circuit Court consider its claims as to Ordinance 7-03 because the CT zone created by that legislation was applied to the Anderson House property through Ordinance 21-05. Thus, its rights were affected and the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to review the challenge to its enactment. <em>See Heery Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>384 Md. 129, 149-50, 862 A.2d 976, 988 (2004) (citing <em>Perdue Farms, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>108 F.3d 519, 521 (4th Cir.1997)) (finding a court \u201chas jurisdiction to review decisions ... where the agency exceeds its delegated powers or ignores a statutory mandate, and the absence of judicial review would sacrifice or obliterate a right created by the legislature\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>269 Md. 202, 209-10, 306 A.2d 223, 227-28 (1973) (finding a declaratory judgment action was the proper vehicle to determine whether the County Charter exceeded the power granted under the Maryland Code and that a declaration would terminate any uncertainty caused by \u201cassertion of the Council\u2019s rights or privileges\u201d); <em>see also Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 536, 814 A.2d at 481 (referring to the uniformity requirement found in Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b)(2) and noting that there must be uniformity within each zone throughout the district as a safeguard of the right to fair and equal treatment of landowners by the local zoning authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We now turn to the Circuit Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the challenges to Ordinance 25-01, which rezoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Anderson House property from 0-2 to C-T through a comprehensive zoning map amendment. With respect to \u00a7 4.08(a), <em>Maryland Overpak </em>teaches that jurisdiction is not proper under that Section because comprehensive zonings do not qualify as \u201czoning actions\u201d for purposes of obtaining judicial review. 895 Md. at 50, 909 A.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">With respect to \u00a7 4.08(f), the answer to the jurisdictional question, were there a need to confront and decide it here, is a bit more problematic. Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-100, purports to authorize an \u201cappeal\u201d to the Circuit Court by a person \u201caggrieved by a decision of the Council on any application for an amendment to the zoning map.\u201d The Circuit Court in the present case made clear, in dicta, however, that it had reservations concerning the applicability of this ordinance section, as well it should.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The Circuit Court was concerned with the proper interpretation of \u00a7 25-100 because the City Code refers, in a footnote, to Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08 as the source of the City\u2019s right to authorize an \u201cappeal\u201d of its decisions to the Circuit Court. Specifically, the Circuit Court was concerned that in reading the City Code <em>in pari materia </em>with Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08, City Code \u00a7 25-100 could not authorize an \u201cappeal\u201d of a comprehensive rezoning action, one generally regarded as a purely legislative act, rather than one partaking of a quasi-judicial process. The court reasoned that because the City Code refers to \u00a7 4.08 it must be read in light of the Maryland Code. The court further reasoned that Rockville City Code, \u00a7 25-100, should be interpreted identically to Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08 because of their similar language and purpose. Therefore, the court concluded, the Rockville City Code was limited to authorizing Circuit Court review of piecemeal zoning actions, but barred from allowing review of comprehensive zoning actions through the same modality.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The court may not have reached the correct jurisdictional conclusion under the prevailing regulatory scheme in Rock-ville. While the Circuit Court focused on \u00a7 4.08(a)(1) in its analysis, it seemingly overlooked \u00a7 4.08(f), which states, <em>\u201c[ijn addition </em>to the appeal provided in [\u00a7 4.08(a)(1)], a local legislative body may allow an appeal to the circuit court of <em>any matter </em>arising under the planning and zoning laws of the local jurisdiction.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The genesis of the State enabling legislation, Chapter 267 of the Laws of Maryland of 1975, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Planning and Zoning\u2014Appeals,\u201d normally is the starting point for any analysis of this question. That Act was implemented</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">[f]or the purpose of clarifying the right of appeal of decisions of the Circuit Court or the Baltimore City Court in Zoning cases [and] to provide that counties, municipalities and the City of Baltimore may provide for an appeal to the Circuit Court or the Baltimore City Court of any matter arising under the planning and zoning laws of a county, municipality, or the City of Baltimore with certain limitations and that the decision of the Circuit Court or Baltimore City Court may be appealed to the Court of Special Appeals ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Chapter 267 of the Acts of 1975,1357-58</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">To do so, the Act made several changes. First, the Act repealed and reenacted \u00a7 4.08(a), \u201cclarifying\u201d the language therein by replacing the term \u201creclassification\u201d with \u201czoning action.\u201d The Act companionably changed the language of Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a), pertaining to \u201cappeals\u201d from \u201czoning actions\u201d made by local legislative bodies in Baltimore City. Additionally, the Act created \u00a7 4.08(f), which provides that in addition to the \u201cappeal\u201d provided in \u00a7 4.08(a) a local legislative body may provide for an \u201cappeal\u201d of any matter arising under the planning and zoning laws of the County or municipal corporation. Pertinent to our discussion, provisions identical to \u00a7 4.08(f) were added at Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 2.09(f), governing zoning in Baltimore City, and Maryland Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(X), regarding zoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>chartered counties in Maryland. In its 1975 Report to the General Assembly on Proposed Bills, the Legislative Council of Maryland discussed the purpose of the proposed Act, stating in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">[t]he proposed legislation clarifies the right of appeal, <em>and enables </em>local jurisdictions to provide for <em>other </em>appeals for noncharter counties, municipalities and the City of Baltimore by amending the appropriate provisions of Article 66B. The proposed legislation also empowers charter counties to provide for appeals in planning and zoning matters by amending Article 25A, Section 5(X)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Legislative Council of Maryland, Report to the General Assembly of 1975, Proposed Bills 194 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Our jurisprudence on the issue, though limited, demonstrates that \u00a7 4.08(f) is not necessarily constrained by our definition of the term \u201czoning action\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4.08(a). In <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 408 A.2d 1017 (1979), our review of the term \u201czoning action\u201d in \u00a7 4.08(a) and its twin, \u00a7 2.09(a), caused us to examine the legislative history set out above. In so doing, we noted that the history distinguishes the addition of \u00a7 4.08(f) from the change in language that replaced \u201creclassification\u201d with \u201czoning action\u201d in \u00a7 4.08(a). <em>Stephans, </em>286 Md. at 392-96, 408 A.2d at 1021-23. We said there that the term \u201czoning action\u201d does not embrace comprehensive zoning or rezoning. <em>Stephans, </em>286 Md. at 397, 408 A.2d at 1023. We did not find, however, any limitation on the kinds of \u201cappeals\u201d in addition to those authorized by \u00a7 4.08(a) that a local jurisdiction might choose to authorize under the authority granted by \u00a7 4.08(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">In <em>Hope v. Baltimore County, </em>288 Md. 656, 421 A.2d 576 (1980), in interpreting \u00a7 4.08(f)\u2019s twin statute for charter counties appearing at Maryland Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(X), we noted that the Section provides for the right of \u201cappeal\u201d to a circuit court of <em>any </em>matter arising under a chartered county\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>planning and zoning laws.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Further, in <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 693 A.2d 757 (1997), we briefly discussed in dicta alternative pathways by which an \u201cappeal\u201d may be maintained. <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 501 n. 16, 693 A.2d at 768 n. 16. There we noted the limitation that \u00a7 4.08(a) may not be used to \u201cappeal\u201d a comprehensive rezoning, but we said that \u201c[e]ven if an appeal ... was not authorized by \u00a7 4.08(a) ..., it may have been authorized by \u00a7 4.08(f)\u201d if the local jurisdiction provided for the \u201cappeal.\u201d <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 501 n. 16, 693 A.2d at 768 n. 16. Finally, in <em>Maryland Overpak, </em>we indicated that the delegation under \u00a7 4.08(f) is not constrained by our most recent interpretation of the term \u201czoning action\u201d when we addressed \u00a7 2.09(a), the twin of \u00a7 4.08(a). <em>Md. Overpak, </em>395 Md. at 52-53, 909 A.2d at 256-57. We stated that \u201cthe grant of authority in the 1975 law to the City Council to provide for appeal to the Baltimore City Court of any matter arising under the planning and zoning laws of the City of Baltimore, [under \u00a7 2.09(f), the twin of 4.08(f),] is not rendered mere surplusage by our broader reading of \u2018zoning action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Fortunately for all concerned, it is not critical to Anderson House\u2019s challenges to Ordinance 21-05 that this nascent jurisdictional query be decided finitely in this appeal. Because Anderson House filed a judicial review action and a declaratory judgment/injunctive action, which actions were consolidated for hearing and decision, jurisdiction to review Ordinance 21-05 existed in the Circuit Court to adjudicate its challenges in the consolidated action under at least one or the other of Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08(f)/Rockville City Code, \u00a7 25-100 or the Declaratory Judgment Act. The parties do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>dispute this result. Had Anderson House stuck to its original decision to file and pursue only a judicial review action, this jurisdictional question properly would have been teed up and would be ripe for decision in this matter. As it is, however, we shall leave resolution of that quandary to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Despite its reservations concerning its jurisdiction, the Circuit Court proceeded to examine both Ordinances in light of Anderson House\u2019s arguments. Before us, as before the Circuit Court, Anderson House raises three arguments. The first two seek to invalidate the creation of the C-T zone generally. Anderson House argues that Ordinance 7-03, by countenancing varying minimum lot sizes, height restrictions, and floor area restrictions for each C-T zoned property, alternatively based on existing conditions at the time of imposition of the zone, violates the uniformity requirement of Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b)(2). In the alternative, Anderson House argues that the C-T zone provisions violate the identicality requirement of Rockville City Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25-1 and 25-91. Finally, Anderson House argues that the reclassification of its property to the C-T zone was an improper exercise of the City\u2019s police power under Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01(b)(1). We shall affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. We hold that Ordinances 7-03 and 21-05 do not violate either the State uniformity requirement or Rockville\u2019s identicality requirement. We further hold that the City did not exercise improperly its delegated police power by placing the Anderson House property in the C-T zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">According to Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01, \u201c[planning and zoning controls shall be implemented by local government.\u201d Thus, Rockville, as a municipal corporation reached by Article 66B, has the power to zone by comprehensive regulation for the \u201corderly development and use of land and structures.\u201d Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01(a)(1)\u00ae. \u201cTo promote the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the community,\u201d the City of Rockville \u201cmay regulate and restrict ... the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures\u201d and additionally may regulate lawn sizes and \u201cthe percentage of a lot that may be occupied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.01(b). There are, however, limitations on Rockville\u2019s power to zone; \u201c[mjunicipalities wield only such zoning powers as are granted them by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 575 n. 31, 814 A.2d at 505 n. 31 (2002). Pertinent to this case, Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b)(2) requires that \u201call regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of development throughout each district....\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">This requirement, commonly referred to as the \u201cuniformity requirement\u201d of Euclidean zoning, has its roots in the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which states, at \u00a7 2, that applicable zoning \u201cregulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts.\u201d 1 Robert M. Anderson, American Law of Zoning 3d \u00a7 5.25, at 417 (1986). This or a similar limitation appears in the state zoning enabling acts of nearly every state. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, Maryland employed the language verbatim, with the exception of the substitution of the word \u201cdevelopment\u201d for the word \u201cbuilding.\u201d Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b)(2). The apparent motive for including the uniformity requirement in the early days of the introduction of zoning controls was appeasement of potentially hostile landowners. 1 Anderson <em>supra, </em>at 418. With the requirement, property owners were assured that similarly situated properties would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>be subject to similar regulation. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the uniformity requirement springs less <em>from pure </em>legal necessity, but more from a policy desire to give notice to property owners that ad hoc zoning discriminations will not be tolerated by the law. <em>Id. </em>(citing Edward M. Bassett, Zoning: The Laws, Administration, and Court Decisions During the First Twenty Years 50 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">It has been observed that courts appear to have been somewhat reluctant to elaborate on or supply judicial gloss to the meaning of the uniformity requirement, perhaps due to the original policy purpose for its inclusion. 1 Anderson <em>supra, </em>at 288. Trends as to its application, however, appear in a number of states. Many jurisdictions agree that the kind of discrimination violative of the uniformity requirement occurs when a zoning ordinance singles out a property or properties for different treatment than others similarly situated. At the same time, those jurisdictions tend to find no violation of the uniformity requirement when zoning regulations are equally applicable, although their application produces varying restrictions and results across properties in the same zoning category. Decisions from New Jersey and Connecticut provide a useful \u201cside by side\u201d illustration of the application of the uniformity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In New Jersey, a violation of the uniformity requirement occurred when an ordinance imposed a setback requirement of 25 feet throughout a business district classification, with the exception of one block where a 67-foot setback was instead required. <em>N.T. Hegeman Co. v. Mayor and Council of Borough of River Edge, </em>6 N.J.Super. 495, 69 A.2d 767 (Law Div.1949). On the other hand, an ordinance that used a mathematical formula to determine minimum lot sizes and maximum lot coverage based upon the steepness of slopes on properties did not violate the uniformity requirement even though it created varying results based upon a parcel\u2019s unique physical conditions or characteristics. <em>Rumson Estates, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; Council of Borough of Fair Haven, </em>177 N. J. 338, 828 A.2d 317 (2003). The New Jersey court emphasized that uniformly applicable regulations could result in different con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ditions without violating the requirement. <em>Rumson Estates, </em>828 A.2d at 329-30. The crux of the requirement is only that similarly situated properties are treated the same under the zoning regulations. <em>Id.; see also Quinton v. Edison Park Dev. Corp., </em>59 N.J. 571, 285 A.2d 5 (1971) (finding that an ordinance requiring a buffer strip for certain properties based upon size and location within the zone did not violate the uniformity requirement because all similarly situated properties were treated the same.); <em>State v. Gallop Bldg., </em>103 N.J.Super. 367, 247 A.2d 350 (App.Div.1968) (finding no violation of uniformity requirement for a special buffer provision where all properties similarly situated were subject to the same requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Connecticut similarly recognized this distinction. An ordinance requiring a buffer strip for one specific land plot, while failing to compel the requirement in all other similar instances within the zone, was found discriminatory and in violation of uniformity. <em>Veseskis v. Bristol Zoning Comm\u2019n, </em>168 Conn. 358, 362 A.2d 538 (1975). On the other hand, an amendment to a town zoning regulation creating different minimum lot sizes, dependent upon various factors otherwise applicable across the zone, such as lot slope, and whether, and how much, of a property is covered by wetlands or watercourses, did not violate Connecticut\u2019s uniformity requirement. <em>Harris v. Zoning Comm\u2019n of Town of New Milford, </em>259 Conn. 402, 788 A.2d 1239 (2002). In distinguishing <em>Veseskis, </em>the <em>Harris </em>Court noted that the regulation in <em>Veseskis </em>affected only one specific parcel of land, whereas in <em>Harris </em>the amendment to the regulation was generally applicable. <em>Harris, </em>788 A.2d at 1258. The court noted that the \u201cthrust of the statutory requirement of uniformity is equal treatment\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe fact that the amendment has [a] differing effect on parcels of land throughout the town does not render its application inconsistent or unequal\u201d because it is applied to \u201cevery parcel within its purview consistently and equally.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Maryland\u2019s common law conforms to the trend. Our discussion in <em>Rylyns </em>demonstrates a recognition and understanding of the origins and history of the uniformity requirement. We said there that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">the requirement that there be uniformity within each zone throughout the district is an important safeguard of the right to fair and equal treatment of the landowners at the hands of the local zoning authority. Frankly put, the requirement of uniformity serves to protect the landowner from favoritism towards certain landowners within a zone by the grant of less onerous restrictions than are applied to others within the same zone elsewhere in the district, and also serves to prevent the use of zoning as a form of leverage by the local government seeking land concession, transfers, or other consideration in return for more favorable zoning treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">372 Md. at 536, 814 A.2d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Indeed, Maryland recognizes that the uniformity requirement is an important tool for the achievement of stability in land use and planning as effected through Euclidean zoning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>but also recognizes that \u201c[pjerfect uniformity in zoning ... is a baseless dream.\u201d <em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 534, 814 A.2d at 481; <em>Mayor and City Council of Balt. v. Byrd, </em>191 Md. 632, 642, 62 A.2d 588, 593 (1948). As with other states, Maryland\u2019s limited case law on the uniformity requirement demonstrates that it is discrimination in favor of, or against, particular properties that will not be tolerated. In contrast, uniformly applicable regulations that produce disparate results in application do not violate the uniformity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">For example, in <em>Board of County Commissioners of Washington County v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 574, 501 A.2d 489, the Court of Special Appeals found a violation of the uniformity requirement where a particular property was limited to half of the uses ordinarily allowed in the zone. Specifically, the Holtz property was rezoned from residential to business. <em>H. Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 576-77, 501 A.2d at 490. In the course of the rezoning, to appease certain protesters, the Holtz property was limited in the uses that could be established on it. <em>H. Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 577, 501 A.2d at 490. Thus, although the Board of County Commissioners had predetermined legislatively acceptable uses for the business zone by its enactment of a list of permitted uses, it sought to limit in a piecemeal fashion the Holtz property to only some of those uses. <em>H. Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 583, 501 A.2d at 493. Thus, the property at issue was singled-out and treated differently by the terms of the act of reclassification. The court aptly found that such a limitation would create a \u201cmini-district\u201d within the relevant business zoning district. The court said, \u201c[i]f we were to authorize the Board of County Commissioners through rezoning to limit or restrict permitted uses of certain tracts within a zone, it would have the power to destroy the uniformity of the district\u201d\u2014to \u201cemasculate\u201d the requirement. <em>H. Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 583, 501 A.2d at 493; <em>see also Cassel v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., </em>195 Md. 348, 354, 73 A.2d 486, 488 (1950) (\u201cThe regulations for the use of property within the various use districts are supported upon the basic theory that they apply equally and uniformly.... Invidious distinctions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>discriminations in zoning cannot be allowed----\u201d); <em>Heath v. Mayor and City Council of Balt, </em>187 Md. 296, 305, 49 A.2d 799, 804 (1946) (\u201c[Ejquality and uniformity of operation within a particular zone as to each type of building are basic in the statute. Invidious distinctions and discriminations are not permissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In contrast, in <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. 686, 718-23, 376 A.2d 483, 501-03 (1977), this Court found that no violation of the uniformity requirement occurred when properties within a zoning district were subjected to uniformly applicable regulations that created in application disparate results for individual properties. Specifically at issue were uniformly applicable regulations concerning gross floor area that created disparate results alleged to be in violation of the uniformity requirement. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, buildings for which permits were obtained before 1959 were subject to different treatment than buildings for which permits were obtained after 1959 relative to the immediacy with which they were required to conform to the new zoning code.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We said there, that \u201c[t]he focus [of the uniformity requirement] is upon the terminology of the ordinance, rather than upon its application.\u201d <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. at 720, 376 A.2d at 501. We found no violation of the uniformity requirement. <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. at 722-23, 376 A.2d at 502-03. Instead, we noted that the regulations applied uniformly, but with different results for properties based upon their characteristics. <em>Id. </em>In other words, regulations concerning a zoning district that are uniformly applicable may result in application in varying restrictions for individual properties without violating the uniformity requirement. \u201cThis difference in treatment is neither arbitrary nor invidiously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>discriminatory, but affects alike all properties similarly situated.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. at 723, 376 A.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The Circuit Court in the present case was correct to find no merit in Anderson House\u2019s complaints as to Article 66B\u2019s uniformity requirement. Ordinance 7-03 calls for uniformly applicable regulations throughout the C-T zoning district. The minimum lot area for all developments is 5,000 square feet or the existing condition, whichever is greater as of the time a property is placed within the zone. Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-311. Building heights for all developments in the zone cannot exceed the height of any structures existing at the time a property was placed in the zone. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 25-315. Total floor area for all improvements cannot exceed 150 percent of an existing building as it existed on 1 January 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 25-315(b). For all properties, side and rear yard setbacks and lot width restrictions are the same as for a comparably sized lot zoned residential. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 25-312. The City\u2019s approach in framing the C-T zone avoids the need for a race to obtain variances lest existing developed properties become nonconforming uses or structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The Anderson House property is but one property to which the uniform regulations applied and for which the uniform regulations created a unique result. It was not, according to this record, a property singled out by the terms of the legislation for disparate treatment. All properties included within the C-T zone are limited by the terms of the legislation. Although the Anderson House property may have been the largest property in gross lot size zoned C-T within the City, this does not make it a \u201cmini-district,\u201d as in <em>Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 588-84, 501 A.2d at 493. Thus, on the record before us, we conclude that there was no unfair or unequal treatment, no arbitrary or invidious distinction or discrimination, and, indeed, no emasculation of the uniformity requirement. <em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 536, 814 A.2d at 481-82; <em>Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 583-84, 501 A.2d at 493; <em>Cassel, </em>195 Md. at 354, 73 A.2d at 488; <em>Heath, </em>187 Md. at 305, 49 A.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Anderson House also asserts that the C-T zone restrictions and placement of its property within the C-T zone violate Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-91(a), where it is required that amendments to the zoning map or to the Rockville City Code, Chapter 25, Zoning and Planning, must be adopted in compliance with procedures set forth in the Article and any other applicable law. Anderson House argues that this means that any amendment must comport with \u00a7 25-1 of the Rock-ville City Code. Section 25-1 generally provides Articlewide definitions and states, \u201c[t]he following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section.\u201d Rockville City Code, \u00a7 25-1. Anderson House argues that this section creates an \u201cidenticality requirement\u201d when amendments are made concerning zoning because it defines the term \u201czone\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aah\">an area within which certain uses of land and buildings are permitted and certain others are permitted only by special exception or are prohibited; yards and other open spaces are required; lot areas, building height limits, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>requirements are established; <em>all of the foregoing being identical </em>for the zone in which they apply.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbH\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">According to Anderson House, the identicality requirement found in \u00a7 25-1 is stricter than the uniformity requirement of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.02(b)(2) of the Maryland Code. Anderson House argues that the C-T regulations are not identical because the formulae that generally apply, because of their alternative reliance on existing site and structure conditions, results in different zoning conditions for each C-T property. Focusing on the minimum lot size, Anderson House\u2019s argument goes: \u201c[t]he offending ordinance establishes for the [C-T zone] a minimum lot size of \u20185,000 square feet or existing condition, whichever is greater.\u2019 Since the \u2018existing condition\u2019 is different for each and every property in the zone, the lot area restrictions for the C-T zone are not identical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">We find this argument unconvincing. Anderson House, by the terms of its argument, acknowledges that \u201cidentical\u201d and \u201cuniform\u201d are synonymous. In both arguments, Appellant focuses on the disparate results achieved by application of the regulations while ignoring their uniform (or identical) application. Under Anderson House\u2019s \u201cplain meaning reading\u201d of the regulation, the identicality requirement of \u00a7 25-1 means that, in each Euclidean zone in the City of Rockville, every yard and other open space requirement, lot area, or building height requirement must yield a uniform result for every property. Anderson House misconstrues the regulation. Regulations \u201cmust be construed in a reasonable way.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Donahue, </em>400 Md. 510, 531, 929 A.2d 512, 525 (2007) (citing <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 663, 911 A.2d 1245, 1250 (2006)). In construing a regulation, we must avoid a construction \u201cthat is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 663, 911 A.2d at 1250. A reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>regulation as Anderson House seeks would surely, however, create an absurd result. As noted by the Circuit Court, were we to rule in such a way, not only would the C-T zone\u2019s regulatory scheme be invalidated, we also would \u201cpull the thread and unravel the sweater\u201d of Rockville\u2019s zoning regulations as to all of its Euclidean zones and perhaps beyond.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In employing properly the plain meaning rule, we search for a \u201cdefinite and sensible meaning.\u201d <em>In re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. 515, 521, 471 A.2d 313, 315 (1984). Such a reading of the statute in this case leads us to conclude that regulations must be applied identically to each property within the zone, but need not produce a uniform result for every property in the zone. As noted by the Circuit Court, the C-T zone regulations (and other regulations created by the City) harmonize \"with such a reading. Indeed, as aptly put by the Circuit Court, \u201cthe C-T zoning scheme applies an identical regulatory scheme to each individual development within the C-T zone.

The Mayor and Council imposed a moratorium on various development activities in the City while the zoning revision process occurs. It is anticipated that RORZOR will release its draft in October 2007 which will result in the filing of a text amendment and related comprehensive map amendment. In its current form the RORZOR draft Zoning Ordinance eliminates existing non-residential zones, including the C-T zone, and substitutes new zones in their place. Most of these new zones are mixed-use zones that emphasize principles of form-based zoning. None of the Proposed new zones contain the development standards challenged here by appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">When questioned by the Court at oral argument in the present case whether the new regulations would moot this case, counsel for Anderson House jokingly commented that it could depend upon the local elections, which were occurring the same day. As it turns out, three out of five persons comprising the then incumbent Mayor and Council prevailed in the municipal election and continue to hold their positions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b757-4\">.

We find these cases distinguishable and therefore unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In <em>Hamer, </em>the California Supreme Court found a one-acre minimum lot size restriction invalid where it was conceded by the parties that the restriction bore no relationship to the public health, safety, or general welfare. 31 Cal.Rptr. 335, 382 P.2d at 379-80. Rockville made no such concession here.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>C &amp; M Developers </em>and <em>Kohn </em>similarly lack persuasive force. In C <em>&amp; M Developers, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected a minimum lot size requirement, which it found to be motivated by a concern to preserve the character of a small number of residential homes, as exclusionary in purpose and therefore not in the interest of the public welfare. 820 A.2d at 158. In <em>Kohn, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected an argument that the public welfare was protected by a minimum lot size requirement which it found was intended to protect the setting for some older homes in the township. 215 A.2d at 611-12. These cases do not change our view of Ordinances 7-03 and 21-05 because we find that the City advanced facially valid justifications for the Ordinances, which included minimizing the impact of businesses on adjacent residential properties and preserving the residential character of the existing structures and lots. Indeed, the Maryland General Assembly has mandated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">[o]n the zoning or rezoning of any land under [Article 66B], a local legislative body may impose ... conditions ... that the local legislative body considers appropriate to preserve, improve, or protect the general character and design of the lands and improvements being zoned or rezoned; or the surrounding or adjacent lands and improvements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01(c)(1); <em>see also Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 568, 814 A.2d at 501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">.

Ten properties range from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet. Two properties range from 20,000 to 30,000 square <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>feet. Finally, one property falls within the range from 30,000 to 40,000 square feet, the Anderson House Property. It is not unreasonable to expect that one property will be the largest in size of any in the classification. If, by virtue of that distinction alone, its rezoning in a comprehensive rezoning becomes irrational, that would be a very silly rule of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">. It is inconsequential to our analysis here that Planning Staff and the Planning Commission supported split zoning the property C-T and 0-2. This Court has recognized that the recommendations of a planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>body with respect to a comprehensive rezoning are not binding upon the legislative body. <em>Nottingham Vill. v.
