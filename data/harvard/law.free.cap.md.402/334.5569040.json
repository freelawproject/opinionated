On March 20, 2007, this Court indefinitely suspended Mba-Jonas, with the right to apply for readmission after 90 days, because of misconduct in the management of his escrow account. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 919 A.2d 669 (2007). In the present matter, the Attorney Grievance Commission, by Bar Counsel, filed a petition for disciplinary action against Victor Mba-Jonas based upon allegations of substantially the same type of conduct involved in Mba-Jonas\u2019s previous case.- Specifically, Bar Counsel alleged violations of Rules 1.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.15,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 8.4<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Professional Conduct; Maryland Rules 16-607 and 16-609;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>and Maryland Code (2000, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-306 and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The matter was referred to Judge Maureen M. Lamasney of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a hearing and factual findings pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The facts, as found by Judge Lamasney, are essentially as follows. On April 26, 2005, Bar Counsel received a letter from the Bank of America stating that there was an overdraft on Mba-Jonas\u2019s attorney escrow account in the amount of $39.79. Bar Counsel sent three letters to Mba-Jonas requesting an explanation for the overdraft but received no response. After a fourth letter was sent to Mba-Jonas\u2019s attorney, Bar Counsel received a letter, forwarded by Mba-Jonas\u2019s attorney, from McDonald C. Okechukwo of the Bank of America. The letter was in reference to the overdraft, but, as Judge Lamasney found, it was \u201ctotally non-responsive.\u201d Thereafter the Attorney Grievance Commission performed a \u201cbank record analysis,\u201d sometimes referred to as a \u201ctrust account analyzer,\u201d for the period of January 1, 2005 to October 15, 2005, on Victor Mba-Jonas\u2019s escrow account at the Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The central feature of the allegations against Mba-Jonas in this case concerns the maintenance of his escrow account, and those facts were not in dispute. Regarding the allegations, Judge Lamasney found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cThe trust analyzer revealed that the trust account had a negative balance on January 10, [2005]. The respondent had only $47.88 in the bank when he wrote a $60.00 check payable to Agyeiwah Adwua. A negative balance of $12.12 ensued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201cOn 2-2-05 a $3,000 deposit was immediately reduced to $2958.74. The second negative balance occurred on April 20, 2005 and resulted in the letter from the bank to the Attorney Grievance Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cOn April 27, 2005, a deposit of $9,000 attributable to Terri Belt was immediately reduced to $8,930 and brought the account to a positive level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201cDuring this period of time, the following clients of Mr. Mba-Jonas had amounts left over in their accounts that were not disbursed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>April Langley $105.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acd\">Terri Belt $100.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">Solange Tang $100.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEs\">Nathan Drakeford $ 30.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5n\">Joseph Ebotarrey $100.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">Christian Njoku $ 15.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsO\">Agnes Mongare $100.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APq\">Kufre Akpaidem $ 68.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A99\">Chinyere Uduhiri $ 25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHh\">Joselyne Edmond $ 66.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFk\">Abel Getaehew $ 25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A46\">S. Olorungbohunmi $400.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201cThe undisbursed money totaled $1,732.80. Bank fees for the account were $370.05, approximately 25% of the total. Mr. Mba-Jonas testified that the money was his, not the clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u201cIn two cases, more money was given out than taken in. In the matter of Hilaria Navarro, $15.00 more was expended. In the case of Dora Lima, the amount was $966.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u201cThere were four occasions during this time period when money directed to one client was used for another. The respondent wrote a partial settlement check for $60.00 to Agyewash Adwua, when only $47.88 in funds remained. Secondly, on February 1, 2005 a deposit of $3000 was made from Progressive Insurance for Ekaette Essien. Because of the negative balance, the amount was immediately reduced to $2,958.74. On April 11,2005, a check was written to Godwin Ihionu for $79.41 with only $39.62 in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u201c[Fourth], a deposit made for the benefit of Terri Belt in the amount of $9,000 became $8,930.21 because of the negative balance. Additionally, the respondent admitted to writing check number 3017 to cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Judge Lamasney made the following conclusions of law regarding Mba-Jonas\u2019s management of the escrow account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">\u201cRule 1.15 Safekeeping Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">The respondent failed to safeguard the property of his clients. He failed to keep his clients\u2019 property separate from his own. He maintained his own funds far in excess of the amount needed to cover expenses. He failed to gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ate complete records in the first place; whatever records he did produce he has not maintained for five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201cRule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cThe manner in which the escrow account was maintained is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The Court does not believe\u2014nor has it been suggested\u2014that the state of his escrow account is the result of dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cMaryland Rule 16-607\u2014Commingling Funds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cThe respondent did not withdraw his own [money] from the account money with any degree of promptness on multiple occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cMaryland Rule 16-609 Prohibited Transactions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cThe respondent acknowledges a check made out to cash. \u201cBusiness Occupations &amp; Professions Article, 10-306 Misuse of Trust Money</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">\u201cAll of the above violations constitute a misuse of trust money under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">The remaining issue in this case concerns Mba-Jonas\u2019s interactions with Bar Counsel investigator Marc Fiedler and the letter from McDonald Okechukwu of the Bank of America. Marc Fiedler testified that he asked Mba-Jonas to produce certain documents so that he could review them, and MbaJonas failed to produce the documents. According to MbaJonas\u2019s testimony, \u201cthe files were not immediately accessible; ... he had difficulty obtaining them; ... the cost of photocopying was expensive, and ... he was dealing with the consequences of the suspension mandated by the Court of Appeals.\u201d In addition, Fiedler testified that he gave MbaJonas information on how to balance his account and reviewed with him the requirements of an escrow account. Judge Lamasney stated that the \u201csituation with his escrow account has not improved since that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">As previously indicated, Bar Counsel received a letter signed by McDonald C. Okechukwu of the Bank of America concerning the overdraft.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Marc Fiedler testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>inquired if Mba-Jonas knew the author of the letter because the letter was nonresponsive and was from a branch of the Bank of America located some distance from Mba-Jonas\u2019s office. Fiedler further testified that Mba-Jonas said that he did not know McDonald Okechukwu and that Mba-Jonas repeated the same answer after Fiedler \u201csaid he hoped he would not find out that the respondent had represented the banker.\u201d According to Judge Lamasney\u2019s findings, MbaJonas \u201cdid in fact represent the banker in a divorce in 1999.\u201d Mba-Jonas testified that Fiedler did not ask whether MbaJonas knew the author of the letter, but whether the author was a friend. Mba-Jonas testified that, to this question, he answered \u201cno.\u201d He also stated that he went to that particular branch of the Bank of America because he was shopping with his family in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Regarding the letter from McDonald Okechukwu and the interactions with Marc Fiedler, Judge Lamasney found that Mba-Jonas violated Rule 8.1. Judge Lamasney stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cRule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that the letter obtained from the Bank of America is another example of the extreme carelessness exhibited by the respondent and not an attempt at deliberate deception. Since the letter was so clearly non-responsive, there was no question that it would be accepted as a resolution of the overdraft by the Attorney Grievance Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cHowever, the conversation with Mr. Fiedler is a different matter. The Court finds the testimony of Mr. Fiedler to be credible and finds that the respondent deliberately tried to conceal his connection to the banker. At the very least, he failed to volunteer the information since it was clear Mr. Fiedler\u2019s questions were directed to ascertain the relationship between the banker and respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">\u201cThe Court finds that he failed to provide information to the Attorney Grievance Commission despite their lawful demand. While the respondent was going through a difficult time in his life, at the time this case was instigated he was in the midst of the prior proceeding. He produced some documents in that matter, but almost none in this. His cooperation decreased, even with the prior grievance and the suspension by the Court of Appeals. That process should have induced more cooperation rather than less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Finally, Judge Lamasney also found in mitigation that MbaJonas \u201chad family problems that required a substantial amount of attention during this period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Bar Counsel filed no substantive exceptions to Judge Lamasney\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Bar Counsel filed a few technical exceptions to correct minor typographical errors in dates set forth in Judge Lamasney\u2019s findings and conclusions, and we sustain those exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Victor Mba-Jonas filed a single exception objecting to Judge Lamasney\u2019s finding of fact and conclusion that he violated Rule 8.1 with respect to his discussions with Marc Feidler. Mba-Jonas argues that \u201ca fair reading of the record would indicate that Bar Counsel failed to prove ... by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that he made a false statement regarding his relationship with Okechukwu. Further more, Mba-Jonas asserts that \u201che had no motive to hide any association with Mr. Okechukwu ... or to be disingenuous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>We overrule this exception. We accept Judge Lamasney\u2019s finding and legal conclusion as she had the opportunity to weigh the credibility of the witnesses. In our review of such disciplinary hearings, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as <em>prima facie </em>correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 54, 930 A.2d 328, 335 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Ward, </em>394 Md. 1, 16, 904 A.2d 477, 486 (2006). In addition, \u2018 \u201c[wjeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.\u201d \u2018 <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, </em>400 Md. 618, 630, 929 A.2d 576, 583 (2007), quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998). Judge Lamasney found the testimony of Marc Fiedler to be credible, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that such a finding is clearly erroneous. Because the factual finding is not clearly erroneous, and the conclusion of law is supported by the factual finding, we overrule Mba-Jonas\u2019s exception relating to his violation of Rule 8.1. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, supra, </em>400 Md. at 629, 929 A.2d at 583 (\u201cWhen the factual findings are not clearly erroneous and the conclusions drawn from them are supported by the facts found, exceptions to conclusions of law will be overruled\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, supra, </em>400 Md. at 629, 929 A.2d at 583, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Bar Counsel recommends that Victor Mba-Jonas be disbarred. In support of this recommendation, Bar Counsel cites Mba-Jonas\u2019s failure to improve his management of his escrow account even after Marc Fiedler provided him 'with information on how to do so. In addition, Bar Counsel cites Mba-Jonas\u2019s failure to disclose the full extent of his relationship with Okechukwu as reason for disbarment. Bar Counsel also maintains that the present matter is distinguishable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>a series of cases applying suspensions of varying lengths for violations involving the mismanagement of escrow accounts. In particular, Bar Counsel cites <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Obi, </em>393 Md. 643, 904 A.2d 422 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Rose, </em>383 Md. 385, 859 A.2d 659 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>374 Md. 505, 823 A.2d 651 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. McClain, </em>373 Md. 196, 817 A.2d 218 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 802 A.2d 1014 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Victor Mba-Jonas argues that the appropriate sanction is a ninety day suspension to run concurrently with his indefinite suspension ordered by this Court <em>in Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Mba-Jonas, supra, </em>397 Md. 690, 919 A.2d 669. Noting that this matter \u201carose in an almost contemporaneous framework as [his previous] disciplinary violations,\u201d Mba-Jonas argues the problems in the instant case are similar to those in his prior case. Furthermore, he reasons that the misrepresentation to Marc Fiedler \u201cnever created a cloud over Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d Mba-Jonas also argues that Judge Lamasney essentially made alternative findings regarding his violation of Rule 8.1. He points to the language from Judge Lamasney\u2019s findings and conclusions stating that he \u201cdeliberately tried to conceal\u201d information and that he \u201c[a]t the very least, failed to volunteer the information.\u201d Mba-Jonas argues that this Court should consider only the latter finding. Finally, he asserts that to impose greater sanctions than those imposed in his previous case \u201cwould needlessly punish him for essentially the same conduct that could have been dealt with in one case, rather than two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">As discussed, Victor Mba-Jonas has previously been the subject of disciplinary proceedings. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Mba-Jonas, supra, </em>397 Md. 690, 919 A.2d 669, this Court addressed violations occurring in 2003 and 2004. In large part, the violations found in Mba-Jonas\u2019s first case are similar to those in the present matter. As here, his previous violations involved mismanagement of his escrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>account including three instances where the escrow account was overdrawn, poorly maintained settlement sheets and records, failure to keep a ledger, and post dated checks. This Court held in the previous case that Mba-Jonas violated Rules 1.15, 8.4(a) and (d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-607, and 16-609, and Maryland Code (2000, 2004 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 10-306, of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">An attorney\u2019s disciplinary history is among the factors this Court considers in determining the appropriate sanction for misconduct. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Sapero, </em>400 Md. 461, 490, 929 A.2d 483, 501 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Hill, </em>398 Md. 95, 103, 919 A.2d 1194, 1198 (2007). In the present matter, we note that the disciplinary violations are substantially similar to those in Mba-Jonas\u2019s previous case and to a certain extent the time periods involved in the two actions overlap. This Court filed its opinion in the first case on March 20, 2007. The proceedings in the instant matter were initiated on December 19, 2005, when the Attorney Grievance Commission filed in this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. Given the overlap in time period and the substantially similar violations involved, we believe it is appropriate to consider Mr. Mba-Jonas\u2019s present violations as a continuation of his previous improper conduct. In considering a sanction, we therefore consider Mba-Jonas\u2019s conduct, including his prior violations, as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Moreover, this Court also considers \u201cthe nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, supra, </em>400 Md. at 642, 929 A.2d at 590 (internal quotations omitted); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Neither of the actions against Mba-Jonas involves an intent to defraud, deceive, or steal from his clients. Judge Lamasney found in the previous case that\u201d [cjlearly, he had no intent to defraud or steal from his clients. In fact, many of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>problems resulted from his desire to accommodate his clients and to keep them satisfied with his representation.\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Mba-Jonas, supra, </em>397 Md. at 698, 919 A.2d at 674. Likewise, in the present matter, Judge Lamasney found that the \u201cCourt does not believe\u2014nor has it been suggested\u2014that the state of [Mba-Jonas\u2019s] escrow account is the result of dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">We disagree that the cases involving suspensions, cited by Bar Counsel, are distinguishable. Bar Counsel relied on most of the same cases to recommend an indefinite suspension in Mba-Jonas\u2019s prior disciplinary proceeding. We believe that the cases again support an indefinite suspension. The only case not relied on by Bar Counsel in the first matter, but cited here, is <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Awuah, supra, </em>374 Md. 505, 823 A.2d 651. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Commission v. Awuah, supra, </em>346 Md. 420, 697 A.2d 446. In <em>Awuah, </em>an attorney who previously had been indefinitely suspended with a right to reapply after 60 days, was disbarred after he continued to practice law in spite of his suspension. The initial suspension involved similar offenses to the present matter. Specifically, Awuah failed to maintain proper trust accounts, commingled client funds with his own, and failed to keep proper records. <em>Awuah, </em>374 Md. at 508, 823 A.2d at 653. In the subsequent case, however, Awuah was disbarred because he continued to practice law in violation of Rule 5.5(a). <em>Awuah, </em>374 Md. at 525-526, 823 A.2d at 663-664. In the present matter, Mba-Jonas did not behave similarly. He did not continue to practice law subsequent to his suspension. Also, as Judge Lamasney found, Mba-Jonas did not deceive his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Bar Counsel also points to Mba-Jonas\u2019s violation of Rule 8.1 to support the disbarment recommendation. According to Judge Lamasney, however, Mba-Jonas, \u201cat the very least, failed to volunteer the information [about his representation of Okechukwu] since it was clear that Fiedler\u2019s questions were directed to ascertain the relationship between the banker and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the respondent.\u201d Under the circumstances, this does not warrant disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In determining the appropriate sanction to apply, we do not seek to punish the erring attorney but to protect the public. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, supra, </em>400 Md. at 642, 929 A.2d at 590; <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, v. Mba-Jonas, supra, </em>397 Md. at 702, 919 A.2d at 677; <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Rees, </em>396 Md. 248, 254, 913 A.2d 68, 72 (2006). We disagree, however, with Mba-Jonas, that a 90 day suspension, concurrent with his indefinite suspension, is the appropriate sanction. Rather, viewing Mba-Jonas\u2019s two cases in conjunction, we believe the appropriate sanction is a continuation of the indefinite suspension with the right to reapply for readmission after six months from the date this opinion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST VICTOR MBA-JONAS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">HARRELL, BATTAGLIA and WILNER, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">.

Which BATTAGLIA and WILNER, JJ. join.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Although I agree with the Majority opinion Parts I and II, I disagree with the sanctions analysis and result in Part III. The Majority opinion concludes that the time periods involved in the present case and Respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary action, <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 919 A.2d 669 (2007) <em>(\u201cMba-Jonas I\u201d), </em>overlap \u201cto a certain extent.\u201d Maj. op. at 346, 936 A.2d at 846. It reaches this conclusion on the basis that the Court filed its opinion in <em>Mba-Jonas I </em>on 20 March 2007 and the proceedings in the present case were initiated on 19 December 2005. <em>Id. </em>On the basis of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>observation in gross, the Majority opinion penultimately expresses the view that it is \u201cappropriate to consider [Respondent\u2019s] present violations as a continuation of his previous improper [and substantially similar] misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, for sanctions purposes, the Majority opinion considers the misconduct in both cases as constituting a \u201cwhole.\u201d The focus of the Majority opinion is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The actual misconduct in <em>Mba-Jonas I </em>occurred over the period June 2003\u2014June 2004. <em>Mba-Jonas I, </em>397 Md. at 695-97, 919 A.2d at 672-74. The misconduct upon which the present case relies occurred during December 2004\u2014October 2005. Respondent had been given the benefit of advice from Petitioner\u2019s investigator, Mr. Fiedler, as early as 23 January 2004, about the specific record-keeping requirements of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as having a monitor of his bookkeeping practices from March 2004 to at least June 2004 <em>(Mba-Jonas I, </em>397 Md. at 695, 919 A.2d at 672) under a failed conditional Diversion Agreement. Notwithstanding these affirmative efforts by others to get him to straighten out his record-keeping, Respondent persisted in the present case to ignore what was expected of him, after he no longer could claim ignorance of the requirements, over a substantially longer period of time than was embraced by them is conduct in <em>Mba-Jonas I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">To my thinking, it is not the overlap of the prosecution and pendency of these cases that should be the focus of the sanctions analysis, but rather the actual dates of the misconduct. There was a clear separation of the misconduct of <em>MbarJonas I, </em>and that in the present case. The separation becomes even more meaningful in light of the external efforts made to get Respondent to conform to the ethical norms and his continued refusal and failure to do so. Simply put, there is no \u201cwhole\u201d or single unit of prosecution (to borrow a phrase from another legal context) here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Moreover, I am troubled by Respondent\u2019s effort, clumsy though it was, to explain away his misconduct through the disingenuous solicitation and tender of Mr. Okechukwu\u2019s let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ter. Respondent was found by the hearing judge to have \u201cdeliberately tried to conceal his connection to [Mr. Okechukwu],\u201d a former client of Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">This record convinces me that Respondent remains resolutely oblivious to the ethical expectations and requirements for the safekeeping and accounting of trust monies and seems prepared to be devious and unforthcoming when sought to be held accountable for his actions. In order to protect the public from the probable continuing perpetration of Respondent\u2019s misconduct and to set a proper example for the Bar as to the tolerance limits for this sort of ongoing pattern of misconduct, I would disbar Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Judge BATTAGLIA and Judge WILNER authorized me to state that they join the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
