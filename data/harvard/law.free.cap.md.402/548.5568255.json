In June 2002, Dr. Marcuse informed Magnetti that his teaching contract with the Professional Writing Program would not be renewed for the upcoming Fall 2002 semester. Magnetti alleges that Dr. Marcuse did not provide him with an explanation for his termination. Magnetti\u2019s subsequent attempts at reapplying to the Professional Writing Program were rebuffed by Dr. Marcuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The Circuit Court, on a motion by the University, dismissed Magnetti\u2019s complaint as barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Circuit Court explained that Magnetti had failed to file his complaint within one year of the accrual date of his claim; therefore, he was unable to effectuate the statutory waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity. Thereafter, Magnetti filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Magnetti\u2019s complaint. <em>Magnetti v. University of Maryland, </em>171 Md.App. 279, 909 A.2d 1101 (2006). On April 11, 2007, we granted <em>certiorari, Magnetti v. University of Maryland, </em>398 Md. 314, 920 A.2d 1058 (2007), to review the following question, which we have distilled from the three questions presented in Magnetti\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Did the Circuit Court err in concluding that Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-202 of the State Government Article applied to bar Magnetti\u2019s contract action against the University?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We answer that question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Because this appeal arises from the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of the University\u2019s motion to dismiss, we assume \u201cthe truth of all well-pleaded relevant and material facts ... as well as all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ings.\u201d <em>Odyniec v. Schneider, </em>322 Md. 520, 525, 588 A.2d 786, 788 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">It is alleged that until June 2002, Magnetti had been employed as an instructor and lecturer in the Professional Writing Program for nineteen years. Magnetti primarily taught legal writing courses; however, during his tenure at the University, Magnetti had come to teach every professional writing course offered to students. For at least the last ten years of his employment, Magnetti usually taught at least three courses a semester.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In the performance of his duties, Magnetti received high marks in both peer and student evaluations. He was nominated as teacher of the year four times during his tenure at the University, winning the honor in 1995 and 1996. At some point during his employment with the University, Magnetti was notified that based on his longevity with the Professional Writing Program, he was classified as a member of the \u201cCore Faculty,\u201d the highest tier in the Professional Writing Program\u2019s personnel system. While the Professional Writing Program did not sub scribe to the traditional tenure system used in many universities, in granting such designation, the Professional Writing Program guaranteed designated faculty members a continuous teaching load of at least three sections/classes per semester as long as they were continuously employed with the Professional Writing Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In June 2002, allegedly without articulating the basis, Dr. Marcuse notified Magnetti that his contract with the Professional Writing Program would not be renewed for the upcoming Fall 2002 semester. Magnetti made subsequent attempts to reapply with the Professional Writing Program; however, such attempts were rebuffed by Dr. Marcuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">More than three years later, on June 13, 2005, Magnetti filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and seeking specific performance to enforce the parties\u2019 contract. Magnetti requested $300,000 in compensatory damages and that the Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>versity \u201cbe ordered to hire [Magnetti] to his previous employment position\u201d with the Professional Writing Program. Magnetti alleged that he was dismissed because of a physical handicap that affects his ability to walk\u2014Peripheral Artery Disorder\u2014and because of his outward appearance, as he wears a beard and a ponytail.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">On September 14, 2005, the University filed \u201cDefendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss,\u201d arguing that Magnetti\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because sovereign immunity barred Magnetti\u2019s suit. Specifically, the University argued that Magnetti filed his lawsuit some three years after his termination, well beyond the one-year period set forth in Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-202 of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d) as the condition precedent for the waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on the motion on December 28, 2005. At that hearing, Magnetti argued that the University\u2019s sovereign immunity had been waived pursuant to Md.Code (1978, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-104(a) and (b)(3) of the Education Article (\u201cEd.\u201d). Specifically, Magnetti argued that a recent amendment to Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a), which added the language \u201cby specific reference,\u201d clarified the General Assembly\u2019s intent that statutory restrictions on powers granted to the Board of Regents must specifically reference the University System to be operable. According to Magnetti, S.G. \u00a7 12-202 could not then apply to the University because it served as a restriction on the ability of the Board of Regents to be sued under S.G. \u00a7 12-201 and the statutory language used in S.G. \u00a7 12-202 did not specifically reference the University System. Magnetti contended that because the provisions of Ed. \u00a7 12-104 applied to waive the University\u2019s sovereign immunity, only the three-year statute of limitations for general contract claims was relevant to the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The Circuit Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Well, I believe the Stem[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] case is dispositive of the issue, and <em>Stem </em>does provide expressly, we hold the Board has sovereign immunity. There was an analysis as to whether the language sued and be sued was sufficient to enact a waiver of immunity. The [C]ourt concluded it was not. I believe the same is true here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">I disagree with Mr. Wein [Magnetti\u2019s counsel] that the 2004 amendments were a response to <em>Stem. </em>In fact, to the contrary, the <em>Stem </em>decision was issued [on] April 12, 2004. The legislation which ultimately was enacted was introduced in February of 2004 ... for the purpose of providing that the authority of the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland [sic] may not be superceded by any state agency or office in certain management affairs except by a provision of law that specifically references the University System of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">In addition, it deleted a requirement as to the number of positions that may be created in the University System. If you look at it, it is expressly what it does. It was dealing with a different issue, that is the relationship between the University and other state agencies. It was an issue that predated the <em>Stem </em>decision. It doesn\u2019t at all respond to the issue of <em>Stem.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">Similarly, <em>Conte[</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>] ... </em>also deals with this issue. <em>Conte, </em>they clearly say, okay, you may be able to proceed because\u2014in <em>Stem, </em>there was no written contract. So the provisions of the State Government Article that have been cited did not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">In <em>Conte </em>there was a written contract and the issue of timeliness, they said, well, there is no confusion but that he did file within the year required. That certainly was not the case here, that is ultimately the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">I find that there has been no broad waiver of immunity by the University of Maryland as analyzed by <em>Stem, </em>and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>broad waiver from the general powers and duties that are explicated in 12-104 of the Education Article, for the reasons stated in <em>Stem.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">I find there may be\u2014there is a limited waiver for claims based on a breach of a written contract, which might permit such a common law contract claim to be filed, and that is in the State Government Article at 12-201, <em>et seq., </em>but specifically 12-202 provides that such a claim need to be filed within one year after later of date [sic] in which the claim arose, or the completion of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">Under any interpretation that would be May or June 2002. Thus the claim must have been filed no later than June of 2003 under any interpretation of that. It wasn\u2019t in fact filed until 2005. Therefore, because it wasn\u2019t timely filed it is barred by the limitations of sovereign immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ART\">Magnetti filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On October 27, 2006, the Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Magnetti\u2019s claims, holding that sovereign immunity barred the continuation of the action. <em>Magnetti, </em>171 Md.App. at 297, 909 A.2d at 1111-12. The intermediate appellate court held that Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b)(3) did not alone waive the University\u2019s sovereign immunity for Magnetti\u2019s claim because, under this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Stern v. Bd. of Regents, </em>380 Md. 691, 701, 846 A.2d 996 (2004), the General Assembly had not appropriated specific funds to satisfy judgments awarded in suits brought pursuant to that particular subsection. <em>Magnetti, </em>171 Md.App. at 288-89, 909 A.2d at 1106-07. The Court of Special Appeals also held that the amended language of Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a), requiring specific references to the University System in statutory restrictions on powers given to the Board of Regents, did not render the one-year limitations period of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 inoperable in contractual cases involving the University, because S.G. \u00a7 12-202 was not a restriction on the powers of the Board of Regents. <em>Magnetti, </em>171 Md.App. at 295-96, 909 A.2d at 1111. The Court reasoned that the prescribed limitations period in S.G. \u00a7 12-202 acted as a restriction on Magnetti as it required him to file his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>within the one-year period in order to effectuate a waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity. <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that because Magnetti filed his complaint outside the one-year period prescribed by S.G. \u00a7 12-202, he had failed to satisfy the condition precedent for the waiver of sovereign immunity under S.G. \u00a7 12-201. <em>Magnetti, </em>171 Md.App. at 297, 909 A.2d at 1111-12. The Court held that Magnetti\u2019s claim could not go forward. <em>Magnetti, </em>171 Md.App. at 297, 909 A.2d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Magnetti filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Court of Special Appeals denied. Shortly thereafter, Magnetti filed a petition for writ of certiorari. On April 11, 2007, we granted <em>certiorari. Magnetti v. University of Maryland, </em>398 Md. 314, 920 A.2d 1058 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The doctrine of sovereign immunity is firmly embedded in Maryland law, long recognized as applicable in actions\u2014contract, tort, or otherwise\u2014against the State of Maryland, its officers, and its units. <em>Stern v. Board of Regents, </em>380 Md. 691, 700, 846 A.2d 996, 1001 (2004) (\u201cThe doctrine of sovereign immunity has long been recognized as applicable in actions against the State of Maryland and its official representatives.\u201d); <em>Maryland State Highway Admin, v. Kim, </em>353 Md. 313, 333, 726 A.2d 238, 248 (1999) (\u201cWe have recognized, and continue to note that, in Maryland, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is applicable not only to the State itself, but also to its agencies and instrumentalities, unless the General Assembly has waived the immunity either directly or by necessary implication.\u201d); <em>ARA Health Servs. v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>344 Md. 85, 91, 685 A.2d 435, 438 (1996) (\u201cMaryland courts have long applied the doctrine of sovereign immunity in actions against the State.\u201d); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 492, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993) (\u201cThe doctrine [of sovereign immunity] is applicable to the State\u2019s agencies and instrumen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>talities, unless the legislature has explicitly or by implication waived governmental immunity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">This doctrine prohibits suits against the State or its entities absent its consent. <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources v. Welsh, </em>308 Md. 54, 58-59, 521 A.2d 313, 315 (1986). As we stated in <em>Stern, </em>\u201cwhen a governmental agency or actor can, and does, avail itself of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, no contract or tort suit can be maintained thereafter against it unless the General Assembly has specifically waived the doctrine.\u201d Ste<em>rn, </em>380 Md. at 701, 846 A.2d at 1001. Generally, we leave the questions of the general applicability and the scope of the doctrine to the General Assembly. <em>See Stern, </em>380 Md. at 700, 846 A.2d at 1001 (\u201cWe have emphasized that \u2018the dilution of the doctrine\u2019 of sovereign immunity should not be accomplished by the judiciary, and that any direct or implied diminution of the doctrine falls within the authority of the General Assembly.\u201d); <em>Welsh, </em>308 Md. at 59, 521 A.2d at 315 (\u201cThe General Assembly must waive immunity \u2018either directly or by necessary implication.\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also Austin v. City of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 69-71, 405 A.2d 255, 264-266 (1979) (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (explaining the legislative origins of sovereign immunity in Maryland as a rationale for the Court\u2019s continual treatment of the doctrine \u201cas a matter exclusively for the Legislature\u201d). It is within our prerogative, however, to determine whether the doctrine applies in a specific case, which we do by asking two questions: \u201c(1) whether the entity asserting immunity qualifies for the protection; and, if so, (2) whether the legislature has waived immunity either directly or by necessary implication, in a manner that would render the defense of immunity unavailable.\u201d <em>ARA Health Services, </em>344 Md. at 92, 685 A.2d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">It is well established that the University is considered to be an arm of the State Government for the purposes of the sovereign immunity doctrine. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 12-102(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 702, 846 A.2d at 1002; <em>Frankel v. Board of Regents, </em>361 Md. 298, 301, 761 A.2d 324, 325 (2000); <em>Maas, </em>173 Md. at 557, 197 A. at 124; <em>Pearson v. Murray, </em>169 Md. 478, 482, 182 A. 590, 592 (1936). Because the University qualifies as a \u201cunit\u201d of the State for the purposes of sovereign immunity, we must discern the extent of the University\u2019s statutory waiver of that immunity. Without a statutory waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity, Magnetti may not maintain his action against the University. The University acknowledges the waiver found in S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202, but asserts that Magnetti is barred from utilizing the waiver because he failed to satisfy the condition precedent of filing his contract claim within the prescribed one-year period. Magnetti claims, to the contrary, that a general waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity exists in Ed. \u00a7 12\u2014104(b). We agree with the University that S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 apply as a waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity and hold that sovereign immunity was not waived under the circumstances of this case. Therefore, Magnetti is not entitled to the claimed relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The Application of S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201, 12-202 and Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Magnetti contends that the Circuit Court erred in relying on S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 in dismissing his complaint with prejudice. Specifically, Magnetti contends that the 2004 amendment to Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) rendered the sovereign immunity provisions of S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 inoperable to the University. Magnetti explains the 2004 amendment to Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) \u201cplainly stated what has readily existed since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>creation of the Board of Regents in the Autonomy Act, that barring specific reference to the University System of Maryland, that matters that conflict with or restrict the Board of Regents\u2019 powers and duties, are not applicable\u201d to the University. He then reasons that S.G. \u00a7 12-202 is a restriction on the powers given under Ed. \u00a7 12\u2014104(b), specifically, the ability to \u2018sue or be sued\u2019 and the ability to \u2018enter into contracts of any kind\u2019 because (1) despite this Court\u2019s labeling S.G. \u00a7 12-202 as a condition precedent to the waiver of sovereign immunity, S.G. \u00a7 12-202 has been \u201ccommonly thought of and referred to as a statute of limitations,\u201d which is a synonym for <em>restriction; </em>and, (2) the one-year period detailed in S.G. \u00a7 12-202 \u201cconflicts] with and \u2018restrict^]\u2019 the regular three years corporate statute of limitations.\u201d Thus, Magnetti asserts that, for S.G. \u00a7 12-202 to be applicable to the University, the statutory language of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 has to specifically reference the University System of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Furthermore, Magnetti argues that \u201cnowhere in the [Ed. \u00a7 ] 12-104 did the Board of Regents and the Maryland legislature choose to create a limitation to contract claims through a sovereign immunity defense.\u201d Magnetti explains that the \u201ccomprehensive nature of [Ed. \u00a7 ] 12-104\u201d shows that the General Assembly did not intend to give the University sovereign immunity in contract claims. Specifically, Magnetti points to the express incorporation of the Maryland Tort Claim Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> into Ed. \u00a7 12-104(i), while noting that \u201cthere exists no [such] incorporation of the provisions of Title 12, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article.\u201d Magnetti suggests that the General Assembly purposefully excluded the incorporation of S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 to the Education Article because it \u201cintended in the plain text of [Ed. \u00a7 ] 12-104(b) that there should be no such limitations [against the University], [so] that common law contract causes of action do not fall under the restriction of [S.G.] \u00a7 12-202 when the offending actor is the University System of Maryland.\u201d Mag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>netti asserts that the general, three year statute of limitations period applies to his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The University counters that the 2004 amendment to Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) does not render S.G. \u00a7 12-202 inapplicable to the University. The University asserts that \u201cas the [Cjircuit [C]ourt correctly concluded, nothing in the language of the Education Article \u00a7 12-104(a) suggests that the legislature intended to override the common law principles of sovereign immunity that are preserved in State Government \u00a7 12-202.\u201d Rather, the University argues that both the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals found that \u201c \u2018the stated purpose\u2019 of the legislation w as to define \u2018the relationship between the Board of Regents and other state agencies.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, the University contends, Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) does not affect the applicability of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 to the University, and, as such, Magnetti was required to file his complaint against the University within the prescribed one-year period. The University maintains that Magnetti\u2019s complaint is thus barred by sovereign immunity because he failed to file within that one-year period. We agree with the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Title 12 of the State Government Article governs the liability of governmental entities, defining the scope and general applicability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Of particular interest to the case <em>sub judice, </em>Subtitle 2, entitled \u201cActions in Contract,\u201d defines the extent to which the State and/or its covered officers and units waive sovereign immunity in contract actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> S.G. \u00a7 12-201, entitled \u201cSovereign immunity defense barred,\u201d reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by a law of the State, the State, its officers, and its units may not raise the defense of sovereign immunity in a contract action, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>court of the State, based on a written contract that an official or employee executed for the State or 1 of its units while the official or employee was acting within the scope of the authority of the official or employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">S.G. \u00a7 12-202 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">A claim under this subtitle is barred unless the claimant files suit within 1 year after the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">(1) the date on which the claim arose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">(2) the completion of the contract that gives rise to the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Magnetti does not contest that S.G. \u00a7 12-201 applies to the University. Indeed, it is without question that the waiver of sovereign immunity applies and includes the University. In <em>Stem, </em>we held that S.G. \u00a7 12-201 was applicable to the University in the dispute over a tuition increase on the theory of a breach of contract, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">There is no doubt ... that the Board is considered to be an arm of the State Government for the purposes of asserting the defense of sovereign immunity. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1978, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-102 of the Education Article; <em>see also Frankel v. Board of Regents of University of Maryland System, </em>361 Md. 298, 301, 761 A.2d 324, 325 (2000) (recognizing that the University of Maryland, which is a part of the University System of Maryland, is an independent unit of the Maryland State government); <em>Maas, </em>173 Md. at 557, 197 A. at 124 (recognizing that the University of Maryland was a State actor for the purposes of sovereign immunity); <em>Pearson v. Murray, </em>169 Md. 478, 482, 182 A. 590 (1936) (holding that the University of Maryland Law School was a State agency). [T]he Board is clearly considered a State actor \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\"><em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 702, 846 A.2d at 1002 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 96, 862 A.2d 941, 957 (2004) (recognizing that claims over state employment contracts are subject to the one-year condition precedent set forth in S.G. \u00a7 12-202); <em>Frankel, </em>361 Md. at 308, 761 A.2d at 329 (noting that Frankel\u2019s claim of a tuition overcharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>against the University of Maryland was not barred by S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 because Frankel filed with the one-year prescribed period).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">As explained above, Magnetti disputes the applicability of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 to the University on the basis of the 2004 amendment to Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a). Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a), as amended in 2004, now reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">In addition to any other powers granted and duties imposed by this title, and subject to the provisions of Title 11 of this article and any other restriction imposed by law by specific reference to the University System of Maryland, or by any trust agreement involving a pledge of property or money, the Board of Regents has the powers and duties set forth in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We find this argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">First, in <em>State v. Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. 129, 148, 149, 854 A.2d 1208, 1219 (2004), Judge Wilner, writing for this Court, explained that S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 were \u201cintended as a conditional waiver of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity in contract actions,\u201d and <em>\u201cmust be read together.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Specifically, \u201cSection 12-201 precludes the State and its agencies from raising the defense of sovereign immunity in a contract action \u201cin a court <em>of </em>the State,\u201d meaning a court that is part of the Maryland judiciary. <em>Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. at 149, 854 A.2d at 1219. We ultimately held that \u201c[S.G.] \u00a7 12-202 is not a mere statute of limitations but sets forth a condition to the action itself.\u201d As Judge Wilner pointed out, \u201c[t]he waiver of the State\u2019s immunity vanishes at the end of the one-year period [specified in S.G. \u00a7 12-202], and an action filed thereafter is ... [barred].\u201d <em>Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. at 148-49, 854 A.2d at 1219. Therefore, it is clear that S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 must be read together in order to understand the limitation and/or condition of the University\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In addition, a plain reading of the statutory provisions suggests that Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) does not affect the applicability of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 to the instant matter. By its plain terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) is applicable only to those restrictions affecting the powers and duties of the Board of Regents. S.G. \u00a7 12-202, however, places upon the claimant, not the University System of Maryland, the condition precedent for bringing a contract claim against the State and/or its covered units or officers. Therefore, we hold that S.G. \u00a7 12-202 is not a restriction placed upon the University and thereby does not implicate Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a). On the contrary, S.G. \u00a7 12-202 is a statutory requirement applicable only to claimants seeking relief against the State through a contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">By its plain language, Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) extends to the Board of Regents every duty and power set forth in Title 12 of the Education Article, including those delineated in Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b), subject to (1) any and all restrictions set forth in Title 11 of the Education Article, (2) any trust agreements involving a pledge of property or money, and (3) any other restriction imposed by law. Notably, the statutory language further requires that any restriction outside those in Title 11 of the Education Article and in covered trust agreements must specifically reference the University System to be applicable to the University System of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005), we discussed statutory interpretation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">In construing the plain language, \u201c[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with force d or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d Statutory text \u201c \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">If statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">(Internal citations omitted). We have also stated that this Court must read and \u201cconstrue legislative dilution of governmental immunity narrowly in order to avoid weakening the doctrine of sovereign immunity by judicial fiat.\u201d <em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 720, 846 A.2d at 1012-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">When read narrowly, S.G. \u00a7 12-202 is clear and unambiguous in its purpose. In plain language, S.G. \u00a7 12-202 bars a claimant from seeking relief against the State or its covered officers or units in a contract action if the claimant does not file his or her claim within one year of the claim\u2019s accrual date. S.G. \u00a7 12-202 clearly places the burden of effectuating a waiver of sovereign immunity on the claimant, as it is the claimant who must file within one year of the claim\u2019s accrual date to enjoy the waiver of sovereign immunity. As we stated in <em>Sharafeldin, </em>\u201c[S.G.] \u00a7 12-202 is not a mere statute of limitations [which can be waived] but sets forth a condition to the action itself.\u201d <em>Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. at 148-49, 854 A.2d at 1219. In our view, S.G. \u00a7 12-202 does not explicitly or by implication affect the University\u2019s ability to sue or be sued because no restriction is placed upon the Board of Regents or the University. Therefore, we hold that the statutory requirements contained in Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) do not affect the applicability of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 to the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">As a secondary argument, Magnetti contends that the \u201cCourt of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion fails to properly consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision\u201d in <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 909 A.2d 694 (2006). Magnetti argues that, like the case before this Court in <em>Anderson, </em>there are two competing and conflicting statutes at play in the case <em>sub </em>judice\u2014the specific statute Ed. \u00a7 12-104 and the general statute S.G. \u00a7 12-202. Magnetti then quotes the following language from <em>Anderson </em>to argue that, as the more specific statute, Ed. \u00a7 12-104 overrules the applicability of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 to the instant matter: \u201cIt is well settled that when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 194, 909 A.2d at 707 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Magnetti asserts that his claim, as a \u201ccommon law breach of contract action under <em>Towson University v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 862 A.2d 941 (2004),\u201d enjoys a three year limitations period. We disagree with Magnetti\u2019s assessment of the conflict and find <em>Anderson </em>inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In <em>Anderson, </em>this Court examined the interplay between competing and conflicting statutes, namely, the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights (\u201cLEOBR\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, and the state Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 176-77, 909 A.2d at 696. Specifically, we were called upon to examine \u201cwhether a[n administrative bjoard\u2019s finding of \u2018not guilty\u2019 entitles the [Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning] Commission to seek judicial review of that decision under the LEOBR or the APA\u201d and, if it did, to \u201cdetermine if the judicial review provisions of the APA conflicted] \"with the judicial review provisions of the LEOBR.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 181, 909 A.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In reviewing the statutory language of both the LEOBR and the APA, we determined that the two statutes conflicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>as to whether the Commission could seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision\u2014that is, a not guilty finding. <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 192-93, 909 A.2d at 706. We read the LEOBR to contain specific and strict requirements for judicial review, namely, a \u201cguilty\u201d finding from the administrative board and a final order from the Chief or his designee regarding the penalty for the officer\u2019s conduct. <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 188, 909 A.2d at 703. We then noted that the APA normally permits an agency to seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision. <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 192-93, 909 A.2d at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Because we found the statutes to conflict as to whether the Commission could seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision, we were required to determine which statute was controlling in that case. In doing so, we set forth the following statement of law regarding conflicting statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u201d <em>Ghajari, </em>346 Md. at 116, 695 A.2d at 150 (citing <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 63, 507 A.2d 172, 180 (1986)). In <em>Ghajari, </em>we stated that when the statutes conflict, \u201cthe specific statute is controlling and the general statute is repealed to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d <em>Ghajari, </em>346 Md. at 116, 695 A.2d at 150. In such a case, \u201cthe court should give effect to the specific statute in its entirety and should retain as much of the general statute as is reasonably possible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"><em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 194, 909 A.2d at 707. We concluded that the LEOBR was the controlling statute as it provided exclusive administrative remedies for law enforcement officers and thus superseded any conflicting provision of the APA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Anderson, </em>395 Md. at 195, 909 A.2d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>As explained above, we conclude that the plain language of S.G. \u00a7 12-202 and Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) do not conflict. Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a), in essence, defines the relationship between the Board of Regents and other state agencies and delineates the statutory limits of the Board of Regents\u2019 powers and duties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> S.G. \u00a7 12-202, on the other hand, is a statutory requirement, a condition precedent, applicable only to claimants seeking relief against the State (or its covered officers or units) through a contract claim. S.G. \u00a7 12-202 does not act to implicate the powers or duties of the Board of Regents or the University System of Maryland. Because S.G. \u00a7 12-202 and Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) do not conflict or compete in their provisions regarding the University\u2019s sovereign immunity, we do not find our analysis in <em>Anderson </em>applicable to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In sum, we hold that S.G. \u00a7 12-202 is the applicable condition precedent to the bringing of a contract-based cause of action against the State and/or a covered unit or employee. Magnetti does not contest that his complaint was filed outside the one-year period prescribed in S.G. \u00a7 12-202. Indeed, the Circuit Court docket indicates that Magnetti filed his complaint on June 13, 2005, nearly three years after his claim against the University arose. Failure to satisfy the condition precedent results in the dismissal of the action as the State has retained its immunity from such suits. <em>Sharafeldin, </em>382 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Md. at 148, 854 A.2d at 1219 (2004). Because he filed the complaint outside the one-year time period, he did not satisfy the condition precedent for a waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The Provisions of Ed. \u00a7 12-104 (b)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">As his alternative basis, Magnetti contends that four provisions of Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b), when read together, wholly waive the University\u2019s sovereign immunity in contract actions for teachers with common law claims of breach of contract\u2014Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b)(1), (3), (5) and (8).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, Magnetti argues that Ed. \u00a7 12\u2014104(b)(1), in discussing how the University can exercise its statutorily-granted corporate powers, stresses the nongovernmental nature of many of the functions of the University and illustrates the ability of others to deal with the University on an equitable basis in the exercise of these powers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>without the University\u2019s use of sovereign immunity. These corporate powers include the powers to sue and be sued, complain and defend actions in court, make contracts and guarantees, and incur liabilities and borrow money. With regard to Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b)(3) and Ed. \u00a7 12\u2014104(b)(5), Magnetti argues that this Court held in <em>Frankel </em>that these provisions waive the University\u2019s sovereign immunity in contract actions concerning its statutory duties and obligations. Lastly, Magnetti contends that \u201c[Ed.] \u00a7 12\u2014104(b)(8) underscores how the University System of Maryland, due to its corporate nature, has many available options in paying off judgments and suits,\u201d including \u201c \u2018borrowing] money from any source for any corporate purpose ... and contracting] with or engaging] the services of any person in connection with any financing, including financial instructions, issuers of credit, or insurers.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The University counters that Magnetti\u2019s reliance on <em>Frankel </em>is misplaced as this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stem </em>clarified Ed. \u00a7 12\u2014104(b)(3)\u2019s role in waiving the University\u2019s sovereign immunity. The University asserts that <em>Stem </em>made it clear that Ed. \u00a7 12\u2014104(b)(3) alone was insufficient to waive the University\u2019s sovereign immunity because, under <em>Maas </em>and <em>Ruff, </em>actions requesting a monetary judgment must set forth both an express statutory waiver of sovereign immunity and the availability of funds to satisfy an adverse judgment. The University argues that Magnetti \u201cis unable to show that funds have been appropriated for the purpose of satisfying adverse judgments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We need not address this issue as Magnetti has clearly failed to satisfy the necessary condition precedent for the waiver of the University\u2019s sovereign immunity. It is clear that the instant matter falls within the coverage of S.G. \u00a7 12-201. Indeed, neither the University nor Magnetti has ever argued that the instant matter falls outside the coverage of S.G. \u00a7 12-201. So long as an action against the State and/or its covered officers or units, including the University, falls within the applicability of S.G. \u00a7 12-201, the claimant must fulfill the condition precedent set forth in S.G. \u00a7 12-202 in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>effectuate the waiver of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is true regardless of the express statutory waiver relied on by the claimant in his or her contract claim against the State and/or its covered officers or units. A claimant may not choose to disregard the requirements for a waiver of sovereign immunity under S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-202 in favor of another statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, if S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 is applicable to his or her claim. We believe that to do otherwise would negate our duty to read and construe overlapping statutes together and in harmony. <em>See Gwin v.

In 1976, the General Assembly first addressed the State's use of the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity in contract actions. <em>See </em>1976 Md. Laws, Ch. 450. Concerned, in part, about the moral implications of the State\u2019s use of the common law doctrine in contract actions, the General Assembly sought to waive the State\u2019s and its political subdivisions\u2019 sovereign immunity, subject to certain conditions and limitations. <em>Id. </em>(\"The Governor\u2019s Commission to Study Sovereign Immunity believes that there exists a moral obligation on the part of any contracting party, including the State or its political subdivisions, to fulfill the obligations of a contract[.]\u201d).

On July 1, 1981, the statutory language of Article 41, Section 10A was transferred without substantive change to Article 21, Sections 7-101 and 7-102. 1980 Md. Laws, Ch. 775, \u00a7 8.

In 1984, the General Assembly, in enacting the State Government Article, recodified Article 21, \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 &amp; 7-102 without substantive change as Section 12-201, <em>et seq. </em>1984 Md.

Ed. \u00a7 12-104(a) was amended in 2004 to clarify the law regarding the governance of the University System of Maryland after similar language was enacted for St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland in 2003. Senate Bill 738, which contained the amendment, provided the following purpose for the amendment: \"providing that the authority of the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland may not be superseded by any State agency or office in certain management affairs except by a provision of law that specifically references the University System of Maryland.\u201d It is clear from the purpose of the amendment that the General Assembly intended to clarify the University System of Maryland's relationship with other state agencies as it gave the University System of Maryland more autonomy in the management of its affairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">.

Magnetti points to <em>Frankel </em>for support of his contention that the provisions of Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b), when read together, waive the University\u2019s sovereign immunity in contract actions concerning matters within the scope of the University's statutory duties and obligations. It is clear from our analysis in <em>Stern, </em>however, that the <em>Frankel </em>Court\u2019s use of Ed. \u00a7 12-104(b)(3) to find a wavier of sovereign immunity, without a discussion of the matter\u2019s application to S.G. \u00a7 12-201, is limited to the facts of that case, namely, a contract action to recover tuition overcharges. Ste<em>rn, </em>380 Md. at 710, 846 A.2d at 1007. It was not necessary for this Court, in <em>Frankel, </em>to determine whether S.G. \u00a7 12-201 applied to Mr. Frankel\u2019s claim against the University because, \"there was legislation enabling the Board to adopt a policy regarding residency reclassifications and an express policy adopted by the Board pursuant to that authority relating to residency reclassifications and refunds of tuition sums\u201d in necessary instances. <em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 710, 846 A.2d at 1007. Nevertheless, we noted in <em>Frankel </em>that \"[e]ven if the only basis for [Mr. Frankel\u2019s] claim were the general waiver of governmental immunity in contract actions ..., [Mr. Frankel]\u2019s claim would not [have been] barred by the one year period of limitations in [S.G. \u00a7 ] 12-202.\u201d <em>Frankel, </em>361 Md. at 308, 761 A.2d at 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
