On judicial review, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Circuit Court affirmed the decision, as did the Court of Special Appeals on appeal. We are now asked to decide whether notice mailed to the insured, \u201ccare of\u2019 a third party listed in the declarations page, constitutes proper notice sufficient to meet the statutory notice requirements. We shall hold that, because the terms of the insurance contract at issue provided a \u201cmailing address\u201d for the insured, written notice of intent to cancel the insurance policy mailed to that address complied with the statutory notice requirements for cancellation of the policy. Furthermore, because the insured consented to the designation of a third party as his agent to receive such notification or at least acquiesced in the designation, notice sent to that third party, consistent with the terms of the insurance contract, is proper notice. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Mark W. Anderson is the owner of an Exxon gasoline and service station located in Ocean City, Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Throughout the 26 years Anderson has operated the business, he has used the services of Benjamin F. Brown Insurance Agency, Inc. (\u201cBrown\u201d) to procure insurance for the gasoline and service station. When Anderson needed insurance coverage for automobile, towing, and road services, he contacted Brown. Because Brown could not directly procure insurance for these types of activities, Brown contacted Ashcraft &amp; Associates Insurance Agency, Inc., which placed the insurance with Southern Guarantee Insurance Company. Southern Guarantee then issued Anderson\u2019s Exxon a Commercial Garage Liability Policy with renewal effective dates of June 1, 2002, to June 1, 2008. The declarations page of the policy listed the Named Insured and Mailing Address as:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Anderson\u2019s Exxon/JSM Ent. Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>c/o Ben Brown Insurance Agency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiB\">304 Compton Avenue Laurel, Maryland 20707-4330</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Anderson received a copy of the policy from Brown, including the declarations page, via U.S. Mail. Anderson did not dispute the use of Brown\u2019s mailing address as his point of contact. Because the premiums for Anderson\u2019s policy were based on the size of his payroll, Southern Guaranty attempted to conduct a financial audit of Anderson\u2019s Exxon business, through Profitworks, an outside audit company. Compliance with the audit was a condition of the policy, and if Anderson failed to comply with the audit condition, Southern Guaranty was permitted to cancel the policy in compliance with statutory notice requirements of Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 27-601 of the Insurance Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, when South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ern Guaranty did not receive any response to its inquiries regarding Anderson\u2019s payroll,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it issued a notice of cancellation for failure to comply with the audit provision. On January 16, 2003, Southern Guaranty mailed the notice, addressed to Anderson\u2019s Exxon c/o Ben Brown\u2019s Insurance Agency, at the address listed in the declarations page. The cancellation was effective March 4, 2003. On March 17, 2003, Southern Guaranty mailed Anderson a check for the unearned insurance premiums on the cancelled policy. The refund check was also sent to the address listed in the declarations, even though Southern Guaranty was aware of Anderson\u2019s business address in Ocean City. The refund check was eventually cashed by Anderson\u2019s Exxon.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">As a result of an accident.that occurred on July 24, 2003, a third party filed a personal injury claim against Anderson\u2019s Exxon. When Southern Guaranty received the claim, it informed the claimant that the policy had been cancelled. Anderson then filed a Complaint with the Maryland Insurance Administration alleging that Southern Guaranty had improperly cancelled the policy because it had no t provided him with the required notice. The Maryland Insurance Administration conducted an investigation, and determined that the cancellation was proper because Southern Guaranty provided proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Anderson requested a hearing, and the matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings. After a hearing on the matter, the Administrative Law Judge affirmed the decision of the Maryland Insurance Administration. The Administrative Law Judge found that \u201cthe Licensee sent a notice of cancellation of policy 00CPP56144 to the Complainant\u2019s address as stated on the policy.\u201d Based on this and other findings of fact, the Administrative Law Judge concluded as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>matter of law that Southern Guaranty complied with the statutory requirements. Anderson filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. After a hearing, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Administrative Law Judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Anderson appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cit was a factual question to determine whether notice to Brown under section 27-601[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] constituted notice to Anderson because Brown was Anderson\u2019s agent.\u201d Because the Court of Special Appeals determined that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings were supported by the evidentiary record, it upheld the Circuit Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Thereafter, Anderson filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court, which petition we granted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Anderson v. General Casualty, </em>399 Md. 592, 925 A.2d 632 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Petitioner argues that Southern Guaranty was required to provide notice to Anderson directly, and that sending the notice of cancellation to Brown did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 27-601 of the Insurance Article, currently \u00a7 27-602. As support for his position, the petitioner cites <em>Admiral Ins. Co. v. John Stromberg &amp; Assocs., </em>77 Md.App. 726, 551 A.2d 923 (1989), in which the court wrote: \u201c[Tlhe statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>intended to benefit the individual insureds by giving them advance notice that their policy was going to be cancelled or non-renewed and affording them a reasonable opportunity to replace that insurance.\u201d <em>Admiral, </em>77 Md.App. at 739, 551 A.2d at 930. Petitioner attempts to bolster his position by arguing that the legislature must have intended that the insurer personally notify the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Petitioner further argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it found that \u201cthere was substantial evidence ... to support the agency\u2019s findings.\u201d According to Petitioner, the issue in this case is purely a question of law, and therefore Petitioner asserts that the Court of Special Appeals should have substituted its judgment for that of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Respondent argues that because the agency\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence, we should defer to its decision. Furthermore, Respondent maintains that it complied with the notice requirements by mailing the notice of cancellation to the insured, at the address listed in the declarations. In support of its position, Respondent argues that Brown was acting as Anderson\u2019s agent for purposes of procuring insurance and receiving insurance notices, and therefore sending notice to Anderson\u2019s agent fulfilled the requirements of the statute. Finally, Respondent posits that the public policy interests that Petitioners allude to were met when Southern Guaranty mailed the notice of cancellation to Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The present case comes to this Court on review of an administrative agency decision. When this Court reviews a decision of an administrative agency, we take the same posture as the circuit court or the intermediate appellate court, and limit our review to the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Watkins v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>377 Md. 34, 45-46, 831 A.2d 1079, 1086 (2003). In general, review of administrative agency decisions is narrow. <em>Id. </em>With respect to findings of fact, we must determine whether the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Mullan, </em>381 Md. 157, 164, 848 A.2d 642, 646 (2004). As to conclusions of law, we give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>significant weight to an agency\u2019s experience in interpreting a statute the agency administers. <em>John A. v. Bd. of Educ. for Howard County, </em>400 Md. 363, 382, 929 A.2d 136, 147 (2007). Nonetheless, if an agency has made an erroneous conclusion of law, it is our duty to correct that conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Maryland law requires that an insurance provider send notice of the intention to cancel, \u201cto the insured,\u201d at least 45 days before it intends to cancel a policy. Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.VoL), \u00a7 27-601 of the Insurance Article, now \u00a7 27-602. We are asked in the case at bar to interpret the meaning of the phrase \u201cto the insured.\u201d The guiding principle of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Sprenger v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>400 Md. 1, 29, 926 A.2d 238, 254 (2007). If the language of the statute, construed in light of its plain meaning, is unambiguous, our analysis ends there. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 926 A.2d at 254-55. Because we determine that the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, in that it requires an insurer to notify \u201cthe insured,\u201d we need not look to outside sources for further evidence of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Admiral </em>is misplaced because its language merely confirms the legislative intent, which is undisputed. <em>Admiral </em>clarifies the intent of the statute at issue by declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Clearly, the statute was intended to benefit the individual insureds, by giving them advance notice that their policy was going to be cancelled or nonrenewed and affording them a reasonable opportunity to replace that insurance, either through another company or through the \u201cfacility\u201d then in existence for insuring substandard risks. It was also, we think, for the public benefit; by affording individual insureds this opportunity to replace their insurance and thus continue their coverage, the statute reduced the risk of injury to innocent victims by uninsured motorists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Admiral, </em>77 Md.App. at 739, 551 A.2d at 930. Petitioner is correct in asserting that the legislative intent is to notify the insured of a potential cancellation; however, Petitioner over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>looks that we cannot apply the statute in a vacuum. We consider the context in which the question of statutory notice arises. Moreover, as to context and factual predicate, <em>Admiral </em>is factually distinguishable, in that the insurer in <em>Admiral </em>never sent any notice to the insured, at any address. <em>Admiral, </em>77 Md.App. at 735, 551 A.2d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Turning to the question of notice, in the context of the terms of the insurance policy at hand, we hold that Southern Guaranty met its obligations under the statute by mailing notice to Anderson at Brown\u2019s address. We begin our analysis with the well-settled principle that, under Maryland law, an insurance policy is a contract. <em>Moscarillo v. Prof'l Risk Mgmt. Servs., Inc., </em>398 Md. 529, 540, 921 A.2d 245, 251 (2007); <em>United Servs. Auto Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 79, 899 A.2d 819, 833 (2006); <em>Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. v. Zelinski, </em>393 Md. 83, 88, 899 A.2d 835, 838 (2006). Because the insurance policy is a contract, it is to be interpreted under the principles of contract law, which require that a contract be interpreted as a whole, in accordance with the objective law of contracts, to determine its character and purpose. <em>Riley, </em>393 Md. at 79, 899 A.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Southern Guaranty was aware of Anderson\u2019s Exxon\u2019s physical location in Ocean City. The very purpose of the insurance contract, however, was to insure activities that were taking place at that location, making disclosure of the Ocean City location to Southern Guaranty necessary as the location of the activities to be insured. The use of Brown\u2019s address in the declarations page, indeed under the heading \u201cMailing Address,\u201d indicates the parties\u2019 mutual intent to use that address as Anderson\u2019s mailing address. Considering the contract as a whole, it is clear that the Ocean City location was merely the place to be insured, and that the parties intended Brown\u2019s address to be used as the mailing address for Anderson\u2019s Exxon. Because Southern Guaranty mailed the notice of cancellation to the \u201cMailing Address\u201d designated in the insurance policy, it fulfilled its obligations under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>To interpret an insurance contract otherwise would not only contradict its overall purpose but also would be unduly burdensome to insurance companies. Petitioner would have the insurer comb through pages of documents and mail the notice to any address mentioned in the contract, regardless of its purpose, within the context of the contract. This interpretation ignores the probability that many addresses may be listed in an insurance contract for purposes other than listing a mailing address.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Whether Anderson directed that Brown\u2019s address be written into the contract or otherwise caused it to be so written is immaterial to this analysis because Anderson consented to using Brown as his agent for purposes of procuring insurance and receiving notices concerning insurance policies. An agency relationship is one that arises from the manifestation of the principal to the agent that the agent will act on the principal\u2019s behalf. <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 373, 765 A.2d 587, 593 (2001). Although such a relationship is not always contractual in nature, it must be consensual. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, a reviewing court must determine that there was an intent to enter into an agency relationship. <em>Id. </em>That intent may be inferred from conduct, including acquiescence. <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 506, 735 A.2d 1039, 1049 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In this case, the Administrative Law Judge found that Anderson had used Brown, for 26 years, to obtain Anderson\u2019s insurance policies, receive notices, and provide him with copies. Anderson received a copy of the policy, including the declarations page. Anderson is presumed to know the contents of the contract he received, at least the declarations page. Upon receipt, Anderson apparently never questioned the use of Brown\u2019s mailing address listed in the declarations page, despite presumably knowing he could change it if he chose to do so. Together, these facts, and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, indicate Anderson\u2019s consent to appoint Brown as his agent for his insurance needs, including receiving notices on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>One of the general principles of an agency relationship is that the \u201cknowledge of the agent is knowledge of the principal.\u201d <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund Bd. v. Fortney, </em>264 Md. 246, 255, 285 A.2d 641, 646 (1972). Where the matter is one that falls within the agent\u2019s scope of authority, the principal is charged with that knowledge. <em>See Fortney, </em>264 Md. at 255-56, 285 A.2d at 646. Because Anderson intended to appoint Brown as his agent for purposes of procuring insurance and receiving related notices, and Brown did actually receive notice within the scope of that agency, Anderson is charged with knowledge of the notice of cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Because we determine that the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, in that it requires insurers to send notice \u201cto the insured,\u201d we need not look any further to determine legislative intent. Looking at the insurance contract as a whole, we hold that because Southern Guaranty mailed the notice of cancellation to the \u201cMailing Address\u201d designated in the policy, such notice was sufficient for Southern Guaranty to properly cancel the insurance. Furthermore, Anderson\u2019s actions demonstrate an intent to appoint Brown as his agent for purposes of receiving such notices, and as such Anderson is charged with knowledge of the cancellation. Because there is substantial evidence supporting the agency\u2019s findings of fact, and the agency made no error of law in reaching its decision, the agency\u2019s decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
