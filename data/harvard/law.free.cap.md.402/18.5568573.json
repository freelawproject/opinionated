Before we may reach that issue, however, we must confront whether the Circuit Court appropriately entertained, under the common law collateral order doctrine, the interlocutory appeal taken by Hudson\u2019s landlord, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, from the District Court\u2019s ruling that limited discovery was permitted. Although we shall conclude that the collateral order doctrine does not justify that interlocutory appeal, as that doctrine is of extremely limited application in the resolution of discovery disputes, given the import of the merits of the certiorari question, we shall address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>substantive issue, albeit as considered dicta. It is our view that Maryland Rule 3-711<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not exclude in \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d actions brought in the District Court the limited discovery allowed under Maryland Rule 3-401(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The material facts are undisputed. Petitioner, Charles Hudson, resides in the Latrobe Housing Development, a subsidized housing project in Baltimore City. On 30 September 2005, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC), Respondent, which owns and operates more than ten thousand dwelling units in Baltimore City, including the Latrobe Housing Development, received a copy of a police report implicating Hudson in the alleged commission of a crime in his rental unit. The point of departure for the police report was that a suspect (not Hudson) carrying drugs ran into Hudson\u2019s dwelling. When police pursued the suspect, they reportedly observed in Hudson\u2019s rental unit a large, clear jar of drugs being used as a leg to support a bed. As a result, on 22 May 2006, HABC filed a form \u201cComplaint and Summons Against Tenant in Breach of Lease,\u201d under Maryland Code (2003), Real Property Article, \u00a7 8-402.1, in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City. The complaint alleged that the above facts constituted the breach of several lease covenants prohibiting illegal and drug-related activities in the dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Trial was set for 12 June 2006. On 6 June 2006, Hudson, through counsel, served written interrogatories on HABC seeking the limited discovery afforded in District Court cases under Maryland Rule 3-401 (a). The next day, Hudson sought a continuance of the trial to allow time for HABC to respond to the discovery request. A continuance of the trial date to after 18 August 2006 was granted on 12 June.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the same day, HABC filed a motion to strike the interrogatories on the ground that Maryland Rule 3-711 prohibits discovery in summary ejectment actions in the District Court. The court denied HABC\u2019s motion, ruling that Rule 3-711 does not apply to \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d cases. On 15 September 2006, the court also denied HABC\u2019s effort seeking reconsideration of its ruling having the effect of allowing the discovery initiative by Hudson.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">HABC appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on 25 September 2006 the District Court\u2019s interlocutory ruling as to discovery, ostensibly in accordance with Maryland Code, Real Property Article, \u00a7 8-402.1(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, HABC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>claimed that the District Court\u2019s discovery ruling was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine and incorrect as a matter of law. The Circuit Court considered the matter on the record made in the District Court. After oral argument, the Circuit Court ruled that the appeal was taken properly under the collateral order doctrine. The Court further held that Rule 3-711 prohibited discovery in \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d cases in the District Court and, thus, reversed the District Court\u2019s ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Hudson successfully petitioned us for a Writ of Certiorari. We shall consider de novo the Circuit Court\u2019s allowance of the interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine and its denial of discovery in a \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d case brought in the District Court, both purely legal determinations. <em>Pickett v. Sears, Roebuck, and Co., </em>365 Md. 67, 77, 775 A.2d 1218, 1223 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We address, first, whether the District Court\u2019s allowance of limited discovery, over HABC\u2019s protest, was immediately appealable to the Circuit Court under the common law collateral order doctrine. We hold that it whs not.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The general proposition in Maryland is that \u201cto be appealable an order or judgment ordinarily must be final.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>358 Md. 259, 266, 747 A.2d 1199, 1202 (2000). Appellate jurisdiction may not be exercised over a judgment considered interlocutory unless it falls within one of three delineated exceptions. <em>See Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 615, 881 A.2d 660, 666 (2005). Appeals from certain types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>interlocutory orders specifically are allowed by certain statute; immediate appeals are authorized from actions taken pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602; and, appeals from interlocutory rulings are allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine. <em>Id. </em>The first and second exceptions are not implicated in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The collateral order doctrine permits a reviewing appellate court to treat as final, without consideration of the procedural posture of a case, a \u201cnarrow\u201d class of interlocutory orders in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 561-62, 914 A.2d 783, 791 (2007); <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587, 591 (2003). We have applied gingerly this doctrine to review actions completely separate from the merits of the litigation based on a \u201cperceived necessity\u201d of immediate appellate review. <em>Ehrlich, </em>396 Md. at 562, 914 A.2d at 791 (quoting <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>376 Md. 53, 64, 827 A.2d 115, 121 (2003)). Of greatest import here, however, \u201c \u2018[t]his Court has consistently held that discovery orders, being interlocutory in nature, are not ordinarily appealable prior to a final judgment terminating the case in the trial court.... \u2019 [Generally such orders do not meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. at 634, 820 A.2d at 591-92 (quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 477, 654 A.2d 877, 880 (1995)). Only in the special circumstances where a litigant seeks to probe the individual thought process of a high level government official, acting in an administrative or investigatory decisional capacity, have we sanctioned immediate review of a trial court\u2019s disposition of a discovery dispute under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Ehrlich, </em>396 Md. at 572, 914 A.2d at 797 (\u201c[A]n interlocutory appeal is appropriate under these extraordinary circumstances involving discovery orders directed to a high government official.\u201d); <em>Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 477-79, 654 A.2d at 879-81; <em>Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 210, 477 A.2d 759, 764 (1984) (\u201cWe reiterate, however, that our holding is a narrow one. Thus discovery orders, directed at other than high level government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>decision makers, are ordinarily not appealable in accordance with the general rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The collateral order doctrine may apply when a decision of the lower court meets four conjunctive and strictly construed elements. <em>Ehrlich, </em>396 Md. at 563, 914 A.2d at 792. If an interlocutory decision \u201c(1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue, (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, and (4) would be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment,\u201d then the collateral order doctrine applies. <em>Id., </em>914 A.2d at 791. Even were we to assume, for the sake of argument, that the District Court\u2019s decision to allow limited discovery in the present \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d case conclusively determined whether the interplay between Maryland Rules 3-401(a) and 3-711 permitted such discovery, and that such a determination resolved an important issue, we nevertheless would conclude that the District Court\u2019s discovery ruling met neither the third nor the fourth criterion of an immediately appealable collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Indeed, \u201c[mjost discovery orders do not comply with the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine, as they generally are not completely separate from the merits of the lawsuit. Instead a typical discovery order is aimed at ascertaining critical facts upon which the outcome of the controversy might depend.\u201d <em>Addison v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 138, 156, 917 A.2d 1200, 1211 (2007) (quoting <em>St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Associates, P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 87, 896 A.2d 304, 311 (2006); <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. at 635, 820 A.2d at 587). Obviously, interrogatories inquiring into the underlying factual grounding of HABC\u2019s claim that Hudson breached his lease are critical to the ultimate determination of whether a breach occurred. Thus, the third requirement of an immediately appealable collateral order is not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Finally, \u201cdiscovery orders fail to meet the collateral order doctrine\u2019s fourth element as they are effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. A party aggrieved by a discovery order and aggrieved by the final judgment may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>challenge the discovery ruling on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc., </em>392 Md. at 87, 896 A.2d at 311 (2006); <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. at 635, 820 A.2d at 587). \u201cIt is a long established principle of appellate procedure, now embodied in Rule 8-131(d), that an appeal from a final judgment ordinarily brings up for appellate review all [other] orders in the case.\u201d <em>B &amp; K Rentals and Sales Co. v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., </em>319 Md. 127, 132-33, 571 A.2d 1213, 1216 (1990); <em>accord Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 476-77, 654 A.2d at 879 (1995) (\u201cMaryland Rule 8-131(d) provides that, on appeal from an order constituting a final judgment, other orders, even if interlocutory, are generally reviewable by the appellate court.\u201d). The rare circumstances occurring in the \u201chigh-level, government official exception\u201d explored in <em>Ehrlich, Stevens, </em>and <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>where requiring disclosure seriously could disrupt administrative governance, do not exist here. We thus hold that the Circuit Court incorrectly applied the collateral order doctrine to endorse its review of the District Court\u2019s Order allowing discovery in the underlying \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Despite the inappropriate path by which this case reaches us, we are persuaded that the merits are worthy of comment. Maryland Rule 8-131 provides that this Court \u201cmay decide ... an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense or delay of another appeal.\u201d The record suggests that there is some division among some judges of Maryland\u2019s District Court and various of its Circuit Courts concerning the proper application of Maryland Rules 3-401(a) and 3-711 in \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d actions. In addition, given that the HABC\u2019s action here was stayed pending disposition of this appeal, our determination of the issue will enable that action to proceed more expeditiously than were we to wait for the issue to arrive at our doorstep after a trial and subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u201cMaryland\u2019s discovery rules were deliberately designed to be broad and comprehensive in scope.\u201d <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 560, 914 A.2d 783, 790 (2007) (citing <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 13, 174 A.2d 768, 771 (1961)). Broad and comprehensive rules eliminate, \u201cas far as possible, the necessity of any party to litigation going to trial in a confused or muddled state of mind, concerning the facts that gave rise to litigation.\u201d <em>Grove, </em>396 Md. at 560, 914 A.2d at 790 (quoting <em>Kelch v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>287 Md. 223, 229, 411 A.2d 449, 453 (1980); <em>Klein v. Weiss, </em>284 Md. 36, 55, 395 A.2d 126, 137 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Civil procedure in the District Court of Maryland is governed by Title 3 of the Maryland Rules. Chapter 400 of that Title governs discovery. Maryland Rule 3-401, entitled \u201cGeneral provisions regarding discovery,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Title, a party may obtain discovery by written interrogatories and, if a written stipulation is filed in the action, by deposition upon oral examination or written questions.\u201d Maryland Rule 3-421(b) clarifies that, \u201c[u]nless the court orders otherwise, a party may serve only one set of not more than 15 interrogatories____\u201d Thus, the rules generally entitle a civil litigant in District Court to limited discovery through 15 interrogatories served upon his, her, or its opponent. Maryland Rule 3-711 provides in pertinent part, however, that \u201cno pretrial discovery under Chapter 400 of this Title shall be permitted in ... an action for summary ejectment, wrongful detainer, or distress for rent, or an action involving tenants holding over\u201d in District Court. A \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d action is not part of the itemized exclusions in Rule 3-711. Therein lies the tension giving rise to the current dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Relevant defining provisions of the Maryland Code closely track the causes of action described in Maryland Rule 3-711. The Real Property Article, originally enacted by Chapter 12 of the Acts of 1974, consists of 15 Titles. Title 8 of the Article governs landlord-tenant relations. Title 8 is organized into 6 Subtitles. Subtitles 3 and 4 of Title 8 address the actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>mentioned in Maryland Rule 3-711.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subtitle 3, \u201cDistress for Rent,\u201d covers the same as named in the Rule. The other actions in Rule 3-711 are covered by Subtitle 4, \u201cLandlord\u2019s Remedies Other Than Distraint.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 8-402, \u201cHolding over,\u201d covers the action in Rule 3-711 described as \u201can action involving tenants holding over.\u201d Section 8-402.3, entitled \u201cWrongful detainer,\u201d covers the action in Rule 3-711 described as the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Rule 3-711 also prohibits discovery in an \u201caction for summary ejectment.\u201d The Real Property Article, however, makes only one mention of this action, contained in \u00a7 8-401, \u201cFailure to pay rent.\u201d Thus, a summary ejectment action is linked to an action for failure to pay rent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In contrast, Rule 3-711 makes no explicit reference to an action for a \u201cBreach of Lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">HABC contends that a plain meaning interpretation of Rule 3-711 demands inclusion of a \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d action within its purview. We conclude the opposite. In applying the plain meaning rule to effectuate the will of the legislature (here, this Court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>), \u201cwe give effect to the statute as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>written.\u201d <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443, 903 A.2d 388, 395 (2006) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005)). The principles of applying a plain meaning approach include consideration of the doctrine of <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>\u201d (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458 n. 17, 903 A.2d at 404 n. 17 (citing <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 537-38, 890 A.2d 279, 285 (2006)). This fundamental principle of construction, long recognized in Maryland, when applied to the case at hand, results in our conclusion that Rule 3-711 includes several forms of actions between landlords and tenants, but necessarily excludes those brought under Md.Code, Real Property Article, \u00a7 8-402.1, \u201cBreach of lease,\u201d from its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Even were we to believe Maryland Rule 3-711 to be ambiguous in this regard, we do not reach the conclusion HABC desires because the \u201clegislative\u201d history of the Rule indicates that the Court clearly intended not to include a \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d action in the enumeration of actions for which discovery in the District Court would not be permitted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>When the Court finds a rule ambiguous, it will endeavor to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent. <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 444, 903 A.2d at 395. \u201cOne form of legislative history useful in determining legislative intent is amendments proposed but later rejected by the Legislature or, as in this case, rules of procedure proposed by the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rules Committee) later rejected by the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 721, 720 A.2d 311, 317 (1998). Here we have a similar situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The Rules Committee in 1990 proposed an amendment to Rule 3-711 to include among its enumerated actions for which discovery was prohibited \u201cBreach of Lease.\u201d 17 Md. Reg. 2729-30 (Nov. 16, 1990). The reporter\u2019s notes explain the purpose of the recommendation of the Rules Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">An inquiry from the Legal Aid Bureau recently brought to light an omission in the \u201claundry list\u201d of summary landlord-tenant proceedings wherein pretrial discovery is prohibited. Code, Real Property Article \u00a7 8-402.1 provides a summary procedure for repossession of leased premises in the event of a breach of lease by the tenant. (The most common breach, failure to pay rent, is separately covered in \u00a7 8-401.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">Rule 3-711 is derived in this regard from former M.D.R. 401 a, enacted in 1971. Section 8-402.1 was enacted in 1978; M.D.R. 401 a was never amended to pick up the reference to the new action. Nor was a reference included when Rule 3-711 was approved in its present form at the November 1983 Rules Committee meeting. Notes from that meeting do indicate that the reason for not allowing discovery in landlord-tenant proceedings generally was because of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>summary nature\u2014there would be insufficient time for discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">It appears, therefore, that the failure to include breach of lease actions in this list was inadvertent. The Rules Committee recommends that it be included because it is very similar to the other summary proceedings on the list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The Legal Aid Bureau and the Housing Law Clinic of the University of Baltimore Law School wrote to the Rules Committee of the Court in opposition to the addition of the \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d action to those actions where discovery is prohibited by Rule 3-711. The Legal Aid Bureau urged that \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d actions generally involve complex factual disputes concerning whether the landlord or tenant committed, or failed to commit, acts in compliance with lease covenants. Letter from Stuart R. Cohen, Director of Litigation, Legal Aid Bureau, to Una M. Perez, Reporter of the Rules Committee, Court of Appeals of Maryland (Jan. 3, 1991) (on file with the Court). Ms. Perez noted receipt of these comments in her Memorandum to the Members of the Rules Committee. Memorandum from Una M. Perez, Reporter of the Rules Committee, Court of Appeals of Maryland, to Members of the Rules Committee, Court of Appeals of Maryland (Feb. 11, 1991) (on file -with the Court). She further noted there that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">After considering these letters the Property Subcommittee is persuaded that there are valid reasons for leaving breach of lease actions out of the \u201claundry list\u201d in Rule 3-711, even if the omission was inadvertent in the first instance. Therefore the Subcommittee recommends that the Committee advise the Court of Appeals that the amendment is being withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">This memorandum is persuasive evidence that the Court chose not to include the \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d action among those contained in Rule 3-711. <em>See Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 650 A.2d 727 (1994) (finding persuasive letters written by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Judge John B. Gray, as Chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, upon the purpose and meaning of a Maryland Rule). This Court\u2019s unequivocal and unanimous Order, published in Volume 18, Issue 8 of the Maryland Register at 853 (April 19,1991), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">This Court having considered at open meetings, notice of which was posted as prescribed by law, all those proposed rules changes, together with comments received, ... it is this 22 day of March, 1991</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">ORDERED, that upon recommendation of the Rules Committee, the proposed amendments to Rule 3-711 be deemed withdrawn....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Thus, peering at the scope and intent of Rule 3-711 through the lens of legislative history serves to affirm our plain meaning reading of the Rule. We are <em>assured </em>in this case that the Court chose to exclude \u201cBreach of Lease\u201d actions from those summary landlord-tenant actions in the District Court where Maryland Rule 3-711 prohibits discovery.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\">.

HABC, in an effort to equate a \"Breach of Lease\u201d action with summary ejectment, a type of action swept up in Rule 3-71 l\u2019s exclusions, contends that \"Maryland law recognizes that landlords may institute a summary ejectment action to obtain repossession of their property because of a breach of lease, failure to pay rent, and tenant holding over beyond the lease term.\u201d HABC cites three cases in support, <em>University Plaza Shopping Center, Inc. v. Garcia, </em>279 Md. 61, 367 A.2d 957 (1977) (non-payment of rent); <em>Fingles v. Singer, </em>139 Md. 535, 115 A. 795 (1921) (tenant holding over); and <em>Darnestown Valley-WHM Ltd. P\u2019ship v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>102 Md.App. 577, 650 A.2d 1365 (1994) (breach of lease). To bolster further its contention, HABC also relies on <em>Brown v. Housing Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery County, </em>350 Md. 570, 714 A.2d 197 (1998) for the predication that the General Assembly recognized the \"Breach of Lease\u201d action as a kind of summary ejectment action because the latter is a statutory action that expedites the eviction of a tenant when a breach of lease has occurred. We find this logic unconvincing. While a \"Breach of Lease\u201d action is a \"summary proceeding\u201d in the sense that it was created to expedite court proceedings, <em>Brown v. Housing Opportunities </em>explains that the \"Breach of Lease\u201d action developed from different stock than other summary actions. Both the failure to pay rent proceeding and the tenant holding over proceeding evolved from the common law action of ejectment, a proceeding used to determine title to property. <em>Brown, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>350 Md. at 581-84, 714 A.2d at 201-04. Because aggrieved landlords were misusing the tenant holding over proceeding by filing \"Breach of Lease\u201d actions on forms created for tenant holding over claims, the Legislature deemed it necessary to create a \"separate, self-contained District Court procedure by which landlords could recover possession of leased premises based on breaches of covenants other than the payment of rent----\" <em>Id. </em>at 584, 714 A.2d at 203. This explains the use of the term summary ejectment in two of the petitioner's cited cases, <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Fingles. </em>This does not legitimate, however, HABC's contention. We note that in no case cited by HABC did this Court hold that summary ejectment is synonymous with any action other than an action for failure to pay rent. Indeed, the only case to speak directly to this question is the present one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
