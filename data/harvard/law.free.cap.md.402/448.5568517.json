Newton Jackson, III of the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Jackson held a hearing on June 8, 2007, and issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on July 3, 2007, in which he concluded by clear and convincing evidence that in the Edwards matter, Respondent had violated MRPC 1.15(a), 1.16(d) with respect to $630 that Respondent had received representing a filing fee for a conversion to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, and 8.4(a), (c) and (d), and had violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d) in the Polk matter. Judge Jackson did not conclude that there were violations of MRPC 1.5(b), nor of MRPC 1.16(d) with respect to a $3,000 retainer in the Edwards matter, nor of MRPC 8.4(a) and (c) in the Polk matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">Opinion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cPetitioner alleges professional misconduct on the part of Respondent. A hearing was held on 8 June 2007. Glenn M. Grossman represented Petitioner; Andrew Jay Graham appeared for Respondent. Testifying were Rosie Edwards (via videotape), Respondent himself, William Handy and Barton Gold, the last two being essentially character witnesses. Various exhibits were admitted into evidence, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>eluding Petitioner\u2019s request for admission of facts and genuineness of documents and Respondent\u2019s response thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s allegations pertain to two of Respondent\u2019s clients, Rosie Edwards and Sheila Polk. Each will be treated separately herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">Rosie L. Edwards</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cIn September 2004, Ms. Edwards hired Respondent because of financial difficulties involving a daycare center on church property operated by her as pastor. Ms. Edwards had already filed a <em>pro se </em>Chapter 7 bankruptcy on behalf of the church, and Respondent advised her to convert the Chapter 7 to Chapter 11. To that end, on 23 September 2004, Ms. Edwards gave Respondent a personal check postdated to 29 September 2004 in the amount of $630. The words \u201cconversion fee/Chapter 11\u201d appear in the memorandum portion of the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201cSimultaneously, Ms. Edwards paid a fee of $3,000 by way of a bank check to Respondent, who told her that he expected the total cost of the representation to be in the $10,000-$15,000 range for the Chapter 11. No retainer agreement was executed by Ms. Edwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">\u201cRespondent placed the funds from the two checks into his general operating account, which he used for general business purposes. Even though Ms. Edwards\u2019 personal check contained the notation \u201cconversion fee,\u201d Respondent did not place those funds in trust. He did not use them for the purpose for which they were given him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">\u201cMs. Edwards assumed that Respondent had effected the conversion. In fact, Respondent did not convert the Chapter 7 bankruptcy to Chapter 11, because it became evident to him that Ms. Edwards was unable or unwilling to make the necessary periodic payments. Instead, he decided that a \u201cre-write\u201d of the existing bank loan against the property was the best course of action. In that regard, he contacted the bank\u2019s president and its attorney, but these negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>bore no fruit. He then advised her that a sale of the property was necessary. Ms. Edwards gave Respondent a list of 10 potential buyers, whom he contacted. Despite these efforts, no buyer could be found, and the bank scheduled a foreclosure sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201cIn late 2004, Respondent learned of the existence of a substantial IRS lien against the premises. Around the same time, the Chapter 7 proceeding was dismissed. In May 2005, the foreclosure sale occurred. Subsequent to the sale, Respondent identified a notice problem with respect to the IRS, but this became moot when the IRS waived that issue, and the sale was eventually ratified in August 2005. By then, Respondent was doing no work for Ms. Edwards of any kind. In April 2006, he returned $1,070 to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cAt no time during any of the foregoing events did Respondent ever advise Ms. Edwards that he had not converted the Chapter 7 to a Chapter 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cPetitioner alleges violations of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5(b), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). Applying the standard of clear and convincing evidence, the Court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201c1. Respondent did not violate Rule 1.5(b). Although he was initially hired to convert a Chapter 7 to a Chapter 11 (something he never did), the <em>focus </em>of his efforts for Ms. Edwards never changed, viz., saving her property from her creditors. Respondent did quote his client an hourly rate, and he did give her an estimate of her anticipated legal fees. Although he should have told Ms. Edwards that he was no longer pursuing the Chapter 11 option, the Court is not convinced that the scope of his representation ever changed. Moreover, the hourly rate was a reasonable one, and Respondent\u2019s efforts were calculated to achieve the best result for his client under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201c2. Respondent did violate Rule 1.15(a) by not depositing the $3,630 into his escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201c3. Respondent did not violate 1.16(d) with respect to the $3,000, because Petitioner has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that this fee was not earned by Respondent. At $200 an hour, this retainer represents 15 hours of work. Although he did not produce time sheets, his testimony regarding various efforts made to save the property went uncontradicted. Fifteen hours of work over a nine-month period of time does not appear to be excessive. The Court does find, however, that Respondent did violate Rule 1.16(d) with respect to the $630 earmarked for converting the Chapter 7 to Chapter 11. Those monies were not earned as fees and should have been forthwith returned to the client when it became apparent that a Chapter 11 was not feasible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">\u201c4. Respondent did violate Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d) for the reasons noted above, especially his failure to deposit the retainers into escrow and his failure to return the $630 promptly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Sheila Polk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cIn March 2006, Sheila Polk retained Respondent to seek an emergency hearing for the custody of her grandson, who had been living with her for several years. The natural mother wanted the child returned to her, but Ms. Polk believed it was not in his best interest. Ms. Polk paid Respondent a fee of $300 on or about 6 March 2006. The Respondent agreed to file for an emergency custody hearing on Ms. Polk\u2019s behalf in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, but failed to do so, although he had previously drafted a complaint for custody on her behalf. When Ms. Polk called Respondent to determine the status of the matter, he told her that he had filed for the emergency hearing. At the hearing, Respondent testified that, while he knew he was not being truthful with Ms. Polk, he intended to file the complaint shortly after their conversation. He did not. Respondent advised Ms. Polk of his false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>representation approximately a week later, when she asked him about the status of the matter. Respondent failed to return Ms. Polk\u2019s fee until on or about 7 July 2006 after Ms. Polk filed a complaint 'with Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201cPetitioner alleges violation by Respondent of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). Petitioner has proven by clear and convincing evidence that he has violated all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201c1. By failing to file a timely request for an emergency hearing, Respondent violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201c2. By misrepresenting the situation to Ms. Polk, he violated Rule 1.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">\u201c3. By failing to return the unearned fee, he violated Rule 1.16(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">\u201c4.

In our review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(2);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at -, 934 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>-; <em>Lawson, </em>401 Md. at -, 933 A.2d at -; <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 151, 844 A.2d 367, 380-381 (2004). As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo. </em>Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at -, 934 A.2d at -; <em>Lawson, </em>401 Md. at -, 933 A.2d at -; <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Therefore, we accept the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, as established, for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction. Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Floyd, </em>400 Md. 236, 250, 929 A.2d 61, 69 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Logan, </em>390 Md. 313, 319, 888 A.2d 359, 363 (2005). In the Edwards matter, Judge Jackson concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a), 1.16(d) with respect to $630 that Respondent had received representing a conversion fee in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, and 8.4(a), (c) and (d), and in the Polk matter, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d). He also, in the Edwards matter, concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Respondent did not violate MRPC 1.5(b), nor did he violate MRPC 1.16(d) with respect to a $3,000 retainer, and also concluded that the Respondent did not violate MRPC 8.4(a) and (c) in the Polk matter. Both Petitioner and Respondent took exceptions to various conclusions of law, each of which we shall address.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\n<em>A. Petitioner\u2019s Exception to Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In the Edwards matter, Petitioner did not except to Judge Jackson\u2019s conclusion that MRPC 1.5(b) was not violated, nor to Judge Jackson\u2019s conclusion that MRPC 1.16(d) was not violated with respect to the retainer of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">With respect to the Polk matter, Petitioner excepts to Judge Jackson\u2019s failure to determine that MRPC 8.4(c) was violated when Respondent lied to Ms. Polk when he told her that he had filed a motion for an emergency custody hearing, when he knew he had not, and failed to return the retainer. Petitioner argues that because Judge Jackson stated, \u201cBy lying to his client and retaining an unearned fee, he violated MRPC 8.4(d),\u201d it is \u201cvirtually axiomatic that the conduct set forth in this recital demonstrates a violation of [MRPC 8.4(c) ]\u201d as well. Respondent contends, conversely, that he did not violate MRPC 8.4(c) because his misrepresentation to Ms. Polk that he had filed the petition for the emergency hearing was a \u201clittle white lie\u201d that did not rise to \u201cfraudulent, deceitful, or misrepresentative behavior\u201d proscribed by MRPC 8.4(c), and that he returned the $300 to Ms. Polk after she filed her complaint with Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">MRPC 8.4(c) states that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">We have said that lying to a client about whether a pleading was filed can amount to a violation of MRPC 8.4(c). In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 910 A.2d 429 (2006), Steinberg was retained to represent a client in her efforts to forestall the sale of her home in foreclosure by filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition; the client paid Steinberg a $1,000 retainer. Steinberg did not file the petition, but he told the client that he had. The client subsequently received a letter notifying her of the date of the foreclosure sale, after which, Steinberg again assured her that he had filed the petition. Steinberg did not make \u201ctimely good faith efforts to make restitution or rectify the damage caused by his misrepresentations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 376, 910 A.2d at 452, and we concluded that he violated MRPC 8.4(c) because he misrepresented that he had filed the Chapter 13 petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">Further, Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c) when he misrepresented to Ms. Adeleye that he filed the Chapter 13 Petition. In <em>Harrington, </em>we held that it was a violation of MRPC 8.4(c) where an attorney lead his client to believe that he had filed a law suit on her behalf when he, in fact, had not. 367 Md. at 48, 785 A.2d at 1267.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 369-70, 910 A.2d at 448. <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Guberman, </em>392 Md. 131, 135-36, 896 A.2d 337, 339-40 (2006) (attorney violated MRPC 8.4(c) when he falsely represented to the partners of his firm that he had filed an appeal on behalf of a client); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 48, 785 A.2d 1260, 1267 (2001) (attorney violated MRPC 8.4(c) when he led his client to believe that he had filed a legal malpractice law suit on her behalf when he had not).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Also, in <em>Attorney Grievance v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. at 467, 813 A.2d at 1145, we concluded that McLaughlin violated MRPC 8.4(e) when he did not refund $72,000 in retainer fees provided by several clients. Specifically, we noted that because McLaughlin had not performed any work for the clients, his retention of the retainers was dishonest and deceitful, and remarked that the \u201cretention of unearned fees paid by a client, alone, may constitute a violation of MRPC 8.4(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502-03, 813 A.2d at 1166 (citations omitted). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 510, 704 A.2d 1225, 1236 (1998) (attorney violated MRPC 8.4(c) when he failed to refund a fee he had not earned). We, therefore, sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception and determine that Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>dent acted dishonestly and deceitfully in violation of MRPC 8.4(c) when he lied to his client about his failure to file the petition and did not promptly return her fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\n<em>B. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9_\">\n<em>1. The Edwards Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Judge Jackson concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) by not depositing Ms. Edwards\u2019 $3,000 retainer into his escrow account. He also determined that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) by not depositing into his escrow account an additional $630 check from Ms. Edwards which was identified as payment of the filing fees for converting a Chapter 7 to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and MRPC 1.16(d) by not promptly returning to Ms. Edwards the $630. The hearing judge also concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(a), (c) and (d) based upon his previous conclusions of law and especially because Respondent did not deposit Ms. Edwards\u2019 $3,000 retainer and $630 check into his escrow account and failed to promptly return the $630.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Respondent excepts to Judge Jackson\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPC 1.15(a), arguing that his conduct constituted a technical violation, but not a substantive violation because Ms. Edwards, allegedly, was not harmed as a result. Bar Counsel, conversely, argues that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) because he deposited the $3,000 retainer and the $630 check into his general operating account.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">MRPC 1.15(a) states in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">With respect to the $3,000 retainer, we recently stated in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 891 A.2d 1085 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">Funds given in anticipation of future legal services qualify as trust money and, accordingly, are to be deposited in trust accounts separate from the attorney\u2019s property, to be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>moved promptly by the attorney as earned. <em>To deposit such trust money into the attorney\u2019s personal or operating accounts before the fees are earned constitutes a violation of MRPC 1.15(a).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 53, 891 A.2d at 1097 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 279, 849 A.2d 423, 446 (2004) (attorney violated MRPC 1.15(a) when he deposited retainer in operating account); <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Clearly, Respondent\u2019s failure to deposit the $3,000 retainer into his escrow account was a violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">With respect to Respondent\u2019s failure to deposit the filing fee of $630 into his escrow account, money linked to a specific purpose qualifies as trust money as well and must be deposited in an escrow account. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Rose, </em>391 Md. 101, 111, 892 A.2d 469, 475 (2006), we concluded that Rose violated MRPC 1.15(a) when he failed to deposit $100 from a client for the filing fee in a divorce action into his escrow account. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Calhoun, </em>391 Md. 532, 567, 894 A.2d 518, 538-39 (2006), moreover, we determined that Calhoun violated MRPC 1.15(a) by failing to deposit $5,000 received from a client to pay for prospective deposition costs into his escrow account. Clearly, Respondent\u2019s failure to deposit the $630 payment for converting the Chapter 7 to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition into his escrow account was a violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Respondent also excepts to Judge Jackson\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPC 1.16(d) regarding the $630, arguing that his conduct constituted a technical violation of that rule, but not a substantive violation because Ms. Edwards, alleged-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ly, was not harmed as a result.

Respondent\u2019s failure to deposit the $3,000 retainer into his escrow account was dishonest, deceitful and prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of MRPC 8.4(c) and (d).

In a situation comparable.to the instant one, <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 810 A.2d 996 (2002), a client provided Gallagher $30,000 related to his securing an L-l visa approval, to be deposited in Gallagher\u2019s escrow account; Gallagher, however, deposited the money into his personal account. We concluded that such misconduct violated MRPC 8.4(c) and (d) because Gallagher misappropriated client funds and misrepresented to his client that the funds would be held in his escrow account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">This Court has consistently found misappropriation of client funds and deceit to constitute a violation of MRPC 8.4(c). Respondent\u2019s conduct was dishonest and deceitful in that he led Mr. Lobo to believe that Mr. Lobo\u2019s $30,000 would be held in trust and returned to him in full, subject to their agreement, while he later disbursed that money without Mr. Lobo\u2019s knowledge or consent. Respondent also made misrepresentations about his authority to distribute this account\u2019s funds to petitioner. Additionally, respondent misled Mr. Damani when respondent indicated that Mr. Damani\u2019s money would be held in trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">This Court has also found conduct constituting the misappropriation of client or third party funds to be \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4(d).

Also, in <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Respondent, however, failed to file an emergency petition. Ms. Polk called Respondent to determine the status of the matter, and Respondent lied to her that he had in fact filed the petition and only fessed up when Ms. Polk contacted Respondent again. We agree with Judge Jackson that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4, and therefore we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Respondent also violated MRPC 1.16(d), which iterates that \u201c[u]pon termination of representation, a lawyer shall ... refund any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred,\u201d by failing to return the $300 retainer promptly. As we have already discussed herein, the failure to promptly return an unearned fee advanced by a client constitutes a violation of MRPC 1.16(d), and we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Respondent also excepts to Judge Jackson\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPC 8.4(d) \u201cto the extent that the trial court concluded that [the violation] involve[s] a wrongful intent and particularly any intent to harm or take advantage of a client.\u201d Respondent contends that he did not violate MRPC 8.4(d) because he did not intend to harm Ms. Polk, but rather that he merely forgot to file the motion for an emergency custody hearing after he had misrepresented that he had. Conversely, Bar Counsel argues that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(d) because he knowingly lied to Ms. Polk about the status of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">MRPC 8.4(d) provides that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">(d) engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Tinsky, </em>377 Md. at 652-53, 835 A.2d at 545-46, we agreed with the hearing judge that Tinsky violated MRPC 8.4(d) in connection with his representation of a client in a bankruptcy case, because he failed to take any effective action on behalf of the client, accepted $925 for his representation, and failed to refund the fees. <em>See also Milliken, </em>348 Md. at 510, 704 A.2d at 1236 (attorney violated MRPC 8.4(d) when he failed to refund a fee he had not earned).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Although Respondent in the present case alleges that he did not engage in conduct that is \u201cprejudicial\u201d to the administration of justice because he did not intend to injure Ms. Polk, it is difficult to conceive of conduct that could be more prejudicial than failing to file an emergency petition for a custody hearing on behalf of a caregiver, who believes she is acting in a child\u2019s best interest. We, therefore, agree with the hearing judge that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(d) in the Polk matter and overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The appropriate sanction for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct generally \u201cdepends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Goff, </em>399 Md. at 1, 922 A.2d at 554. In that case, Goff was indefinitely suspended with the right to reapply for readmission 60 days after the date of the suspension for violating MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.15(a) and (b), 8.1(b) and 8.4(d), Maryland Rule 16-609 and Section 10-306 of the Business, Occupations and Professions Article in connection with his handling of estate proceeds.
