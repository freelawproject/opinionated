[djuring any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled in this or any other state, unless the individual is eligible for a restricted license under \u00a7 16-113(e) of this subtitle.\u201d Less than three years ago, in <em>Gwin v. MVA, </em>385 Md. 440, 869 A.2d 822 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 823, 126 S.Ct. 359, 163 L.Ed.2d 67 (2005), we held that the statute means what it says and that MVA may not issue a Maryland driver\u2019s license to someone whose license to drive has been revoked or is currently in suspension in another State, even if the revocation or suspension is permanent in that State. That holding, based on the unambiguous, plain wording of the statute, also dooms petitioner, Ramiro Alavez\u2019s, quest for a Maryland driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Petitioner, currently a resident of Maryland, is a citizen of Mexico. He said that he came to the United States in 1988 and resided initially in California, where he was able to obtain a driver\u2019s license from that State. Two years later, he obtained a Virginia driver\u2019s license. He claims that in 1991 he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>applied for a license in New Jersey but was turned down because he was not \u201ca legal immigrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The actual history of what occurred in New Jersey, as revealed in the records of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJMVC) is not entirely consistent with that assertion. Under New Jersey law, a driver\u2019s license is issued for a 48-month period, subject to renewal in the manner prescribed by the NJMVC. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. \u00a7 39:3-10. At least since 1993, New Jersey law has also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">\u201cIn addition to requiring an applicant for a driver\u2019s license to submit satisfactory proof of identity and age, the commission also shall require the applicant to provide, as a condition for obtaining a permit and license, satisfactory proof that the applicant\u2019s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">If the commission has reasonable cause to suspect that any document presented by an applicant as proof of identity, age or legal residency is altered, false or otherwise invalid, the commission shall refuse to grant the permit or license until such time as the document may be verified by the issuing agency to the commission\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-8\"><em>Id. </em>Those provisions also apply to identification cards issued by NJMVC to persons who do not have a New Jersey driver\u2019s license. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. \u00a7 39:3-29.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Regulations adopted by NJMVC allow a person from a foreign country who is in New Jersey for a year or less to operate a motor vehicle in the State if the person holds a current driver\u2019s license from that country. <em>See </em>N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, \u00a7 21-8.2(e). The regulations also permit a person from a foreign country who is in New Jersey for a year or less but who does not hold a current license from the foreign country to apply for a New Jersey license or permit The Administrator, however, must suspend or revoke such a license upon its expiration or upon expiration of the holder\u2019s \u201clawful presence in the United States unless it is demonstrated that the person\u2019s continued presence in the United States is authorized under Federal Law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 21-8.2(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>One of the NJMVC regulations requires an applicant for a license, permit, or non-driver identification card to furnish to the Commission, upon its request, \u201cproof of identity and date of birth and proof that the applicant\u2019s presence in the United States is authorized under Federal law,\u201d and it lists the kinds of documents that will suffice. Among the documents pertaining to proof of lawful presence in the U.S. are a U.S. birth certificate, adoption papers, a certificate of naturalization or citizenship, a current and verified alien registration card, specific documents establishing refugee status, and a photo employment authorization card. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, \u00a7 21-8.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">NJMVC records, placed into evidence in this case, indicate that Alavez received a commercial and a non-commercial driver\u2019s license on September 30, 1987, which is before he said he emigrated to the U.S. It would appear that NJMVC was unaware, when it issued the licenses, that Alavez maintained his Virginia license, as New Jersey law, like that of Maryland, requires that a foreign license be surrendered prior to the issuance of a domestic one. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. \u00a7 39:3-10; TR \u00a7 16-111.1(f)(2). When the New Jersey licenses expired four years later, on September 30, 1991, they were \u201cwithdrawn\u201d because of \u201cmisrepresentation of identity or other facts on application for driver license.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Alavez continued to drive in New Jersey. On February 12, 1995, his two licenses, which somehow were treated as still in effect, were suspended, again for misrepresenting facts on his application (D02). In March, 1995, Alavez was convicted of driving on a suspended license, and, when the licenses actually expired in 1995, they were again \u201cwithdrawn,\u201d this time because of the \u201cdriving while license suspended\u201d conviction (ACD Code B26).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>During the entire time Alavez was in New Jersey, he maintained his Virginia driver\u2019s license. In December, 2002, he surrendered that license and was issued a Maryland driver\u2019s license. There is no indication that MVA was then aware that his New Jersey licenses had been suspended or withdrawn. In January, 2003, that fact was discovered, and MVA notified Alavez that, as a result of the New Jersey suspension, his Maryland license would be cancelled on February 27, 2003. To avoid cancellation or to re-apply for a Maryland license after cancellation, he was told, he would need to submit a \u201cclearance letter or driving record\u201d confirming that his driving privilege had been restored in New Jersey. No such confirmation was forthcoming, and his license was cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">At some point in 2005, Alavez made inquiry to NJMVC about his New Jersey license and was informed, on November 3, 2005, that, if he were foreign-born, he would need to submit notarized copies of documents that prove his presence in the United States to be lawful under Federal law. Through counsel, Alavez then requested some sort of review by MVA, which contacted NJMVC. The New Jersey Commission confirmed that it had suspended Alavez\u2019s license \u201cbecause of failure to present acceptable proof of legal name, date of birth, valid address, social security number, legal presence in this country and/or provide testimony concerning fraud/misuse of the driver license and/or registration under investigation at the time of the application for a New Jersey driver license.\u201d The letter further advised that unless Alavez \u201ccan provide proof that [his] presence here is authorized under Federal Law by providing valid and acceptable immigration documentation, [he] will not be eligible for a New Jersey license or permit or for restoration of [his] New Jersey driving privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Apart from this written response, MVA officials had a number of telephone conversations with their New Jersey counterparts, including counsel to NJMVC. Based on those conversations, MVA advised Alavez on April 4, 2006 that the \u201cidentity suspensions\u201d in New Jersey were \u201cas the result of [Alavez] submitting fraudulent [United States Citizenship and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Immigration Services] identification to obtain and/or retain a New Jersey permit or license\u201d and that the suspensions will \u201cstay suspended until valid and acceptable immigration documentation is presented proving that [his] legal presence is authorized by federal law.\u201d Citing TR \u00a7 16-103.1 and <em>Gwin v. MVA, supra, </em>MVA advised that it could not issue a Maryland driver\u2019s license until the New Jersey suspensions were cleared. MVA confirmed that decision on April 25, 2006, and advised that its decision was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Rather than seek immediate judicial review, as suggested by MVA, Alavez requested an administrative hearing, and the matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing the evidence, essentially as recounted above, the Administrative Law Judge (AL J) found as a fact that Alavez\u2019s New Jersey driver\u2019s license had been suspended in 1991 for obtaining the license \u201cwith forged documents,\u201d that the suspension remained in effect, and, based largely on Alavez\u2019s concession, that he could not take the steps identified by NJMVC as necessary to terminate the suspension. She concluded that TR \u00a7 16-103.1 was not a discretionary statute, but precluded MVA from issuing a Maryland license during the period of the New Jersey suspension. Addressing Alavez\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated because he is unable to comply with the New Jersey requirement, the AL J noted that, if there was any due process violation, it arose from the New Jersey statute, as implemented by NJMVC, not from TR \u00a7 16-103.1. Upon those findings and conclusions, the ALJ sustained the cancellation of Alavez\u2019s Maryland driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The Circuit Court for Baltimore County, on Alavez\u2019s petition for judicial review, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ruling, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support her findings and agreeing that TR \u00a7 16-103.1 mandated the action taken by MVA. We granted Alavez\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari </em>to consider the broad question raised of whether MVA erred in canceling the Maryland license. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The issue before us is not whether Maryland should issue a driver\u2019s license to undocumented or illegal aliens. We do; it is not prohibited. Nor are we concerned with whether New Jersey\u2019s contrary policy is wise or fair; that is an issue for the New Jersey legislature, which established the policy. Maryland has a statute, TR \u00a7 16-103.1, which prohibits MVA from issuing a driver\u2019s license to an individual during any period in which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or cancelled \u201cin this or any other state.\u201d The two questions presented by Alavez are (1) whether \u00a7 16-103.1 was intended by our General Assembly to apply only to out-of-State revocations, suspensions, refusals, or cancellations based on conduct that would lead to a suspension or refusal of a license in Maryland, and (2) if not, whether the statute violates Alavez\u2019s substantive due process and equal protection rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. To the extent our resolution of those questions hinges on <em>Gwin v. MVA, supra, </em>385 Md. 440, 869 A.2d 822, we are asked to overrule that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\n<em>Construction of TR \u00a7 16-103.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The rules of statutory construction are well-established. As we pointed out most recently in <em>Sprenger v. PSC, </em>400 Md. 1, 29, 926 A.2d 238, 254 (2007), our goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature, and, to do that, we look first to the language of the statute, giving that language its natural and ordinary meaning. As stated in <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003) and confirmed in <em>Sprenger, supra, </em>at 29, 926 A.2d at 254, \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">There is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about the pertinent part of TR \u00a7 16-103.1. It says that MVA \u201cmay not issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual ... [d]uring any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled in this or any other state, unless the individual is eligible for a restricted license under \u00a7 16\u2014113(e) of this subtitle.\u201d Alavez would have us insert another exception\u2014unless the revocation, suspension, or cancellation in the other State is for conduct that would not warrant that result in Maryland. To add that exception, to read the statute in that manner, would be to do precisely what we have consistently said a court may not do\u2014add words to create an exception or limitation that the Legislature chose not to create.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Not only does the plain wording of the statute preclude such a \u201cforced or subtle\u201d interpretation, the legislative history of the provision makes clear a legislative intent not to create such an exception. The prohibition against the issuance of a Maryland driver\u2019s license to one whose license to drive has been revoked, suspended, refused, or cancelled dates back at least to the 1943 rewriting of the Motor Vehicle Code. <em>See </em>1943 Md. Laws, ch. 1007. The 1943 law provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">\u201c[t]he Department [of Motor Vehicles] shall not issue any license hereunder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">3. To any person, as an operator or chauffeur, whose license has been suspended during such suspension nor to any person whose license has been revoked, until the expiration of three (3) months after such license was revoked ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">In modified form, that provision survived a substantive rewriting of the Motor Vehicle Code in 1970 (1970 Md. Laws, ch. 534, enacting Art. 66/6, \u00a7 6-103 \u00b6 2) and the 1977 code revision enactment of titles 11 through 27 of the Transporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>tion Article (1977 Md. Laws, ch. 14, enacting TR \u00a7 16-1.03.1). In that penultimate form, the statute precluded MVA from issuing a driver\u2019s license to an individual \u201c[d]uring any period for which his license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">MVA construed the statute, as so written, as applying to revocations, suspensions, refusals, and cancellations in both Maryland and other States, but apparently that approach was challenged, on the ground that the term \u201clicense\u201d was defined in TR \u00a7 11-128 as any \u201c(1) Driver\u2019s license; and (2) Any other license or permit to drive a motor vehicle that is issued under or granted by <em>the laws of this State </em>...\u201d Seeking to remove any ambiguity and make clear that its approach was correct, MVA, through the Department of Transportation, proposed a Departmental bill in the 1993 Legislative Session to add to the existing language in \u00a7 16-103.1 \u201cin this or any other State unless the individual is eligible for a restricted license under \u00a7 16-113(e) of this subtitle.\u201d With one technical amendment to correct a printing error, the bill was enacted as proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The addition of \u201cin this or any other State\u201d certainly clarified any ambiguity regarding the <em>duty </em>of MVA to honor and enforce revocations, suspensions, refusals, and cancellations decreed in other States, but the exception is equally telling. Section 16-113(e) allows MVA to issue (1) a driver\u2019s license valid only in Maryland when the applicant\u2019s driving privilege was suspended in another State for failing to comply with the financial responsibility requirements of that State, and (2) subject to certain conditions, a temporary driver\u2019s license valid only in Maryland and good for only 90 days when the applicant\u2019s driving privilege was suspended in another State for failing to comply with the licensing requirements of that State, for which a comparable violation in this State would not have resulted in revocation or suspension. One of the conditions to that exception is that MVA determine that the applicant \u201cwill be able to take any actions required by the other jurisdiction for reinstatement of the privilege to drive in that jurisdiction.\u201d TR \u00a7 16-113(e)(1)(ii)4.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>What this shows is that the Legislature, understanding that it was mandating a very broad reciprocity and that, by doing so, would be precluding the issuance of a Maryland driver\u2019s license to anyone whose license or privilege to drive had been revoked, suspended, refused, or cancelled in any other State, even for reasons that would not produce such action in Maryland, was willing to draw two specific exceptions to that broad reciprocity, but only those two. No argument is, or could reasonably be, made here that Alavez falls within either of those exceptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not for this Court, by judicial f\u00edat, to add another one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\n<em>Article 24</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides, in relevant part, that no person ought to be disseized of his liberties or privileges or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty, or property \u201cbut by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the Land.\u201d That provision has been held to be the State counterpart to both the due process and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Kane v. Board of Appeals, </em>390 Md. 145, 169, n. 16, 887 A.2d 1060, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>1074, n. 16 (2005) (due process); <em>Bowie Inn, Inc. v. Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 235, n. 1, 335 A.2d 679, 683, n. 1 (1975) (due process); <em>Matter of Easton, </em>214 Md. 176, 187, 133 A.2d 441, 447 (1957) (due process); <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 353-54, 601 A.2d 102, 107-08 (1992) (equal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">At no time during the administrative hearing before the ALJ did Alavez mention either Art. 24 or equal protection. He did mention that \u201c[t]he due process section is that he went to the MVA one time and asked for a license\u201d and that MVA made clear that as long as the New Jersey suspension, which Alavez could not cure, remained extant, he could not get a Maryland license. Fleeting as that reference was, the ALJ addressed the issue. Her response was that any due process issue would arise from the New Jersey law and would need to be dealt with in that State and that, based on <em>Gwin v. MVA, </em>there was no due process violation emanating from the Maryland TR \u00a7 16-103.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The due process and equal protection argument seems to be based on the notion that, because Maryland would not refuse to issue a driver\u2019s license simply because the applicant is unable to prove legal residence in the United States, it has no legitimate interest in denying such a license to a qualified applicant simply because New Jersey has a different policy, especially when that policy, if implemented through the revocation, suspension, refusal, or cancellation of a New Jersey license, would permanently bar the applicant from obtaining a Maryland driver\u2019s license. There are two responses. First, as we pointed out in footnote 4, above, Alavez\u2019s license was not suspended in New Jersey because he is an illegal resident, but because he used forged documents to obtain that license, and Maryland would do the same. He is being treated the same as any other person whose license is suspended for that reason. Maryland does have a legitimate interest in assuring that persons who have resorted, or attempted to resort, to fraud or forged documents in order to obtain a driver\u2019s license elsewhere and who, as a result, have had that license revoked, suspended, refused, or cancelled in the other State, not be rewarded for that conduct by receiving a Maryland driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>license. The fact that the out-of-State revocation or suspension maybe permanent does not suffice to make the Maryland reciprocity statute unconstitutional. That was also the case in <em>Gwin, </em>which, despite Alavez\u2019s request, we decline to overrule. It was right when filed, and it remains right today.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">JUDGMENT OF CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Dissenting Opinion by ELDRIDGE, J., which GREENE, J. joins.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\">. The documents show as the reason for withdrawal \"D02.\u201d That designation is part of an \"ACD Code\" that was established by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators to facilitate the electronic sharing of information among the motor vehicle administrations in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. D02 is the code for misrepresentation of identity or other facts on applications for driver license. It is not clear whether, in New Jersey, a withdrawal is in the nature of a non-renewal or a suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. Contemporaneously, Alavez wrote to NJMVC, pointing out that he had moved to Maryland, that Maryland does not require lawful presence in the United States as a condition to obtaining a driver\u2019s license, asking that the New Jersey suspension be withdrawn so that he could obtain a Maryland license, and demanding a hearing regarding what he characterized as \u201cthis unlawful suspension.\u201d It is not clear whether that demand was pursued. We assume from what occurred in Maryland that NJMVC did not withdraw its suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">. But for the condition attached to the second exception, Alavez may have qualified under that exception. MVA did not, and could not, determine, however, that Alavez would be able to take the action required by New Jersey for reinstatement of his driving privilege in that State. Indeed, it determined precisely the opposite, and that determination is not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">. Even if we were to construe TR \u00a7 16-103.1 as applying only to out-of-State suspensions for conduct that would produce a similar result with respect to a Maryland license, it would avail Alavez naught He was not suspended in New Jersey because he was an undocumented or illegal alien, but, as the ALJ specifically found, based on the NJMVC records, for obtaining the New Jersey license by the use of forged documents. The same result would pertain had he obtained a Maryland driver's license by the use of forged documents. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16\u2014201(a)(3) (MVA may cancel Maryland driver\u2019s license if it determines licensee committed fraud in obtaining license); \u00a7 16-301(b)(4) (person may not in any application for a driver\u2019s license use a false, fictitious, or fraudulently altered document); \u00a7\u00a7 16-402(a)(31) and 16\u2014404(a)(3)(ii) (assessment of 12 points for conviction violation of \u00a7 16-301 and revocation of license of person who accumulates 12 points).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\">. The Dissent suggests that, because TR \u00a7 7-103.1 is \"broad and sweeping,\u201d and precludes persons whose licenses are suspended in other States from obtaining a Maryland driver\u2019s license even if they would be able to obtain such a license but for that suspension, the statute is arbitrary and therefore may, or possible could, be unconstitutional in some way. The Dissent offers as proof the extreme hypothetical situation of the Canadian province of Quebec suspending a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license because the person cannot speak French and is somehow physically, mentally, or emotionally incapable of learning French. That, of course, is not this case, and despite the hesitant response of MVA counsel to Judge Eldridge\u2019s no doubt entirely unanticipated question, it is not at all clear that Maryland would deny a license in such a bizarre situation. The Maryland law is broad and sweeping, and was intended to be so. It appears to be consistent with the laws enacted in most, if not all, of the other States, and there is nothing arbitrary, capricious, or unconstitutional about it. It is a legitimate safety measure and appears to be applied fairly and uniformly, precisely as intended by the General Assembly. The Dissent urges that \"[t]he General Assembly\u2019s policy decision concerning the issue should be respected by the Judiciary and the MVA.\u201d That is exactly what MVA and this Court are doing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b771-7\">ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Atg6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Under the State\u2019s and the majority\u2019s interpretation of Maryland Code (1977, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-103.1 of the Transportation Article, Alavez, now a resident of Maryland, will always be ineligible to obtain a driver\u2019s license in Maryland because of New Jersey\u2019s policy of refusing a driver\u2019s license to a person whose \u201ccontinued presence in the United States is [unauthorized under Federal Law.\u201d New Jersey\u2019s policy in this respect is directly contrary to Maryland\u2019s public policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>which does not require that non-citizens of the United States demonstrate federally authorized presence in this country as a condition for obtaining a Maryland driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">A person in a similar position as Alavez, but who had resided in Maryland ever since his or her arrival in the United States, or who had moved to Maryland from another state without a lawful presence requirement for a driver\u2019s license, would now be eligible for a Maryland driver\u2019s license. An interpretation of \u00a7 16-103.1, which makes a Marylander\u2019s eligibility for a driver\u2019s license dependent upon which state the individual came from, is, in my opinion, arbitrary and unnecessary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is an interpretation presenting serious constitutional problems under the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">I would reverse the decisions below and direct that the case be remanded to the MVA for a new determination, treating Alavez in the same manner as a person whose Maryland driver\u2019s license was suspended by the MVA because the person obtained the Maryland license by using a false document.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The majority opinion takes the position that \u201c[tjhere is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about\u201d \u00a7 16-103.1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Transportation Article, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cThe Administration may not issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">(1) During any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused or canceled in this or any other state____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Nevertheless, this Court has held that \u201cvery broad and sweeping\u201d statutes, or \u201c[gjeneral statutes ... which, if given their broadest and most encompassing meaning, give rise to constitutional questions, have regularly been the subject of narrowing constructions so as to avoid the constitutional issues.\u201d <em>Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 729, 580 A.2d 176, 183 (1990). <em>See also, e.g., Board of Trustees of Employees\u2019 Retirement System of City of Baltimore v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City, </em>317 Md. 72, 97-98, 562 A.2d 720, 732-733 (1989) (This Court construed broad delegation of legislative power language to be advisory only, to \u201cavoid[ ] casting substantial doubt upon\u201d the validity of the statutory language); <em>Yangming Marine Transport Corp. v. Revon Products U.S.A., Inc., </em>311 Md. 496, 509-510, 536 A.2d 633, 640 (1988) (A construction of the statute in accordance with its literal meaning would present a substantial issue under the federal Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause, and, therefore, this Court construed the statute narrowly); <em>In Re James D., </em>295 Md. 314, 327, 455 A.2d 966, 972 (1983) (This Court decided \u201c \u2018to construe the statute more narrowly than its literal wording,\u2019 \u201d in order to avoid a substantial constitutional question); <em>Mangum v. Md. St. Bd. of Censors, </em>273 Md. 176, 187-192, 328 A.2d 283, 289-292 (1974) (Construing the definition of \u201cobscenity\u201d narrowly in light of First Amendment requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Section 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article, with the majority\u2019s broad construction of the statute, presents serious constitutional issues. Like the statutes involved in the above-cited cases, it should be construed more narrowly to avoid those constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The statute is sweeping, rendering a Maryland resident ineligible for a Maryland driver\u2019s license if previously he or she had a driver\u2019s license revoked, suspended, or canceled in any other state, or was refused a driver\u2019s license in any other state. Moreover, \u201cany other state,\u201d for purposes of this statute, even includes the Provinces of Canada. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11-101 and 11-161 of the Transportation Article. In addition, if the statute is given its broadest possible meaning, as the majority does, the grounds for the action in \u201cany other state\u201d are irrelevant. Even if those grounds would not disqualify a native Marylander from obtaining a driver\u2019s license, and even if the grounds are discriminatory, arbitrary, or contrary to strong Maryland public policy, the action in the \u201cother state\u201d would render the applicant ineligible for a Maryland driver\u2019s license. Literally, if the \u201cother state\u201d had suspended the applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license because of his or her race, color, national origin, gender, religion, or any other arbitrary reason, the applicant, after moving to Maryland, would be ineligible for a Maryland driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The broad, sweeping interpretation of \u00a7 16-103.1(1), advocated by the MVA and adopted by the majority, is illustrated by the following colloquy during the oral argument before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: Let me ask you a hypothetical, [perhaps an] unrealistic hypothetical, but it will illustrate a point. Suppose the Province of Quebec passes a statute that says anyone who cannot speak French doesn\u2019t get a license and everybody who has a Quebec driver\u2019s license who doesn\u2019t speak French gets suspended for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cJudge Wilner: Until you learn to speak French.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: So let\u2019s say somebody who\u2019s unable to learn French comes to Maryland, resettles in Maryland, has had his [Quebec] license suspended because he\u2019s not French-speaking and applies to MVA for a Maryland\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Are you going to give it to him or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: Well if the person truthfully fills out the application, and reports----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u201cJudge Eldridge: Truthfully. [He] says I\u2019m suspended in Quebec, attaches ... the Quebec statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: I believe that Canadian ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: No Constitutional argument, ... the U.S. [Constitution], you know, doesn\u2019t apply to Quebec.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cCounsel for MVA; I believe that ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: But Quebec, as I understand, is a state under the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: I believe a Canadian suspension would be reported under the national driver registry and the MVA would reject that application, as it\u2019s required to do by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: Under my hypothetical he could never drive in Maryland unless he [goes] back to Quebec, learns to speak French, and gets a Quebec driver\u2019s license, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-10\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: Well, I\u2019m not ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-11\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: That\u2019s a yes or no question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-12\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: Whether he would never be able to ... he may have a legal remedy, 1 don\u2019t know that it\u2019s in Maryland. It might be a federal remedy. But I would agree that in Maryland he doesn\u2019t have a remedy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-13\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: By federal, [do] you mean federal in Canada, or federal here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: Yeah, federal in ... well maybe both. Perhaps. But I don\u2019t believe he has a Maryland remedy under the licensing laws. That suspension is in effect and the MVA is under [a] mandatory duty to reject it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-15\">\u201cJudge Raker: So your answer is yes to Judge Eldridge\u2019s question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-16\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-17\">\u201cJudge Eldridge: You won\u2019t give him a license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-18\">\u201cCounsel for MVA: Won\u2019t be ... he\u2019ll plainly be rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-19\">A person whose presence in the United States is federally unauthorized, who has been refused a driver\u2019s license in New Jersey because of his or her immigration status, and who later becomes a resident of Maryland, will be ineligible for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Maryland driver\u2019s license under the MVA\u2019s and the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article. On the other hand, a person whose presence in the United States is federally unauthorized, who has been given a driver\u2019s license in Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington or any other state having the same driver\u2019s license policy as Maryland\u2019s, and who later becomes a resident of Maryland, will be eligible for a Maryland driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Making a Maryland resident\u2019s eligibility for a Maryland driver\u2019s license depend upon which state or province was the person\u2019s previous residence certainly appears to lack any rational basis. Moreover, the grounds of refusal in the other state or province could be utterly arbitrary or discriminatory. The MVA\u2019s and the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 16-103.1(1) obviously presents substantial issues under the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See, e.g., Maryland Green Party v. Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 156-164, 832 A.2d 214, 231-236 (2003); <em>Frankel v. Board of Regents, </em>361 Md. 298, 312-318, 761 A.2d 324, 331-335 (2000); <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 416-427, 635 A.2d 967, 969-975 (1994); <em>Kirsch v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>331 Md. 89, 104-108, 626 A.2d 372, 379-381 (1993); <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 704-728, 426 A.2d 929, 940-954 (1981). A narrower construction of \u00a7 16-103.1(1) would avoid the significant equal protection issues presented by the majority\u2019s broad construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In the absence of congressional legislation governing the issue, the eligibility of Maryland residents, whose presence in Maryland is federally unauthorized, to obtain Maryland driver\u2019s licenses is a policy matter for the General Assembly of Maryland. This is true regardless of one\u2019s individual political position about the issue. The General Assembly\u2019s policy decision concerning the issue should be respected by the Judiciary and the MVA. Clearly, Maryland\u2019s public policy in this regard should not be dictated by \u201cany other state\u201d including foreign provinces, particularly when it results in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>similarly situated Maryland residents being treated differently without any rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Judge Greene authorized me to state that he joins the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. According to a November 2007 Report of the National Immigration Law Center, at least eight states do not have lawful presence requirements as a condition for drivers licenses. Several other states do not have such a statutory requirement but, apparently, may have such a requirement administratively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">. The majority, in footnote 4, states that, even if Alavez were treated the same as a person whose Maryland driver\u2019s license was suspended for using a false document, \"it would avail Alavez naught.\u201d The majority's statement is erroneous. If Alavez had a Maryland driver\u2019s license suspended because he used a false document to obtain the license, he would not face a lifetime suspension. Neither side disputed this fact at oral argument. Instead, it was pointed out that he could apply for reinstatement of his Maryland driver\u2019s license and it could be reinstated after 12 months. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-208(a)(l) of the Transportation Article which prohibits the MVA from suspending \"a license of privilege to drive for a period of more than 1 year.\u201d Even if a license is revoked because of points, it may be reinstated after a period of time. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-208(b)(2)(ii) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
