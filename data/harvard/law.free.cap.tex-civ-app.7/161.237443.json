Crosby, Commissioner General Land Office.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\"><em>Conclusions of </em>Law.\u2014This suit was to try the title to a third of a league, the headright of Lewis Duel, in Atascosa County, the plaintiffs being admitted to be the heirs of P. H. Coe.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Plaintiffs relied upon their ancestor Coe being the common source of title, and introduced a chain of transfers under said Coe to the defendant Ellen Tom to 984 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The defendants, Ellen Tom and Marietta Adams, pleaded not guilty, improvements, etc., and the former asked for a decree confirming and quieting her title to 983 acres, and the latter for a decree confirming her title to 492 acres, of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">Each of the aforesaid defendants introduced a chain of transfer to herself emanating from P. H. Coe, and the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">The case is brought here by appellants upon a question relating to the effect of the deed from the independent executrix of the will of P. \u201eH. Coe to A. P. Towns (dated August 1, 1853), under whom defendants have conveyances. This deed from Coe\u2019s executrix to Towns purported to convey \u201call the right, title, and interest which1 said Coe, deceased, had in and to the following lands,- certificates for lands, bonds, etc., to wit: One-third of league of land, abstract number \u2014, granted to Lewis Duel by virtue of patent number \u2014, volume \u2014.\u201d The deed then proceeds and describes other lands specifically as to the county in which situated, and otherwise. The above in quotations is all the matter of description that by any possibility relates to the tract sued for, and there is omitted from this description the locality of the third of a league, the abstract, and the patent numbers, and in view of these omissions, and the fact shown in the record that the headright by which the land was located did not issue until December 29, 1853, it is insisted that the said deed was not sufficient to convey title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>land in question. Appellants urge that the deed fails for want of description, and that it must be held that the certificate by which the land was secured not being then in existence, the deed has no reference to the land in controversy.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b186-9\">Delivered April 25, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The certificate issued on December 21,1853, recites that Lewis Duel, having entered the service of Texas and fallen with Travis at the Alamo, his heirs were entitled to a one-third league of land as the headright of said Lewis Duel, under the provisions of the Act of February 9, 1850, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">It is judicially known that certificates for one-third of a league of land were headrights, and of such the beneficiary was not granted more than one. It follows, therefore, that the deed was sufficiently specific to designate as its subject matter the certificate which was located upon the survey in question, to wit, the headright of said Duel, and it could apply to nothing else. It is clear, whatever right P. H. Coe had in said certificate, under the evidence before us, it was divested from his heirs by the deed from his executrix to Towns, and under the deed from Towns has become vested in the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Fly, Associate Justice, did not sit in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Writ of error refused by Supreme Court, June 28, 1894.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
