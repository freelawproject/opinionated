A. Wyatt, is a will or a deed. It recites as its consideration, \u201clove and affection,\u201d \u201cand other valuable considerations;\u201d contains the usual granting, habendum, and warranty clauses, and concludes as follows: \u201cBut it is hereby expressly understood, that I reserve to myself the full ownership and control of the above named premises during my natural life, and that at my death this property belongs to the said J. H. Wyatt. This is the same land which was deeded to my husband, Calvin Wyatt, and his bodily heirs, by Stephen C. Rogen and his wife, Josephine C. Rogen, on the 18th day of July, 1860, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>intended as a relinquishment of all my interest in the same, except the ownership and control during my natural life.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b63-8\">Delivered April 4, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The court below found that the instrument had been executed and delivered at the date specified; that the only consideration for its execution was natural love and affection; and, in effect, that it was intended by the grantor to convey, at the date of its execution, all her interest except a life estate in the land in controversy; concluding, therefore, that the instrument was a deed, and not a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In this conclusion we concur, and affirm the judgment, especially in view of article 556 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
