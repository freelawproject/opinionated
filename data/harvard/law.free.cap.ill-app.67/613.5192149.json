B. Preston &amp; Co., by C. E. Jenkins, manager, dated Chicago, Illinois, September 11, 1891, having reference to the manufacture and sale of a certain improved hose attachment and swivel, patented August 20, 1891, patent number 409,512, and that we will proceed no further under that contract. We cancel this contract because the patented article has proved to be unsalable, and the contract running for no definite time, we have the privilege, after the first year, of canceling the contract when we see fit.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-9\" pgmap=\"613\">We do not, by this letter, mean to admit any liability to you under this contract, except for royalties on the hose attachment and swivels actually sold by us thereunder.

B. Pbestox &amp; Co,\u201d</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\" pgmap=\"614\">Upon receipt of this notice, appellee served upon E. B. Preston &amp; Co., the following:</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\" pgmap=\"614\">\u201c Chicago. Sept. 17, 1894.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\" pgmap=\"614\">E. B. Preston &amp; Co., care Flower, Smith &amp; Musgrave, Chicago, Ill.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\" pgmap=\"614\">Gentlemen : I do not understand that you have the right to cancel, without my consent, a certain contract signed by your company and myself, dated Chicago, Illinois, September 11,1891, and I hereby notify you that I shall adhere to that contract, and if you fail to perform your part of it, I shall hold you liable for all damages.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-8\" pgmap=\"614\">C. L. Smith.\u201d .</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-9\" pgmap=\"614\">Appellant insisted that as Everett B. Preston, who did business as E. B. Preston &amp; Co., had, since the entering into said contract, and after serving the above notices, died, such death terminated said contract.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-10\" pgmap=\"614\">The finding of the court was for four hundred and fifty dollars per year for the remaining term of thirteen years, less interest.</p><attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-11\" pgmap=\"614\">Flower, Smith &amp; Musgrave, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-12\" pgmap=\"614\">McGlasson &amp; Beitler, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b614-13\" pgmap=\"614\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AiLh\" pgmap=\"614\">delivebed the opinion op the Coubt.</p> <p id=\"b614-14\" pgmap=\"614\">A right to, in a certain contingency, cancel the contract, was reserved- to appellee, while Preston had no such privilege. The attempt by Preston to bring the undertaking to an end was nugatory, and properly treated by appellee as such.</p> <p id=\"b614-15\" pgmap=\"614\">The agreement was a personal undertaking upon the part of Preston, which he could not transfer, and which did not, at his death, devolve upon his executors.</p> <p id=\"b614-16\" pgmap=\"614(45) 615(93)\">In effect, the contention of appellee is that the executors of E. B. Preston are bound for twelve years to continue \u201c to furnish \u201d C. L. Smith with what his wants may be of this hose attachment, of any size manufactured, at a margin of twenty per cent above cost, said cost to be agreed upon, \u201c he retaining \u201d the right to sell these goods at market price, agreed upon between \u201chim\u201d and said executors; and that the said executors shall push the sale of this swivel by advertising, exhibiting and soliciting trade by their traveling salesmen, or other employes; and shall keep at all times in stock such quantities as will supply the market for demand, and to use their best efforts to create a large demand and a heavy sale of this article.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b615-4\" pgmap=\"615\">In other words, that these executors are bound to continue for twelve years to carry on the business of the late E. B. Preston.</p> <p id=\"b615-5\" pgmap=\"615\">The contract under consideration contains no such compact. It is manifest that the parties contemplated the personal services of Hr. Preston, his endeavors, skill and effort, and not that of persons appointed to administer upon his estate.</p> <p id=\"b615-6\" pgmap=\"615\">The agreements mentioned, to be made as to cost and prices, were to be between appellee and Hr. Preston, not between his executors and \u201c O. L. Smith.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b615-7\" pgmap=\"615\">Contracts for personal service which can only be performed during the lifetime of the party contracting, are subject to the implied condition of his continuing to live and to be in health to perform them, and are terminated by his death or incapacity from illness.
