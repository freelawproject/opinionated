The declaration contained a special count under the statute permitting the drawer and indorser to be sued jointly, and the common counts. The special count was on a check made by appellant Brady, payable to appellant McCarty, and by him indorsed in blank and delivered.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-7\" pgmap=\"636\">In addition to the general issue, two special pleas were filed : First, that the check was simply an accommodation check. Second, that the check was never intended to be used. By stipulation, all defenses were to go. in under the general issue., and all evidence to go in under the common counts. The case was tried by the court, the parties waiving a jury. The check was offered in evidence, and appellees proved that it was presented in due season for payment to the bank, and payment refused for want of funds.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-8\" pgmap=\"636\">. The defendants testified that the check was loaned, merely as an accommodation check; the plaintiff's then testified that the check was given as a deposit on a real estate contract entered into between McCarty and one Johnson, McCarty\u2019s name being used by Brady, who was the real party, McCarty having no interest in the transaction; that this trade fell through; that Brady\u2019s property in Kansas 'City was contracted to be sold to Johnson for $30,000, and that appellees were entitled to recover for commissions on such sale, Brady having refused to carry it out. Appellees testified that McCarty, as they knew all the while, had no interest in the transaction, having merely loaned the use of his name to Brady.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-9\" pgmap=\"636\">Johnson &amp; McDannold, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-10\" pgmap=\"636\">Edward J.

They were not misinformed, and- did not sell, or try to sell, any property belonging to McCarty.</p> <p id=\"b637-6\" pgmap=\"637\">Such being the case, they were not, taking their statement as to the facts to be entirely true, entitled to recover against McCarty.</p> <p id=\"b637-7\" pgmap=\"637\">Bor were they, the action being 6\u00ae contractu for a joint promise, entitled to recover against one defendant only; they could have a recovery against all the defendants or none. United Workmen et al. v. Zuhlke, 129 Ill. 298.</p> <p id=\"b637-8\" pgmap=\"637\">It is therefore unnecessary for us to discuss the conflicting and irreconcilable testimony given upon the trial.</p> <p id=\"b637-9\" pgmap=\"637\">The cause having been tried without a jury, the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and a judgment will be here entered for appellants, upon a finding of facts.</p> <p id=\"b637-10\" pgmap=\"637\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for appellants here, with finding of facts.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
