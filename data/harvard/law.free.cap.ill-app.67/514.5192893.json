The breach alleged is, that defendant did not safely and securely deliver the same to plaintiffs, but by the misconduct and negligence of defendants and its servants, the two telescope cases were broken and destroyed, and a portion of the contents of the same .were lost to plaintiffs.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-11\" pgmap=\"512(41) 513(27)\">The evidence for plaintiffs was that of one Samuel Moskowitz. He testified that he was a traveling salesman in the \u2022employ of plaintiffs, and sold fur capes and collars for plaintiffs, who were fur manufacturers, and, being such salesman, he had in his possession at Cleveland, Ohio, on April 18, L891, the telescope cases in question, which were, with, the contents, the property of plaintiffs.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\" pgmap=\"513\">The witness went to the baggagemaster of defendant, at Cleveland, Ohio, told him that he had his sample cases there, wished them checked for Chicago, and he asked the said baggagemaster if he would promise to send them to Chicago by the first train, and to have them there by Monday morning, as on that day he had an engagement with a house there, to show his samples. The baggageman promised to send them by the next train.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\" pgmap=\"513\">Moskowitz delivered the cases to the baggagemaster and got two checks for theA, but did not come on the train with his baggage, taking a later train.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\" pgmap=\"513\">The telescope cases in question were checked on the strength of a ticket possessed by Moskowitz, the traveling salesman of plaintiffs, and on the faith of representations made by him at the time the same were checked, that the sample cases were his own.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\" pgmap=\"513\">Moskowitz says that he received twenty-five capes and thirty-three collars, and that there were eighteen capes and four collars lost; and this suit is to recover for the articles lost.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-8\" pgmap=\"513\">A jury was waived by the parties, and the cause was heard by the court without a jury. The court found the defendant guilty, and assessed plaintiffs\u2019 damages at $326.61. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled, and judgment on this finding was rendered against the defendant, April 8, 1896, for the said sum of $326.61.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-9\" pgmap=\"513\">The value of the articles missing and sued for was $270.91.
