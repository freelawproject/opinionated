Fry, superintendent, does agree to pay to parties of first part $11,500 on certificates of superintendent as work progresses.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\" pgmap=\"133\">The contract also contains the following:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-10\" pgmap=\"133(157) 134(66)\">\u201c It is further agreed that in case any difference of opinion shall arise between said parties in relation to the contract, the work to be performed under it, or in relation to the plans, drawings and specifications hereunto attached, the decision of Frank L. Fry, the architect, shall be final and binding on all parties hereunder, or, if preferred, the decision of an umpire selected by two men, one of whom is appointed by the owner and the other one by the contractor, shall be final and binding on all parties hereunder. The owner has engaged Frank L. Fry as superintendent of the erection and completion of said building, his duties being faithfully to enforce all the conditions of the contract, and to furnish all necessary drawings, etc. * * * Also to make estimates for the contracts of the amounts due them on the contract, in no case estimating any materials or work which are objectionable or have become permanent parts of the work, and when the building is completed to issue a certificate to the contractor, which certificate, if unconditional, shall be an acceptance of the contract, and shall release him from all further responsibility on account of the work, the owner being bound in all cases to recognize the acts of his superintendent.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\" pgmap=\"134\">Appellees offered in evidence in support of their claim the contract above mentioned, and also the architect\u2019s certificate, dated December 16,1893, certifying that $474 is due John Wagner &amp; Son, by the terms of contract.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\" pgmap=\"134\">Henry Lindeman. appellant, on the witness stand denied giving any authority to Charles S. Fry to sign any contracts for him, and that said Charles S. Fry had informed him that said mason work would not cost over $9,000. The testimony shows that the buildings were not completed until some weeks after the time specified in the contract.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\" pgmap=\"134\">It was claimed by appellant that the work was not done in a good and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the contract, and the claim was supported by the testimony of two architects.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\" pgmap=\"134\">Appellant, in a plea of set-off, set up a counter-claim of $3,300 for delay, and damage in not completing the building in a workmanlike manner.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-8\" pgmap=\"134\">F.

It does not appear that the architect acted fraudulently; he may have erred in thinking that the work was well done\u2014the testimony given on behalf of appellant tends to show that he did\u2014but there is no evidence to the effect that the architect was actuated by any improper motive. The burden of showing that the archite\u00f3t fraudulently gave the certificate in question, was upon appellant; this he did not show. The mere fact that the building was not completed at the agreed time, and that the architect allowed appellees the full contract price, did not establish that the certificate was fraudulently issued.</p> <p id=\"b135-4\" pgmap=\"135\">It is too late for appellant to contend that he did not authorize Fry, the architect, to sign the agreement.</p> <p id=\"b135-5\" pgmap=\"135\">Appellant accepted such signing, acted under the contract with full knowledge of how it was made, and is bound thereby.</p> <p id=\"b135-6\" pgmap=\"135\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
