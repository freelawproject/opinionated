Ency. of Law, 923.</p> <p id=\"b351-8\" pgmap=\"351\">Damages resulting from negligent operation are not presumed to have been taken into account when the right of way was procured, but only such as necessarily and naturally result, though due and proper care be exercised. O. &amp; M. R. R. v.

The verdict was largely based upon such evidence and is clearly excessive, if such testimony was not.competent.</p> <p id=\"b351-12\" pgmap=\"351\">The alleged nuisances did not effect a permanent change in the property of appellee, and were, within themselves, temporary in character. They were illegal and, the law assumes, will not continue forever.</p> <p id=\"b351-13\" pgmap=\"351\">It was, therefore,\" not proper to receive evidence that the property had been permanently depreciated in value.</p> <p id=\"b351-14\" pgmap=\"351\">The assessment should have been for past, not perspective damages.</p> <p id=\"b352-5\" pgmap=\"352\">The theory of law is the infliction of past damages will cause the abatement of a temporary nuisance.</p> <p id=\"b352-6\" pgmap=\"352\">If it does not, successive actions may be maintained, and damages, both compensatory and exemplary, awarded until the wrong-doing is discontinued.
