Twenty-five of said notes were for $25 each, and payable one every month. The notes were paid as they became due until nine notes had been paid, the tenth note falling due June 26, 1893.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\" pgmap=\"299\">About June 13, 189.3, Gustafson made a sale to Eric Anderson, appellant herein, of all his goods and chattels at said saloon, including the mortgaged property. (An offer was made during the trial to show that Gustafson obtained from the Merle &amp; Heaney Manufacturing Company its verbal consent that he might make such sale before the sale was made, and while said company still owned the notes and mortgage, but the court refused to admit such evidence.)</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\" pgmap=\"299\">Immediately upon the sale to Anderson the saloon was closed, and was never again opened for business. On or about June 17,1893, the South Chicago Brewing Company, hearing that the saloon was closed, entered a judgment of confession against said Gustafson on a judgment note dated November 30, 1892, for $419. After June 13, and on or before June 21, 1893, the Merle &amp; Heaney Manufacturing Company transferred Gustafson\u2019s notes and mortgage to the Garden City Banking and Trust Company; and on June 21, 1893, the South Chicago Brewing Company purchased said notes and mortgage from the bank, paying therefor the face of the notes with accrued interest. Immediately upon obtaining possession of said notes and mortgage, the brewing company, through its secretary, Mr. Lederer, placed said mortgage in the hands of Constable Murphy, with instructions to foreclose at once. Said constable went direct to said saloon and took possession of the mortgaged goods, and posted notices of a sale, giving as a cause of foreclosure, that the mortgagee \u201cfelt unsafe and insecure and feared a waste of said property.\u201d On June 23d following, the sheriff levied under the execution issued in confession of judgment against Gustafson, and on June 30, 1892, Eric Anderson sued out the replevin writ herein.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\" pgmap=\"299\">The declaration has three counts:</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\" pgmap=\"299\">First.
