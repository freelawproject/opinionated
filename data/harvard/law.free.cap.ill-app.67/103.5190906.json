The case was continued to January 28, 1896, when the parties thereto were present in court. What was the subject-matter of the action, or the evidence therein, does not appear. The justice docket recites as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\" pgmap=\"101\">\u201c Parties present, plaintiff sworn and examined, and defendant confesses and. acknowledges that he is indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of one hundred and twenty-five dollars and costs of suit; \u201d then follows an entry of judgment in the usual form.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-13\" pgmap=\"101(30) 102(19)\">The defendant took an appeal to the Circuit Court of Cook County. On March 28,1896, that court, on motion of plaintiff, dismissed the appeal on the ground that an appeal does not lie from a judgment by confession in justice court, and that this was a judgment by confession.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-4\" pgmap=\"102\">W.
