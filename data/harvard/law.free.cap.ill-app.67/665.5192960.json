Ho will shall be permitted to control the appointment or distribution of or rights of any person to any endowment payable by this order.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b664-5\" pgmap=\"664\">The validity of this by-law, we do not think admits of question; the effect of it is the subject of inquiry.</p> <p id=\"b664-6\" pgmap=\"664\">The certificate implied that James might, in the event of the death of his wife during his life, make \u201c other or further disposition \u201d of the sum payable under the certificate.</p> <p id=\"b664-7\" pgmap=\"664\">The privilege could not be exercised under the provision that he might surrender the certificate, and take a new one payable to some other person, for such action would not be \u201c other or further disposition \u201d of the sum payable under the original certificate, but an abandonment of that certificate.</p> <p id=\"b664-8\" pgmap=\"664\">The privilege of \u201c other or further disposition \u201d was to be exercised only in the event of the death of Maggie while James lived, and it was the money to which she would have been entitled, had he died first, of which the \u201c other or further disposition \u201d could be made.</p> <p id=\"b664-9\" pgmap=\"664\">If, therefore, the by-law quoted had not been enacted, the right of the appellee would be clear.</p> <p id=\"b664-10\" pgmap=\"664\">How, the first sentence of that by-law does not refer to the will of the person who took out the certificate; but to the will of some person who is to take a benefit under it.</p> <p id=\"b664-11\" pgmap=\"664\">The second sentence is ambiguous. Broken up into clauses, it may be read: \u201c Ho will shall be permitted to control the appointment of any person to any endowment. Ho will shall be permitted to control the distribution of any endowment. Ho will shall be permitted to control the rights of any person to any endowment.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b664-12\" pgmap=\"664\">But as the right to make \u201c other or further disposition,\u201d if Maggie died, was reserved to James, and no mode of its exercise .named, he might exercise it in any way not in conflict with the laws of the appellant, or with general law.</p> <p id=\"b665-3\" pgmap=\"665\">Any law of the appellant restricting the exercise of the right, should be reasonably plain, not requiring the abstruse reasoning of a doctor of laws to arrive at its meaning. \"Upon the maxim noscitur a sdciis, the second sentence refers only to such wills as the first sentence does.</p> <p id=\"b665-4\" pgmap=\"665\">References to many authorities are in City of Cairo v. Coleman, 53 Ill. App. 680; Broom, L. M. 588.</p> <p id=\"b665-5\" pgmap=\"665\">In our judgment the will of James was a valid disposition of the sum payable under the certificate, and entitled the appellee to the money. That he intended that the words he used in his will should give the money to her, can not be doubted, and in construing the will, his intention is the primary consideration.</p> <p id=\"b665-6\" pgmap=\"665\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b665-7\" pgmap=\"665\">Mr. Justice Waterman,</author> <p id=\"A-S\" pgmap=\"665\">dissenting.</p> <p id=\"b665-8\" pgmap=\"665\">Sec. 3 of Art. 12 is as follows: \u201cA member may at any time, when in good standing, surrender his endowment certificate, and a new certificate shall be thereafter issued payable to such beneficiary or beneficiaries as such member may direct, in accordance with the laws of the order, upon the payment of a fee of fifty cents. Said surrender and direction must be made in writing, signed by the member and forwarded under seal of the subordinate court with the endowment certificate to the high secretary.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b665-9\" pgmap=\"665\">The member, in taking his certificate, agrees to be bound by the by-laws then in force and such as might thereafter be adopted.</p> <p id=\"b665-10\" pgmap=\"665\">The following by-law was thereafter adopted:</p> <blockquote id=\"b665-11\" pgmap=\"665\">\u201c No entry shall be made in any application or endowment certificate, or otherwise, permitting the designation by, or ascertainment by reference to, any will of the person or persons, trustees or beneficiaries, to whom any endowment shall be payable, or the amount or share of any benefit. Mo will shall be permitted to control the appointment or distribution of or rights of any person to any endowment payable by this order.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b665-12\" pgmap=\"665(12) 666(15)\">It is manifest that it was intended by the by-law last set forth, to put at rest all claim, of right to designate by will a beneficiary.</p> <p id=\"b666-5\" pgmap=\"666\">I see no reason why the plain meaning of the by-law should not be enforced:</p> <p id=\"b666-6\" pgmap=\"666\">The member, by his will, instead of designating appellee as the beneficiary, willed to her \u201c all the remainder of his personal estate, including anything that may come to his estate by reason of his insurance,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b666-7\" pgmap=\"666\">Hothing goes to his estate by reason of the insurance.</p> <p id=\"b666-8\" pgmap=\"666\">Wills are to be construed according to the intention of the testator, and it may, perhaps, be fairly said that the deceased thought that the insurance money would go to his estate, and so willed it to his sister instead of, in a proper manner, exercising the power of appointment which he had, and which the new by-law forbade the exercise of by will.</p> <p id=\"b666-9\" pgmap=\"666\">The mode of changing the beneficiary specified in the contract must be substantially followed. \u00cd\u00ediblack on Benefit Societies, Sec. 218; Mellows v.
