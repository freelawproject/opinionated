Tracy a new benefit certificate, by the terms of which the benefit which might become due thereunder was to be payable \u201c to Annie E. Tracy, Elizabeth Tracy and Agnes Tracy, daughters of said Thomas P. Tracy, each one-third.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-12\" pgmap=\"203\">Thomas P. Tracy died September 21, 1894. It is admitted that at the time of his death he was a member in good standing of said Northwestern Council No. 315.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-13\" pgmap=\"203(88) 204(308)\">Thomas P. Tracy was married twice. Three of the children of his first wife are the appellants, Annie Tracy, Elizabeth Tracy and Agnes Tracy. The appellee was his second wife. She was a widow at the time she married Tracy in 1882. The evidence shows that at the time of her marriage with Tracy she had about $1,500; that Tracy had some money, but not a large amount, and that in the summer or fall of the year 1885, he purchased with the joint money of himself and wife, she contributing the said $1,500, the real estate described in the bill of complaint. The evidence further shows that Tracy agreed that if she would contribute said sum of money toward the purchase of said real estate, he would join the Eoyal Arcanum, from which he would receive a benefit certificate for .$3,000, and that he would deliver it to her; that he did join, as above stated, Northwestern Council No. 315, and receive and deliver to appellee the benefit certificate, a copy of which is herein given, and that appellee kept said certificate locked up in her trunk, and beyond his control, until after her husband\u2019s death. It further appears that appellee paid the greater part, if not all, of the assessments which were due under said certificate amounting in the aggregate to about $500. The bill alleges, and the proof introduced seems to support the allegation, \u201c that in order to induce your oratrix to permit said Thomas P. Tracy, deceased, to put the said sum of money into real estate above referred to, said Thomas P. Tracy agreed to and did deliver to your orator said insurance policy as indemnity against loss to your oratrix for the advance of said money, and then and there in the presence of witnesses delivered to your oratrix his said insurance policy, as and for her own, to keep and to have and to hold the same in lieu of said money so advanced by your oratrix as aforesaid, with the understanding and agreement that when he should die the said policy and the money thereby secured was to become the property of your oratrix and her heirs, in consideration of the said sum of $1,500 so to him advanced on said real estate bought in his name as aforesaid.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\" pgmap=\"204\">The claim of appellee is based upon the following allegation in her bill of complaint:</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\" pgmap=\"204(82) 205(60)\">\u201c Tour oratrix charges the fact to be that she is in equity the assignee of said certificate for value, and that she is the equitable owner of said certificate, by reason of said assignment to her for value, as above stated, and that it is not, nor was not, within the power of said Thomas P. Tracy, or said Eoyal Arcanum, or its officers, to cancel such certificate, in manner as above set forth, and that the issuance of any other certificate to other beneficiaries, in lieu of the one above described, under the circumstances above set forth, is void and is fraudulent, as against the right of your oratrix, and that the same, if any, was made without the knowledge or consent of your oratrix, and that the said new certificate is and should be declared void accordingly.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-4\" pgmap=\"205\">The prayer of the bill is, that the new benefit certificate issued to Annie Tracy, Elizabeth Tracy and Agnes Tracy, the daughters of Thomas P. Tracy, \u201c be declared void, and that the attempt to cancel the certificate, Ho. 65,078, of September 8, 1885, above referred to, be declared void and of no effect, and that your oratrix may be declared to be' the legal and equitable owner of the money secured by said certificate, Ho. 65,078, by reason of an equitable interest therein in favor of the complainant, and that the said Royal Arcanum may be decreed to pay the same over to your oratrix by a short day, or that the money collectible of the Royal Arcanum, on the death of said Thomas P. Tracy, as indemnity, on his life, be paid over to your oratrix, as the equitable owner thereof.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205\">The original bill sought, also, to have the devise of the real estate above referred to, to Thomas P. Tracy\u2019s children, set aside, but a demurrer to this portion of the bill was sustained by the court.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\" pgmap=\"205\">A decree as to the benefit certificate, in accordance with the prayer of the bill, ivas rendered, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-7\" pgmap=\"205\">H.

Y. 423.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-4\" pgmap=\"206\">The fact that a member applying for a change of beneficiary by affidavit, or otherwise, does not state truly the reason why he does not produce and surrender the original certificate, is a matter of no concern to the old beneficiary, for the simple reason that such beneficiary has no vested interest in the benefit.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\" pgmap=\"206\">The requirement that the member shall account for the non-production of the certificate is made for the benefit of the order, and may be waived by it. All that is required in the case of the Boyal Arcanum is that the member shall make \u201c an affidavit of the facts in the case satisfactory to the supreme secretary, and pay a fee of fifty cents.\u201d Splawn v.

Equitable rights thereto may be acquired, which a court of chancery will enforce. Bispham\u2019s Principles of Equity, Ch. VIII, 162,167,168.</p> <p id=\"b206-10\" pgmap=\"206(69) 207(36)\">Mrs. Tracy was, for a valuable consideration, the beneficiary named in, and the actual holder of Mr. Tracy\u2019s insurance certificate. For a large sum by her paid, the certificate was given to her; she kept it, and paid the dues subsequently accruing thereon. As between Thomas Tra-cv and his wife, he then had no right to attempt to surrender this certificate and obtain another payable to his daughfcers. What he attempted, looking to such end, was not only based upon his false affirmation as to loss of the certificate, but was an attempt to fraudulently deprive his wife of what she equitably owned.</p> <p id=\"b207-4\" pgmap=\"207\">What her rights would have been against a person to whom another certificate had been, in good faith, for value, issued, or against the company, had it, without notice of her claim, paid to the beneficiaries named in the second certificate, the insurance money, it is unnecessary to consider. Ho such question is here presented.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">It is manifest that had she been informed that her husband was about to surrender his certificate and have another issued to new beneficiaries, she might have applied to a court of equity to restrain such contemplated surrender and issue. High on Injunctions, Sec. 1113.</p> <p id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207\">She is here a holder for value contending against mere volunteers, whose claim came into existence through the frandulent conduct and misrepresentation of their donor.</p> <p id=\"b207-7\" pgmap=\"207\">As to such, it was not necessary that the holder of the fund, in whose hands it yet is, and who knew that the certificate made for her benefit was outstanding, should have been notified of the assignment to, and payments by, her, and as against such volunteers her right is clear.
