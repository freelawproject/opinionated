Brown v. Miner, 21 Ill. App. 60; same case, 128 Ill. 148.</p> <p id=\"b678-7\" pgmap=\"678\">A default which had not occurred\u2014failure to pay taxes\u2014 could not be alleged in the bill. When such default happened, it was not necessary that a supplemental bill, setting this up, should be filed. Brown v. Miner, 21 Ill. App. 60.</p> <p id=\"b678-8\" pgmap=\"678\">The allegations of the bill regarding the trust deed were \u00a1sufficient to make the trust deed a part of the bill, for the purpose of permitting appellees to make proof of payment \u00a1of taxes pendente lite.</p> <p id=\"b678-9\" pgmap=\"678\">In equity, relief will not be denied, because of mere vari\u2022ance, unless the case stated and the case found are so materially variant as to prevent a decree in favor of the complainant. 1 Barton\u2019s Ohy. Pr. 260.</p> <p id=\"b678-10\" pgmap=\"678\">In stating deeds or other written instruments in a bill, it \u2022is usual to refer to the instrument itself, in some such words as the following, namely: \u201c as by the said indenture, when produced, will appear.\u201d The effect of such reference is to make the whole instrument referred to part of the record. 'The effect of referring to it is to enable the plaintiff to rely upon every part of the instrument, and to prevent his being precluded from availing himself, at the hearing, of any portion, either of its recital or operative part, which may not be inserted in the bill. Thus it seems that a plaintiff may, by his bill, state simply the date and general purport of anv particular deed or instrument under which he claims, and that such statement, provided it is accompanied by a reference to the deed itself, will be sufficient. 1 Daniell\u2019s Oh. PI. &amp; Pr. (6th Am. Ed.) p. 369; Swetland v. Swetland, 3 Mich. 482.</p> <p id=\"b679-3\" pgmap=\"679\">The solicitor\u2019s fee allowed was shown to be reasonable, and was properly included in the decree. Telford v. Gar. rels, 132 Ill. 555.</p> <p id=\"b679-4\" pgmap=\"679\">In the present case, the trust deed directly authorizes such inclusion.</p> <p id=\"b679-5\" pgmap=\"679\">The payment of the taxes was for the benefit of appellant, and the decree for solicitor\u2019s fees only what he stipulated for. The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
