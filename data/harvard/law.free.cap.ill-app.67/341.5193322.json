The court refused a motion for new trial and' rendered a judgment on the verdict, from which the present appeal is prosecuted. The question argued in the brief of appellant is whether the evidence supports the verdict. There was a square conflict. On the part of the appellees there was enough, if believed, to justify the conclusion that they dealt directly with the appellant, that it was so understood by the parties, and that the appellees had therefore a perfect right to call upon the appellant for the full amount due them for the wt&gt;rk.</p> <p id=\"b340-4\" pgmap=\"340\">On the other hand the evidence would, if credited and uncontradicted, justify the opposite conclusion and it was for the jury to determine the issue thus presented. It is urged that the court erred in permitting Austin to answer whether he contracted with appellees for the work in question because this called for a conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b340-5\" pgmap=\"340\">Whatever of error there was herein, was obviated by the subsequent testimony of the witness when he proceeded in detail to state what he said and did in that behalf, l\u00edo exception appears to any other rulings in the admission of evidence or the giving of instructions.</p> <p id=\"b340-6\" pgmap=\"340\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
