Mason passed away on December 3, 1999, and her will was admitted to probate on January 10, 2000. In her will, Dorothy Mason left her son, Richard F. Mason, a one-fourth interest in the proceeds from the sale of the real property in her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">{\u00b62} In June 2000, a law firm, appellee and cross-appellant, Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw, revived a judgment it had obtained against Richard Mason in 1994. A few months after reviving the 1994 judgment, Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw filed a garnishment action to attach Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate of.his mother and served the notice of garnishment on the executor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">{\u00b6 3} Over one year later, in late December 2001, the Hancock County Child Support Enforcement Agency filed a motion to intervene in the probate of Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate to present a creditor\u2019s bill on behalf of appellant and cross-appellee, Wilma J. Mason, in an attempt to collect on two postdivorce lump-sum judgments for spousal support arrearages she had obtained against Richard in 1991 and 1992. No certificates of judgment or execution on these judgments had been filed at the time the Hancock County Child Support Enforcement Agency moved to intervene on Wilma Mason\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On February 12, 2002, Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate sold a piece of real property, which resulted in funds becoming available for distribution to Richard Masqn under the terms of his mother\u2019s will. Later that month, Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw filed a motion to intervene in the probate of Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate in order to present a creditor\u2019s bill against Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 5} On March 7, 2002, appellee Lila Fagan obtained a judgment against Richard Mason for money owed. A few days later, she filed a garnishment action to attach Richard\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s estate and served the notice of garnishment on the executor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 6} On April 4, 2002, Wilma Mason revived her 1991 and 1992 lump-sum judgments against Richard Mason. That same month, Lila Fagan filed a motion to intervene in the probate of Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate to present a claim in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill against Richard Mason\u2019s share of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 7} In evaluating the competing claims against Richard Mason\u2019s share of the estate, the probate court ruled that a claim against a legatee\u2019s distributive share does not become a legal claim, and thus subject to garnishment, until the distributee\u2019s right to possess the gift becomes certain. The trial court further explained that the certainty of a gift becomes fixed at the earlier of the date of distribution or the date on which claims against the estate expire pursuant to R.C. 2117.06(B), which at the time of Dorothy Mason\u2019s death was one year after the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3899.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 8} Since there was no distribution, the probate court found that Richard Mason\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s estate became fixed, and therefore subject to garnishment, one year after Dorothy Mason\u2019s death. The court held that Richard\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s estate prior to that date was equitable and therefore attachable only through a creditor\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">{\u00b6 9} Further, the probate court ruled that Wilma Mason\u2019s 1991 and 1992 postdivorce judgments for past due spousal support were dormant and, therefore, unenforceable at the time she attempted to use a creditor\u2019s bill to attach Richard\u2019s interest in the estate. Although Wilma Mason had revived her judgments, she never filed for garnishment. Thus, the probate court determined that the priority of the competing claims against Richard\u2019s share of Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate was as follows: (1) Lila Fagan, (2) Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw, and (3) Wilma Mason.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 10} Wilma Mason appealed and Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw cross-appealed the probate court\u2019s decision to the Third District Court of Appeals. The appellate court reversed the probate court\u2019s holding that a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>automatically becomes subject to garnishment one year after the decedent\u2019s death, but affirmed the court\u2019s judgment, including its priority determination. <em>In re Estate of Mason, </em>Hancock App. No. 5-04-01, 2004-Ohio-5644, 2004 WL 2377865.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 11} The appellate court ruled that a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate remains contingent, and thus equitable and attachable, only through a creditor\u2019s bill until the executor of the estate has a definite amount available for distribution to the legatee. Id. at \u00b6 30. The court explained that once the executor possesses a definite amount ready to distribute to the legatee, the legatee\u2019s interest becomes an attachable legal interest subject to a garnishment action. Id. Consequently, the appellate court determined that prior to the February 12, 2002 sale of real property by Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate, Richard Mason\u2019s share of his mother\u2019s estate was equitable and could be attached only by a creditor\u2019s bill. Id. at \u00b6 31. Further, the court found that after the sale on February 12, 2002, the executor had a definite amount ready for distribution to Richard, thus making his interest in the estate a legal interest subject to garnishment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 12} Moreover, the appellate court rejected Wilma Mason\u2019s argument that Ohio\u2019s dormancy and revivor statutes do not apply to her 1991 and 1992 postdivorce judgments for past due spousal support. Id. at \u00b6 16. Rather, the court ruled that once an installment support order is reduced to a lump-sum judgment, the dormancy and revivor statutes begin to apply. Id. at \u00b6 15. The appellate court reasoned that since Wilma Mason had her unpaid spousal support orders from 1989 to 1991 reduced to two lump-sum judgments in 1991 and 1992, and because she never executed upon the judgments within five years of their issuance, these judgments became dormant. Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, the appellate court determined that only Wilma Mason had filed a creditor\u2019s bill before the February 12, 2002 sale and that only Lila Fagan had filed a garnishment after February 12, 2002. Id. at \u00b6 31. However, because Wilma Mason\u2019s 1991 and 1992 judgments were dormant when she filed her creditor\u2019s bill, the appellate court held that the creditor\u2019s bill was unenforceable. Id. at \u00b6 32. Accordingly, the appellate court held that Lila Fagan\u2019s garnishment was the only instrument that properly attached Richard Mason\u2019s share of the estate, giving Lila Fagan first priority to the proceeds from the February 12, 2002 sale. Id. at \u00b6 33. As between Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw and Wilma Mason, the appellate court held that Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw had been the first to revive its judgment and file an action against Richard Mason\u2019s share of the estate, thus affording it priority over Wilma Mason. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 14} The cause is now before this court pursuant to our acceptance of a discretionary appeal. In this case, we are asked to address the following two issues: (1) whether a lump-sum judgment for spousal support arrearages is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>subject to Ohio\u2019s dormancy and revivor statutes and (2) at what point in the probate of a decedent\u2019s estate a legatee\u2019s interest in the estate converts from an equitable interest, attachable by a creditor\u2019s bill, to an attachable legal interest subject to garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Lump-Sum Judgments for Spousal Support Arrearages</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 15} Ohio\u2019s dormancy statute, R.C. 2329.07, provides that \u201c[i]f neither execution on a judgment rendered in a court of record or certified to the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the judgment was rendered is issued * * * within five years from the date of the judgment * * *, then * * * the judgment shall be dormant and shall not operate as a lien upon the estate of the judgment debtor.\u201d This court has held that a decree for alimony is not a judgment within the meaning of Ohio\u2019s dormancy and revivor statutes. <em>Lemert v. Lemert </em>(1905), 72 Ohio St. 364, 368, 74 N.E. 194. In <em>Smith v. Smith </em>(1959), 168 Ohio St. 447, 450-451, 7 O.O.2d 276, 156 N.E.2d 113, we expanded on this principle, holding that an installment support order is not subject to Ohio\u2019s dormancy and revivor statutes <em>at least until </em>the rights of the parties with respect to the unalterable amount remaining due on the order are fixed. In reaching this conclusion, this court reasoned 'that an installment support order or judgment is unique as compared to other judgments due to its uncertainty of amount. Id. at 450, 7 O.O.2d 276, 156 N.E.2d 113. Applying that same rationale to this case, we hold that once an installment support order is reduced to a lump-sum judgment, the obligation becomes a fixed and unalterable amount, and, thus, Ohio\u2019s dormancy and revivor statutes, R.C. 2329.07 and 2325.15, begin to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 16} The mere fact that Wilma Mason\u2019s judgments involve spousal support arrearages does not exempt them from the provisions of Ohio\u2019s dormancy statute. Indeed, R.C. 2329.07 does not contain any language excluding or exempting lump-sum judgments for spousal support arrearages from its provisions. Moreover, this court in <em>Smith </em>excluded installment support orders from Ohio\u2019s dormancy and revivor provisions not because of the fact that the order involved support, but because of the uncertainty of the amount that would be due on the order. <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>168 Ohio St. at 451, 7 O.O.2d 276,156 N.E.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 17} Here, the judgments that Wilma Mason attempted to attach through a creditor\u2019s bill are not installment support orders. Rather, Wilma Mason converted spousal support arrearages in 1991 and 1992 into postdivorce lump-sum judgments. Unlike an installment support order, the 1991 and 1992 judgments are not uncertain in amount. Therefore, the dormancy provisions of the laws of Ohio applied to Wilma Mason\u2019s 1991 and 1992 postdivorce judgments from the date of their issuance. Since Wilma Mason did not execute upon these judgments within five years from the date of their issuance, the judgments were dormant until she revived them on April 4, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Legatee\u2019s Interest in An Estate</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 18} Next, this case presents the question of when a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate converts from an equitable interest attachable by a creditor\u2019s bill to a legal interest subject to garnishment. Garnishment is an action in law \u201cby which a creditor seeks satisfaction of the indebtedness out of an obligation due the debtor from a third person, the garnishee.\u201d <em>Union Properties, Inc. v. Patterson </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 192, 195, 28 O.O. 111, 54 N.E.2d 668. Alternatively, a creditor\u2019s bill is an action in equity by which a judgment creditor seeks to subject an interest of the judgment debtor that cannot be reached on execution to the payment of the creditor\u2019s existing judgment. Id.; see, also, R.C. 2333.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Orlopp v. Schueller </em>(1905), 72 Ohio St. 41, 73 N.E. 1012, this court addressed the issue of whether a creditor can attach a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate through a garnishment action. In that case, this court ruled that a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate cannot be reached by garnishment before an order of distribution is made. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. This court held that as long as an estate remains unsettled, or at least until an order of distribution is made, the property in the estate does not vest in, or become the property of, the legatee. Id. at 58-59, 73 N.E. 1012. In reaching such a conclusion, this court explained that, even if an executor could say that there would probably be something due to the legatee, the legatee\u2019s interest remains uncertain and contingent until an order of distribution or final settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 20} By contrast, in <em>Union Properties, Inc. v. Patterson, </em>this court held that a judgment creditor may reach a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate through a creditor\u2019s bill before an order of distribution is made. 143 Ohio St. 192, 28 O.O. 111, 54 N.E.2d 668, at syllabus. Accordingly, the above cases establish a precedent that a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate is equitable and attachable by a judgment creditor only by a creditor\u2019s bill prior to an order of distribution or final settlement and is a legal interest subject to garnishment after an order of distribution or final settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 21} Since <em>Orlopp </em>and <em>Union Properties, </em>changes have been made to the Revised Code regarding the probate process. Now, R.C. 2113.53(A) permits the administrator or executor of an estate to distribute the assets of an estate at any time after his or her appointment, thus negating the requirement that the fiduciary have an order of distribution before distributing funds or assets of the estate. However, this change does not alter the nature of a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate as set forth in the above precedent. The fact that R.C. 2113.53 gives the fiduciary discretion to distribute estate assets at any time after appointment does not also mean that the statute confers on the legatee a right of possession immediately after the appointment. Although the fiduciary, once appointed, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>make a distribution at any time, he or she is <em>required </em>to do so only when ordered by the probate court. See R.C. 2109.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">{\u00b6 22} Therefore, even though a legatee may possess an expectancy in the estate\u2019s assets, it is only a contingent, equitable interest until such time as there is an order of distribution by the probate court or an action by the fiduciary to distribute the assets of the estate prior to an order of distribution. Accordingly, a legatee\u2019s interest in an estate is equitable and attachable only by a creditor\u2019s bill until the probate court makes an order of distribution or until the fiduciary holds a definite amount ready to distribute to the legatee. After that point, the legatee\u2019s interest in the estate becomes an attachable legal interest subject to garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 23} As the lower court explained, the executor of Dorothy Mason\u2019s estate did not have a definite amount ready to distribute to Richard Mason under the terms of his mother\u2019s will until the February 12, 2002 sale of real property in the estate. Prior to that sale, Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate was equitable and attachable only by a creditor\u2019s bill. However, after the February 12, 2002 sale, Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate became a legal interest subject to garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 24} Although Wilma Mason was the first to file a creditor\u2019s bill when Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate was equitable, the 1991 and 1992 judgments that served as the basis of her creditor\u2019s bill were dormant and, therefore, unenforceable at the time she filed her action. Moreover, Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw failed to properly attach Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate because it filed a garnishment action when Richard\u2019s interest was still an equitable interest and filed a creditor\u2019s bill after Richard\u2019s interest in the estate became a legal interest subject to garnishment. Therefore, Lila Fagan was the first to properly attach Richard Mason\u2019s interest in the estate by a garnishment action following the February 12, 2002 sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 25} As between Wilma Mason and Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw, Rakestraw <em>&amp; </em>Rakestraw revived its 1994 judgment against Richard Mason and attempted to attach Richard\u2019s interest in the estate by a garnishment and creditor\u2019s bill before Wilma Mason revived her 1991 and 1992 dormant judgments. Therefore, we agree with the lower court\u2019s determination that the priority of the competing claims against Richard Mason\u2019s share of his mother\u2019s estate is as follows: (1) Lila Fagan, (2) Rakestraw &amp; Rakestraw, and (3) Wilma Mason.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b700-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ALf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>John A.
