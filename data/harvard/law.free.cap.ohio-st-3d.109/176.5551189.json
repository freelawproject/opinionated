We find that it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">{\u00b6 2} The Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted appellee, Mark Saxon, in a six-count indictment alleging two counts of gross sexual imposition involving a victim under the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2907.05, one count of importuning, in violation of R.C. 2907.07, two counts of gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05, and one count of attempted gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05. Appellee pleaded guilty to one count of gross sexual imposition involving a victim under the age of 13, a felony of the third degree, and one count of gross sexual imposition, a felony of the fourth degree. In return, the state dismissed the remaining charges. The trial court sentenced appellee to four years on each count and ordered the sentences to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, appellee challenged his four-year sentence for the fourth-degree felony of gross sexual imposition, but failed to raise any alleged errors as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>to the four-year sentence on the third-degree felony of gross sexual imposition. The state conceded that the trial court lacked the authority to impose a four-year sentence of incarceration on a defendant for a fourth-degree felony. See R.C. 2929.14(A)(4) (maximum penalty for a fourth-degree felony is 18 months). The appellate court, however, vacated not only the sentence for the fourth-degree felony, but also the properly imposed sentence for the third-degree felony, and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>State v. Saxon, </em>8th Dist. No. 83889, 2004-Ohio-5017, 2004 WL 2340106. The state appealed that decision to this court, and we accepted jurisdiction to determine whether an appellate court may vacate or modify the sentence for an offense that a defendant fails to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) permits an appellate court to \u201cincrease, reduce, or otherwise modify a [felony] sentence that is appealed under this section\u201d or to \u201cvacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing\u201d if the sentence is contrary to law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, appellee specifically argued on appeal that his sentence for the fourth-degree felony of gross sexual imposition was erroneous. The Eighth District, therefore, had the authority to vacate that admittedly erroneous sentence. The court, however, went further and vacated both sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 5} Over the years, some appellate courts have adopted the \u201csentencing package\u201d doctrine, a federal doctrine that requires the court to consider the sanctions imposed on multiple offenses as the components of a single, comprehensive sentencing plan. See, e.g., <em>State v. Webb, </em>8th Dist. No. 85318, 2005-Ohio-3839, 2005 WL 1792364, \u00b6 9-11; <em>State v. Jackson, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-698, 2004-Ohio-1005, 2004 WL 396331, \u00b6 5; <em>In re Mitchell </em>(June 28, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 01AP-74, 2001 WL 722104.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 6} According to this view, an error within the sentencing package as a whole, even if only on one of multiple offenses, may require modification or vacation of the entire sentencing package due to the interdependency of the sentences for each offense. <em>United States v. Clements </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 86 F.3d 599, 600-601. Thus, in a direct appeal from multiple-count criminal convictions, the appellate court has the authority to vacate all sentences even if only one is reversed on appeal. Id., citing Section 2106, Title 28, U.S.Code. Significantly, by enacting Section 2106, Congress, unlike our General Assembly, has expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>endowed the federal appellate courts with the authority to vacate and remand an entire sentencing package despite the fact that it includes an unchallenged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 7} This rationale makes good sense when considering the many multicount and interrelated sentencing enhancements considered and used by federal judges applying the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov.2005) 342 (providing rules \u201cfor determining a <em>single offense level that encompasses all the counts of which the defendant is convicted. </em>The single, \u2018combined\u2019 offense level that results from applying these rules is used * * * to determine the sentence. * * * In essence, counts that are grouped together <em>are treated as constituting a single offense for purposes of the guidelines </em>\u201d). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 8} But the rationale for \u201csentence packaging\u201d fails in Ohio where there is no potential for an error in the sentence for one offense to permeate the entire multicount group of sentences. Ohio\u2019s felony-sentencing scheme is clearly designed to focus the judge\u2019s attention on one offense at a time. Under R.C. 2929.14(A), the range of available penalties depends on the degree of each offense. For instance, R.C. 2929.14(A)(1) provides that \u201c[f]or <em>a felony </em>of the first degree, the prison term shall be three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.14(A)(2) provides a different range for second-degree felonies. In a case in which a defendant is convicted of two first-degree felonies and one second-degree felony, the statute leaves the sentencing judge no option but to assign a particular sentence to <em>each </em>of the three offenses, <em>separately. </em>The statute makes no provision for grouping offenses together and imposing a single, \u201clump\u201d sentence for multiple felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 9} Although imposition of concurrent sentences in Ohio may appear to involve a \u201clump\u201d sentence approach, the opposite is actually true. Instead of considering multiple offenses as a whole and imposing one, overarching sentence to encompass the entirety of the offenses as in the federal sentencing.regime, a judge sentencing a defendant pursuant to Ohio law must consider each offense individually and impose a separate sentence for each offense. See R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only after the judge has imposed a separate prison term for each offense may the judge then consider in his discretion whether the offender should serve those terms concurrently or consecutively. See <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraph seven of the syllabus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u00b6 100, 102, 105; R.C. 2929.12(A); <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, paragraph three of the syllabus. Under the Ohio sentencing statutes, the judge lacks the authority to consider the offenses as a group and to impose only an omnibus sentence for the group of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 10} This court has never adopted the sentencing-package doctrine, and we decline to do so now. The sentencing-package' doctrine has no applicability to Ohio sentencing laws: the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when sentencing a defendant, and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 11} Not only does sentencing in Ohio lack the underpinning interdependency that supports the federal doctrine, but the doctrine conflicts with the plain meaning of \u201csentence,\u201d as defined by the Revised Code, ignores the requirements of the Ohio sentencing statutes, and abrogates the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2929.01(FF) defines a sentence as \u201cthe sanction or combination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.\u201d Appellee in the case at bar points to the \u201ccombination of sanctions\u201d language in this definition and urges us to find that that language necessarily indicates that a \u201csentence\u201d includes all sanctions given for all offenses and is not limited to the sanction given for just one offense. But a trial court may impose a combination of sanctions on a single offense, for example, a fine and incarceration. See R.C. 2929.15 to 2929.18; <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, at \u00b6 45. Therefore, appellee\u2019s insistence that the \u201ccombination of sanctions\u201d language supports his contentions is misplaced. This language merely recognizes the availability of multiple sanctions for a single offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 13} Further, the statute explicitly defines <em>\u201ca </em>sentence\u201d as those sanctions imposed for <em>\u201can </em>offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d modifying \u201csentence\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d denotes the singular and does not allow for the position urged by appellee. A finding that the statute intended to package the sanctions for all sentences into one, appealable bundle would ignore the plain meaning of the statutory language: a sentence is the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed on each separate offense. If the legislature had intended to package sentencing together, it easily could have defined \u201csentence\u201d as the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed for all offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 14} This interpretation is further supported by consideration of the current comprehensive sentencing scheme originally enacted by the General Assembly as part of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2 in 1996. 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136. The current scheme provides precise guidance for criminal sentencing within clearly defined constraints. As described above, the sentencing judge may not impose one term of incarceration and additional sanctions as to the total number of offenses before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>him, but must consider each offense separately. See R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">{\u00b6 15} Because the sentencing judge must consider each individual offense, the logical conclusion is that a \u201csentence\u201d is the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed for each offense. Adopting the sentencing-package doctrine ignores the critical differences between the Ohio and federal sentencing schemes and implies that sentencing judges must disregard the law and focus on the entire array of offenses when imposing sentence. Ohio law has no mechanism for such an approach. Because Ohio does not \u201cbundle\u201d sentences, nothing is \u201cunbundled\u201d when one of several sentences is reversed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 16} Our holding that a \u201csentence\u201d includes only the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed for a single offense also comports with our long-standing precedent that any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings. <em>State v. Hutton, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 176, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 37; <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 143, 652 N.E.2d 710. As we explained nearly 40 years ago:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cUnder the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was <em>raised or could have been raised by the defendant </em>* * * <em>on an appeal </em>from that judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104, paragraph nine of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 18} Thus, the doctrine serves to preclude a defendant who has had his day in court from seeking a second on that same issue. In so doing, res judicata promotes the principles of finality and judicial economy by preventing endless relitigation of an issue on which a defendant has already received a full and fair opportunity to be heard. See <em>State ex rel. Willys-Overland Co. v. Clark </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 263, 268, 147 N.E. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 19} When a defendant fails to appeal the sentence for a certain offense, he cannot take advantage of an error in the sentence for an entirely separate offense to gain a second opportunity to appeal upon resentencing. To hold otherwise would essentially abrogate the doctrine of res judicata for multicount sentences and precludes finality in sentencing. Accordingly, a defendant who fails on direct appeal to challenge the sentence imposed on him for an offense is barred by res judicata from appealing that sentence following a remand for resentencing on other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 20} This court\u2019s interpretation is not only in accord with the legal principles of res judicata and finality of judgments, but it is faithful to the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>statute and the General Assembly\u2019s intent in promulgating a comprehensive sentencing scheme. The legislature crafted the sentencing statutes in a manner that mandates individual consideration of each offense during sentencing and allows meaningful review of the sentence for each offense individually on appeal. R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.19; R.C. 2953.08; <em>Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 23-24, 35-36, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 21} Any adoption of the sentencing-package doctrine would dismantle that carefully crafted statutory scheme: an error in the sentence for a single offense would require the sentencing judge to reconsider the sentences for every other offense, even if the defendant pleaded guilty to 100 counts. No purpose can be served by forcing a sentencing judge to revisit properly imposed, lawful sentences based upon an error in the sentence for a separate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 22} Adoption of appellee\u2019s definition would further produce an unprecedented and unsupported result when considering the plain language of R.C. 2929.14(A):</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c[I]f the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony elects or is required to impose a prison term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite prison term that shall be one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(1) For a felony of the first degree, the prison term shall be three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(2) For a felony of the second degree, the prison term shall be two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(3) For a felony of the third degree, the prison term shall be one, two, three, four, or five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(4) For a felony of the fourth degree, the prison term shall be six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(5) For a felony of the fifth degree, the prison term shall be six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">{\u00b629} The statute explicitly allows a court to impose only <em>\u201cone </em>of the following\u201d prison terms each time it imposes \u201ca sentence\u201d on an offender. (Emphasis added.) If we adopted appellee\u2019s definition of \u201ca sentence\u201d as including the entire sentencing package, the trial court could impose only <em>one </em>of the terms of imprisonment <em>per case </em>regardless of the number or variety of felonies committed. A defendant found guilty of multiple counts each of first-, second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-degree felonies could only receive <em>one </em>prison term of no more than ten years. There is no doubt that the legislature did not intend to punish a defendant guilty of a multiple number of crimes in the same manner as one who committed only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>{\u00b6 30} App.R. 12(A)(1)(b) mandates that an appellate court \u201c[d]etermine the appeal on its merits on the assignments of error,\u201d and R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) permits the court to modify or vacate only a sentence appealed under that section. In this case, the appellate court exceeded its authority by essentially considering an assignment of error not raised and vacating a sentence not appealed. An appellate court may modify or vacate only a sentence that is appealed by the defendant and may not modify or vacate the entire multiple-offense sentence based upon an appealed error in the sentence for a single offense. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Eighth District Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-5\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b345-6\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">.

Both real-world considerations and statutory construction compel an affirmance of the judgment of the court of appeals in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 32} As for the statutes at issue, the central question of this case is what constitutes a sentence, and whether every offense a defendant is convicted of comes with its own sentence. The majority points to R.C. 2929.01(FF), writing that \u201cthe statute defines <em>\u2018a </em>sentence\u2019 as those sanctions imposed for <em>\u2018an </em>offense.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) \u00b6 13. But that is not true. R.C. 2929.01(FF) does not tie a sentence to a particular offense. It could have, but it did not. R.C. 2929.01(FF) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018Sentence\u2019 means the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">{\u00b6 34} A sentence is tied to \u201can offender\u201d who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense; it is not tied to the offense itself. That is to be contrasted with the definition of \u201csanction\u201d in R.C. 2929.01(EE):</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c \u2018Sanction\u2019 means any penalty imposed upon an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, as punishment for the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">{\u00b6 36} The definition of \u201csanction\u201d makes clear that a sanction is a penalty that acts as punishment for a particular offense. While sanctions operate as punishments for single offenses, a sentence can be a \u201ccombination of sanctions,\u201d i.e., a combination of punishments for particular offenses. All that is required for a set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>of sanctions to constitute a sentence is that they are \u201cimposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.\u201d Saxon did plead guilty to an offense in this case; the combination of sanctions imposed by the judge thus technically fits within the definition of \u201csentence\u201d in R.C. 2929.01(FF).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 37} Moreover, R.C. 2953.08 itself makes clear that a sentence can include sanctions for more than one offense. R.C. 2953.08(A) sets forth factors that create an appeal as a matter of right for a defendant as to a criminal sentence. R.C. 2953.08 contemplates the appeal of a sentence that includes sanctions for multiple offenses. The statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(A) In addition to any other right to appeal and except as provided in division (D) of this section, a defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may appeal as a matter of right the sentence imposed upon the defendant on one of the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(1) <em>The sentence consisted of or included the maximum prison term allowed for the offense </em>by division (A) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, the sentence was not imposed pursuant to division (D)(3)(b) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, the maximum prison term was not required for the offense pursuant to Chapter 2925. or any other provision of the Revised Code, and the court imposed the sentence under one of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(a) <em>The sentence was imposed for only one offense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(b) <em>The sentence was imposed for two or more offenses arising out of a single incident, </em>and the court imposed the maximum prison term for the offense of the highest degree.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 2953.08(A)(1) speaks of the appealability of a sentence that \u201cconsists] of or include[s] the maximum prison term allowed for the offense.\u201d A sentence that does not consist of, but rather <em>includes </em>the maximum prison term can include other sanctions for other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">{\u00b6 43} R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(a) and (b) leave no doubt that a sentence, for purposes of the statute, can include multiple sanctions for multiple offenses. The factor for appealability set forth in R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(a) requires that the \u201csentence was imposed for only one offense,\u201d thereby indicating a court\u2019s ability to impose sentences that cover more than one offense. Finally, the factor for appealability set forth in R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(b) describes a sentence that \u201cwas imposed for two or more offenses arising out of a single incident.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(b) indisputably contemplates sentences that cover more than one offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">{\u00b6 44} R.C. 2953.08(C) allows for an appeal as of right as to sentencing when a \u201csentence\u201d includes consecutive sentences:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>William D.

Allan Regas, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8O\">Thomas Rein, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cIn addition to the right to appeal a sentence granted under division (A) or (B) of this section, a defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may seek leave to appeal a sentence imposed upon the defendant on the basis that the sentencing judge has imposed consecutive sentences under division (E)(3) or (4) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code and that the consecutive sentences exceed the maximum prison term allowed by division (A) of that section for the most serious offense of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 46} In R.C. 2953.08(C), consecutive sentences are together considered to be part of one appealable sentence. Even if none of the consecutive sentences on their own are contrary to law, how they operate together as one sentence can be.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 2953.08 thus demonstrates that criminal sentences can consist of multiple sanctions for separate offenses. R.C. 2953.08(G) gives the appellate court the opportunity to correct an illegal sanction as to any particular offense or to vacate the entire sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 49} Therefore, since a sentence can include multiple sanctions imposed on one offender, and since an appellate court has the ability to vacate an entire sentence, I would hold that an appellate court may vacate all parts of a criminal sentence pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G), even sanctions not specifically appealed by a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 50} This conclusion makes real-world sense as well. In my view, judges do take into account all of the surrounding factors, including the seriousness of other offenses for which the defendant stands before the bench, in determining a sentence. As long as sentences may differ in length, that will be the case. Upon resentencing, judges should have the whole picture before them as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
