Conway III, defendant-appellant, killed Andrew Dotson with a pickax. A jury convicted Conway of aggravated murder and recommended the death penalty, and Conway was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">I. Facts and Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 2} On Friday, September 14, 2001, Jesse James was shot and wounded near the intersections of Evergreen, Fern Hill, and Palmetto Streets on the west side of Columbus. James, who was a witness for the defense, said that Dotson was at the scene of the shooting with a \u201cbig, fat white guy,\u201d a description that matches Conway. James said that the \u201cbig, fat white guy\u201d had a gun. Later that evening, Dotson\u2019s mother and his brother picked up Dotson\u2019s car on Evergreen, where it was parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 3} On Saturday, September 15, 2001, two Franklin County detectives went to the home of Dotson\u2019s mother, Lora Eberhard. Eberhard told the detectives that Dotson was not there but that she was expecting him. She gave the detectives Dotson\u2019s home address and cell phone number, and they left a business card. Dotson arrived at Eberhard\u2019s home a few hours later with Jamie Horton and another person in a white Jeep Cherokee. Eberhard gave Dotson the detectives\u2019 business card, and she left to go to church. This was the last time Eberhard saw or spoke to Dotson. One of the last calls from Dotson\u2019s cell phone was made later that evening to the Franklin County Sheriffs Detective Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 4} Under a plea agreement, Mike Arthurs, a co-conspirator of Conway\u2019s, testified that sometime in mid-September 2001, he had attended a party at the Hampton Inn in Chillicothe with Conway, Dotson, Horton, and Shawn Nightingale. During the party, Conway met secretly with Arthurs and Nightingale in the bathroom of their hotel room and asked them to kill Dotson. Conway gave no reason for wanting Dotson killed, but Arthurs and Nightingale nevertheless agreed to carry out the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 5} The group spent the night at the hotel, and the next morning, Conway, Dotson, Arthurs, Nightingale, and Horton met in the hotel parking lot. Conway and Horton left in Conway\u2019s car. Arthurs and Nightingale drove to West Virginia in Nightingale\u2019s Jeep Cherokee with Dotson to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">{\u00b6 6} After they arrived in West Virginia, Arthurs and Nightingale realized that they could not kill Dotson. Arthurs testified that Dotson wanted drugs, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the group picked up some pills. Dotson started taking the pills and subsequently-passed out in the back seat of Nightingale\u2019s Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">{\u00b6 7} Arthurs and Nightingale decided to drive to Columbus. During the trip, they called Conway to tell him that they could not kill Dotson. According to Arthurs, Conway told him and Nightingale to \u201cquit being bitches\u201d and instructed them to bring Dotson to a shopping center on the west side of Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 8} Dotson was still passed out when Arthurs and Nightingale met Conway and Horton in the shopping center parking lot after dark. Conway directed Arthurs and Nightingale to follow him to a nearby cornfield on Galloway Road. Once at the cornfield, Conway ordered Arthurs to pull Dotson out of Nightingale\u2019s Jeep and choke him, which Arthurs said he pretended to do. Conway then had Arthurs and Horton drag Dotson further into the cornfield. Arthurs said that Dotson was unconscious but still breathing after he was dragged into the cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 9} Horton and Nightingale then removed Dotson\u2019s clothes, except for his underwear, and placed them in a plastic bag. At this point, Conway took a pickax from his truck and walked into the cornfield where Dotson was. Arthurs could not see Conway but testified that he heard \u201ctwo thuds.\u201d After Arthurs heard the thuds, Conway reappeared and removed blood from the pickax by wiping it in the dirt. Conway broke apart the pickax, placed the metal part of the pickax into the plastic bag containing Dotson\u2019s clothes, and put the handle in his truck. Horton then removed a bag of lime from Nightingale\u2019s Jeep and poured the lime over Dotson\u2019s body. The group then left Dotson\u2019s body in the cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 10} After leaving the cornfield, Arthurs disposed of Dotson\u2019s clothes and part of the pickax in the trash behind his cousin\u2019s house. The next morning, Conway, Horton, and Nightingale picked up Arthurs, and they drove to a hardware store. While there, Conway picked up a spaded shovel and told Arthurs that \u201cit was for the next time.\u201d Conway later admitted to Arthurs that he had stabbed Dotson twice in the chest with the pickax.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 11} Thereafter, the group went to the mall, where Conway bought Arthurs new clothes and new shoes. Conway then took the clothes that Arthurs had worn when Dotson was killed and said that he was going to burn them.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 12} Ronny Trent, Conway\u2019s cellmate at the Franklin County Corrections Center, also testified against Conway under a plea agreement. Trent testified that he and Conway had never met prior to their joint incarceration. Soon after discovering that Trent was a distant cousin, however, Conway began confiding in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>{\u00b6 13} In April 2002, before Conway was charged with Dotson\u2019s murder, Dotson\u2019s mother visited Conway in jail, seeking information about her son\u2019s death. After telling Trent that Dotson\u2019s mom had just visited him, Conway said, \u201cThat stupid bitch actually thinks I\u2019m going to tell her I killed her son.\u201d Conway later told Trent that he had killed Dotson because he was afraid that Dotson would tell the police that Conway had shot someone \u201cin the butt\u201d at a White Castle restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 14} Trent testified that Conway had instructed Arthurs and Nightingale to take Dotson to West Virginia, cause him to overdose on drugs, and dump his body in the hills. When Arthurs and Nightingale could not kill Dotson, they brought him back to Columbus and met Conway and Horton. Conway originally told Trent that he had stepped on Dotson\u2019s neck until Dotson died. Conway later admitted to Trent, however, that he had struck Dotson twice in the chest with a pickax \u201cto be sure that Andrew was dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 15} Trent also said that Conway hired him to kill Arthurs because Conway feared that Arthurs would tell the police about Dotson\u2019s murder. Conway paid Trent $5,000 by having the money placed in Trent\u2019s jail account. However, instead of killing Arthurs, Trent went to the prosecutor and began working as a confidential informant gathering incriminating information on Conway.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 16} Gary Wilgus, a special agent with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, was called to an area off Galloway Road in Franklin County on October 10, 2001. There, Wilgus saw the badly decomposed body of a white male lying in a cornfield. The body was undressed except for a pair of boxer shorts. The victim\u2019s left foot was missing, and Wilgus speculated that it had been removed by an animal. Wilgus noticed a white powder on and around the body, which was later identified as a cement-type material.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 17} Wilgus took pictures of the body and crime scene. Because of decomposition, the victim\u2019s face was unrecognizable. Wilgus attempted to identify the body through fingerprints but was unsuccessful. The body was later identified as Dotson\u2019s through his dental records.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 18} Dr. Patrick Fardal, chief forensic pathologist and deputy coroner for Franklin County, determined that Dotson had died as a result of two stab wounds to his chest that pierced his heart and liver. Both wounds were substantially similar and appeared to have been caused by the same instrument. Dotson\u2019s wounds were consistent with those that would be inflicted by an instrument such as a pickax. Fardal also compared Dotson\u2019s wounds with a pickax purchased by Arthurs that was offered into evidence as similar to the pickax used in the murder. Fardal found that the pickax purchased by Arthurs could have been the type of instrument that caused Dotson\u2019s chest wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>{\u00b6 19} During the autopsy, Fardal found blood in Dotson\u2019s chest cavity, indicating that he was still alive when he sustained his stab wounds. No evidence suggested that Dotson was killed by strangulation. Fardal also noted that when Dotson\u2019s body was discovered, it was partially covered with a \u201cpowdered whitish, gray material\u201d that looked like lime or concrete powder. The toxicology report showed that alcohol and Valium were present in Dotson\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 20} In June 2002, Conway was indicted on six counts, including one count of aggravated murder. Count One charged that Conway had purposely and with prior calculation and design caused the death of Dotson, R.C. 2903.01(A), and/or that Conway had purposely caused the death of Dotson during a kidnapping, R.C. 2903.01(B). Count Two charged Conway with kidnapping. R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) and (3). Conway was charged in Count Three with possession of criminal tools, R.C. 2923.24(A); Count Four, abuse of a corpse, R.C. 2927.01(B); Count Five, obstruction of justice, R.C. 2921.32(A)(4) and (C)(4); and Count Six, tampering with evidence, R.C. 2921.12(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 21} The aggravated murder count contained three death-penalty specifications. Specification one charged that the aggravated murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense. R.C. 2929.04(A)(3). Specification two charged aggravated murder during a kidnapping. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Specification three charged that the aggravated murder was committed to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding. R.C. 2929.04(A)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 22} The defense theory of the case was that Arthurs had already killed Dotson before Conway struck him with the pickax. Defense counsel extensively cross-examined Arthurs and challenged Dr. Fardal\u2019s conclusion that Dotson had died from being stabbed twice in the chest. The defense also called seven witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 23} James testified for the defense and said that he was shot at the corner of Evergreen and Palmetto Streets on September 14, 2001. James drove his maroon Ford Explorer to this location after Dotson called him. James said that the shooting occurred in a residential neighborhood, and no White Castle restaurant was nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 24} James has never been able to identify his shooter. Moreover, James never identified Conway as being at the scene of the shooting. Although James testified that \u201ca big, fat white guy\u201d was with Dotson at the scene, he has never said that that person was Conway. To James\u2019s knowledge, the police have never filed any charges regarding his shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 25} Robert Hale testified that he lives on Evergreen Terrace, about 100 to 200 feet from the corner of Evergreen and Palmetto. On September 14, 2001, Hale was about 150 feet from this intersection when he heard five loud gunshots. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Hale then saw a young man run and jump into a maroon Ford Explorer. As the Explorer sped away, Hale heard nine more shots from a different gun. Hale did not see who was doing the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">{\u00b6 26} Linda Goodman, the general manager at the Hampton Inn Suites in Chillicothe, testified about a hotel billing record. The bill indicated that Arthurs checked into room number 306 at 10:31 p.m. on September 11, 2001, and checked out on September 15, 2001, at 1:44 p.m. Goodman also stated that it was hotel policy to require photo identification if the hotel guest paid with cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 27} Brian Woodworth, a maintenance worker at the Chillicothe Hampton Inn, measured the dimensions of the bathroom in room 306. Woodworth said that the bathroom measured slightly over ten feet by five and one-half feet and that the \u201csurface area for the standing room\u201d in the bathroom was about three and one-half by five and one-half feet. According to Woodworth, three large adult males would be able to stand in the bathroom at the same time, but \u201cit would be tight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 28} Arthur Wood testified that Dotson was his \u201cadopted cousin.\u201d Wood was a fellow inmate of Arthurs, and he claimed that Arthurs admitted killing Dotson. Wood, however, conceded that he did not know whether Arthurs was telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 29} The jury convicted Conway of all charges and specifications. After a penalty hearing, the trial court sentenced Conway to death, consistently with the jury\u2019s recommendation, for the aggravated murder of Dotson. The trial court merged Conway\u2019s kidnapping conviction (Count Two) into his aggravated murder conviction and did not impose a separate sentence on Count Two. The trial court imposed sentences of one year for each of Conway\u2019s convictions for possessing criminal tools (Count Three) and abuse of a corpse (Count Four), and five years for each of Conway\u2019s convictions for obstructing justice (Count Five) and tampering with evidence (Count Six). The trial court ordered that the sentences for Counts Three through Six run consecutively to each other and concurrently with the sentence for Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 30} The cause is now before this court on direct review from the trial court. R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 31} Conway has raised eight propositions of law. We have reviewed each one and have determined that none justifies reversal of Conway\u2019s convictions. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating evidence. We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we affirm Conway\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>II. Pretrial Publicity</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 32} In his fourth proposition of law, Conway contends that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to change venue deprived him of a fair and impartial jury. Conway claims that adverse publicity surrounding both his trial in this matter and a prior murder conviction and death sentence required that venue be moved from Franklin County. .</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 33} A motion for change of venue is governed by Crim.R. 18(B), which provides that a trial court may transfer venue \u201cwhen it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held\u201d in that court. See, also, R.C. 2901.12(K). \u201cA change of venue rests largely in the discretion of the trial court * * <em>State v. Fairbanks </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 34, 37, 61 O.O.2d 241, 289 N.E.2d 352. Moreover, \u2018\u201ca careful and searching <em>voir dire </em>provides the best test of whether prejudicial pretrial publicity has prevented obtaining a fair and impartial jury from the locality.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 111, 666 N.E.2d 1099, quoting <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 98, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035. Accord <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 117, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 34} Before trial, defense counsel filed a motion to change venue under Crim.R. 18(B). During a pretrial hearing in July 2003, the trial judge indicated that he saw no reason to change venue. When juror selection began on September 15, 2003, defense counsel moved for a continuance and a change of venue based on various media reports about the trial and Conway\u2019s prior aggravated-murder conviction and death sentence. During trial, defense counsel also submitted to the court newspaper articles about the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court deferred ruling on defense counsel\u2019s motions for a continuance and a change of venue until voir dire was completed. After prospective jurors were individually questioned about pretrial publicity, the trial court denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 36} Some newspaper articles were adverse to Conway. These articles described Conway\u2019s criminal background, including his prior murder conviction and death sentence, his alleged plans to kill witnesses and prosecutors, allegations that he was the l\u00e9ader of a criminal gang, and details of the charges against Conway in this case. Other articles described Conway as a father of two young children and a college student, or mentioned him only peripherally.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 37} Notwithstanding the publicity before and during the trial, Conway has not shown that the trial court erred in failing to change venue. The trial court conducted individual voir dire of prospective jurors to determine the extent of their exposure to media coverage involving Conway. Only 14 of 60 venire members indicated that they had read or heard anything about this case or Conway\u2019s prior murder conviction and death sentence. Defense counsel chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>lenged four of these jurors, and the trial court readily dismissed those jurors. Defense counsel did not challenge any other prospective juror based on exposure to adverse media coverage about Conway. Cf. <em>Murphy v. Florida </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 794, 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589; <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 38} Defense counsel also did not exhaust their peremptory'challenges. The limited number of defense challenges for pretrial publicity and the failure to exhaust peremptory challenges indicate that the defense did not believe that the jury venire was overly exposed to negative publicity. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 39} Moreover, none of the seated jurors indicated they had any knowledge about this case or Conway\u2019s other criminal activities. A defendant claiming that pretrial publicity has denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased. See <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749; <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, at \u00b6 40-41. Conway is unable to demonstrate that any biased juror sat on his jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 40} The trial court took other precautions. The court granted one continuance to allow publicity from Conway\u2019s first capital trial to dissipate. The court also continually cautioned jurors not to discuss the case and to avoid media reports. Under these circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to change venue. The trial court took effective steps to protect Conway\u2019s rights. <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, at \u00b6 47-58; <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 30. Therefore, we reject Conway\u2019s fourth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">III. Guilt-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A64\">A. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 41} In his second proposition of law, Conway challenges the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) (murder to escape detection) and 2929.04(A)(8) (murder to prevent testimony) capital specifications contained in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 42} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are primarily jury issues. <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>St.3d 424, 430, 588 N.E.2d 819; <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 43} <em>R.C. 2929.04(A)(3). </em>The first capital specification charged Conway with committing aggravated murder \u201cfor the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense committed by the offender,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), which was the felonious assault upon James. Conway contends that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that he had committed that felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163, this court held that proof of the defendant\u2019s commission of the prior offense constituted an essential element of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification. Thus, the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Conway committed the offense of felonious assault for which he had sought to avoid detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 45} The state presented testimony from Ronny Trent (Conway\u2019s cousin and a government informant) that Conway was afraid that Dotson would tell the police that Conway had shot someone. Conway also told Trent that he had killed Dotson because Dotson had seen Conway shoot someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 46} James testified that he was shot on September 14, 2001. James said that Dotson was at the scene of the shooting with a \u201cbig, fat white guy,\u201d a description that matches Conway, and that the \u201cbig, fat white guy\u201d had a gun. James also testified that the shooting occurred at Evergreen and Palmetto in Columbus. On September 14, police recovered multiple shell casings from that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) defines felonious assault as knowingly causing or attempting to cause serious physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Conway had feloniously assaulted Jesse James. Therefore, we find that sufficient evidence was presented to prove this element of R.C. 2929.04(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">{\u00b648} <em>R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) Jury Instruction. </em>Under this proposition of law, Conway also contends that the jury was not instructed that a finding on the felonious-assault charge was necessary to convict on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification. After defining the offense of felonious assault in conjunction with the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification, the trial court instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cNow, felonious assault can also be committed, the State of Ohio, and that\u2019s the felonious assault that \u2014 you aren\u2019t deciding that offense before you, but the State must prove that it was intended to, with respect to that specification, that a felonious assault \u2014 the State has to show that the offense was committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, [or] punishment for another offense and the other offense is the felonious assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 50} Conway complains about the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury \u201c[Y]ou aren\u2019t deciding that offense [felonious assault] before you * *</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 51} The challenged instruction is less than a model of clarity. Nevertheless, Conway failed to object to this instruction and has waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. A trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct on every essential element of a crime does not, per se, constitute plain error under Crim.R. 52(B). <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144, paragraph two of the syllabus. It is only when the failure to properly instruct results in a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d that plain error may be recognized. Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 52} We conclude that there was no prejudice to Conway resulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice. The state did present sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Conway had committed a felonious assault. Thus, plain error is absent because the outcome of the trial would not clearly have been different with a more precise instruction. See <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 53} <em>R.C. </em>2929.04(A)(8). Conway also maintains that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the third capital specification, that he killed Dotson to prevent his \u201ctestimony in any criminal proceeding.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Conway contends that the (A)(8) specification is inapplicable because there was no evidence that Conway was a suspect in the shooting of Jesse James, and no criminal proceeding regarding the James shooting was underway.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 54} R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) allows the death penalty if \u201c[t]he victim of the aggravated murder was a witness to an offense who was purposely killed to prevent the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding and the aggravated murder was not committed during the commission, attempted commission, or flight immediately after the commission or attempted commission of the offense to which the victim was a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b6 55} Under the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification, the state was not required to show that Conway was a suspect or that he had committed any underlying offense in order to prove the witness-murder specification. In addition, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) does not require that a criminal action be pending when the defendant kills the victim-witness. Indeed, we have previously upheld application of the witness-murder specification in situations where no criminal proceeding had been initiated at the time the victim was murdered. See, e.g., <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 655, 693 N.E.2d 246; <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>St.3d 148, 159, 661 N.E.2d 1030; <em>State v. Hooks </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 67, 69, 529 N.E.2d 429. The plain language of the statute requires only (1) that the victim was a witness to an offense and (2) that the purpose of killing the victim was to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding. See <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, at \u00b6 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 56} James testified that he was shot on September 14, 2001, and that Dotson was at the scene. Trent testified that Conway was afraid that Dotson would tell the police that Conway had shot someone. Conway told Trent that he had killed Dotson because Dotson had seen Conway shoot someone. In addition, Arthurs testified that Conway was concerned that Dotson would disclose Conway\u2019s criminal activities. Finally, the state presented evidence that one of the last calls made on Dotson\u2019s cell phone was to a Franklin County Sheriffs detective. This call was made on September 15, 2001, one day after the James shooting. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, we hold that sufficient evidence was presented to prove the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification. Therefore, we overrule Conway\u2019s second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">B. Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 57} Conway argues in his sixth proposition of law that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony when it permitted two witnesses to testify that Dotson had been involved in a shooting and that detectives had wanted to speak with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 58} Lora Eberhard, Dotson\u2019s mother, testified that on September 15, 2001, two Franklin County Sheriffs detectives came to her house looking for Dotson. According to Eberhard, the detectives told her that \u201cthey believed [that Dotson] was witness to a shooting and they wanted to talk about it.\u201d Defense counsel objected, and the judge gave the jury during Eberhard\u2019s testimony a lengthy explanation of the law concerning hearsay. Similarly, Cecil Dotson, Dotson\u2019s brother, was permitted to testify that Roberta Hannah, Dotson\u2019s girlfriend, told him \u201cthat there was a shooting and that [Dotson] was there.\u201d Again, defense counsel objected, and the witness was warned not to relate the statements of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 59} Any errors in admitting these statements were harmless. The testimony of Eberhard and Cecil Dotson was merely cumulative. James testified that Dotson was present when James was shot, and Conway admitted to Trent that Dotson had seen Conway shoot someone and that Conway was afraid that Dotson would tell the police. Therefore, we reject Conway\u2019s sixth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">C. Other-Acts Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">{\u00b6 60} In his eighth proposition of law, Conway maintains that the trial court improperly admitted \u201cother acts\u201d evidence in violation of Evid.R. 404(B). He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>argues that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">1. Evid.R. 404(B): Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d Evid.R. 404(B). Such evidence may be admissible, however, for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. Id. The exceptions allowing the evidence \u201cmust be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.\u201d <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 62} Nevertheless, the admission of evidence lies within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice. <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 752 N.E.2d 904. Thus, our inquiry is confined to determining whether the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably in deciding the evidentiary issues about which Conway complains. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 23, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 63} <em>Hannah\u2019s testimony. </em>Conway first complains about Hannah\u2019s testimony regarding an incident during which Conway yelled at Dotson. Hannah testified that on one occasion, she accompanied Dotson to meet Conway. As they were leaving a neighborhood in separate vehicles, Conway stopped at the side of the road and yelled at Dotson for following him. Conway did not object to this testimony and waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 64} This evidence was relevant to a noncharacter issue and was allowed under Evid.R. 404(B). Hannah\u2019s testimony indicated that Conway distrusted Dotson. The testimony was probative of Conway\u2019s motive to kill. See, e.g., <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, at \u00b6 81; <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 161, 749 N.E.2d 226. Therefore, we conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 65} <em>Arthurs\u2019s testimony. </em>Conway argues that the trial court erred in allowing Arthurs to testify about a statement that Conway made the day after Dotson\u2019s murder. Arthurs testified that he and Conway were at a hardware store where Conway picked up a spaded shovel and said that \u201cit was for the next time.\u201d Conway objected, but we find that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 66} Conway\u2019s reference to the spaded shovel and \u201cthe next time\u201d was a thinly veiled reference to his murder of Dotson with a pickax the previous night. Accordingly, Conway\u2019s statement to Arthurs was an implied admission of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and was not barred by Evid.R. 404(B). Cf. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 67} Conway also challenges Arthurs\u2019s testimony about faking his murder with the help of Franklin County Sheriffs detectives. Over objection, Arthurs testified, \u201c[The detectives] asked me to dig my own grave and let them take pictures of me in it because * * * [Conway] had hired someone to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 68} The trial court did not err in admitting this testimony. Trent testified that Conway had hired him to kill Arthurs because Conway was afraid that Arthurs would implicate Conway in Dotson\u2019s murder. Evidence of conduct designed to impede or prevent a witness from testifying is admissible to show consciousness of guilt. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 11, 679 N.E.2d 646, citing <em>United States v. Cirillo </em>(C.A.2, 1972), 468 F.2d 1233, 1240. See, also, <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 357, 595 N.E.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 69} <em>Trent\u2019s testimony. </em>First, Conway complains about Trent\u2019s testimony regarding his initial conversations with Conway concerning Dotson\u2019s murder. Trent testified that Conway discussed a Chillicothe case and his concerns about people cooperating with police. According to Trent, Conway then said that \u201che had some people he wanted to take care of.\u201d Trent added that \u201cit was like a list, you know, a hit list\u201d and that Conway had then asked Trent to kill Arthurs. The trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 70} Trent\u2019s testimony explained how his conversation with Conway turned to the subject of killing Arthurs, who was present when Conway killed Dotson. The evidence that Conway wanted Trent to kill Arthurs to prevent his testimony was admissible to show Conway\u2019s consciousness of guilt for Dotson\u2019s murder. <em>State v. Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 11, 679 N.E.2d 646. Thus, the trial court did not commit error.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 71} Second, Conway complains about Trent\u2019s testimony that Conway was afraid that Dotson was going to talk to police about a racketeering case and about seeing Conway shoot someone at a White Castle restaurant. But testimony that Dotson knew of Conway\u2019s other criminal acts and that Conway was afraid that Dotson would go to the police was probative of Conway\u2019s motive and intent to kill and his identity as Dotson\u2019s killer, and it was relevant to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) witness-murder specification. See, e.g., <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 47; <em>State v. Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 161, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 442, 700 N.E.2d 596. In addition, the White Castle shooting and the Jesse James shooting were the same offense, and evidence relating to Conway\u2019s commission of a felonious assault was necessary to prove the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) escaping-detection specification. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, at \u00b6 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b6 72} Third, Conway challenges testimony, admitted over objection, that he asked Trent to kill Arthurs because Conway was afraid that Arthurs would tell police about a robbery in Chillicothe and \u201cthe thing with [Dotson].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 73} As we previously determined, evidence that Conway solicited Trent to kill Arthurs was admissible to show Conway\u2019s consciousness of guilt. <em>State v. Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 11, 679 N.E.2d 646. However, reference to the Chillicothe robbery in relation to Conway\u2019s plan to kill Arthurs was irrelevant to the charges in this case and was not admissible under one of the exceptions to Evid.R. 404(B). See, also, Evid.R. 401 and 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 74} Nevertheless, Conway\u2019s alleged involvement in this robbery is of minor significance compared to the gravity of the aggravated murder charged in this case. Accordingly, we hold that the admission of this evidence did not result in prejudicial error. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, at \u00b6 126-127; <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 73, 623 N.E.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 75} Fourth, Conway complains of Trent\u2019s testimony on redirect examination about a letter that Trent wrote to prosecutors while he and Conway were incarcerated together. Trent testified over objection that he wrote the letter at Conway\u2019s request in order to get placed in protective custody so that he could kill a witness against Conway in an unrelated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 76} On cross-examination, defense counsel had inquired into Trent\u2019s letter in an effort to impeach Trent regarding his motivation for contacting the prosecutor about the Dotson murder. In cross-examining Trent, defense counsel questioned why Trent\u2019s letter to the prosecutor had not implicated Conway in Dotson\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">{\u00b6 77} In <em>State v. Kamel </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 306, 311-312, 12 OBR 378, 466 N.E.2d 860, we held that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination into the defendant\u2019s use of Demerol was permissible because it was the defense that had first raised the subject of defendant\u2019s drug problem and made it an issue at trial. We reasoned that after putting the drug problem in issue, defense counsel could not limit the subject to only those points of evidence that were in its favor. \u201cRather, the topic became open to all relevant inquiry in the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Id. at 312,12 OBR 378, 466 N.E.2d 860, citing, generally, Evid.R. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">{\u00b6 78} In this case, defense counsel first inquired into Trent\u2019s letter in an effort to attack his credibility. Thus, Conway cannot now contend that the prosecution was foreclosed from delving into the same subject in an effort to rehabilitate its witness. Admittedly, evidence of Conway\u2019s desire to kill a witness in an unrelated murder case reflected very badly on Conway\u2019s character. Nevertheless, the evidence was not offered to show propensity or bad character but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>necessary to bolster Trent\u2019s claim that it was Conway\u2019s idea to write the letter. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 79} Fifth, Conway challenges the following testimony by Trent: \u201cConway told me he might have a couple other people he might need me to kill.\u201d He also challenges Trent\u2019s related comment that \u201cnow the body count\u2019s * * * getting astronomical.\u201d Finally, Conway complains about testimony that Trent showed Conway photographs of two people that Trent had purportedly lolled for Conway: Arthurs and another \u201cguy that made a video confession for [Conway].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 80} Conway failed to object to Trent\u2019s \u201cbody count\u201d comment and has waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B). Conway did object to Trent\u2019s testimony that Conway might want him to kill other people, but- not on Evid.R. 404(B) grounds. Thus, he has forfeited all but plain-error analysis by failing to state the specific ground raised on appeal. Evid.R. 103(A)(1); <em>State v. Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 161, 749 N.E.2d 226, citing <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 159, 694 N.E.2d 932. Conway preserved error as to the remaining testimony about the photographs because the basis for his objection is apparent from the transcript. Evid.R. 103(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 81} Except for the reference to the photograph of Arthurs, none of the complained-of testimony should have been admitted because it did not \u201c \u2018tend to show\u2019 by substantial proof\u2019 any of the exceptions under Evid.R. 404(B). See <em>State v. Broom, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting <em>State v. Flonnory </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 124, 126, 60 O.O.2d 95, 285 N.E.2d 726. Nor do we accept the state\u2019s argument that these comments were necessary or relevant to rebut defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Trent.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">- {\u00b6 82} Nevertheless, the admission of Trent\u2019s testimony in these instances, although improper, does not rise to the level of prejudicial error. The comments were gratuitous on Trent\u2019s part and were not invited by the prosecutor. Moreover, other evidence showing similar acts and intentions of Conway was properly admitted. Thus, we conclude that Conway did not suffer material prejudice from the erroneous admission of this testimony. Cf. <em>State v. Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 161, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. Woodard, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 73, 623 N.E.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">2. Evid.R. 403(A): Unfair Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">{\u00b6 83} Conway also contends under this proposition of law that the other-acts evidence in his case was highly prejudicial and should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). Yet Conway failed to object on Evid.R. 403(A) grounds to the trial court\u2019s admission of other-acts evidence. Thus, he has waived all but plain-error analysis. Evid.R. 103(A)(1); Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">{\u00b6 84} We determine that the challenged testimony was substantive evidence showing Conway\u2019s motive, intent, and identity as Dotson\u2019s killer and his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>sciousness of guilt. See, e.g., <em>State v. Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 11-12, 679 N.E.2d 646. In light of the substantial relevance of this evidence, the trial court did not commit plain error in allowing relevant testimony of Conway\u2019s other acts. Therefore, we overrule Conway\u2019s eighth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">IV. Penalty-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Abf\">A. Defense Mitigation Exhibits</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 85} In his third proposition of law, Conway contends that the trial court erred when it prevented the jury from considering defense mitigation exhibits. Conway argues that the trial court should have admitted photographs of him with various family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 86} In the penalty phase, the state objected twice to the defense introduction of these photographs, arguing that they were irrelevant to mitigation and were intended solely to invoke sympathy. No ruling was made on the record, but the trial court did allow Conway\u2019s mitigation witnesses to testify about the photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 87} At the close of its mitigation case, the defense moved to admit the photos into evidence. The state again objected on relevancy grounds. In response, defense counsel argued that the photos were relevant evidence of Conway\u2019s history and background. The trial court, however, found that the photos were not relevant \u201cto any of the factors that the jury can consider\u201d and granted the state\u2019s objection. Defense counsel then proffered the photos for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 88} We hold that the trial court should not have excluded the defense photographs. R.C. 2929.04(B) requires the sentencer to consider \u201cthe history, character, and background of the offender.\u201d Moreover, R.C. 2929.04(C) grants the defendant great latitude in the introduction of mitigating evidence during death-penalty hearings. See <em>State v. Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, at \u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">{\u00b6 89} The excluded evidence depicted Conway at various stages of his life and included photos of several family members, including Conway\u2019s two young children. The photos illustrated testimony that Conway is part of a loving and supportive family and that he maintains a close relationship with his two children. Thus, the photos were relevant mitigating evidence of Conway\u2019s history, character, and background under R.C. 2929.04(B), and to \u201c[a]ny other factors\u201d in mitigation under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). See <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 448, 709 N.E.2d 140, citing <em>Franklin v. Lynaugh </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 164, 174, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, mitigating factors are facts about the defendant\u2019s character, background, and record that may call for a penalty less than death). See, e.g., <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, at \u00b6 198-199 (evidence of loving, dedicated family, and support of young son entitled to mitigating weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 90} However, we hold that the trial court\u2019s decision not to allow Conway to introduce the photographs into evidence does not require a new sentencing hearing. First, Conway has not shown how he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence. The photographs themselves, while illustrative of testimony by defense mitigation witnesses, are essentially cumulative of Conway\u2019s mitigation evidence. For instance, several witnesses testified that Conway loves and cares for his two young children and enjoys a close relationship with his family. Conway\u2019s mitigation witnesses also testified about the photographs in great detail by identifying the individuals depicted, their ages, when and where the photographs were taken, and the activities being pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">(\u00b6 91} Moreover, we can eliminate the effect of the trial court\u2019s decision as a result of our independent review. When independently reviewing a sentence of death pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we may consider proffered evidence that the jury was prevented from considering. <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 267, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 578, 660 N.E.2d 724. Accordingly, we reject Conway\u2019s third proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">B. Penalty-Phase Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 92} Conway argues in his fifth proposition of law that the trial court gave a faulty reasonable-doubt instruction in the penalty phase by repeating the instruction from the guilt phase. Conway challenges the following instruction: \u201cReasonable doubt is present when after you\u2019ve carefully considered and compared all of the evidence you cannot say you are firmly convinced of <em>the truth of the charge. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conway waived this issue by not objecting to the court\u2019s instruction. <em>State v. Franklin </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 128, 580 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus; Crim.R. 30(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 93} We have consistently rejected claims of prejudice stemming from the erroneous use of this particular reasonable-doubt instruction in the penalty phase. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 418, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Goff </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 131-132, 694 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 29-30, 676 N.E.2d 82. We stated in those cases that an appropriate penalty-phase instruction on reasonable doubt conveys to the jurors that they must be firmly convinced that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors and that the prosecution has the burden of proof on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>{\u00b6 94} In addition to the challenged instruction, the trial court told the jury, \u201cThe burden is solely on the State to prove that the aggravated circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d There were three similar instructions informing the jury that, before imposing the death penalty, they must be unanimously convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances in this case outweigh the mitigating factors. Therefore, we hold that the instructions when viewed as a whole were not prejudicial. See, also, <em>State v. Woodard, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 76-77, 623 N.E.2d 75. Accordingly, we overrule Conway\u2019s fifth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">V. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 95} In his seventh proposition of law, Conway makes various claims relating to ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Reversal of a conviction or sentence based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires satisfying the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>Strickland </em>requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. In order to show deficient performance, the defendant must prove that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation. To show prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id.; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">A. Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 96} <em>Failure to request hearing. </em>Immediately prior to Arthurs\u2019s testimony, defense counsel complained that the prosecutor had violated the trial court\u2019s order for separation of witnesses when Arthurs spent approximately 50 minutes in a holding cell talking with Detective Zachary Scott, one of the investigating detectives in the case. Conway now contends that trial counsel were ineffective in failing to request a hearing on this issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">{\u00b6 97} There is no evidence that the trial court\u2019s separation order was violated. First, Detective Scott was on the list of potential witnesses, but the prosecution never called Scott as a witness. When defense counsel brought the issue to the trial court\u2019s attention, the prosecutor explained that Detective Scott was assigned to keep the state\u2019s witnesses separated while they were housed in holding cells prior to testifying. The prosecutor had also instructed Scott not to talk about the case, and there is no evidence that he disobeyed this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">{\u00b6 98} Second, there is no evidence that Detective Scott heard any of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who testified before Arthurs. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Conway does not complain that Scott was in the courtroom while these witnesses testified or that he was privy to their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 99} Finally, defense counsel cross-examined Arthurs on this issue. Arthurs admitted that he and Scott talked in the holding cell prior to his testimony but denied that they discussed this case. Thus, trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">(\u00b6 100} <em>Prejudicial cross-examination. </em>Conway claims that trial counsel were ineffective when their cross-examination of Trent opened the door to damaging testimony on redirect. On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to impeach Trent regarding his reasons for contacting the prosecutor about the Dotson murder. Defense counsel inquired into a letter that Trent had written to prosecutors while he and Conway were incarcerated together, and counsel questioned why Trent\u2019s letter had failed to mention Conway\u2019s role in Dotson\u2019s murder. On redirect, the prosecutor was able to elicit that Trent had written the letter at Conway\u2019s request in order to be placed into protective custody so that he could kill a witness against Conway in an unrelated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 101} The scope of cross-examination falls within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 45; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 339, 738 N.E.2d 1178. In addition, to fairly assess counsel\u2019s performance, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 102} Admittedly, counsel may not have exercised the best judgment in cross-examining Trent on his letter to the prosecutor. (See our discussion regarding Conway\u2019s eighth proposition of law.) The details of the letter were previously unknown to the jury because the state did not attempt to question Trent during his direct testimony about the contents of the letter. Nevertheless, even if counsel\u2019s cross-examination reflected deficient performance, Conway has failed to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>The jury had before it similar testimony that Conway had hired Trent to kill Arthurs in order to prevent Arthurs from testifying against Conway. Thus, Conway has not shown that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of his trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 103} <em>Failure to object. </em>Conway contends that counsel rendered ineffective assistance when they failed to object to inadmissible hearsay and other-acts testimony. However, the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831; <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 653 N.E.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>{\u00b6 104} First, Conway claims that trial counsel should have objected to hearsay testimony from Roberta Hannah that Dotson had made a phone call to her from Chillicothe, \u201cwhere * * * events leading up to the homicide began.\u201d Conway\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 105} Hearsay is an out-of-court statement made by the declarant offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Evid.R. 801(C). Hannah\u2019s testimony was not objectionable on hearsay grounds, because she never testified that Dotson had made the statement in question \u2014 i.e., that he was calling from Chillicothe. See Evid.R. 801(B) (defining \u201cdeclarant\u201d as \u201ca person who makes a statement\u201d). While the statement was objectionable under Evid.R. 602 based on Hannah\u2019s lack of personal knowledge, Conway has not shown that counsel\u2019s failure to object affected the outcome of the trial. Indeed, Conway concedes in his brief that other evidence indicated that Dotson was in Chillicothe just prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 106} Second, Conway claims that defense counsel were ineffective by eliciting hearsay testimony from Arthurs on cross-examination that Nightingale had told Arthurs that Conway had shot Jesse James. Conway claims that counsel should have asked the court to strike Arthurs\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 107} The state argues that Nightingale\u2019s statement was not hearsay, because it was admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e). To be admissible as a nonhearsay statement, Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) requires that the co-conspirator\u2019s statement must be made during the course of the conspiracy. While the record is not entirely clear, it appears that Nightingale\u2019s statement to Arthurs was made prior to the commencement of the conspiracy to kill Dotson. Thus, we reject the state\u2019s co-conspirator argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 108} Nevertheless, even if we determine that defense counsel should have moved to strike this testimony, Conway has failed to show that a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of his trial would have been different had counsel done so. Other evidence proved that Conway shot Jesse James.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">{\u00b6 109} Third, Conway claims that his trial counsel were ineffective for not objecting to Hannah\u2019s testimony describing the incident during which Conway had yelled at Dotson. However, we decided under Conway\u2019s eighth proposition of law that Hannah\u2019s testimony was properly admitted. Thus, there was no basis for counsel to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">{\u00b6 110} <em>Failure to request curative instructions. </em>Conway contends that, in addition to not objecting to inadmissible hearsay and other-acts evidence, trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request curative instructions regarding this evidence. Conway maintains that whenever clearly inadmissible evidence is presented to the jury, counsel has a \u201cclear obligation\u201d to request a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>{\u00b6 111} However, counsel\u2019s decision not to request a jury instruction falls within the ambit of trial strategy. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 341, 595 N.E.2d 902; <em>State v. Schaim </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 61, 600 N. E.2d 661, fn. 9. Furthermore, debatable trial tactics do not constitute ineffective assistance of trial counsel. <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189; <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 146. Conway does not mention what language the curative instructions should have contained or how such instructions would have cured any errors. As Conway has failed to show that counsel\u2019s decision not to request curative instructions was either unreasonable trial strategy or prejudicial, we reject his claim. Cf. <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 331, 686 N.E.2d 245 (counsel\u2019s decision not to request curative instructions to inadmissible evidence reflected an objective standard of reasonable representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 112} <em>Testimony of Jesse James. </em>Conway contends that trial counsel were ineffective because they called Jesse James as a defense witness. Conway claims that James\u2019s testimony established that Conway murdered Dotson to escape detection for committing a felonious assault on James. See R.C. 2929.04(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 113} Counsel\u2019s decision to call a witness is a matter of trial strategy. Such decisions will generally not be second-guessed by a reviewing court. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, at \u00b6 143; <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. We conclude that counsel\u2019s decision to call James as a defense witness did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 114} As a defense witness, James testified that he was shot on September 14, 2001. He claimed that Dotson was at the scene but that he was unable to identify his shooter. On cross-examination, James did testify that a \u201cbig, fat white guy\u201d with a gun was at the scene. While Conway resembled this description, James never testified that Conway was present at the shooting. In addition, James said that the shooting occurred in a residential neighborhood and that no White Castle restaurant was located nearby, testimony that contradicted the testimony of Trent, who had said that Conway shot someone at White Castle. Finally, James testified that, to his knowledge, no charges had been filed regarding his shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 115} Defense counsel noted for the record that they made a strategic decision to call James as a witness in light of the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the defense\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion. Moreover, counsel\u2019s decision to call James reflected reasonable trial strategy. James\u2019s testimony could have created reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors regarding whether Conway had shot James. That this strategy was unsuccessful and the jury ultimately found Conway guilty of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification is not a basis for finding ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>counsel. Trial counsel\u2019s strategic choices must be accorded deference and cannot be examined through the distorting effect of hindsight. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 524-525, 605 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">B. Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 116} <em>Failure to object to reasonable-doubt instruction. </em>Conway maintains that his trial counsel were ineffective for not objecting to the trial court\u2019s penalty-phase reasonable-doubt instruction. But this instruction was harmless. (See the discussion regarding Conway\u2019s fifth proposition of law.) Thus, we cannot deem counsel ineffective for failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">{\u00b6 117} <em>Failure to call psychologist. </em>Conway argues that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to call a psychologist during the penalty phase. Trial counsel did employ the services of Dr. Robert Stinson, a forensic psychologist, but did not call Dr. Stinson as a defense mitigation witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 118} A decision by trial counsel not to call an expert witness generally will not sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 298, 307-308, 544 N.E.2d 622; <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 514 N.E.2d 407. The record does not reveal why Dr. Stinson was not called to testify or what testimony he would have provided. Thus, nothing in the record establishes that counsel were deficient by not calling Dr. Stinson or that, if called, he would have provided relevant mitigating evidence. Therefore, we hold that this claim has no merit. See, e.g., <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 335, 703 N.E.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 119} <em>Testimony of high school physics teacher. </em>Finally, Conway claims that his trial counsel were ineffective in calling William Kruczynski, his high school physics teacher, as a mitigation witness. Kruczynski testified that Conway was a very good physics student but, notwithstanding, he believed that Conway was an \u201cat-risk\u201d student. Kruczynski defined an at-risk student as one who may have \u201cproblems in * * * life, at home or work or somewhere else\u201d that may prevent the student from performing up to his or her capabilities in class. Conway contends that Kruczynski\u2019s testimony left the jury with the impression that Conway \u201cmost certainly had the potential to do something positive with his life, and that he most certainly understood the consequences of the decisions he was making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 120} Kruczynski\u2019s testimony corroborated other mitigation testimony and fit within the overall mitigation strategy adopted by the defense: to show that Conway was physically and verbally abused by his father and that Conway has some redeeming qualities. Thus, Conway has not shown that his counsel were deficient in calling Kruczynski or that there was a reasonable probability that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>outcome of his penalty hearing would have been different had Kruczynski not testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">{\u00b6 121} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Conway has not shown that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel. Accordingly, we reject Conway\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">VI. Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 122} In his first proposition of law, Conway raises various constitutional challenges to Ohio death-penalty statutes. However, we have already rejected similar arguments. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 734 N.E.2d 345. Ohio\u2019s capital sentencing scheme is constitutional. See, e.g., <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997) 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668; <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 253-254, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Accordingly, we summarily reject Conway\u2019s first proposition of law. <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">VII. Independent Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">A. Penalty Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 123} At the penalty hearing, Conway called 12 mitigation witnesses and gave an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 124} Tina Bourne, Conway\u2019s cousin, is the same age as Conway, and they grew up together. Bourne said that Conway is like a brother, and she wants him to remain in her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">{\u00b6 125} Conway has two children: four-year-old James IV, whose nickname is \u201cBubba,\u201d and two-year-old Halle. According to Bourne, Conway is very close to his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">{\u00b6 126} Bourne described Conway\u2019s father, James Conway Jr., as an \u201cextremist.\u201d Bourne said that Conway\u2019s father loved his children, but he would get upset over \u201cthe littlest things\u201d and would physically and verbally abuse Conway and his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">{\u00b6 127} Conway\u2019s uncle, Richard Wilkinson (the brother of Conway\u2019s mother, Janice Conway), said that Conway\u2019s father was \u201cvolatile\u201d and violent at times. According to Richard, Conway\u2019s father gave Janice Conway a \u201cblack eye or two.\u201d Conway\u2019s father was not a good role model, and he failed to provide Conway with basic values or a strong work ethic.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">{\u00b6 128} Richard also noted that Conway was intelligent and performed well in school. Conway was an elementary school chess champion and was good at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>sports. Richard said that Conway would be a good influence on his children even while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 129} Thelma Jean Wilkinson, Conway\u2019s maternal grandmother, testified that Conway lived with her while his father was in prison and that she loved Conway.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 130} Randall Wilkinson, Conway\u2019s uncle, testified that his daughter, Tina Bourne, and Conway attended Bible school together. Conway also played football for the west side Boys\u2019 Club and was in high school ROTC. He wanted to become a Navy SEAL but was rejected because of poor eyesight. Randall said that Conway adds \u201cvalue\u201d to his life and that he will maintain contact with Conway if Conway is given a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 131} John Hambel, Conway\u2019s uncle, has lived in close proximity to Conway his entire life. Conway\u2019s father used to \u201cwhip\u201d his children, but John never discussed this matter with Conway\u2019s father or considered calling children\u2019s services or the police. John and Conway are close in age; they played youth football together for the west side Boys\u2019 Club, and later, both coached football at the boys\u2019 club. John has maintained his close relationship with Conway during his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 132} Maranda Oliver, the mother of Conway\u2019s daughter, Halle, had a one-year relationship with Conway. While they were dating, Conway attended Columbus State and made the dean\u2019s list. Oliver still maintains contact with Conway, and she believes it is important that Conway remain in Halle\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 133} Jo Ellen Conway, Conway\u2019s aunt, baby-sat Conway when he was a child. Her relationship with Conway is important, and she wants to continue to be a part of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 134} Jo Ellen testified that her brother, Conway\u2019s father, physically abused her as well as his wife, Janice. She described her brother as a \u201cmaniac\u201d and said that he verbally abused his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">{\u00b6 135} Gretchen R\u00f3ese met Conway through his sister and had a several-month romantic relationship with him. R\u00f3ese remains friends with Conway, visits him in jail, writes letters, and talks with him on the phone. R\u00f3ese said that Conway has a great relationship with his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">{\u00b6 136} R\u00f3ese, however, observed that Conway\u2019s relationship with his father is abnormal. R\u00f3ese claims that Conway\u2019s father constantly yelled, called Conway names, and never offered any positive comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">{\u00b6 137} William Kruczynski, Conway\u2019s high school physics teacher, testified that Conway was a very good physics student. However, he opined that Conway was an \u201cat-risk\u201d student, which he described as a student who has problems outside of school that prevents the student from performing to his or her full potential in class.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>{\u00b6 138} Clara Hambel, Conway\u2019s paternal grandmother, described her family as very close. Clara has spent a considerable amount of time with Conway, and continues to write and visit him in jail. Clara said Conway\u2019s children also visit him in jail and that he is a loving and supportive father. Everyone in the family loves Conway and wants him to remain a part of their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">{\u00b6 139} Jennifer Conway, Conway\u2019s sister, enjoys a close relationship with Conway and said that the entire family is tight-knit. Jennifer helps care for Conway\u2019s children while he is incarcerated. She still loves her brother, visits him in jail every chance she gets, and will always support him.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 140} Jennifer said that Conway did well in school and was always on the honor roll when he was younger. In high school, Conway was in the band and ROTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 141} Jennifer described her father as very stern. He would become angry over little things and yell a lot and was always critical. Her father would often \u201cwhoop\u201d her and her brothers, and he was verbally abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 142} Janice Conway, Conway\u2019s mother, said that her husband was incarcerated after Conway was born and that she took Conway to visit him in prison. Her husband drank a lot and physically abused her and the children, once breaking their other son\u2019s jaw. However, Janice never thought of calling the police or children\u2019s services because she did not think it would help. In hindsight, Janice recognized that she should have left and taken the children with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 143} Janice testified that Conway did well in school and played chess, football, and the saxophone. Conway was in high school ROTC and wanted to be a Navy aviator and a Navy SEAL. However, his eyesight was poor, and he did not pass the tests. Janice visits Conway in jail and wants to maintain then-relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 144} In Conway\u2019s unsworn statement, he said he could never imagine what Dotson\u2019s family was going through. Conway asked the jury for the opportunity to see his children grow older and to teach them right from wrong. He said that no one can do that better than people who \u201chad opportunities and made the wrong choices in their life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">{\u00b6 145} Conway said that he would like to be there for his family, and he never realized until then how many people cared for him. Ultimately, he said that his family was being punished for the \u201cthings that [he has] been convicted of.\u201d Conway hoped that the jurors could see that his family did nothing wrong and that they would spare his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>B. Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">{\u00b6 146} The jury convicted Conway of three death-penalty specifications: R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), aggravated murder to escape detection, apprehension, trial or punishment for another offense; R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), aggravated murder during a kidnapping; and R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), aggravated murder to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding. For purposes of sentencing, the trial court merged the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (A)(8) specifications and submitted two aggravating circumstances for the jury\u2019s consideration. See <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 344, 652 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 147} After independent assessment, we hold that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Conway killed Andrew Dotson during a kidnapping and that he did so for the purpose of escaping detection for committing a felonious assault. Conway solicited Arthurs and Nightingale to kill Dotson because Dotson had seen Conway shoot Jesse James. Arthurs and Nightingale drove Dotson to West Virginia under false pretenses for the purpose of killing him. When they could not carry out the murder, Conway ordered them to bring Dotson to him, and Conway killed Dotson himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 148} Nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense is mitigating. Dotson was passed out from ingesting drugs when Conway instructed Arthurs and Nightingale to follow him to a nearby cornfield. After arriving at the cornfield, Conway brutally killed Dotson by striking him twice in the chest with a pickax as he lay unconscious and helpless on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 149} Conway\u2019s history, character, and background provide some mitigating features. There was testimony that Conway\u2019s father verbally and physically abused Conway and other family members. Despite this abuse, Conway was able to succeed in several areas. Witnesses attested to Conway\u2019s academic achievements in grade school, high school, and college. As a juvenile and young adult, Conway was successful in several endeavors, including chess, football, band, and high school ROTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 150} Several family members and friends testified that Conway is a loving and supportive father to his two young children. While attending college, Conway was employed at his uncle\u2019s concrete company, and he contributed to his local community by coaching youth football. We accord some mitigating weight to these factors. See, e.g., <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, at \u00b6 198; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 194, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 151} Conway\u2019s age of 23 at the time of the offense qualifies as a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) (youth of offender). However, we assign only modest weight to this factor. See, e.g., <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>349, 715 N.E.2d 136; <em>State v. Dunlap </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 308, 319, 652 N.E.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 152} As to the R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) \u201cother factors,\u201d Conway grew up in a loving, supportive, and close-knit family. Several family members and friends testified of their love for Conway and the importance of having him in their lives. We have also considered Conway\u2019s family photographs that the trial court improperly excluded. The love and devotion of Conway\u2019s family and friends qualify as \u201cother factors\u201d worth some mitigating weight. See, e.g., <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, at \u00b6 199; <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 239, 744 N.E.2d 163. That Conway has children who love and need him is also mitigating. See, e.g., <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, at \u00b6 144. There was some brief testimony that Conway would do well in a structured and disciplined environment, but this factor is entitled to only slight weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 153} We hold that Conway\u2019s unsworn statement is entitled to little weight. Conway expressed little remorse and never specifically apologized for murdering Dotson. See, e.g., <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, at \u00b6 180; <em>State v. Keene, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 671, 693 N.E.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 154} As to the remaining statutory mitigating factors, no evidence was presented in regard to R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record), and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 155} Upon weighing the evidence, we hold that the aggravating circumstances of murder to escape detection, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), and murder in the course of a kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), outweigh Conway\u2019s collective mitigation evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we hold that Conway\u2019s death sentence is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">{\u00b6 156} Finally, the death penalty imposed is proportionate to death sentences approved in other cases in which the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification was present in combination with an R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 180; <em>State v. Noling, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 152; <em>State v. Frazier, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 344-345, 652 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">{\u00b6 157} Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences, including the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-12\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AO2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Steven L.
