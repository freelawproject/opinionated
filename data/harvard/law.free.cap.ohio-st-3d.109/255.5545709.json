Defendant-appellant, Troy Tenace, was arrested several days later and was charged with aggravated murder during an aggravated robbery of 76-year-old Edward Kozlowski. Tenace was found guilty of murdering Kozlowski and was sentenced to death, but his conviction was reversed on appeal. Tenace was retried and was again found guilty of murdering Kozlowski, and he was sentenced to death. The court of appeals then affirmed his conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 2} In this appeal, Tenace has raised 17 propositions of law. We have reviewed each and have determined that none justifies reversal of Tenace\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating evidence and have compared Tenace\u2019s sentence to those imposed in similar cases. We find that the aggravating circumstance does not outweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we reverse Tenace\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">{\u00b6 3} <em>Prosecution evidence. </em>On Christmas Eve 1993, Tenace arrived from New York at the home of Lori Moore in Toledo. Moore had known Tenace since 1991, when he worked construction and handyman jobs with Moore\u2019s daughter\u2019s boyfriend. Because Tenace had no place to stay and all of the local shelters were full, Moore allowed Tenace to stay at her home. During the next several weeks, Tenace continued to stay at Moore\u2019s home. According to Moore, Tenace would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>go to the public library, get lists from the local directories, and make phone calls soliciting work for concrete and household repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">{\u00b6 4} During January 1994, Marlene Murphy, who also lived at Moore\u2019s home, would borrow Moore\u2019s car to run errands. Because Tenace was not permitted to drive Moore\u2019s car, Murphy drove Tenace to buy supplies and to places where he worked. On one occasion, Murphy took Tenace to a house on Wamba Street in Toledo, where Tenace had done some chimney work.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 5} In late January 1994, Ben Lamont Covington, who lived at Moore\u2019s house with Moore\u2019s daughter, drove Tenace to Wamba Street in Moore\u2019s car. Before taking Tenace there, Covington overheard Tenace say that he was going to reimburse a customer who had overpaid him. Moore had seen Tenace at the same time and described him as being \u201chigh.\u201d According to Moore, Tenace had called a customer to tell him that he had overpaid. Tenace left Moore\u2019s home that evening wearing heavy work boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 6} As Covington drove Tenace to Wamba Street, it was \u201csnowing like crazy.\u201d Covington dropped Tenace off at the Wamba Street address and told him he was going to a nearby store. A short time later, while inside the store, Covington saw Tenace get in Moore\u2019s car and beckon to Covington. Tenace then told Covington that he \u201ctook care of business,\u201d and they drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 7} While riding back to Moore\u2019s, Tenace opened the car window and said he was hot, and he asked Covington to stop the car because he had to vomit. Tenace left the car. After a few minutes, Tenace returned, and they drove back to Moore\u2019s home. There, Tenace gave Covington $20.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 8} Lois Hamilton, who lived next door to Edward Kozlowski, did not see Kozlowski on January 26 and noticed that Kozlowski did not undertake his usual morning routine on Thursday, January 27. Hamilton knew Kozlowski was at home because his car was parked in the garage. The next morning, however, Hamilton became concerned because she had seen a light on in Kozlowski\u2019s living room around 4:30 a.m. and noticed that it was still on around dawn. Hamilton summoned Kozlowski\u2019s brother, Chester, because she suspected that something was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 9} After receiving Hamilton\u2019s call, Chester Kozlowski went to his brother\u2019s home. Once inside, Chester found his brother lying between the living room and dining room in a pool of blood. The phone cord had been ripped out of the wall, so Chester asked Hamilton to call police.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 10} Toledo police arrived and found cloth wrapped around Kozlowski\u2019s head, covering his mouth. Officer James Knight described Kozlowski\u2019s face as \u201cbeaten\u201d with \u201csevere damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The deputy coroner who performed the autopsy on Kozlowski found what appeared to be a shirt wrapped around his face with a knot in his mouth in gag form. Kozlowski had sustained blunt-force injuries to his face and neck, including fractures to the bridge of his nose and skull fractures, as well as three broken ribs.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 12} Internally, Kozlowski sustained \u201cquite a few injuries of the -neck.\u201d The horns of the thyroid cartilage were fractured, indicating a squeezing-type pressure from both sides of the neck. There was also a hairline fracture of the left side of the hyoid bone. But the gag on his mouth did not cause Kozlowski to suffocate. The nature of Kozlowski\u2019s injuries indicated manual strangulation. The coroner concluded that Kozlowski had incurred a combined cause of death: blunt craniocerebral trauma and strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 13} In the days following his trip to Wamba Street, Tenace began making a number of calls to New York, saying that he had to get out of town. Tenace told Moore that he needed money to get out of town and acted \u201cagitated, walking around the house saying, \u2018He must have choked on a gag.\u2019 \u201d Tenace asked Covington to lend him money. When Covington told Tenace he could not, Tenace told him, \u2018You don\u2019t understand. I need it. I just killed a mother fucker. * * * I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead. I just stomped on his head a couple times and he wasn\u2019t moving, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead.\u201d Tenace admitted to Covington that the incident happened at the house to which Covington had driven him several days earlier. During this time, Moore also heard Tenace say, \u201cI think I killed him. * * * He must have choked on the gag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 14} Covington and others living at Moore\u2019s house discussed what Tenace had said and began looking for news of a murder on television. When the news reported the discovery of Kozlowski\u2019s body, Tenace, who was also there at the time, \u201cdropped his head and * * * said he was sorry and that he didn\u2019t want to hear no more of that shit\u201d and left the room. Sometime thereafter, Murphy heard Tenace say, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough evidence. They can\u2019t pin this on anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 15} Fearing for her life, over the weekend, Moore made many attempts to reach authorities to remove Tenace from her home. On the following Monday, January 31, Thomas Ross, then a Toledo police investigator, returned Moore\u2019s phone call and met her away from her home. At that time, Moore gave Ross a sheet of paper that Tenace had given her. On one side of the paper was a code to be given to Western Union that Moore was to use to obtain money for Tenace. On the other side was the Xerox copy of a page from a city journal of addresses. The name Helen Kozlowski, her address on Wamba Street, and her phone number had been circled in green ink.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Police arrested Tenace at Moore\u2019s home, and at the police station, Detective Ross advised Tenace of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Tenace waived those rights after stating that he was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. After signing a waiver-of-rights form, Tenace told police that he had found Kozlowski\u2019s name and phone number in a street guide. Tenace stated that he had circled Kozlowski\u2019s address on the street-guide page because Kozlowski had agreed to have work done to his chimney.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 17} When Detective Ross asked Tenace what happened at Wamba Street during the last week of January 1994, Tenace became very upset. Tenace said that he had been awake for several days, drinking beer and doing crack and that he had needed more crack. Tenace stated that someone drove him to Kozlowski\u2019s home and that he had asked Kozlowski for change. Tenace claimed that Kozlowski was talking so loudly that he feared the neighbors might become alarmed, so he placed a gag around Kozlowski\u2019s face. Tenace said that he grabbed money out of Kozlowski\u2019s pocket and ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 18} While the interview continued, Tenace was \u201cfull of despair, crying\u201d and said he wished he could die. Tenace was rambling so much that Detective Ross gave him a few minutes to settle down, and he then asked Tenace whether he would agree to be taped. Ross then audiotaped his interview with Tenace, and Tenace admitted that he had wrestled with Kozlowski on the floor of Kozlowski\u2019s home and had tied a gag around his mouth. Tenace had asked Kozlowski whether he had more money, and Kozlowski pointed to the other room. Tenace opened a drawer and took \u201c[a] couple hundred\u201d dollars and pulled the phone cord out of the wall \u201cso he couldn\u2019t call anybody.\u201d Tenace then fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Trial result </em>The grand jury indicted Tenace on one count of aggravated murder for the killing of Kozlowski (R.C. 2903.01(B)), with a death-penalty specification for murder during an aggravated robbery. See R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The grand jury also indicted Tenace for aggravated robbery pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 20} A jury convicted Tenace on both counts and recommended a death sentence. Upon appeal, the court of appeals reversed. The appellate court found that Tenace was denied the effective assistance of counsel when the trial court allowed counsel to withdraw Tenace\u2019s plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, even though Tenace had objected. <em>State v. Tenace </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 702, 715, 700 N.E.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 21} On remand, the cause was retried, and another jury found Tenace guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">{\u00b6 22} At the mitigation hearing, Tenace presented several mitigation witnesses, including his mother, a videotaped deposition of his brother, and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>expert psychologist. However, the jury recommended death, and the court imposed the death penalty on Tenace.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">{\u00b6 23} On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence. The cause is now before us on an appeal as of right, pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A) and Section 2(B)(2)(e), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Voir Dire/Pretrial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\n<em>Excusal for Cause (VII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 24} In proposition of law VII, Tenace argues that the trial court erroneously excluded prospective juror Vitale from the venire solely on the grounds that she is the sister of one of Tenace\u2019s attorneys. Tenace submits that a trial court may not add to the categories of presumptively prejudiced jurors set forth in Crim.R. 24 and exclude them for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 25} The excusal of prospective juror Vitale did not constitute error. As we held in <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 249, 750 N.E.2d 90, \u201can erroneous excusal for cause, on grounds other than the venireman\u2019s views on capital punishment, is not cognizable error, since a party has no right to have any particular person sit on the jury. Unlike the erroneous denial of a challenge for cause, an erroneous excusal cannot cause the seating of a biased juror and therefore does not taint the jury\u2019s impartiality.\u201d Accord <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 26} Moreover, excusing juror Vitale was within the trial court\u2019s discretion under CrimR. 24(C), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA person called as a juror may be challenged for the following causes:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(14) That the juror is otherwise unsuitable for any other cause to serve as a juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">{\u00b6 30} See, also, R.C. 2313.42(G) (a prospective juror may be properly excused for cause if the juror is \u201cakin by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree * * * to the attorney of either party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">{\u00b6 31} Proposition VII is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">\n<em>Voluntariness of Confession (VIII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">{\u00b6 32} In proposition of law VIH, Tenace contends that a confession made to police when a defendant is not informed that he faces the death penalty is involuntary and violates his rights to counsel and to be free from self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">{\u00b6 33} Yet as Tenace concedes, we have held that police are not required to inform a suspect that he or she is \u201cpotentially eligible for a death sentence prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to obtaining a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 60, 656 N.E.2d 623. Accord <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 230, 235, 703 N.E.2d 286. Accordingly, proposition VIII is summarily overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Trial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence [Specific Intent] (II)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\n<em>Manifest Weight of the Evidence (III)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 34} In proposition of law II, Tenace asserts that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove intent to kill and that therefore his conviction and sentence for aggravated murder must be reversed. Tenace submits that the trial court erred in not granting his Crim.R. 29(A) motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 35} In proposition of law III, Tenace asserts that because the state failed to prove the element of intent to kill, his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 36} In criminal appeals from the court of appeals, this court is not required to reweigh evidence. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 102, 684 N.E.2d 668, fn. 4. While pursuant to R.C. 2953.02 we can overturn a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence in a capital case, we consider such claims only when the crime was committed after January 1, 1995. <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 254, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 134. Because the crime committed here occurred before 1995, we will not decide Tenace\u2019s weight-of-the-evidence arguments. Nevertheless, as we did in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Skatzes, </em>we will consider Tenace\u2019s arguments as if he were challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 37} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. A motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(A) is governed by the same standard as the one for determining whether a verdict is supported by sufficient evidence. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 553, 651 N.E.2d 965; <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 38} The state\u2019s evidence showed that Tenace told both Moore and Covington that he needed money to get out of town. After Covington told Tenace that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>could not give him any money, Tenace declared: \u201cI need it. I just killed a mother fucker. * * * I just stomped on his head a couple times and he wasn\u2019t moving, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead.\u201d Lori Moore described Tenace as \u201cagitated,\u201d and Marlene Murphy described Tenace as \u201cjittery and jumping\u201d after he returned to Moore\u2019s home with Covington from Wamba Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">{\u00b6 39} Dr. Cynthia Beisser, who performed the autopsy on Kozlowski, stated that the nature of the injuries to Kozlowski\u2019s neck indicated a squeezing-type pressure from both sides of the neck, and she testified that he was a victim of manual strangulation. She further noted that her external findings showed quite a bit of trauma on Kozlowski\u2019s face and neck area, including bruises, abrasions, and lacerations caused by blunt-force trauma. Several areas of Kozlowski\u2019s head and neck sustained fractures, including the bridge of his nose, the sphenoid bone, the roof of the sphenoid sinus, the horns of the thyroid cartilage, and the left side of the hyoid bone. Kozlowski also had subarachnoid blood over the left side of his brain, and he sustained three broken ribs. Dr. Beisser concluded that Kozlowski had died as a result of blunt craniocerebral trauma and strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 40} Tenace argues that the foregoing did not constitute a \u201csavage beating\u201d or \u201cmassive damage\u201d to Kozlowski and that Dr. Beisser\u2019s testimony talked only about \u201chairline fractures, brittle bones, and no evidence of stomping.\u201d Tenace also submits that questions from the jury during deliberation indicate that the jury struggled with the issues of purpose and specific intent. Tenace points out that even the trial judge expressed concern over the jury\u2019s possible confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 41} Nevertheless, construed in a light most favorable to the state, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict beyond a reasonable doubt on the element of specific intent to kill. A jury could reasonably find that Tenace specifically intended to kill Kozlowski in the course of aggravated robbery, given the evidence of manual strangulation and multiple blunt-force injuries to Kozlowski\u2019s head. As we noted in another capital case, an intent to kill is shown by a defendant\u2019s blows to the victim\u2019s \u201chead, certainly a vital area.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 82, 656 N.E.2d 643. That the 76-year-old Kozlowski had brittle bones, or that some of the fractures he sustained were hairline, does not detract from the evidence showing Tenace\u2019s intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 42} Accordingly, we reject propositions II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Sentencing Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence (I)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 43} In proposition of law I, Tenace argues that the evidence was insufficient to find that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the factors in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt and that therefore his death sentence was inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ate. We will consider Tenace\u2019s arguments as part of our independent review of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\n<em>Proportionality Review (XVII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 44} In proposition of law XVII, Tenace contends that his sentence is disproportionate to the sentence in other cases involving murder in connection with aggravated robbery. Yet many of the arguments that Tenace raises under this proposition claiming a disproportionate sentence are the same ones he raises claiming that the evidence was insufficient to find that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors. Accordingly, we will also consider Tenace\u2019s arguments under this proposition as part of our independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 45} In proposition of law IV, Tenace alleges that prosecutorial misconduct occurred throughout his trial. However, determining whether improper remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct requires analysis as to (1) whether the remarks were improper and (2), if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. We will not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 46} Tenace first contends that the prosecutor misstated the evidence and made outlandish remarks by promising to provide a connection between the extent of the injury to the victim and defendant\u2019s intent to kill. Tenace cites the prosecutor\u2019s language during opening statement of the guilt phase that characterized Kozlowski\u2019s injuries as \u201cmassive damage\u201d due to a \u201csavage beating * * * inflicted on this person * * * to cause his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">{\u00b6 47} Yet even if Tenace had objected, error or prejudice is lacking. The prosecutor\u2019s comment that Kozlowski suffered \u201cmassive damage\u201d constituted fair comment. The prosecutor is allowed to foreshadow what the evidence is and what he believes the evidence will establish. The terms the prosecutor used were a fair summary of the evidence later elicited from Dr. Beisser. Tenace points to testimony that Dr. Beisser gave on cross-examination that several of the facial fractures Kozlowski sustained required little physical force to occur. But Dr. Beisser stated that Kozlowski suffered \u201cquite a bit of trauma\u201d externally and \u201cquite a few injuries of the neck\u201d internally. Quantitatively, \u201cmassive damage\u201d was an appropriate term to describe what the evidence did in fact show, as testified to by Dr. Beisser. The fact that the force that caused certain injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>was not intense did not mean that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was an exaggeration or improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">{\u00b6 48} Nor was \u201csavage beating * * * inflicted * * * to cause his death\u201d an improper description in opening statement. Dr. Beisser concluded that these injuries caused the victim\u2019s death, and a jury may certainly find intent to kill from the nature of the injuries that Tenace inflicted upon this 76-year-old man, as well as the surrounding facts and circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 168, 555 N.E.2d 293. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that opening statements are not evidence. See <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 226, 744 N.E.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 49} Tenace next claims that the prosecutor improperly stated during closing argument at the guilt phase that Tenace had left the victim to die. Tenace\u2019s failure to object waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 451, 696 N.E.2d 1009. Moreover, error is absent in any event. The prosecutor may comment on \u201c \u2018what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 165, 555 N.E.2d 293, quoting <em>State v. Stephens </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82, 53 O.O.2d 182, 263 N.E.2d 773. The facts show that Tenace did leave Kozlowski after beating and robbing him and that Kozlowski then died.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 50} Next, Tenace complains that the prosecutor improperly asserted in closing argument that the defendant had \u201cstomped\u201d the victim. Regardless of the fact that Tenace failed to object, such a comment was not improper. Tenace told Covington that he thought the victim was dead \u201cbecause he stomped in his head a couple of times and he wasn\u2019t moving when he left.\u201d The prosecutor fairly commented on the evidence and simply reiterated the characterization that Tenace himself relayed to Covington. The fact that Dr. Beisser testified on cross-examination that there was no evidence of stomping on Kozlowski\u2019s neck did not necessarily conflict with Covington\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 51} Tenace next cites as improper the prosecutor\u2019s comment, without evidence to support it, that Tenace had a plan to eliminate the victim. Once again, Tenace\u2019s failure to object waived all but plain error. Moreover, the statement was a fair comment based on a reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence. Tenace knew that Kozlowski had paid him in cash before, so he reasoned that it was likely that Kozlowski had cash at his home. Tenace also knew that Kozlowski was elderly and that Kozlowski could identify him. Based on this evidence, the prosecutor could argue, and the jury could reasonably infer, that Tenace had planned to rob and kill Kozlowski before going to Kozlowski\u2019s home that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 52} Tenace next claims improper comment during guilt-phase closing argument that Kozlowski suffered \u201cmassive injury.\u201d Again, Tenace did not object, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and the comment did not constitute error. This comment was fair based on the testimony of Dr. Beisser in view of the fact that Kozlowski\u2019s injuries had caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 53} Tenace also cites as improper the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument at the close of the guilt phase. The prosecutor stated: \u201cNow, we don\u2019t know what happened in that house on that evening. Only the killer would actually know that. And we know what Troy Tenace told the police on that \u2014 the 31st. But I submit to you that he entered the house, as a possible scenario, he demanded the money from Mr. Kozlowski. Mr. Kozlowski said no, I\u2019m not giving you my money, and he said, Get out or I\u2019m going to call the police. He goes over to pick up the phone. That\u2019s when the phone cord is pulled out. He said he didn\u2019t want him making noise so it would attract attention from the neighbors. He certainly didn\u2019t want him to pick up the phone and leave there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 54} Tenace did not object to these comments, but none of them constituted error. These were all fair comments based on reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 55} Next, Tenace complains that the prosecutor improperly told jurors during voir dire that death was a mandatory sentence under some circumstances. He claims further improper comment when the prosecutor stated at the close of the mitigation phase: \u201cYour verdict will be mandatory, and that is that you must vote for the death sentence.\u201d Tenace asserts that the trial judge made the same mandatory-death comment to two prospective jurors who did not serve on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 56} Defense counsel never objected to any of these comments. Yet even if they had been objected to, error is absent. The prosecutor prefaced his comment during voir dire by explaining that if the jury finds that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors, a death sentence is mandatory. The trial judge gave one prospective juror a hypothetical: \u201cThe law says that if A, B, and C exists, you must impose the death penalty. You have no choice. It\u2019s mandatory. The law says you must.\u201d The judge told the other prospective juror: \u201cas a matter of fact in certain circumstances the death penalty is mandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 57} Ohio law directs that the jury \u201cshall recommend to the court that the sentence of death be imposed on the offender\u201d when the jury unanimously finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). Thus, given the context and manner in which the comments were delivered, the comments were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 58} Lastly, Tenace contends that the cumulative effect of the prosecutorial comments cited by him denied him a fair trial. Since the prosecutor\u2019s comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>were either fair comments or nonprejudicial, no basis exists for us to find cumulative error. Accordingly, we overrule proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Effective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 59} In proposition of law V, Tenace contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to improper and prejudicial statements by the prosecutor. Before we reverse a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. * * * Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 60} However, in no instance does Tenace demonstrate deficient performance or prejudice \u2014 in other words, \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id., paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 61} Tenace first argues that counsel failed to object when the state promised to connect the extent of the injuries to the victim with defendant\u2019s intent to kill through the coroner\u2019s testimony. Yet as we discussed under proposition IV, the prosecutorial comments were not improper in the context in which they were made. Moreover, defense counsel cannot be found deficient in not objecting to comments about evidence that the state has yet to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 62} Tenace then asserts that counsel were deficient in failing to object to other instances that he claims constituted prosecutorial misconduct. However, \u201c \u2018[t]he failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 347, 715 N.E.2d 136, quoting <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831. Moreover, as we discussed in proposition IV, the prosecutorial comments that Tenace complains of were proper, and therefore counsel did not render ineffective assistance in not objecting to these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 63} Tenace also claims that counsel were deficient in failing to propose jury instructions that placed the burden of proving the mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence on the state. However, we have held that requiring an accused to establish mitigating factors, even by a preponderance, remains constitutionally valid. See <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 15-16, 564 N.E.2d 408. Therefore, counsel were not deficient in failing to propose different jury instructions in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 64} Lastly, Tenace submits that the cumulative effect of counsel\u2019s mistakes violated his right to effective assistance of counsel. However, Tenace received a fair trial, and we hold that all of the instances cited by him either did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>constitute deficient performance or did not affect the outcome of his trial. Therefore, we overrule proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Constitutionality</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 65} In proposition VI, Tenace argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty scheme violates international law, and he contends that trial counsel were deficient in failing to argue that his rights were violated under international law. However, we have uniformly rejected such claims. See <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643; <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 69, 752 N.E.2d 904. Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to raise such claims did not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 66} In propositions of law IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI, Tenace challenges Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes on numerous constitutional grounds, but we summarily reject these claims. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 137-138, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 125, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383; <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 453, 700 N.E.2d 596; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 372, 582 N.E.2d 972; and <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Independent Review and Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"AUj\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 67} Upon independent assessment, we find that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance in this case: that Tenace murdered Edward Kozlowski while committing an aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\n<em>Mitigating Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">{\u00b6 68} In proposition of law I, Tenace contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">{\u00b6 69} At the mitigation hearing, Tenace presented four witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">{\u00b6 70} Tammy Bruno, Tenace\u2019s sister, testified during the mitigation phase of Tenace\u2019s first capital trial in November 1994. However, because she was in prison at the time of Tenace\u2019s second trial, her prior testimony was read to the jury. In that testimony, Bruno described her childhood as \u201cvery bad.\u201d She was \u201csexually abused by [her] father * * * from the time [she] was two until [she] was about 17, and he [Tenace] was made to watch * * *.\u201d The family never celebrated any holidays or birthdays, and Bruno stated that she and her brothers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>would cook their own meals \u201cbecause [her] mother was either sleeping or she was out at night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">{\u00b6 71} Bruno described her life prior to her marriage to a New York state trooper as \u201c[v]ery, very bad. Psycho kind of bad.\u201d As children, she and her brothers thought their lives were normal. Their parents, who divorced when the children were very young, would steal the children from each other. Bruno elaborated on the fact that Tenace was always present when Bruno was sexually abused as a child. Tenace would be in his own bed in the same room and would be told to go to sleep or be made to stand there and watch \u201cas [her] stepfather would make [her] do things.\u201d She testified, \u201cWe had race horses, and he would make me do things to the horses and he would make [Tenace] stand there and watch * * *.\u201d Bruno also recounted that Tenace had told her that their mother would leave him with a baby-sitter who sexually abused him. Tenace would beg his mother not to leave him there, but she would ignore his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 72} Bruno declared, \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a normal family, ever,\u201d and she said that Tenace had never had a normal life. Bruno felt that if Tenace\u2019s life were spared, he would adjust well to prison life and that his son would be able to see him. According to Bruno, all Tenace has ever known are \u201cabnormal things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 73} Tenace\u2019s brother, Tony Tenace, testified by way of a videotaped deposition. Tony is a year older than Tenace and was incarcerated in New York for burglary and grand larceny at the time of Tenace\u2019s second trial. According to Tony, their family often moved around when the children were growing up, and they lived with boxes around their homes because they never settled anywhere to the point where they were completely unpacked. The father of the Tenace children had drinking problems, as did their grandfather. Tony stated that their father was never around, but was physically abusive to him when he was around. Their parents had a lot of fights, and their father would beat up their mother. Tony described his father as \u201ca drunk\u201d and claimed that on one occasion when Tony was about 12 years old, his father, while drunk, tried to touch him inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 74} Tony further testified that their father never accepted Tenace as his son because he believed erroneously that someone else was Tenace\u2019s father. Tony also described their father as a \u201cbig shot\u201d who at times had a lot of money, but never had time for his children. He recalled that once when their father gave the boys presents, they turned out to be stolen girls\u2019 bikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 75} The marriage of Tenace\u2019s parents dissolved when their mother, Bonnie, caught their father in adultery. Subsequently, their parents engaged in a long custody battle over the children, and their father brought the children to New York, where they lived with their grandparents. There, the Tenace children had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>a reputation as \u201cbad kids.\u201d They stole items from neighbors, shoplifted, and generally got into trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 76} Tony described his mother\u2019s second husband, David Sena, as a \u201cpervert\u201d who abused both his wife and stepdaughter. After Bonnie left Sena, she was involved with different boyfriends who were also physically abusive to her. One boyfriend was a \u201cprofessional forger\u201d who, during the late 1970s, taught the Tenace children how to work credit card and counterfeit-money scams.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 77} Tony recalled that when all three of the children were under eight years of age, they would steal from storage areas in apartment buildings. He also recalled that Bonnie had brought the Tenace children on a burglary when Tenace was around 11 years old. Tony stated that over the years, Bonnie was involved in \u201cat least half a dozen\u201d lawsuit scams in which she would stage accidents to collect money. Tony noted that their father was also involved in scams, primarily in his construction business \u2014 overcharging customers, scheming, and defrauding people.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 78} Tony also chronicled how he, Tenace, and Tammy would sniff glue, drink alcohol, and take drugs while growing up. Tenace tended to take downers and went on to become a regular crack abuser. Tony recalled that Tenace, as a youngster, would take drugs to try to impress him. Bonnie was addicted to prescription drugs while they were growing up. All three Tenace children became drug addicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 79} Tenace\u2019s mother, Bonnie Fay Souza-Wilcox, also testified on Tenace\u2019s behalf. Bonnie described her own childhood as involving \u201ca lot of incest * * * a lot of child abuse\u201d perpetrated by her uncles, grandfathers, and stepfathers. She married Tenace\u2019s father, Leonard Tenace, when she was 18 years old and had three children with him, all born within approximately three years. Tenace was the middle child. Bonnie asserted that Leonard never accepted Tenace as his son because he thought Tenace\u2019s father was someone else. When Bonnie was pregnant with Tammy, her youngest, she caught Leonard cheating on her with both her brother\u2019s wife and her baby-sitter\u2019s mother. The couple divorced soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 80} Bonnie received custody of the children. While she was undergoing a hysterectomy for cancer, however, Leonard took the children with him to New York to live. Several years passed before she finally regained custody of the children and moved them back to California. During that time, she remarried, thinking that remarriage would help her regain custody of the children. However, her new husband, David Sena, was a physically abusive alcoholic who she later learned was sexually abusing her children. After several years of abuse, Bonnie took the children back to New York because Leonard Tenace told her he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>help. But that promise turned out to be hollow; Leonard did not support his children. He spent most of his money on drinking and gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 81} After a couple of bad car accidents, Bonnie became addicted to prescription drugs. She admitted that because she worked a lot of hours, she did not properly supervise her children. In succeeding years, Bonnie moved to Florida, then to Boston. She was addicted to drugs, was arrested for prostitution, and attempted suicide several times. At one point, she was in a mental-health hospital for six weeks. While in another relationship, she went to jail for a year for committing forgery. \u201c[W]e were all locked up\u201d in 1978, she recounted, referring to herself, Tony, and Tenace.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 82} According to Bonnie, over the years, she and her boyfriends would smoke pot with the children, and she noted that all of her children ended up addicted to cocaine. All three children were in prison at the time of the mitigation hearing because of their drug problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 83} Bonnie stated that Tenace married his girlfriend while he was serving time in the Schenectady, New York jail during the late 1980s. The marriage produced a son named Troy Jr., but the couple separated around 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 84} Bonnie admitted that she started stealing with her children just before she moved to Florida around the time they were teenagers. She helped them burglarize stores and homes, removing money from cash registers and stealing items like motorcycles from people\u2019s homes. Bonnie lamented that Tenace \u201cdidn\u2019t have one year of his life that was stable or happy or secure with a mother and father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 85} Tenace\u2019s main mitigation witness was Dr. Janice Ort, a clinical psychologist who had evaluated Tenace. Dr. Ort met with Tenace on three different occasions, spending approximately ten hours interviewing and evaluating him. She also reviewed records pertaining to Tenace, as well as statements of family members and others associated with Tenace\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">{\u00b6 86} Dr. Ort chronicled Tenace\u2019s life and that of his family. Tenace was born May 21, 1962, the second of three children. His parents divorced in 1964. The children were kidnapped by each parent at one point, and the parents fought over custody for a number of years as they shuttled the children back and forth across the country. Both parents remarried. Bonnie\u2019s second husband, David Sena, was consistently described by family members as \u201ca monster, as a child molester, and as a rapist.\u201d Bonnie and the children endured physical and sexual abuse by Sena. Dr. Ort noted that Bonnie spent five years with Sena during the children\u2019s formative years. Tenace told Dr. Ort that his earliest childhood memory was that of his mother\u2019s face coming through a motel window. Tenace also told Dr. Ort that during this time, he \u201cwas scared all the time\u201d and that he had memories of only violence and fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>{\u00b6 87} Tenace\u2019s sister, Tammy, told Dr. Ort that Bonnie would sell Tenace as a child to adult males for sexual purposes and would leave him with gay male friends to baby-sit, knowing that Tenace would be sexually abused. Tenace denied this happened, but did recount vividly how painful it was for him to watch his mother and sister being abused without being able to do anything for them. Dr. Ort noted that for a child that age, it is often more traumatic to observe that kind of abuse of someone one loves and cares about than it is to experience it oneself.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 88} Dr. Ort stated that the Tenace children became involved in illegal activities \u2014 i.e., fire-setting, burglaries, and drug use \u2014 before any of them were even ten years old. Tammy recalled that she and her brothers started burglarizing places when Tenace was seven years old. Tony recalled setting fires at about age seven or eight. During this time, Bonnie was not around very much \u2014 she ran around a lot and was wild. When Bonnie was around, she not only took the children to places to burglarize, she encouraged them to steal from others. Bonnie would tell her children that if they saw something they liked, they should go ahead and take it because she could not afford to buy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 89} As an adolescent, Tenace was arrested, placed on probation, and placed in a therapeutic after-school program. A report evaluating Tenace at that time remarked that Tenace\u2019s family life was chaotic. Tenace was eventually discharged from the after-school program because of his uncooperative behavior. Tony told Dr. Ort that during their adolescence, both he and Tenace were heavily into drugs and shoplifting. The family home was raided several times to recover property that both the parents and children had stolen. At one point, an order of protection was filed in family court against the father, Leonard. He was ordered to refrain from any violence or offensive conduct against Bonnie and the children, and he was ordered to not remove the children from the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 90} In December 1977, when Tenace was around 15, his problems were described as resulting from a \u201cdisorganized, disruptive and unstable natural family, inadequate supervision at home, past history of delinquent behavior.\u201d During the next several years, Tenace was arrested in both New York and California. A report written during this time indicated that Tenace\u2019s family was very protective and that the mother tended to move frequently to help Tenace avoid being prosecuted for his crimes. At age 17, Tenace was charged with a number of offenses and was in and out of prison on parole violations over the next eight years. Tenace\u2019s mother attempted suicide again, and she was diagnosed with manic depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 91} In 1986 or 1987, Tenace met his wife, Cheryl, and they married in 1988, while he was in jail. Cheryl told Dr. Ort that Tenace had had a nervous breakdown once and had lain naked in an empty tub for more than a day. Cheryl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>stated that Tenace was a devoted father after the birth of their child. However, in May 1989, Tenace began using drugs again, and Cheryl kicked him out of their home. Over the next several years, Tenace was in various treatment programs for substance abuse and in jail, at times, for parole violations until he arrived in Toledo in December 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 92} Dr. Ort reported that as a result of the number of moves that Tenace and his siblings made as children, they attended a number of different schools. Tenace successfully completed only the seventh grade. He repeated eighth grade and then dropped out of school. While in prison, Tenace attended classes at a community college and a junior college and received As and Bs.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 93} Dr. Ort administered several tests to Tenace, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (\u201cWAIS-R\u201d), the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (\u201cMMPI-2\u201d), and the Rorschach Inkblot Test. On the intelligence scale, Tenace\u2019s scores fall in the average range of intellectual function. The MMPI-2 test results were invalid. But the Rorschach test led Dr. Ort to make several diagnoses of Tenace\u2019s mental condition. First, Dr. Ort diagnosed Tenace as suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Tenace experienced personal threats against his own safety, in particular from his stepfather, David Sena. He witnessed sexual and physical abuse to his mother and sister. There were also indications from records compiled by others who evaluated Tenace that he experienced sexual abuse as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 94} Second, Dr. Ort diagnosed Tenace as suffering from a dysthymic disorder \u2014 a type of depressive disorder. Third, Tenace has a substance dependence disorder, in particular with cocaine, but also involving alcohol and marijuana abuse. Such abuse interfered with his relationship with his wife and son, as well as his ability to perform the house-repair scams he was engaged in. Dr. Ort noted a high correlation in the professional literature between cocaine use and aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 95} Tenace also has an antisocial personality disorder. According to Dr. Ort, the essential feature of his antisocial personality disorder is a history, dating back to when Tenace was 15 years old, of continuous and chronic antisocial behavior in which the rights of others are violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 96} Dr. Ort stated that her diagnoses were based on records, testing, and her interviews. In evaluating Tenace, she noted that her diagnoses were less influenced by the testing she performed than the information from family and friends, the clinical interviews with him, and her review of his records. In her report, Dr. Ort characterized Tenace\u2019s childhood as \u201ca tutorial for criminal behavior, and [full] of neglect and abuse.\u201d She also concluded that Tenace \u201cis not the one bad apple in the barrel. All his siblings are incarcerated and have lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>histories of legal involvement and substance abuse.\u201d She asserted that Tenace\u2019s parents \u201cwere criminals, abusive, neglectful, and substance abusers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 97} Undoubtedly, the felony-murder aggravating factor under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), the senseless and tragic murder of Edward Kozlowski during an aggravated robbery, was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In weighing the evidence, we must \u201cconsider, and weigh against the aggravating circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character, and background of the offender,\u201d and the statutory mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 98} The nature and circumstances of the offense offer nothing in mitigation. Tenace performed some work on Kozlowski\u2019s chimney and then later concocted a ruse in order to steal money from him to support his crack addiction. Tenace, 31 years old at the time of the offense, likely had little problem overcoming the 76-year-old Kozlowski, who was reputed to have paid his debts in cash. Kozlowski\u2019s robbery and murder were unprovoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 99} R.C. 2929.04(B)(1), victim inducement, is not implicated. Likewise, there is no evidence that Kozlowski provoked Tenace, thereby invoking R.C. 2929.04(B)(2). Dr. Janice Ort testified that Tenace does not suffer from any mental disease or defect, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) is inapplicable because Tenace was 31 years old at the time of the homicide. He had prior criminal convictions, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), and was the principal offender in the murder, R.C. 2929.04(B)(6). R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) directs us to consider \u201c[a]ny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 100} The words used by the dissent in speaking of the appellant in <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 587, 605 N.E.2d 884 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting), conceivably describe Tenace here: \u201cdestined for disaster * * * as a direct result of the conditions to which he was exposed by his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 101} Tenace was doomed from the start. Both appellant\u2019s mother and father were abusive, neglectful, and pernicious influences on their three children, who were schooled in crime from an early age. A second marriage facilitated sexual abuse of Tenace\u2019s sister by the children\u2019s stepfather. Appellant\u2019s mother was addicted to drugs, arrested for prostitution, and jailed for forgery. She attempted suicide several times and spent six weeks in a mental hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 102} There was evidence that Tenace was made to watch the sexual abuse of his sister and that he was sexually abused himself \u2014 at one point being sold by his mother for sexual services. Both his grandfather and father were alcoholics, and his father, assuming Tenace was not his son, physically abused him. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>kidnapped by each parent during a drawn-out custody fight. While still a child, he began abusing substances with his mother and her boyfriends, eventually graduating to cocaine. He was encouraged to cheat and steal. Tenace\u2019s brother and sister became addicts as well and were in prison at the time of his mitigation hearing because of their drug problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 103} Dr. Ort concluded that Tenace\u2019s parents were criminals, were abusive, and were neglectful substance abusers. His childhood was a \u201ctutorial\u201d for criminal behavior, and, in fact, he has an antisocial personality disorder. Although he completed only seventh grade, Tenace received As and Bs while attending community college and junior college in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 104} Tenace also expressed remorse and sorrow during his confession to police, <em>State v. Rojas </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 131, 143, 592 N.E.2d 1376, and cooperated with police after his arrest. <em>State v. Dunlap </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 308, 319, 652 N.E.2d 988. The love and support of the family members who testified on Tenace\u2019s behalf also deserve some mitigating weight. See, e.g., <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 34, 716 N.E.2d 1126. Finally, if Tenace is given maximum and consecutive sentences to the sentence of 25 years to life he received for crimes committed in New York, he would be at least 96 years old before his first eligibility for parole in Ohio. See <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 149, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 105} A single one of these facts, standing alone, would not establish that appellant\u2019s history, character, and background were so impaired as to outweigh the aggravated robbery and murder of his elderly victim. However, the foregoing evidence, viewed cumulatively, establishes the presence of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) \u201cother factors\u201d that strongly militate against imposing the death sentence. While nothing condones Tenace\u2019s gratuitous killing of an elderly man, the evidence presented in mitigation on Tenace\u2019s behalf is entitled to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 106} Based upon an independent review of the evidence, we conclude that the aggravating factor does not outweigh the mitigating factors in evidence to support a sentence of death. R.C. 2929.05(A). Accordingly, we affirm the conviction but vacate the sentence of death and remand the cause to the trial court for resentencing consistent with R.C. 2929.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b435-11\">Resnick, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-14\">. On April 14, 2005, Tenace filed a motion pro se entitled \u201cWaiver of All Further Appeals\u201d in which he requested that review of all pending appeals, both state and federal, cease. He indicated no dissatisfaction with current counsel. Because we have decided this appeal on its merits, his motion is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Avf\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 107} I join the majority\u2019s opinion but write to add that we struggle constantly with the issue of when a defendant\u2019s childhood is so horrific that it militates against the death penalty. In reading this record, one cannot imagine a more terrible, depraved, and damaging childhood than that which the defendant suffered. He was victimized constantly as a child. The only skills taught him by the adults in his life were how to commit crimes and how to abuse drugs. All his siblings are now in prison, none being able to rise above their doomed childhood. If these facts don\u2019t present a case in which mitigation finally outweighs the aggravating circumstance, then I can imagine no fact pattern that would. While it still in no way justifies the brutal murder, his terrible childhood does militate against the death penalty and in favor of a life sentence. Therefore, I respectfully join in the majority\u2019s decision to remand this cause for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b436-6\">O\u2019Connor, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANX\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 108} I concur in the majority opinion in all aspects except in its conclusion that the death sentence should not be imposed upon Tenace. I would hold that the aggravating factor, that Tenace murdered Kozlowski while committing an aggravated robbery, outweighs the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 109} Tenace planned and executed a robbery of Kozlowski and then murdered him by \u201cstomping\u201d on his head and strangling him. He pulled the telephone cord out of the wall so that Kozlowski could not summon assistance, and he left Kozlowski to die on the floor of his own home. Although it is true that Tenace endured a troubled childhood and dysfunctional family life, cooperated with police, and expressed remorse for his actions, the robbery and brutal murder of this 76-year-old man in his home merit the capital penalty to which Tenace was sentenced. I agree that the tragedies suffered by Tenace as a child are lamentable, but they are simply not enough to overcome the fact that Tenace committed a horrific murder to cover up his own robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 110} This court has \u201cseldom accorded strong [mitigating] weight to a defendant\u2019s childhood,\u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 547, 747 N.E.2d 765, and previously has upheld the death penalty in cases involving commission of aggravated murder during an aggravated robbery by a defendant with a chaotic and dysfunctional childhood. See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 424, 429, 692 N.E.2d 151; <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 274, 699 N.E.2d 482; <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 400-401, 721 N.E.2d 52; <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 547, 747 N.E.2d 765. In each of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>cases, the defendant suffered physical abuse and/or neglect by a parent or parents who were involved in a life of crime. In <em>Raglin, </em>the defendant even accompanied his mother on drug deals in order to protect her, and his mother later illicitly removed him from a detention facility. These cases involved defendants with mitigating factors similar to Tenace\u2019s. Yet in each case, this court affirmed the death penalty in spite of the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 111} Since the institution of independent review of death-penalty cases under R.C. 2929.05, this court has vacated the death sentence based on that review in only two instances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Claytor </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 234, 574 N.E.2d 472, the defendant, who lacked any criminal record, had killed two security guards who had approached him for identification. The court determined that the murders had been a product of Claytor\u2019s mental disease\u2014 paranoid schizophrenia \u2014 and that Claytor' substantially lacked the ability to refrain from committing the crimes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 112} In <em>State v. Lawrence </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 541 N.E.2d 451, the defendant was a Vietnam veteran without a significant criminal history who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. A loving father and son who had even cared for his sick mother during his high school years, he had spiraled into severe depression after the death of his infant son due to sudden-infant-death syndrome. After requesting that his neighbor tone down a loud, late-night party, Lawrence responded to taunts by the neighbor and his guests by firing a shot that wounded the neighbor and the neighbor\u2019s guest. The neighbor subsequently returned fire upon Lawrence. In response, Lawrence shot his two neighbors to death and wounded two additional guests. Although a jury recommended imposition of the death penalty, this court considered the aggravating and mitigating factors and held that the provocation by the neighbor, coupled with Lawrence\u2019s past good deeds, outweighed the aggravating factor of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 113} The facts in <em>Claytor </em>and <em>Lawrence </em>are entirely different from those in this particular case. Undisputed testimony established that Claytor, a generally law-abiding individual, could not prevent himself from acting, because of his mental illness. Lawrence also had led a law-abiding life, caring for those around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>him, volunteering his time, and risking his life to serve his country. He had acted based upon his severe depression and the provocation of his neighbor. Tenace, on the other hand, was raised in a dysfunctional family, but had no relevant mental defects and purposefully chose to engage in a life of crime.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AE8\">Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and Craig T. Pearson, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-U\">Gamso, Helmick &amp; Hoolahan, Jeffrey M. Gamso, and Gary W. Crim, for appellant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 114} Although the majority asserts that the lives of Tenace\u2019s siblings show that Tenace never had a chance to lead a law-abiding life, that allegation is misleading. There is a fundamental difference between leading a \u201clife of crime\u201d and committing a brutal murder. Tammy Bruno, Tenace\u2019s sister, who suffered the same upbringing as Tenace but further endured extensive sexual abuse, has been convicted only of nonviolent crimes. Tenace\u2019s brother may have a reputation for violence in prison and an extensive criminal history, including arson, armed robbery, burglary, assault on a peace officer, and grand larceny, but he has never committed a murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 115} Tenace remains the only family member with a conviction for murder. He chose an extreme path that his siblings have resisted. As I believe that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factor, I would affirm the death penalty in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-7\">Resnick and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\">. Although a third case purports to do so, that case actually turned on \u201cresidual doubt\u201d because mitigating evidence was not presented at the death-penalty hearing. <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 572 N.E.2d 97, overruled on this ground by <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\">. As the only appellate court to reverse a death penalty based upon the independent review mandated by R.C. 2929.05, the Fifth District Court of Appeals similarly overturned the death penalty of a man who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and could not substantially appreciate the criminality of his behavior.
