We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Johnnie Edwards filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in 2001. The Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation reviewed the claim and determined that Edwards was entitled to benefits for workplace injuries to his right knee and leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 3} In 2003, Edwards\u2019s treating physician recommended that Edwards undergo a magnetic-resonance-imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) procedure on his right knee so that the doctor could identify and treat his injuries more effectively. The doctor sought and received the bureau\u2019s authorization for the MRI in April 2003. Edwards\u2019s employer, Avalon Precision Casting Company, then challenged the bureau\u2019s authorization of the MRI, exhausting all administrative appeals at the bureau and at the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">{\u00b6 4} When those appeals did not succeed, Avalon filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in May 2004 in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the bureau and the commission had improperly authorized the MRI as a proper course of treatment for Edwards\u2019s workplace injuries. In a separate filing in June 2004, Avalon \u2014 citing alleged fraud on the part of Edwards \u2014 also asked the commission to vacate the bureau\u2019s underlying determination made in 2001 awarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Edwards for those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">{\u00b6 5} The commission filed a motion for summary judgment in the mandamus case, and in May 2005, the court of appeals granted summary judgment in the commission\u2019s favor. The court of appeals ruled that Avalon\u2019s legal challenge to the commission\u2019s authorization of the MRI was not ripe for review while Avalon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>motion to vacate the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim was pending before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 6} Avalon has now filed an appeal as of right. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 7} Avalon argues first that the commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the court of appeals was untimely and should not have been accepted by that court. The court of appeals, however, expressly granted leave to the commission to file the motion within a few days after it was tendered to the court. Absent an abuse of discretion, a lower court\u2019s decision to accept such a motion \u2014 even if the motion is untimely \u2014 will not be reversed on appeal. In this case, Avalon was given ample opportunity to respond \u2014 and did respond \u2014 to the commission\u2019s summary judgment motion, and we hold that the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the commission to file that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 8} In granting the commission\u2019s summary judgment motion, the court of appeals concluded that Avalon\u2019s mandamus complaint was premature as long as Avalon\u2019s challenge to the underlying allowance of Edwards\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was pending before the 'bureau. We need not reach that ripeness issue, for appellant Avalon urges us to address the merits of its mandamus complaint, and we find ample grounds to support the dismissal of that complaint on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe appropriate standard guiding our review is whether there is \u2018some evidence\u2019 in the record to support the commission\u2019s decision. * * * If so, then the commission will not be deemed to have abused its discretion, and the granting of a writ of mandamus to correct an abuse of discretion is not warranted.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Secreto v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 581, 582-583, 687 N.E.2d 715. This court\u2019s role is not to \u201cmicromanage the commission as it carries out the business of compensating for industrial/occupational injuries and illness.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mobley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 579, 584, 679 N.E.2d 300. \u201cWhere a commission order is adequately explained and based on some evidence, even evidence that may be persuasively contradicted by other evidence of record, the order will not be disturbed as manifesting an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 10} In this case, Edwards\u2019s treating physician recommended that he undergo an MRI on his right knee, When Avalon challenged that recommendation, a second physician reviewed Edwards\u2019s treatment plan and agreed that an MRI was a reasonable and necessary procedure that would assist his doctor in treating the injured knee. The bureau then relied on that second doctor\u2019s conclusion when it rejected Avalon\u2019s administrative challenges to the MRI authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 11} Because at least some evidence in the record supported the decision of the bureau on the MRI issue, we cannot say that the commission abused its discretion when it declined to overturn the bureau\u2019s authorization of that proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>dure. Avalon was therefore not entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling the commission to reach a different outcome, and the court of appeals properly-granted judgment in the commission\u2019s favor on the mandamus complaint.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Al5\">Willacy, LoPresti &amp; Marcovy and Aubrey B.
