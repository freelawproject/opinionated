On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Fortson </em>(Aug. 2, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78240, 2001 WL 898428.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">{\u00b6 3} In October 2003, Fortson filed a petition in the Lorain County Court of Appeals for a writ of habeas corpus to compel his immediate release from prison. In response to a dismissal motion, Fortson claimed that his trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him on the aggravated-murder charge because the state had dismissed that charge. The court of appeals dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On appeal, we affirmed the dismissal of the petition. <em>State ex rel. Fortson v. Kelly, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 77, 2004-Ohio-1799, 806 N.E.2d 556. In so holding, we noted that the entry attached to Fortson\u2019s petition established that the aggravated-murder charge had not been dismissed. Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 5} Fortson filed three additional habeas corpus petitions, which were dismissed in April 2004 and August 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 6} In May 2005, the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County affirmed the denial of Fortson\u2019s motion to correct the record and vacate his conviction. <em>State v. Fortson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85096, 2005-Ohio-2463, 2005 WL 1190726. The court of appeals expressly rejected Fortson\u2019s argument that the state had dismissed his aggravated-murder charge:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[I]n regard to the validity of the conviction in this case, it is clear upon review of the record before us that the aggravated murder count was not dismissed * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cNot only did the assistant prosecuting attorney\u2019s statements on the record make it clear what charge was being dismissed, the trial court\u2019s journal entry relative to the charge the State sought to dismiss, and which was accepted by the court for dismissal, clearly reflected that the conspiracy to commit aggravated murder charge was being dismissed. Furthermore, * * * the case proceeded to trial, without objection, on the aggravated murder and complicity to aggravated murder charges.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 9} In September 2005, Fortson filed yet another petition for a writ of habeas corpus, this time in the Court of Appeals for Richland County. Fortson sought the writ to compel appellee, Mansfield Correctional Institution Warden Margaret Bradshaw, to release him from prison. Fortson again claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him upon the aggravated-murder charge because the state had dismissed that charge. Fortson\u2019s petition included an affidavit in which he erroneously claimed that he had \u201cnot filed a civil action or appeal of a civil action against any government entity or employee in the previous five years.\u201d After Warden Bradshaw moved to dismiss Fortson\u2019s petition, Fortson filed an affidavit describing his prior civil actions. On November 8, 2005, the court of appeals granted the warden\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before the court upon Fortson\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">{\u00b6 11} The court of appeals properly dismissed Fortson\u2019s petition because res judicata barred Fortson from filing a successive habeas corpus petition. <em>State ex rel. Rash v. Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 145, 2004-Ohio-2053, 807 N.E.2d 344, \u00b6 10-11. Since Fortson previously raised the issue of the alleged dismissal of his aggravated-murder charge, he may not use habeas corpus to gain successive appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>reviews of the same issue. <em>Agee v. Russell </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 540, 548, 751 N.E.2d 1043.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A22\">Andrew Fortson, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5d\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Gregory T. Hartke, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 12} Moreover, Fortson failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25(A), which required that he file an affidavit describing each civil action or appeal from a civil action that he had filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court. His belated attempt to file the required affidavit does not excuse his noncompliance. <em>Fuqua v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 211, 2003-Ohio-5533, 797 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b414-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
