The court of appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial. <em>State v. Tenace </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 702, 700 N.E.2d 899. On remand, a jury again convicted Tenace of th\u00e9 aggravated murder of Edward Kozlowski, and Tenace was sentenced to death. The court of appeals then affirmed his conviction and death sentence. <em>State v. Tenace, </em>Lucas App. No. L-00-1002, 2003-Ohio-3458, 2003 WL 21500249. On May 31, 2006, we also affirmed his conviction, but we vacated the death penalty and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>State v. Tenace, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant timely filed the instant application for reopening his appeal with the court of'appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Mumahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, paragraph three of the syllabus, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">{\u00b6 4} In denying appellant\u2019s application for reopening, the court of appeals held that \u201cappellant has failed to present a genuine issue of a colorable claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ineffective assistance of appellate counsel that would mandate reopening appellant\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Tenace </em>(Nov. 20, 2003), Lucas App. No. L-00-1002. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Tenace has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen his appeal in the court of appeals under App.R. 26(B)(5). See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696. To show ineffective assistance, Tenace must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues that he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had they presented those claims on appeal. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Tenace \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 7} <em>Strickland </em>charges us to \u201cappl[y] a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Moreover, we must bear in mind that appellate counsel need not raise every possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987; <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151-152, 761 N.E.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 8} We have reviewed appellant\u2019s two propositions of law alleging, inter alia, deficient performance by appellate counsel. In neither of his two propositions of law has Tenace raised \u201ca <em>genuine issue </em>as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required by App.R. 26(B)(5). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 9} In proposition of law I, Tenace argues that counsel were deficient in failing to raise issues concerning evidence of appellant\u2019s cocaine addiction and in failing to present expert-opinion testimony during his trial on the effects of drug abuse on his behavior. Yet the court of appeals correctly concluded that counsel\u2019s decision not to raise the additional arguments, as raised here by Tenace, helped to focus attention on stronger arguments undiluted by weaker ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals also properly rejected proposition II. We have uniformly held that criminal defendants have no right to hybrid representation</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AD9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and Craig T. Pearson, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A24\">David H. Bodiker, Ohio Public Defender, and Ruth L. Tkacz, Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">when they are already represented by counsel. See, e.g., <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b615-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
