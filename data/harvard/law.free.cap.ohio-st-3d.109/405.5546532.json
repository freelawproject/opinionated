Respondent met with Wilson, performed legal research for her, and prepared a motion on Wilson\u2019s behalf. In July 2003, Wilson discharged respondent and demanded a refund of the retainer. In November 2003, Wilson filed a complaint against respondent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>small-claims court. Respondent did not appear at the hearing, and a $1,550 judgment was awarded to Wilson.

Respondent obtained a divorce decree for Pratt, but failed to file the necessary paperwork to ensure the transfer of Pratt\u2019s share of the funds in her ex-husband\u2019s deferred-compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">{\u00b6 20} The board found that respondent had thereby violated DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">\n<em>Count X</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">{\u00b621} The board dismissed the allegations in Count X of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">\n<em>Count XI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent prepared and filed a bankruptcy petition on behalf of Guther Barnes. Respondent was in the hospital at the time of the bankruptcy hearing and therefore did not attend. The bankruptcy trustee filed a one-page form to finalize the bankruptcy and filed a motion calling for respondent to refund $150 to Barnes. The bankruptcy court ordered respondent to pay a sanction of $10 per day until the $150 was paid to Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">{\u00b6 23} The board found that respondent had thereby violated DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\n<em>Count XII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 24} In January 2002, Jennifer Guilford-Howard and Ernest Howard hired respondent to represent them after they sustained injuries in a car accident. In December 2003, their claims were settled, and the insurance company sent an $11,000 settlement check to respondent. Respondent then wrote separate checks to each of her clients in January 2004 for their share of the settlement proceeds. Those checks were returned for insufficient funds. From the settlement proceeds, respondent was also supposed to pay the Howards\u2019 medical provider, but she failed to do so, prompting that provider to sue the Howards for the cost of their medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 25} The board found that respondent had thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation), 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting an attorney from intentionally failing to carry out a contract of professional employment), 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting an attorney from intentionally prejudicing or damaging a client), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver funds to which a client is entitled).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\n<em>Count XIII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 26} In November 2003, Andel Marsaw Andrews paid respondent a $350 retainer to represent her in a child-support matter. Respondent never filed a motion to increase child support on Andrews\u2019s behalf as she had promised, and respondent never returned any of the retainer that Andrews had paid her.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 27} The board found that respondent had thereby violated DR 6-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">{\u00b6 28} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The board found several aggravating factors: a dishonest and selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, harm to vulnerable victims, and the failure to make restitution. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), (h), and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">{\u00b6 29} The board also noted two mitigating factors: respondent\u2019s lack of any prior disciplinary record and her cooperative attitude during the disciplinary process. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d). Respondent also suffers from neurotic depression and a chemical dependency to alcohol, according to testimony presented to the board by a qualified health-care professional. The parties and the board agreed that these problems played a role in causing respondent\u2019s misconduct. Respondent has not successfully completed any treatment programs for her mental-health and alcohol problems, however, and the panel expressed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>doubts about her ability to return to the competent and ethical practice of law while those problems remain unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b6 30} The parties recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio and that she satisfy several conditions before seeking reinstatement. The board adopted that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 31} We agree that respondent violated all of the Disciplinary Rules cited in the board\u2019s report, and we agree with the parties\u2019 and the board\u2019s recommended sanction. Respondent\u2019s repeated neglect of multiple clients calls into serious doubt her ability to practice law in a professional and competent manner, and a licensed psychologist who evaluated respondent concluded that she is not currently mentally competent to practice law. That same psychologist testified that respondent may, with effective treatment, be able to function appropriately in the profession in the future, but she is not able to do so now. In his opinion, any treatment for her diagnosed mental illness must include psychotropic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 32} Respondent\u2019s addiction to alcohol must be addressed as well. She signed a contract with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d) in 2003 promising to refrain from the use of alcohol, and she received both in-patient and out-patient treatment for her chemical dependency in 2004. Even so, she continued to drink after signing the OLAP contract, she was charged with a drunk-driving offense in May 2004 after her discharge from the in-patient treatment program, and she acknowledged at her disciplinary hearing in August 2005 that she continues to drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 33} We have imposed an indefinite suspension in similar cases. See, e.g., <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. McClain, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 248, 2003-Ohio-3394, 791 N.E.2d 411, \u00b6 12 (\u201cAn indefinite suspension may be an appropriate sanction for repeated neglect caused, at least in part, by mental or emotional illness\u201d); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Golden, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 230, 2002-Ohio-5934, 778 N.E.2d 564, \u00b6 23, 24 (\u201cwhen misconduct permeates a practice in the way it has in this case, disbarment is often the only sanction available for preserving the public confidence in the judicial system,\u201d but \u201cwhen an attorney\u2019s misconduct results directly from clinical depression as it does here, we have tempered our disposition to see whether the attorney is able, with the help of appropriate medical care, to merit the public\u2019s confidence again\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 34} Accordingly, respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Before seeking reinstatement, respondent must (1) pay full restitution to her former clients and the bankruptcy court as she agreed to do in paragraph 48 of the stipulations filed by the parties with the board on August 8, 2005, (2) comply with the OLAP contract that she signed in November 2003 and comply with any other conditions set by OLAP, (3) obtain a report from her psychiatrist stating that she has been treated for her mental illness and is able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>return to the competent and ethical practice of law, and (4) obtain a similar report from an expert of relator\u2019s choosing. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAU\">Fred C. Crosby, David M. Paris, and Ellen S. Mandell, Bar Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aly\">Mary L.
