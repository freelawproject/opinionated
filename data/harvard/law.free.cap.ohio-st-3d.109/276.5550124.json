We reverse, reinstate the trial court\u2019s order for the establishment of a constructive trust, and modify the order to place the constructive trust over the assets in their present form as cash deposits held by the Lorain County Clerk of Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 2} Grace and Garnard Cowling married in 1967. It was a second marriage for both of them, and each of them had children from a previous marriage. Sandra Reddington and appellees Gary Cowling and Richard Cowling are Garnard\u2019s children from his previous marriage. Appellee Deanna Cowling is Gary\u2019s wife; appellee Dianne Cowling is Richard\u2019s wife. The appellees will be referred to collectively as the Cowlings. Grace and Garnard had no children together.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 3} Grace and Garnard owned various brokerage accounts and stock investments jointly with rights of survivorship. On July 16, 1996, Grace signed irrevocable documents that transferred stocks to Garnard. This transaction gave Garnard exclusive possession and control over these stocks, which previously had been owned and controlled by both Grace and Garnard. Garnard placed the stocks in an account that he designated in December 1996 as a transfer-on-death (\u201cTOD\u201d) account, with his children named as the beneficiaries. Garnard gave some of these stocks to Gary, Richard, and Sandra between December 1996 and February 1997. Garnard transferred additional assets from joint brokerage accounts into his own name sometime in 1996 or 1997. He then placed those assets in the TOD accounts. The assets in the TOD accounts passed to Gary, Richard, and Sandra upon Garnard\u2019s death on February 8, 1998. The total amount received by Garnard\u2019s children as a result of the gifts of stock ($142,-363.00) and the proceeds of the TOD accounts ($182,995.69) was $325,358.69.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 4} Grace filed an equitable claim against the Cowlings for a declaratory judgment to establish a constructive trust over the assets transferred by Garnard to the Cowlings. Grace\u2019s complaint also made claims against Garnard\u2019s estate for breach of contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The record contains much evidence of Grace\u2019s and Garnard\u2019s respective contributions to their joint assets, including the testimony of Grace\u2019s expert witness Mark Bober, a certified public accountant, testimony of various nonexpert witnesses, and a variety of income tax returns, stock certificates, and gift and estate tax returns. Bober estimated that 74 percent of the assets were attributable to contributions made by Grace. Although Bober\u2019s analysis did not directly track Grace\u2019s personal assets into the joint accounts with rights of survivorship, it was based upon increases in investment income after Grace and Garnard sold stocks and their residence. He also considered the proportion of the stocks and the residence that had been owned by Grace. The Cowlings attempted to refute Grace\u2019s proof of her contributions and offered tax returns and stock certificates as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 6} The court instructed the jury (1) to determine wh\u00e9ther Garnard had withdrawn funds from the joint and survivorship accounts in excess of the contributions attributable to him and (2) to assess damages in the amount of assets that had been wrongfully transferred by Garnard. The court also instructed the jury to award only damages that were proven by Grace by a preponderance of the evidence. The jury found that Garnard had withdrawn funds from the accounts in excess of the contributions attributable to him and that the damages suffered by Grace were $255,354. The court rendered a default judgment in that amount against Garnard\u2019s estate, which had not answered or participated in the trial. Garnard\u2019s estate did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 7} In its judgment, the trial court also declared a constructive trust in the total amount of $255,354, imposed on each of the Cowlings in proportion to the amount that each had individually received from Garnard. The trial court did not designate the specific property or assets over which the constructive trust was to be imposed. The Cowlings moved for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 8} On January 27, 2003, after trial but before the decision of the court of appeals, the parties stipulated that the assets had been retained by the Cowlings during the trial. After the trial, the assets were sold to post cash deposits for the appeal. These cash deposits are being held by the Lorain County Clerk of Courts. Sandra Reddington satisfied the portion of the judgment against her and was not a party to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 9} While the appeal was pending, Grace Cowling died, on July 8, 2002. Appellant estate of Grace Cowling was substituted as plaintiff by the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 29(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the Cowlings\u2019 motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict regarding the claim for the establishment of a constructive trust. The court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>thereby reversed the trial court\u2019s equitable order for the imposition of a constructive trust. Grace\u2019s estate appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 11} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe existence of a joint and survivorship bank account raises a rebuttable presumption that co-owners of the account share equally in the ownership of the funds on deposit.\u201d <em>Vetter v. Hampton </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 227, 8 O.O.3d 198, 375 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. This presumption applies in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Id. at paragraph four of the syllabus; see <em>Wright v. Bloom </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 596, 602-603, 635 N.E.2d 31. \u201cA joint and survivorship account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Thompson </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 433, 20 O.O.3d 371, 423 N.E.2d 90, paragraph one of the syllabus; see Uniform Probate Code 6-103. We expressly stated that <em>Thompson </em>did not \u201csignificantly alter our earlier case law\u201d but merely amended our analytic framework to better effectuate \u201cthe intent of the parties to create joint and survivorship accounts.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 439, 20 O.O.3d 371, 423 N.E.2d 90. This language indicates that, although we adopted a new presumption for determining ownership of joint and survivorship accounts, the presumption of equal ownership continues to exist when net contributions are not proven. See Uniform Probate Code 6-103, Official Comment (courts should \u201cdivide the account equally among the parties to the extent that net contributions cannot be proven\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cNet contributions\u201d is not defined in the Revised Code and has not been defined by this court. The Uniform Probate Code defines \u201cnet contributions\u201d of a party as \u201cthe sum of all deposits to an account made by or for the party, less all payments from the account made to or for the party which have not been paid to or applied to the use of another party and a proportionate share of any charges deducted from the account, plus a proportionate share of any interest or dividends earned.\u201d Uniform Probate Code 6-211. As we concluded in <em>Thompson </em>concerning another section of the Uniform Probate Code, we conclude that this definition from the Uniform Probate Code (the \u201cnet contributions presumption\u201d) \u201caccurately reflects] the common experiences of mankind in regard to joint and survivorship accounts,\u201d and we adopt this definition as the law of Ohio. See <em>Thompson, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 439, 20 O.O.3d 371, 423 N.E.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 14} We also conclude that the determination of net contributions is a factual determination for the trier of fact. Parties may produce evidence of their own net contributions, the net contributions of another account holder, or the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>contributions of all account holders. Evidence of net contributions presented by one party will often necessarily rebut the evidence offered by an opposing party. Ultimately, the finder of fact must determine net contributions based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 15} Next we must determine the evidentiary burden necessary to prove net contributions to a joint and survivorship account. In <em>Union Properties, Inc. v. Cleveland Trust Co. </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 430, 435, 40 O.O. 425, 89 N.E.2d 638, this court held that a husband\u2019s creditor could not appropriate money from a joint account, of which the husband was a joint account holder, because there was evidence of \u201csufficient probative force [that] the money on deposit was in reality the sole property\u201d of his wife. The evidence consisted of testimony by the husband and wife that the funds on deposit belonged exclusively to the wife. Id. at 432, 40 O.O. 425, 89 N.E.2d 638. Although the court did not discuss the evidentiary burden, we conclude that the court applied a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. See <em>Drosos v. Drosos </em>(Nov. 17, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 54138, 1988 WL 122961, at *5 (burden of proving contributions by a preponderance of the evidence was not met). We hold that evidence of net contributions must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court instructed the jury to determine damages suffered by Grace as a result of Garnard\u2019s withdrawals in excess of the contributions attributable to him. Garnard withdrew assets worth $325,358.69 from the joint accounts and had transferred those assets by gift or TOD accounts to his children as of February 8, 1998, the day of his death. The jury instructions did not specifically state that damages would be equivalent to the net contributions made by Grace. Nevertheless, because Garnard transferred only assets that had been withdrawn from joint accounts, we conclude that the damages award, $255,354, is the equivalent of a determination of Grace\u2019s net contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 17} Neither Garnard\u2019s estate nor the Cowlings appealed the jury\u2019s damages award. Accordingly, whether the jury\u2019s damages award could have been successfully challenged is not before us. The jury\u2019s determination of damages remains unmodified. Garnard\u2019s estate has no assets with which to pay damages. We look next, therefore, to the Cowlings to determine whether the assets transferred to them are held in trust for Grace\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">{\u00b6 18} A constructive trust is a \u201c \u2018trust by operation of law which arises contrary to intention and in invitum, against one who, by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of wrong, or by any form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>who in any way against equity and good conscience, either has obtained or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy. It is raised by equity to satisfy the demands of justice.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Ferguson v. Owens </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 223, 225, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293, quoting 76 American Jurisprudence 2d (1975) 446, Trusts, Section 221. A constructive trust is considered a trust because \u201c \u2018[w]hen property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 225, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293, quoting <em>Beatty v. Guggenheim Exploration Co. </em>(1919), 225 N.Y. 380, 386, 389, 122 N.E. 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">{\u00b6 19} A constructive trust is an equitable remedy that protects against unjust enrichment and is usually invoked when property has been obtained by fraud. <em>Ferguson, </em>9 Ohio St.3d at 226, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293; <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Hussey </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 640, 642, 590 N.E.2d 724. \u201c[A] constructive trust may also be imposed where it is against the principles of equity that the property be retained by a certain person even though the property was acquired without fraud.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>9 Ohio St.3d at 226, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293, citing 53 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d (1962) 578-579, Trusts, Section 88; V Scott on Trusts (3d Ed.1967) 3412, Section 462. \u201cIn applying the theories of constructive trusts, courts also apply the well known equitable maxim, \u2018equity regards [as] done that which ought to be done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>9 Ohio St.3d at 226, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 20} The party seeking to have a constructive trust imposed bears the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland, Inc. v. Lynch, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 118, 2002-Ohio-3748, 772 N.E.2d 105, paragraph three of the syllabus. y</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 21} Although this court has never addressed the issue of tracing, various Ohio courts have held that a constructive trust cannot be imposed absent tracing by the claimant. See <em>Dixon v. Smith </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 308, 320, 695 N.E.2d 284; <em>State ex ref Marietta v. Groves </em>(Aug. 9, 1985), 4th Dist. No. 84 X 7, 1985 WL 8297, at *2 (\u201cOhio follows the majority rule that there must be tracing\u201d); <em>Ohio State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Biltwell Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1924), 23 Ohio App. 409, 412-413, 155 N.E. 163. The parties agree that tracing is a necessary predicate to the imposition of a constructive trust in Ohio. See Ashley S. Hohimer, Constructive Trusts in Bankruptcy: Is an Equitable Interest in Property More Than Just a \u201cClaim\u201d? (2003), 19 Bankr.Dev.J. 499, 510-511 (\u201cTracing is a process where the claimant basically must be able to point to the identifiable property or fund and say, \u2018This is mine.\u2019 If the funds or property are untraceable \u2014 meaning the claimant cannot determine where they were deposited or what the debtor has done with them \u2014 the equitable remedy is not available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>{\u00b6 22} When they have addressed tracing, courts in Ohio have required the claimant to offer sufficient proof of tracing the property through any changes in form or possessor to the possessor of the property over whom the constructive trust should be placed. See <em>Dixon, </em>119 Ohio App.3d at 320, 695 N.E.2d 284; <em>State ex rel. Marietta, </em>4th Dist. No. 84 X 7, 1985 WL 8297; and <em>Biltwell Tire, </em>23 Ohio App. 409, 412-113, 155 N.E. 163. We are in accord with these decisions and hold that before a constructive trust can be imposed, there must be adequate tracing from the time of the wrongful deprivation of the relevant assets to the specific property over which the constructive trust should be placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 23} We have previously held that a party seeking the judicial imposition of a constructive trust \u201cbears the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence justifying it.\u201d <em>Lynch, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 118, 772 N.E.2d 105, paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>Lynch </em>specifically referred to the claimant\u2019s burden of proof and the evidentiary standard for proving the unjust-enrichment aspect of a constructive trust. Id. at 130, 772 N.E.2d 105. We conclude that the same evidentiary burden should apply to tracing and that the burden of proof is on the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 24} A claimant seeking the imposition of a constructive trust must specify the particular property over which the constructive trust is to be placed. If the form or possessor of the property over which the constructive trust should be placed changes during a lawsuit, the claimant should be given an opportunity to conduct discovery, if necessary, and present evidence of the new location or form of the property over which the trust should be placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 25} A constructive trust is an equitable remedy that must be imposed on particular assets, not on a value. For example, if a party is inequitably deprived of 100 shares of stock that are valued at $10,000, a constructive trust should be imposed over 100 shares of stock, not $10,000. The value of the stock may decrease to $9,000 through no fault of the present possessor. In that instance, it would be inequitable to impose a constructive trust for a higher dollar amount than the stock\u2019s new value. Similarly, should the stock rise, the beneficiary of a constructive trust should not be deprived of that increase in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 26} Constructive trusts should be placed over the property of the party who wrongfully obtained the property. When, as in this case, the property was subsequently transferred to third parties, a constructive trust can be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 27} The Cowlings challenged the trial court\u2019s denial of their motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict with respect to Grace\u2019s estate\u2019s claim for a constructive trust. We therefore reiterate the standards we apply when determining whether a motion for directed verdict or a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict has been properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The standard for a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B) is the same as that for a motion for a directed verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50(A). <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 121, 671 N.E.2d 252, fn. 2, citing <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 318-319, 662 N.E.2d 287, and <em>Posin v. A.B.C. Motor Court Hotel, Inc. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 271, 275, 74 O.O.2d 427, 344 N.E.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">{\u00b6 29} Civ.R. 50(A)(4) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u2018When a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe law in Ohio regarding directed verdicts is well formulated. In addition to Civ.R. 50(A), it is well established that the court must neither consider the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses in disposing of a directed verdict motion. * * * Thus, \u2018if there is substantial competent evidence to support the party against whom the motion is made, upon which evidence reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. <em>Kellerman v. J.S. Dung Co. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 320 [27 O.O.2d 241, 199 N.E.2d 562] * * *.\u2019 <em>Hawkins v. Ivy </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 114, 115 [4 O.O.3d 243, 363 N. E.2d 367].\u201d <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 284-285, 21 O.O.3d 177, 423 N.E.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 32} We must consider whether Grace\u2019s estate presented sufficient evidence regarding her claim for the imposition of a constructive trust to defeat a motion for directed verdict and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We must consider whether Grace\u2019s estate presented clear and convincing evidence of the inequitable situation or unjust enrichment that would result if the Cowlings retain the assets and whether Grace\u2019s estate provided clear and convincing evidence tracing the assets from the joint and survivorship accounts in the name of Grace and Garnard to property held by the Cowlings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 33} Garnard withdrew all of the assets that he subsequently transferred to his children from joint and survivorship accounts that were in his and Grace\u2019s names. Grace\u2019s estate presented evidence indicating that these withdrawals exceeded Garnard\u2019s contributions. Garnard transferred all of the assets that he had withdrawn from the joint and survivorship accounts to his children. Construing this evidence most strongly in Grace\u2019s estate\u2019s favor, reasonable minds could only conclude that inequity had been proven by clear and convincing evidence. We conclude that Grace\u2019s estate presented sufficient evidence with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>respect to this element of a constructive-trust claim to survive motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 34} As to the tracing requirement, the parties stipulated that at the time of the trial, the assets that Garnard had transferred to his children were in the same form in which Garnard had received them. According to the stipulation, the Cowlings retained the assets throughout the trial and (with the exception of Reddington, who paid her share of the assets to Grace\u2019s estate) then sold the assets to post cash deposits for an appeal. We conclude that the evidence and stipulations on the record are sufficient to satisfy the tracing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 35} This case is in equity. See John Selden, Table Talk (1689), quoted in Bartlett, Familiar Quotations (11th Ed., Morley Ed.1947) 130 (\u201cEquity is a roguish thing. For Law we have a measure, know what to trust to; Equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is Equity. \u2018Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a \u2018foot\u2019 a Chancellor\u2019s foot; what an uncertain measure would this be! One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot. \u2018Tis the same thing in the Chancellor\u2019s conscience\u201d). Despite the imprecision of some of the standards we apply in equity, we can only conclude, under any standard, that the Cowlings would unjustly benefit in the absence of a constructive trust. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals. The trial court\u2019s order for a constructive trust, however, cannot stand unmodified.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 36} The trial court did not specify the particular assets over which the constructive trust was to be imposed. That was error, and we hereby order that the constructive trust be specifically imposed over the assets currently held by the Lorain County Clerk of Courts. The trial court ordered that the constructive trust be placed over a specific dollar amount, which now, given the conversion of assets into cash, is appropriate. At the time, however, the trust should have been placed over the proportion of the specific assets held by the Cowlings that equaled Grace\u2019s net contributions, as determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 37} The total value of the assets on February 8, 1998, the day of Garnard\u2019s death, was $325,358.69. The jury determined damages of $255,354.00. The trial court order should be modified to place a constructive trust over 78.5 percent ($255,354.00 divided by $325,358.69) of the assets held by each appellee in their current form.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 38} We hereby order the reinstatement of the trial court\u2019s order for the imposition of a constructive trust and modify the order to place the constructive trust over the assets currently held by the Lorain County Clerk of Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>John L.
