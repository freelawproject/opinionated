(\u201cCPM\u201d) owns and manages an apartment complex known as Hunt Club Apartments located in Copley, Ohio. Tobi Pledger and Mary Sliwinski were tenants of apartment units at Hunt' Club Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2004, CPM began charging tenants for water metered at their apartment units. The ultimate source of the water was the city of Akron Water Department. CPM billed individual tenants for water based on Akron\u2019s water rate, plus an administrative charge of ten percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">{\u00b6 3} Also in January 2004, CPM began billing individual tenants for sewer service based on water use at each apartment unit at the rate charged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ultimate provider of that service, the Summit County Department of Environmental Services, plus ten percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 4} On July 1, 2004, Pledger and Sliwinski<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission (\u201cPUCO\u201d) against their landlord, asserting that CPM was a public utility subject to the PUCO\u2019s jurisdiction and seeking, among other things, relief from CPM\u2019s administrative charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 5} On July 13, 2004, CPM filed its answer denying all material allegations of the complaint and raising affirmative defenses, including the defense that the PUCO lacked jurisdiction because CPM is not a public utility and does not provide public-utility service. CPM alleged that it was not a public utility pursuant to the criteria established by the commission in <em>In re Complaints of Inscho v. Shroyer\u2019s Mobile Homes, </em>PUCO case Nos. 90-182-WS-CSS, 90-252-WS-CSS, and 90-350-WS-CSS, 1992 WL 937210 (Feb. 27, 1992). CPM also asserted that it has never filed an application with the PUCO for a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 6} On August 16, 2004, the PUCO\u2019s attorney examiner issued an entry concluding that CPM\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction would be treated as a motion to dismiss predicated on the three-part test delineated in <em>Shroyer, </em>and ordering the parties to brief whether the complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 7} On October 6, 2004, the PUCO applied the <em>Shroyer </em>test and concluded that CPM is not a public utility and does not render public-utility services. Accordingly, the PUCO determined that it lacked jurisdiction in the matter and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant then filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied by the PUCO in its entry on rehearing dated November 23, 2004. From that denial, appellant filed this appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Central Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 9} The central issue in this appeal is a question of law: For purposes of determining the PUCO\u2019s jurisdiction under R.C. 4905.04(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is CPM a \u201cwaterworks company\u201d or a \u201csewage disposal system company\u201d as defined in R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) and (14), and, thus, a public utility under R.C. 4905.02?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>{\u00b6 10} R.C. 4905.03 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAs used in this chapter:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) Any person, firm, copartnership, voluntary association, joint-stock association, company, or corporation, wherever organized or incorporated, is:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(8) A water-works company, when engaged in the business of supplying water through pipes or tubing, or in a similar manner, to consumers within this state;</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(14) A sewage disposal system company, when engaged in the business of sewage disposal services through pipes or tubing, and treatment works, or in a similar manner, within this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant claims that because CPM provides water and sewer services to its tenants, it is a water-works company and a sewage-disposal-system company pursuant to the definitions of R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) and (14). The statutory definitions, however, are not self-applying<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when considered in the context of a landlord-tenant relationship. Something more than the words of the statute is needed. The PUCO states that to assist in its determination of the jurisdiction question, it developed the <em>Shroyer </em>test and urges that the test is \u201centirely consistent with the well-established precedent of the Court, as a way to systematically implement the statutory definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">{\u00b6 18} The <em>Shroyer </em>test involves three questions: (1) Has the landlord manifested an intent to be a public utility by availing itself of special benefits available to public utilities such as accepting a grant of a franchised territory, a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the use of eminent domain, or use of the public right of way for utility purposes? (2) Are the water services available to the general public rather than just to tenants? and (3) Is the provision of water services ancillary to the landlord\u2019s primary business?</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">{\u00b6 19} The facts of <em>Shroyer </em>are similar to the facts in this case. As in this case, the PUCO in <em>Shroyer </em>considered a complaint under R.C. 4905.26 brought by tenants (of pads, or lots, for manufactured homes) against their landlord, Shroyer\u2019s Mobile Homes (\u201cShroyer\u201d). Shroyer was a manufactured-home park, with 125 to 128 lots, located in Delaware County, Ohio, outside the corporate limits of the city of Delaware. The city was the source of Shroyer\u2019s water supply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Shroyer had historically incorporated water costs into the rent it charged. But sometime before the complaint was filed, Shroyer installed meters and began charging tenants for water based on their usage. Shroyer received water service from the city at a commercial rate and charged its tenants at the city\u2019s higher residential rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Shroyer </em>the tenants alleged that Shroyer was a public utility and that it had \u201cunreasonably and unlawfully installed meters on their mobile homes, charged them for those meters, and charge[d] them for water on a usage basis as well as through the rent for the pad as specified in their leases.\u201d The PUCO found that the primary question presented was whether Shroyer was a waterworks company as defined by R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) and therefore a public utility as defined by R.C. 4905.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 21} Given the similarities between the facts and legal questions in <em>Shroyer </em>and those in this case, it is not surprising that the PUCO applied the <em>Shroyer </em>test to determine whether it had jurisdiction in this case. The PUCO found that the tenant in this case had failed to demonstrate that any part of the three-part test was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 22} As to the first part, the PUCO found that the tenant failed to show that CPM had received from the PUCO a franchised territory or a certificate of convenience and necessity to provide water service. The PUCO also found that CPM did not manifest an intent to be a public utility by availing itself of special benefits available to public utilities, such as using eminent domain or using the public right of way in rendering water or sewer service.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 23} As to the second part of the <em>Shroyer </em>test, the PUCO found that CPM did not hold itself out as providing water and sewer services to the general public. Rather, CPM provided those services only to its tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 24} As to the third part, the PUCO found that CPM\u2019s providing water and sewer services to its tenants was ancillary to its primary business of being a landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 25} Based on the complaining tenant\u2019s failure to demonstrate that CPM met any part<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the <em>Shroyer </em>test, the PUCO determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and dismissed the tenant\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>PUCO\u2019s determination and hold that the dismissal of the complaint was reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Significance of <em>Shroyer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 26} In a construction of the statutes that is inconsistent with our earlier observation that R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) and (14) are not self-applying, appellant urges that to be a statutory water-works company or sewage-disposal-system company, appellant\u2019s landlord need only be \u201c \u2018in tbh business\u2019 of supplying water or sewage disposal services.\u201d Appellant then argues that \u201cin the business\u201d simply means the \u201cbuying and selling of commodities and services,\u201d which CPM, as appellant\u2019s landlord, does with respect to water and sewer service. Accordingly, argues appellant, the third part of the <em>Shroyer </em>test should not be considered in making a jurisdictional determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant\u2019s argument ignores the fact that the noun \u201cbusiness\u201d is followed in both statutory provisions by the preposition \u201cof,\u201d which is used to introduce words describing the noun preceding it. A utility is not in the \u201cbusiness of\u2019 buying and selling an ordinary commodity or service. Instead, R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) refers to the \u201cbusiness of <em>supplying </em>water through pipes or tubing, or in a similar manner,\u201d and R.C. 4905.03(A)(14) refers to the \u201cbusiness of <em>[providing] </em>sewage disposal services through pipes or tubing, and treatment works, or in a similar manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 28} We cannot accept appellant\u2019s suggested definition of \u201cbusiness,\u201d which would mean that appellant\u2019s landlord, CPM, need only buy water and resell it to its tenants to become a water-works company and that CPM need only buy sewage-disposal services and resell them to its tenants to become a sewage-disposal-system company.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, appellant complains that the PUCO\u2019s application of the third prong of the <em>Shroyer </em>test results in a requirement that for a landlord to be deemed a water-works company subject to the PUCO\u2019s jurisdiction, the landlord must be \u201cprimarily in the business of\u2019 supplying water.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 30} A close reading of the PUCO\u2019s October 6, 2004 dismissal entry, however, reveals that the PUCO did not say what appellant attributes to it. The PUCO did not say that only if the landlord were primarily in the business of supplying water would the landlord be a water-works company subject to PUCO jurisdiction. Rather, the PUCO found that CPM\u2019s primary business was that of being a landlord and to the extent that it provides water and sewer service to its tenants, the provision of those services \u201cis ancillary to [CPM\u2019s] primary business of being a landlord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 31} The PUCO did not interpret the phrase \u201cin the business of supplying\u201d to require CPM to be \u201cprimarily in the business of supplying,\u201d as claimed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>appellant. Thus, the PUCO did not unreasonably apply its <em>Shroyer </em>test, and <em>Shroyer </em>is relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Landlord as Consumer</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) defines a water-works company to be a company \u201cengaged in the business of supplying water * * * to consumers within this state.\u201d Thus, it is important that the \u201cconsumers\u201d be identified in this appeal. The PUCO found CPM, the landlord, to be the consumer. Appellant contends that the PUCO\u2019s finding was wrong and that the consumer referred to in the statute is the complaining tenant, appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 33} Appellant then cites and discusses two cases involving appeals to this court from PUCO decisions. The first, <em>Mohawk Util., Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St.2d 47, 66 O.O.2d 128, 307 N.E.2d 261, dealt with the question of who was a \u201cconsumer\u201d of water service, but it did not involve a landlord-tenant relationship. The second case, <em>Shopping Ctrs. Assn. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 1, 32 O.O.2d 1, 208 N.E.2d 923, did involve landlords and tenants, but it supports the commission\u2019s position that landlords and not their tenants are the consumers of public-utility services when the landlords resell and redistribute to their tenants the products supplied by the public utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant also refers to several statutory definitions of \u201cconsumer.\u201d However, each of these statutory definitions specifies that it is applicable to code sections that are not relevant here. The statutes appellant relies on are R.C. 1317.01(P) (retail installment sales), 1345.01(A) and (D) (consumer-sales practices), and 1345.71 (Ohio\u2019s Lemon Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 35} In summary, none of the authorities that appellant cites, whether dictionary definitions, case law, or statutory definitions, supports the assertion that in a landlord-tenant relationship, it is the tenant rather than the landlord who is the consumer of the commodity provided by a water-works utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 36} The PUCO\u2019s position that the landlord is the \u201cconsumer\u201d under R.C. 4905.03(A)(8) is better reasoned and is supported by legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 37} Landlords are consumers of utility service, even though they resell that service to their tenants. In <em>FirstEnergy Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 371, 2002-Ohio-4847, 775 N.E.2d 485, this court held that the energy supplier was not allowed to restrict the resale of electric service by a landlord to a tenant if the resale took place only on the landlord\u2019s property. This court, citing precedent, held that \u201coffice buildings, apartment houses, and shopping centers are \u2018consumers\u2019 of electricity even though these consumers may resell, redistribute, or submeter part of the electrical energy to their tenants.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAO4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>John Wood, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AaH\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Duane W. Luckey, John H. Jones, and Thomas W. McNamee, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee Public Utilities Commission.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ASx\">Benesch, Friedlander, Copian &amp; Aronoff, L.L.P., and Orla E. Collier III, for appellee Capital Properties Management, Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 38} Applying <em>FirstEnergy </em>to the case at bar, we hold that the landlord is the consumer of these services, even though it resold the services to its tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 39} A water-works company is a company \u201cengaged in the business of supplying water through pipes or tubing, or in a similar manner, to consumers within this state.\u201d R.C. 4905.03(A)(8). The landlord in this case is a consumer of utility services. The landlord consumes utility services in the process of engaging in its business of renting apartment space. Since the landlord is not the supplier of water to consumers, it is not a water-works company and therefore not a public utility subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 40} As this court has held in the past, \u201c \u2018[d]ue deference should be given to statutory interpretations by an agency that has accumulated substantial expertise and to which the General Assembly has delegated enforcement responsibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monongahela Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 571, 2004-Ohio-6896, 820 N.E.2d 921, \u00b6 30, quoting Weiss <em>v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 15, 17-18, 734 N.E.2d 775. Pursuant to R.C. 4903.13, we will not reverse or modify a final order of the PUCO unless the \u201ccourt is of the opinion that such order was unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d We hold that the PUCO\u2019s decisions in this case were reasonable and lawful, and, therefore, we affirm them.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-11\">.
