State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27, 723 N.E.2d 97, is applicable to the version of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372 (\u201cH.B. 261\u201d), effective September 3, 1997. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 2} On January 1, 2001, Bruce Hedges, an Arizona resident, was riding his bicycle just outside Tucson, Arizona. John Leasure Jr., an insured motorist driving a truck, struck Hedges from behind, knocking him off his bike. Bruce died of injuries sustained in the accident. Leasure\u2019s insurer paid the limits of his policy, and Bruce\u2019s insurer paid damages on a claim for underinsured-motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage. Bruce\u2019s mother, Mary Hedges, the appellee, received a portion of those payments. Hedges was an Ohio resident, and on the date of her son\u2019s accident, she held an automobile insurance policy and an umbrella insurance policy issued by Nationwide Insurance Company, the appellant. Both policies provided uninsured/underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage. The umbrella policy applied to losses covered by the insured\u2019s underlying automobile insurance policy. The automobile insurance policy\u2019s UM/UIM provision provides that Nationwide \u201cwill pay compensatory damages, including derivative claims, which are due by law to you or a relative from the owner or driver of an uninsured [or underinsured] motor vehicle because of bodily injury suffered by you or a relative.\u201d The definition of \u201crelative\u201d in Hedges\u2019s policy states that a relative is \u201cone who regularly lives in your household and who is related to you by blood, marriage or adoption.\u201d By the terms of Hedges\u2019s policy, her adult son was not a \u201crelative,\u201d because he did not live in her household.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 3} Hedges submitted a claim for UIM coverage under her automobile insurance policy, claiming that the policy covers the damages she sustained from the nonphysical, personal loss she experienced as a result of her son\u2019s death. Nationwide denied benefits, stating that Hedges\u2019s claim was not a covered loss. Hedges then filed a complaint in the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County seeking a declaration of her rights under the policies and also asserting claims against Nationwide for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and bad-faith breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 4} Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. Hedges requested summary judgment on policy coverage, asserting that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 27, 723 N.E.2d 97, involved similar facts and circumstances and applied to her claim. <em>Moore </em>held that R.C. 3937.18(A) does not permit an insurer to limit uninsured-motorist coverage in such a way that an insured must suffer bodily injury, sickness, or disease to recover damages from the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 5} Nationwide argued, in defense, that because <em>Moore </em>interpreted an earlier version of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 20, 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 204, 210 (\u201cS.B. 20\u201d), <em>Moore </em>does not control this case. The version of R.C. 3937.18(A) in effect when Hedges entered her contracts with Nationwide was the version as amended later by H.B. 261. Nationwide contended that the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(A) permits an insurer to limit UM/CJIM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>coverage to accidents in which an insured suffers bodily injury; therefore, Nationwide claimed, Hedges was not entitled to coverage, because she did not meet the bodily injury requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Nationwide, finding that <em>Moore </em>did not apply to the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18 and that the policy provision at issue restricted UM/UIM coverage to claims for bodily injury suffered only by an insured. Because Hedges did not suffer bodily injury and her son was not an insured under the policy, she was not entitled to UIM coverage under her policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 7} Hedges appealed to the Franklin County Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in finding <em>Moore </em>inapplicable to the circumstances of her case. Relying on <em>Bernabei v. Cincinnati Ins. Cos., </em>Stark App. Nos. 2002CA00073 and 2002CA00078, 2004-Ohio-4939, 2004 WL 2260686, the court of appeals ruled that the trial court had erred. It held that <em>Moore </em>applied and that UIM coverage should not have been denied, as the policy provision at issue contravened R.C. 3937.18 by requiring an insured to sustain bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 8} The case is before us upon determination that a conflict exists between the Tenth and Second District Courts of Appeals and pursuant to the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 9} We reverse the judgment and hold that <em>Moore </em>does not apply to the version of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by H.B. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Law and Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 10} The Tenth District Court of Appeals has framed the issue in conflict as being whether the Ohio Supreme Court decision in <em>Moore </em>is applicable to the version of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by H.B. 261. In its discretionary appeal, Nationwide offers two propositions of law. The first asserts that <em>Moore </em>does not apply to the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18, and the second proposes that we overrule <em>Moore. </em>To address the first argument, we must discuss the history behind <em>Moore </em>and the amendments to R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 11} This court\u2019s decision in <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555, preceded <em>Moore </em>and was the first case to interpret the version of R.C. 3937.18 that was in effect before the S.B. 20 amendments to the statute. In <em>Sexton, </em>Gareld Sexton\u2019s 17-year-old daughter was killed by an uninsured motorist. The daughter did not live with Sexton and was not an insured under his policy with State Farm Automobile Insurance Company. Sexton paid $2,300 in medical and funeral expenses related to his daughter\u2019s injuries and death. State Farm denied Sexton\u2019s claim for these damages. The State Farm policy provided UM coverage for \u201cdamages * * * because of bodily injury sustained by the insured.\u201d Id. at 432, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>N.E.2d 555. This court held that because the policy required that an insured suffer bodily injury before receiving UM coverage, it violated R.C. 3937.18(A), as this restriction attempted to limit recovery. Construing the language of R.C. 3937.18, <em>Sexton </em>stated, \u201cAlthough [R.C. 3937.18(A) ] does not indicate who must have sustained the bodily injury, it does not specify that it be the insured. Because the statute should be construed liberally, * * * we will not add that limitation.\u201d Id. at 434, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 12} After <em>Sexton, </em>the General Assembly amended R.C. 3937.18 several times. The S.B. 20 version, effective October 20,1994, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(A) No automobile liability * * * policy of insurance * * * shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state * * * unless both of the following coverages are provided to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such persons:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) Uninsured motorist coverage, which * * * shall provide protection for bodily injury or death * * * for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy.\u201d 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 15} This court had the opportunity to interpret these amendments to R.C. 3937.18 in <em>Moore. </em>Specifically, the court looked at whether the S.B. 20 amendments to R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) allowed insurers to restrict UM/UIM coverage to those accidents in which an insured suffered bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Moore, </em>Alice Moore\u2019s son died as a result of an automobile accident caused by an uninsured motorist. Moore was not involved in the accident, her son did not live with her at the time of the accident, and her son was not an insured under her insurance policy with State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company. State Auto denied Moore\u2019s claim for damages for her nonphysical, personal loss. The insurance policy limited coverage to \u201cdamages which an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * [sjustained by an \u2018insured\u2019 * * * and * * * [claused by an accident.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 28, 723 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 17} State Auto argued that the new statutory language permitted the insurer to do what was forbidden before the S.B. 20 amendments: to require that an insured suffer bodily injury in order to receive UM/UIM coverage. Id. at 30, 723 N.E.2d 97. Moore responded by asserting that the words \u201csuffered by such persons\u201d in the S.B. 20 version of the statute referred to \u201closs\u201d and not to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and that the phrase \u201csuffered by any person insured under the policy\u201d referred to \u201cdamages.\u201d Id. at 30-31, 723 N.E.2d 97. Moore argued that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Sexton </em>was unaltered by the S.B. 20 amendments and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>policy language was invalid because it afforded less coverage than that required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 18} <em>Moore </em>began its analysis by deciding that the statutory language was ambiguous and thus looked to the intent of the General Assembly. The General Assembly\u2019s intent in requiring insurers to offer UM/UIM coverage was to protect persons from losses that, because of the tortfeasor\u2019s lack of liability coverage, would otherwise go uncompensated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the court reasoned that following the insurer\u2019s interpretation would thwart the purpose of the UM/UIM statute. Id. at 31, 723 N.E.2d 97. The court held that R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by S.B. 20 precluded an insurer from limiting UM/UIM coverage in such a way that an insured must suffer bodily injury in order to recover damages. Id. at 32, 723 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Moore </em>interpreted the 1994 version of R.C. 3937.18 as amended by S.B. 20, but R.C. 3937.18 was amended afterward in 1997 by H.B. 261. The certified conflict between the Tenth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in the underlying case and the Second District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Cincinnati Equitable Ins. Co. v. Wells, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20286, 2004-Ohio-2418, 2004 WL 1072270, presents us with the opportunity to examine the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18. The H.B. 261 version provided:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) No automobile liability * * * policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle * * * unless both of the following coverages are <em>offered </em>to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such <em>insureds:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(1) Uninsured motorist coverage which * * * shall provide protection for bodily injury, <em>sickness, </em>or <em>disease, including </em>death * * * for the protection of <em>insureds </em>thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy.\u201d (Emphasis added to indicate changes made by H.B. 261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Cincinnati Equitable, </em>2004-Ohio-2418, 2004 WL 1072270, the Second District determined that <em>Moore </em>did not apply to the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18. The court determined that by changing the word \u201cperson\u201d to \u201cinsured\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>in the H.B. 261 version, the General Assembly confined \u201cthe required UM/UIM coverage that must be offered to coverage for claims for bodily injury and death suffered by the person(s) to whom \u2018such insureds\u2019 specifically refers, the named insureds.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">{\u00b6 23} The Tenth District reached the opposite result, agreeing with the Fifth District\u2019s reasoning in <em>Bernabei v. Cincinnati Ins. Cos., </em>2004-Ohio-4939. In <em>Bemabei </em>the Fifth District acknowledged <em>Moore\u2019s </em>holding that R.C. 3937.18 is remedial legislation that should be construed liberally to provide coverage to persons suffering damages caused by uninsured motorists. Id. at \u00b6 56. <em>Bemabei </em>also noted that <em>Moore </em>had found the S.B. 20 version of the statute ambiguous because it was not clear whether the phrases \u201csuffered by such persons\u201d and \u201csuffered by any person insured under the policy\u201d modified \u201closs\u201d and \u201cdamages,\u201d respectively, rather than \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 57. Like the Fifth District in <em>Bemabei, </em>the Tenth District concluded that changing the word \u201cpersons\u201d in the S.B. 20 version to \u201cinsureds\u201d in the H.B. 261 version of the statute did not cure the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 24} The Second District\u2019s analysis comports with the rules of grammar and statutory construction. R.C. 1.42 provides that \u201c[wjords and phrases [in a statute] shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d The rules of grammar are clear that \u201c \u2018[Referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Indep. Ins. Agents of Ohio, Inc. v. Fabe </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 310, 314, 587 N.E.2d 814, quoting <em>Carter v. Youngstown </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 209, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63. In the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(A)(1), the phrase \u201csuffered by any person insured under the policy\u201d modifies its antecedent \u201cbodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death.\u201d The statute allows insurers to restrict UM/UIM coverage to accidents in which an insured suffers bodily injury, sickness, or disease. Hedges argues that it is unclear whether the phrase \u201csuffered by any person insured under the policy\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cbodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death\u201d or the word \u201cdamages.\u201d We disagree. The suggestion that the phrase could modify \u201cdamages\u201d is not in agreement with the plain meaning of the statute, according to the rules of grammar. Accordingly, we find that the changes to the statutory language in the H.B. 261 version cured the ambiguity that concerned <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 25} We infer that when the General Assembly amended the statute, changing the word \u201cperson\u201d to \u201cinsured,\u201d it intended to clarify that insurers could limit UM/UIM coverage to accidents in which an insured suffers bodily injury. The clear meaning of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by H.B. 261 is that a UM/UIM provision may restrict coverage to damages arising from bodily injury to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>insured. Because <em>Moore </em>based its analysis on a different version of R.C. 3937.18, we hold that <em>Moore </em>does not apply to the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">{\u00b626} Nationwide next urges us to overrule <em>Moore. </em>The doctrine of stare decisis provides continuity and predictability in our legal system. In <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, we set forth a standard by which to judge whether a past decision should be overruled. According to that standard, an earlier decision of the Ohio Supreme Court may be overruled when \u201c(1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 27} Applying the <em>Galatis </em>test, we decline to overrule <em>Moore, </em>but instead limit <em>Moore </em>to insurance contracts governed by the S.B. 20 version of R.C. 3937.18. We cannot say that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided, for the court did not err in finding the S.B. 20 language at issue in that case to be ambiguous. Furthermore, effective October 31, 2001, to dispel any question of its intent, the General Assembly expressly superseded the holdings of <em>Moore </em>and <em>Sexton </em>when it enacted Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, Section 3, 788-790 (\u201cIn enacting this act, it is the intent of the General Assembly to * * * supersede the holdings of the Ohio Supreme Court in * * * <em>Sexton </em>* * * and [its] progeny\u201d). Overruling <em>Moore </em>would have no practical effect in light of this legislative action and our ruling today.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, we hold that the interpretation of R.C. 3937.18(A) in <em>Moore </em>applies only to the 1994 S.B. 20 version of the statute. Thus, <em>Moore </em>does not apply to the 1997 H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-8\">Mover, C.J., Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b238-9\">Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\">.

I believe that the interpretation of R.C. 3937.18(A) reached in <em>Moore v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27, 723 N.E.2d 97, fully applies to this case. I would affirm the well-reasoned judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">{\u00b6 30} I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the 1997 amendments to R.C. 3937.18(A) made by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372 (\u201c1997 H.B. 261\u201d) made <em>Moore\u2019s </em>holding inapplicable to this case. In declining to deviate from <em>Moore\u2019s </em>analysis, the Tenth District Court of Appeals rightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>followed the same path that has been taken by every appellate district save one that has considered the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">{\u00b6 31} In addition to the Tenth District\u2019s decision in this case, most other appellate districts that have encountered the issue have squarely determined <em>Moore </em>to be applicable when considering the effect of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by 1997 H.B. 261 on uninsured/underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) policies. See <em>Adams v. Crider, </em>Mercer App. Nos. 10-02-18 and 10-02-19, 2004-Ohio-535, 2004 WL 231785 (Third District), appeal not accepted for review, 102 Ohio St.3d 1473, 2004-Ohio-2830, 809 N.E.2d 1159; <em>Bernabei v.

Co., </em>Columbiana App. No. 02 CO 54, 2004-Ohio-1546, 2004 WL 614824 (Seventh District).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 32} I find it noteworthy that a majority of this court denied review in all of the above cases that were appealed here before this one, thus permitting to stand a number of determinations that <em>Moore </em>applies to <em>\u201cSexton </em>claims\u201d made under UM7UIM policies governed by the 1997 H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(A). See <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555. The only appellate district that has considered this issue and decided it otherwise was the Second District in <em>Cincinnati Equitable Ins. Co. v. Wells, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20286, 2004-Ohio-2418, 2004 WL 1072270, a judgment that was not appealed to this court. The majority adopts the reasoning of that decision, even though districts that have examined the approach taken in <em>Cincinnati Equitable Ins. Co. </em>have justifiably declined to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 33} As the Tenth District recognized by quoting the Fifth District\u2019s <em>Bemabei </em>decision at length, that opinion is the best reasoned of all the cases that have considered this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 34} The <em>Bemabei </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cUpon closer analysis of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of prior versions of R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(A), it is our opinion that the changes made to the statute in 1997 would not have affected the analysis used in either <em>Sexton </em>or <em>Moore. </em>In both opinions, the Supreme Court held that the statute was remedial legislation and must be construed liberally to provide coverage for persons injured by uninsured and underinsured motorists. <em>Sexton </em>[69 Ohio St.2d] at 434 [23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555]; <em>Moore </em>[88 Ohio St.3d] at 31, 723 N.E.2d 97. Both cases understood that the purpose of the statute was to protect insured persons. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cBoth cases held that the statute was ambiguous in its use of the phrase \u2018bodily injury or death.\u2019 <em>Sexton </em>[69 Ohio St.2d] at 434 [23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555]; <em>Moore </em>[88 Ohio St.3d] at 31, 723 N.E.2d 97. The phrase \u2018bodily injury or death\u2019 could relate to the general type of damages and loss that an insured had sustained, or it could describe a much narrower range of losses that could be compensated, i.e., losses relating to the bodily injury or death <em>of an insured party. </em>Both Supreme Court opinions chose the former interpretation to resolve the ambiguity, and held that the type of UIM coverage available to an insured must relate to bodily injury or death, but not necessarily the insured\u2019s own bodily injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe same ambiguity occurs in the 1997 version of the statute. The key section of the statute is: \u2018unless both of the following coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such insureds.\u2019 On the one hand, the statute can be interpreted as providing UIM coverage to an insured for loss suffered by the insured, if such loss is somehow related to bodily injury or death. This reading emphasizes the words in the statute in the following way: \u2018unless both of the following coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such insureds.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cOn the other hand, the statute can be interpreted to provide coverage only when an insured has suffered bodily injury or death. This interpretation emphasizes the following words: \u2018unless both of the following coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such insureds.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cBoth of these readings are plausible. Given the choice, the remedial nature of the statute requires an interpretation in favor of granting UIM coverage consistent with <em>Sexton </em>and <em>Moore.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>Bernabei, </em>2004-Ohio-4939, 2004 WL 2260686, at \u00b6 56-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 40} In addition to reviewing the <em>Bemabei </em>decision, the Tenth District also extensively discussed the Second District\u2019s analysis in <em>Cincinnati Equitable Ins. Co. v. Wells, </em>2004-Ohio-2418, 2004 WL 1072270, see <em>Hedges, </em>2004-Ohio-6723, 2004 WL 2896350, at \u00b6 25-27, but ultimately found that analysis lacking:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cWe believe that the Fifth District\u2019s opinion in <em>Bemabei </em>is the better reasoned. As noted therein, both the <em>Sexton </em>and <em>Moore </em>courts emphasized that R.C. 3937.18 is remedial legislation and, as such, is to be construed liberally to provide coverage to persons injured by uninsured and underinsured motorists. Further, as recognized in <em>Bemabei, </em>the words \u2018loss\u2019 and \u2018damages\u2019 remain in the 1997 version of the statute. The <em>Moore </em>court found the 1994 version of the statute ambiguous because it was not clear whether the phrases \u2018suffered by such persons\u2019 and \u2018suffered by any person insured under the policy\u2019 modified, respec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tively, \u2018loss\u2019 and \u2018damages\u2019 rather than \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 We agree with the <em>Bemabei </em>court that the change from \u2018persons\u2019 to \u2018insureds\u2019 at the end of the last full paragraph of R.C. 3937.18(A) did not cure this ambiguity. Finally, we note that, although <em>Moore </em>had not yet been decided at the time H.B. 261 was enacted, <em>Moore\u2019s, </em>predecessor, <em>Sexton, </em>remained good law, and the General Assembly did not indicate an intention to overrule <em>Sexton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cAccordingly, we find that the trial court erred in failing to apply <em>Moore </em>to the 1997 version of R.C. 3937.18(A) applicable to the challenged policy.\u201d <em>Hedges, </em>2004-Ohio-6723, 2004 WL 2896350, at \u00b6 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 43} The General Assembly stated its explicit intention to supersede <em>Sexton </em>and <em>Moore </em>in uncodified legislation accompanying amendments to R.C. 3937.18(A) in Sub.S.B. No. 267, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11380, 11385 (\u201c2000 S.B. 267\u201d), effective September 21, 2000. Section 3 of 2000 S.B. 267 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly in amending division (A) of section 3937.18 of the Revised Code to supersede the holdings of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431 [23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555] and <em>Moore v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27 [723 N.E.2d 97] that division (A)(1) of section 3937.18 of the Revised Code does not permit an insurer to limit uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage in such a way that an insured must suffer bodily injury, sickness, death or disease for any other insured to recover from the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 45} See, also, Section 3(E) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 779, 788-790, effective October 31, 2001, in which the General Assembly again explicitly stated its intention .\u201c[t]o supersede the holdings of the Ohio Supreme Court in\u201d <em>Sexton </em>and its \u201cprogeny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 46} This case involves the version of R.C. 3937.18(A) as amended by 1997 H.B. 261, not the version as amended by 2000 S.B. 267. In <em>McDaniel v. Rollins, </em>Allen App. No. 1-04-82, 2005-Ohio-3079, 2005 WL 1421754, a case involving an insurance policy governed by R.C. 3937.18 as amended by 2000 S.B. 267, the Third District held that that version of R.C. 3937.18 \u201cpermits an insurer to limit UM/UIM coverage to instances where the insured suffers bodily injury.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29. The Third District in <em>McDaniel </em>based its holding on the revised statutory language and on the General Assembly\u2019s statement of intent accompanying 2000 S.B. 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 47} To reach that point in its analysis, <em>McDaniel, </em>at \u00b6 28, summarized why the Third District (along with other districts) had previously determined that the 1997 H.B. 261 amendments to R.C. 3937.18(A) did not accomplish a similar result:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cR.C. 3937.18 was amended by House Bill 261, effective September 3, 1997. Several appellate courts, including this one, have addressed this amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ment to R.C. 3937.18 and found that it did not alter the holdings in either <em>Sexton </em>or <em>Moore. [Adams </em>v.] <em>Crider </em>[2004-Ohio-535, 2004 WL 231785] at \u00b6 19-21, appeal not allowed by 102 Ohio St.3d 1473, 2004-Ohio-2830 [809 N.E.2d 1159]; <em>Hedges </em>[2004-Ohio-6723, 2004 WL 2896350] at \u00b6 33-35; <em>Bernabei v. The Cincinnati Ins. Cos., </em>5th Dist. No. 2002CA00078, 2004-Ohio-4939, 2004 WL 2260686, at \u00b6 61-63; <em>Aldrich v. Pacific Indemn. Co., </em>7th Dist. No. 02 CO 54, 2004-Ohio-1546, 2004 WL 614824, at \u00b6 24. Accordingly, this Court has held that the version of R.C. 3937.18 as amended by House [B]ill 261 does not allow insurers to exclude from UM/UIM coverage wrongful death losses that an insured suffers because of an underinsured motorist. <em>Adams </em>at \u00b6 20. In similar rulings, both the Fifth and the Tenth-Districts relied on the fact that the legislature had not removed the words \u2018for loss\u2019 or \u2018damages\u2019 from the 1997 version of the statute and that the legislative comments published with House Bill 261 did not indicate any intention on the part of the legislature to overturn <em>Sexton. Hedges </em>at \u00b6 33; <em>Bemabei </em>at \u00b6 52-62.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"As\">Smith, Phillips &amp; Associates and Janet L. Phillips, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AC-\">Buckley King, L.P.A., Thomas Blackburn, and Gary A. Gillett, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">{\u00b6 49} I fully agree with the cogent reasoning expressed in decisions such as <em>McDaniel, Bernabei, </em>and the opinion of the court of appeals in this case. In light of that reasoning, the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish the version of R.C. 3937.18(A) at issue in <em>Moore </em>(the version as amended by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 20,145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 204, 210) from the version at issue in this case (the 1997 H.B. 261 version) by resorting to \u201crules of grammar and statutory construction\u201d rings hollow. Because the two versions of the statute cannot be so distinguished, <em>Moore </em>should apply to this case. Furthermore, because <em>Moore </em>was soundly reasoned, this court should reaffirm the rationale of that decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-5\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
