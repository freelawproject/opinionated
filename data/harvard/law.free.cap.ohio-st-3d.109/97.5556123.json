A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause, including the parties\u2019 comprehensive stipulations, and made findings of misconduct and a recommendation, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 3} All of the charged misconduct arose from respondent\u2019s representation of a licensed practical nurse during 2003. The nurse had engaged respondent in July of that year to defend her against allegations that she had stolen prescription drugs from the long-term care facility where she worked. These allegations led to the nurse\u2019s termination, her indictment on theft charges, and review by the Ohio Board of Nursing of her license to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">{\u00b6 4} In a meeting with respondent and his employer in August of that year, the nurse discussed her pending criminal case and the administrative proceedings against her. She agreed to a $3,000 fee for respondent\u2019s representation, and over the succeeding several weeks, she paid $1,700 toward this fee. Respondent did not commit their fee agreement to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent\u2019s client desperately wanted a hearing before the nursing board to explain the extenuating circumstances of her situation, including that she had confessed her theft to her employer. She also wanted to prove her rehabilitation and suitability to be restored to an unrestricted license. Thus, when the client received the nursing board\u2019s September 19, 2003 Notice of Opportunity for Hearing, she immediately advised respondent by telephone and personally delivered the notice to him. The notice advised the client that she could request a formal hearing, provided the request was made in writing no later than 30 days from the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent did not file the hearing request, because, in the exercise of his professional judgment, he had decided that appearing before the nursing board would not advance his client\u2019s interests. Respondent failed, however, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>adequately communicate this conclusion to his client, and she, having heard nothing to the contrary, continued to expect that a hearing would be held on the status of her license. During the disciplinary proceedings, respondent explained this communication failure as a misunderstanding, and, looking back, he conceded that his client\u2019s expectation was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent\u2019s client learned on November 19, 2003, that respondent had not requested a nursing-board hearing. She received a notice advising that, due to the lack of a formal hearing request, the board would consider her case ex parte at a meeting on November 20 and 21, 2003. The client alerted respondent, and he immediately asked for a delay of the board\u2019s deliberations, citing \u201cmistake, inadvertence, [and] excusable neglect\u201d as the cause for the failed hearing request. A representative of the nursing board later advised respondent that there were no provisions for a hearing without a proper request.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 8} The failure to request a hearing resulted in the indefinite suspension of the client\u2019s nursing license, an order from which she could not appeal. The indefinite suspension also carried certain restrictions. Even if the client\u2019s license is eventually reinstated, her practice would always be subject to conditions, including a prohibition against dispensing medication or supervising those who do.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 9} The client dismissed respondent for his neglect of her case before the nursing board. Prior to his dismissal, however, respondent successfully negotiated a resolution of the client\u2019s criminal case, obtaining treatment in lieu of conviction for her. The client has since successfully completed her treatment, and her criminal record has been expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 10} On these facts, the panel and board found that respondent had failed to clearly define for his client the scope of his representation and to communicate his decisions on her behalf. As the parties stipulated, the client reasonably believed that respondent would protect her interests before the board by requesting the hearing to which she was entitled. The panel and board thus found that respondent had violated DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting a legal matter), 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract for professional services), and 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally prejudicing or damaging a client).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 11} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel and board weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>{\u00b6 12} In mitigation, the panel and board found that respondent had no prior record of disciplinary action and that he had not acted with a dishonest or selfish motive. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (b). Respondent had also cooperated fully in the disciplinary process. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). The panel and board further commended respondent\u2019s performance on his client\u2019s behalf in her criminal case and accepted his expressions of remorse for his failings before the nursing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 13} In aggravation, the panel and board observed that respondent\u2019s client likely received a more severe sanction for her transgressions than she would have received had respondent timely requested a hearing before the nursing board. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent and relator stipulated that a six-month suspension, with the entire period stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further Disciplinary Rule violations during the stayed suspension, was an appropriate sanction. The panel' initially recommended that respondent receive a six-month suspension with a conditional stay. During board deliberations, however, the panel modified its recommendation, advocating instead a public reprimand. The board accepted this proposal and recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 15} We agree that respondent committed the cited misconduct, but we disagree with the board\u2019s recommended sanction. Instead, we adopt the panel\u2019s initial recommendation of a six-month stayed suspension, which both respondent and relator agreed was an appropriate sanction. Respondent\u2019s contrition, remedial efforts, and expressed devotion to the legal profession all suggest that he will .never repeat the serious mistake that he made in this case, but we conclude that a stayed suspension will help to protect the public by ensuring that respondent will conscientiously comply with all of his ethical obligations during the suspension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months, with the entire suspension stayed provided that respondent commit no further misconduct during the suspension period. If respondent violates this condition, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b262-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b262-12\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., would publicly reprimand respondent.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AT1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Rapoport, Spitz, Friedland &amp; Courtney and Michael M.
