FirstEnergy, the Ohio Energy Group, and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio have intervened in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 2} The history of this case dates to enactment by the General Assembly of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7962 (\u201cSB 3\u201d), effective October 5, 1999, which provided for restructuring of Ohio\u2019s electric-utility industry with a goal of achieving retail competition with respect to the generation component of electric service. SB 3 provided for a transition period, termed the \u201cmarket development period,\u201d during which an electric utility\u2019s rates would be subject to certain regulatory requirements. FirstEnergy\u2019s market-development period ended December 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 3} In response to SB 3, FirstEnergy filed an initial application on July 1, 2003, seeking approval of a proposed revision to its 2004 and 2005 shopping credits<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> established in the electric-transition plans earlier approved by the PUCO for each of FirstEnergy\u2019s operating companies. In an entry dated September 23, 2003,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the PUCO (1) denied FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed shopping-credit revision for 2004, (2) stated that the matter of the shopping credits for 2005 would best be considered \u201cin the context of what would best promote orderly and progressive market development in the post market development period,\u201d (3) encouraged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>FirstEnergy \u201cto consider and develop plans for 2005 and beyond, which balance three objectives: rate certainty, financial stability for the electric distribution utilities and further competitive market development,\u201d and (4) directed FirstEnergy to file those plans before December 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 4} Responding to this directive, on October 31, 2003, FirstEnergy, on behalf of its Ohio operating companies, Ohio Edison Company, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and the Toledo Edison Company, filed another application, which marks the beginning of the proceedings at issue in this appeal. In its application, FirstEnergy sought PUCO approval of, inter alia, a proposed rate-stabilization plan to take effect at the end of the market-development period, December 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 5} Several groups and other entities intervened and participated in the PUCO proceedings that addressed FirstEnergy\u2019s application, including the OCC and the Northwest Ohio Aggregation Coalition on behalf of the governmental aggregators.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In connection with the FirstEnergy application, which had been filed on October 31, 2003, the PUCO conducted local public hearings in Toledo, Cleveland, and Kent in November 2003 and evidentiary hearings in February 2004. Members of the public submitted written testimony, comments, and letters for consideration by the PUCO. FirstEnergy, the Ohio Energy Group, the Ohio Hospital Association, Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, Cargill, Inc., and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio signed a partial stipulation and recommendation purporting to resolve some issues in this case and submitted it to the PUCO in February 2004. The parties filed posthearing and rebuttal briefs in March 2004, and the PUCO heard oral argument in April 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 6} These proceedings culminated in the PUCO\u2019s June 9, 2004 opinion and order in this case, which, inter alia, approved a modified version of FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed rate-stabilization plan and determined that the price under the plan should be compared periodically with the prices submitted in a competitive-bid process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>{\u00b6 7} As part of its opinion and order approving the rate-stabilization plan, the PUCO approved the following components, inter alia: (1) a rate-stabilization charge, which the PUCO stated compensates FirstEnergy for its commitment to provide \u201cprovider of last resort\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> generation service for 2006-2008 for customers in its service areas who drop out of aggregation plans or short-term contracts with competing power-generation providers; (2) shopping credits, which a shopping customer receives when he or she uses a competitive retail-electric service provider; (3) interest on shopping-credit deferrals, which the OCC and the governmental aggregators argue violates a previous stipulation by the parties; and (4) a waiver of the requirement that it divest its generation assets in order to comply with R.C. 4928.17(A) because the PUCO determined that good cause existed to extend the financial-separation waiver with regard to the divestment of FirstEnergy\u2019s generating assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 8} Following the PUCO\u2019s June 9, 2004 opinion and order, various parties or intervenors<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> filed successive applications for rehearing, and in the three entries, the PUCO refined its concept of FirstEnergy\u2019s competitive-bid process. OCC objected to FirstEnergy\u2019s commission-approved rate-stabilization plan and, following the PUCO\u2019s third entry on rehearing, dated November 23, 2004, brought the appeal in case No. 2004-1993. The governmental aggregators appealed from the same opinion and order in case No. 2005-0118.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Propositions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 9} The OCC and the aggregators each assert five propositions of law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>which may be considered as the following issues: (1) approval of the rate-stabilization plan, (2) approval of the rate-stabilization charge, (3) approval of shopping credits, (4) grant of interest on shopping credits, and (5) approval of FirstEnergy\u2019s financial-separation plan. We affirm the PUCO with respect to propositions two, three, four, and five. Regarding the first proposition, however, the rate-stabilization plan as adopted by the PUCO failed to conform to R.C. 4928.14(B) because it did not ensure that a reasonable means for customer participation had been developed. We therefore remand the matter to the PUCO for further consideration of this aspect of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Approval of Rate-Stabilization Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 10} The OCC and the governmental aggregators argue that, in accordance with R.C. 4928.14(A), as of January 1, 2006, electric-distribution utilities are required to provide customers with both a market-based standard service offer and, pursuant to R.C. 4928.14(B), an <em>option </em>to purchase electric service at a price to be determined through a competitive-bidding process. They further maintain that the PUCO lacks authority to approve a rate-stabilization plan that does not comport with these legislative mandates. It is the OCC\u2019s and governmental aggregators\u2019 position that, in this case, instead of requiring FirstEnergy to offer a market-based standard service <em>and </em>an option to purchase electric service at a rate set by way of a competitive-bidding process, the PUCO itself rejected all bids received in the auction and instead chose the rate-stabilization plan as the only offer to be presented to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 11} Further, the OCC and the governmental aggregators contend that not only are customers being denied an option to purchase electric service at a price determined through a competitive-bidding process as required by R.C. 4928.14(B), but also, they are not being offered a market-based rate as required by R.C. 4928.14(A), because the rate-stabilization plan provides only rates at which FirstEnergy is willing to sell generation based on its own costs. The governmental aggregators argue that the rate-stabilization plan violates the PUCO\u2019s own rules, which provide that a market-based standard service offer must be at a rate that fluctuates with changes in wholesale market prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 12} In response, the PUCO and FirstEnergy contend that R.C. 4928.14(B) allows the PUCO to dispense with competitive bidding when there are other means to accomplish the same end and customers can reasonably participate. However, to fulfill its duty to the public, the PUCO first required FirstEnergy to engage in a competitive-bidding process, but then, the PUCO itself rejected the bids received because FirstEnergy had submitted the lowest bid. Accordingly, the PUCO argues, FirstEnergy offered the rate-stabilization plan as the best package the market could offer, and for this reason, the PUCO approved it. The OCC and the governmental aggregators respond that the rate determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>through the competitive-bidding auction held December 8, 2004, although higher than the proposed rate in the rate-stabilization plan, was fixed for a three-year period, whereas FirstEnergy could seek an increase in its rate during the same period. They argue that some customers would choose a stable fixed rate over the rate established in the rate-stabilization plan, which is subject to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">{\u00b6 13} The PUCO and FirstEnergy further argue that the rate-stabilization plan meets the standard of a market-based standard service offer as determined by the PUCO and is sufficient to take the place of a competitive-bidding process because the PUCO tested it in a competitive-bidding situation. In addition, the PUCO agreed to conduct additional competitive-bid procedures to ensure that the price remains favorable throughout the life of the plan and that the PUCO could terminate the rate-stabilization plan if a more competitive bid surfaced in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 14} The issue for our determination here, however, concerns whether the rate-stabilization plan conforms to the statutory requirements as set forth by the General Assembly in R.C. 4928.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 4928.14(A) provides: \u201cAfter its market development period, an electric distribution utility in this state shall provide customers, on a comparable and nondiscriminatory basis within its certified territory, a market-based standard service offer of all competitive retail electric services necessary to maintain essential electric services to consumers, including a firm supply of electric generation service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4928.14(B) provides: \u201cAfter that market development period, each electric distribution utility also shall offer customers within its certified territory an option to purchase competitive retail electric service the price of which is determined through a competitive bidding process.\u201d Significantly, the last sentence of R.C. 4928.14(B) provides, \u201cThe commission may determine at any time that a competitive bidding process is not required, <em>if other means to accomplish generally the same option for customers is readily available in the market and a reasonable means for customer participation is developed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 17} We recently decided <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, a case in which the parties stipulated to and the PUCO approved a pricing plan for the Dayton Power &amp; Light Company without a competitive-bidding process. There, Constellation NewEnergy argued that the PUCO violated R.C. 4928.14(B) by adopting an alternative to the statutorily mandated competitive bid. Id. at \u00b6 44. In that case, we stated that \u201c[t]he commission\u2019s finding that the stipulation, as a package, benefits ratepayers and the public was fully supported by the record and was reasonable and lawful.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49. The stipulation at issue in <em>Constellation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>contained the agreement of, among others, the staff of the PUCO, Dayton Power &amp; Light, and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, id. at \u00b6 4, and provided for (1) ongoing PUCO review of market-based rates, through a competitive-bidding process, if necessary, (2) termination by the PUCO if market-based rates did not reasonably reflect the rates established by the stipulation, and (3) the establishment of a voluntary-enrollment procedure that provided customers an option to select a marketer and a reasonable method to participate. Id. at \u00b6 48. We determined that the PUCO offered a convincing explanation of how the stipulation satisfied the alternatives to the competitive-bidding requirement of R.C. 4928.14(B). Id. at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 18} Here, FirstEnergy filed a rate-stabilization plan including a market-based standard service offer, and the PUCO approved it, noting that it accomplished the same goals as a competitive bid and that customers could reasonably participate in it. However, unlike the record in <em>Constellation, </em>the record here contains nothing to persuade us that a reasonable means for customer participation has been developed as required by R.C. 4928.14(B). The absence of a stipulation signed by customer groups factually distinguishes this case from <em>Constellation. </em>In <em>Constellation, </em>we also noted that \u201cno entire customer class was excluded\u201d from settlement negotiations and that the following classes were represented and signed the stipulation: residential customers, low-income customers, commercial customers, industrial customers, and competitive retail electric service providers. Id. at \u00b6 22-23. When it enacted R.C. 4928.14, the General Assembly anticipated that at the end of the market-development period, customers would be offered both a market-based standard service as required by R.C. 4928.14(A) <em>and </em>service at a price determined through a competitive-bidding process as required by R.C. 4928.14(B); one very narrow exception contained in R.C. 4928.14(B) permits the commission to determine that a competitive-bidding process is not required. In <em>Constellation, </em>the customer groups, by stipulation, agreed to accept a market-based standard service offer and waive any right to a price determined by competitive bid. Those facts are not present in this case. Rather, the PUCO itself made a unilateral decision to eliminate the offer to customers of a price determined through competitive bids as required by R.C. 4928.14(B). As FirstEnergy and the PUCO point out, R.C. 4928.14(B) states that the PUCO may dispense with a competitive-bidding process \u201cif other means to accomplish generally the same option for customers is readily available in the market and a reasonable means for customer participation is developed.\u201d They assert that the market is not yet fully developed to the point at which meaningful competitive bidding can take place and that the rate-stabilization plan accomplishes the same objectives. The rate-stabilization plan, however, does not allow for customer participation, which is mandated by statute and which the PUCO is not authorized to ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"AWjR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>{\u00b6 19} In contrast to the customer groups in <em>Constellation, </em>the customer groups here did not agree to the FirstEnergy rates, and most customer groups, including the OCC, which represents all residential customers, opposed them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the PUCO had no authority to adopt the rate-stabilization plan without also ensuring that a reasonable means for customer participation had been developed. While the PUCO has authority to dispense with a competitive-bidding process pursuant to R.C. 4928.14(B), if it does so, it must also ensure that \u201cother means to accomplish generally the same option for customers is readily available in the market <em>and [that] reasonable means for customer participation is developed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4928.14(B). Thus, in this case, the PUCO exceeded its statutory authority by approving a rate-stabilization plan that did not meet these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Rate-Stabilization Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 20} FirstEnergy includes a proposed rate-stabilization charge within its plan that the OCC maintains is a disguised generation-transition charge that may no longer be collected after December 31, 2005, pursuant to R.C. 4928.40. However, the evidence before the PUCO showed that, rather than a historically based charge to recover so-called stranded costs, the rate-stabilization charge was market-based and designed to serve a different function. June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 47, 50 (finding No. 11). The rate-stabilization charge is intended to compensate FirstEnergy for the cost of its commitment to supply generation service as the provider of last resort for 2006 through 2008. Id. at 22-23, 47. The PUCO found that the charge fairly and reasonably compensates FirstEnergy for its risks. As required by R.C. 4903.09, the PUCO\u2019s reasoning and the factual basis supporting approval of the rate-stabilization charge are easily discernible from its order. See, generally, <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 306, 311-312, 513 N.E.2d 337. The PUCO considered objections to the proposed charge and determined that it was not cost-based as the OCC and the government aggregators suggest. June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 23. It did, however, approve the amount only after modification of the rate-stabilization plan. Id. at 24. Accordingly, approval of the rate-stabilization charge is within the authority of the PUCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Shopping Credits</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 21} As part of its proposed rate-stabilization plan, FirstEnergy proposed shopping credits for 2006 through 2008, to which the OCC and governmental aggregators object. \u201cShopping credits are a deduction against [FirstEnergy\u2019s] own generation charges on the bills of customers who switch to a competitive supplier for their generation services.\u201d June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 28. Customers may also avoid paying a portion of the rate-stabilization charge if they commit to obtaining electric generation from another supplier. The credits are designed to encourage customer shopping for energy generation supplied by a competitive retail electric service. Id. at 28-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 22} Many residential consumers who shop obtain a shopping credit equal to FirstEnergy\u2019s generation rate. For other customers, the shopping credit is \u201cenhanced.\u201d If customers take service under a qualifying aggregation program, or if commercial or industrial customers meet certain qualifications, their credit includes, in addition to the proposed generation rate, a percentage of the rate-stabilization charge. June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 30-33. Different levels of shopping credits are granted depending on the length of the customer\u2019s contract with FirstEnergy\u2019s competitor. Specifically, residential customers whose aggregator obtains a three-year commitment by a stated deadline receive a shopping credit increased by 65 percent of the rate-stabilization charge for the first year, 75 percent for the second year, and 85 percent for the third year of the plan. Residential customers whose aggregator agrees not to return to FirstEnergy\u2019s generation service during the plan and who agree to pay market price if they do return receive a credit of 100 percent of the rate-stabilization charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 23} OCC and the governmental aggregators claim that these differing credits violate R.C. 4905.32, 4905.33, and 4905.35, and that they discriminate against customers who are not capable of being served by governmental aggregators. The PUCO, however, did modify FirstEnergy\u2019s plan, directing that nongovernmental aggregators be eligible for the same credit as governmental aggregators. June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 30-31. Furthermore, R.C. 4905.33 \u201c \u2018does not prohibit rate discrimination <em>per </em>se; rather, it prohibits charging different rates when the utility is performing \u201c * * * a like and contemporaneous service under substantially the same circumstances and conditions. * * * \u201d R.C. 4905.35 is to the same effect, and prohibits \u201c * * * unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage * * *.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>AK Steel Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 81, at 86-87, 765 N.E.2d 862, quoting <em>Mahoning Cty. Twps. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 40, 43-44, 12 O.O.3d 45, 388 N.E.2d 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 24} The statutes do not require uniformity in utility prices and rates. \u201cA reasonable differential or inequality of rates may occur where such differential is based upon some actual and measurable differences in the furnishing of services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to the consumer.\u201d <em>Mahoning Cty. Twps., </em>58 Ohio St.2d at 44, 12 O.O.3d 45, 388 N.E.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 25} It was reasonable for the PUCO to approve a provision allowing residential aggregation groups and commercial and industrial customers to qualify for larger credits against the rate-stabilization charge, since their agreeing to stay with a competitive supplier can greatly reduce FirstEnergy\u2019s provider-of-last-resort risk, for which the rate-stabilization charge compensates. In <em>Weiss v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 15, 734 N.E.2d 775, we rejected claims of discrimination pursuant to R.C. 4905.33 and 4905.35, holding that classification of customers based upon whether they had competitive alternatives for electric service was reasonable and lawful. We held that R.C. 4905.31, 4905.33, and 4905.35 do not prohibit all discrimination, preferences, or advantages. Id. at 16, 734 N.E.2d 775. When utility services are rendered under different circumstances or conditions, differences in prices are not proscribed by R.C. 4905.33. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, FirstEnergy\u2019s provider-of-last-resort risks are different for different customer groups. Rational distinctions between customers are permitted. <em>AK Steel; Mahoning Cty. Twps., </em>supra. The level of provider-of-last-resort risk that shopping customers impose on FirstEnergy determines how much, if any, of the rate-stabilization charge they will pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 27} Because the rate-stabilization charge relates to FirstEnergy\u2019s cost of planning to cover returning customers, it is reasonable that the residential aggregation groups, which significantly affect FirstEnergy\u2019s risks as provider of last resort, should qualify for credits to avoid these costs when they contract with another supplier. Since customer qualification for these shopping credits is based upon a rational distinction, there has been not violation of R.C. 4905.31, 4905.33, or 4905.35. We therefore affirm the PUCO\u2019s findings regarding proposition three.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Interest on Shopping-Credit Deferrals</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">{\u00b6 28} The governmental aggregators next challenge the portion of FirstEnergy\u2019s plan that allows for imposition of interest charges that were prohibited under a previous case. On July 19, 2000, the PUCO approved a stipulation and recommendation in FirstEnergy\u2019s transition-plan proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The governmental aggregators claim that the part of the rate-stabilization plan that allows interest on shopping-credit deferrals violates this stipulation, which cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>modified without consent. They also argue that collateral estoppel applies and that the PUCO has failed to respect precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">{\u00b6 29} OCC and the governmental aggregators rely on Section VIII(2) of the stipulation, which states, \u201cThe difference between the market support price, as reflected in Attachment 2, and the incentivized shopping credit, as reflected in Attachment 3, both as reflected in the respective tariff of the customers who shop times their kWh usage will be deferred as RTC and tracked as set forth below. <em>No interest charges will be capitalized on such deferrals.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 30} The stipulation, however, also provides, in Section V(2), that if more than a 20 percent shopping level is attained by the residential class of customers, the shopping-credit incentives <em>\u201cmay be adjusted in subsequent years as deemed appropriate by the Commission to minimize deferrals.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In considering the question of interest, the PUCO first noted that, even after the 20 percent shopping level had been reached, the PUCO had not adjusted shopping incentives to minimize deferrals, and, thus, the balance tipped in favor of encouraging shopping, at FirstEnergy\u2019s expense. As a result, the deferred-shopping-credit balance was over $500 million more than the amount contemplated at the time the stipulation was approved. June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 31} After reviewing the evidence, the PUCO determined that there was a need to balance the detrimental effect of large deferrals with the need for marketers to meet contractual responsibilities based on anticipated shopping-credit levels. Id. Therefore, rather than reducing shopping credits, which could reduce shopping, the PUCO decided to allow accrual of interest on the deferred-shopping-credit balance \u201cto minimize the impact of deferrals on FirstEnergy as authorized in the ETP [electric-transition plan].\u201d Id. Considering those circumstances, which differed from those anticipated at the time of the transition-plan stipulation, the PUCO\u2019s approval of the interest provision is reasonable. Moreover, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply, because the rate-stabilization plan dealt with different issues and time frames. We therefore affirm the PUCO\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Extension of Financial-Separation Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, the governmental aggregators argue that, by extending its waiver of the R.C. 4928.17(A) financial-separation requirement, the PUCO acted unlawfully and unreasonably. The extension relates to one of the two temporary waivers that the PUCO granted when it approved FirstEnergy\u2019s electric-transition plan. See ETP Order at 26-27. One waiver granted in that order related to requiring \u201cfinancial separation due to financial entanglements involving the generating assets of FirstEnergy.\u201d June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 40 (describing the earlier waivers). The second was a general waiver for wherever FirstEner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>gy\u2019s plan was not in exact compliance with the statutory or rule requirements regarding full structural separation. Id; ETP Order at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{133} R.C. 4928.17(C) expressly provides that the PUCO may issue an order approving a corporate-separation plan that does not comply with division (A)(1) of the statute but that \u201ccomplies with such functional separation requirements as the' commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed in the order\u201d upon a finding that such an alternative plan will continue to comply with R.C. 4928.02. Based upon the evidence, including testimony on the need for, and the effectiveness of, a modified separation plan, the PUCO found that FirstEnergy had established good cause to allow approval of an alternative functional-separation plan pursuant to R.C.' 4928.17(C) and reaffirmed that decision on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 34} As part of its proposed rate-stabilization plan, FirstEnergy sought to extend the two waivers granted in the electric-transition plan. The PUCO denied FirstEnergy\u2019s request for extension of the general corporate-separation waiver because of the breadth of the request and the lack of any specificity as to the areas of noncompliance. June 9, 2004 PUCO Opinion at 51 (finding No. 22). It explained, \u201cThe Commission cannot grant a waiver where the applicant has been unable to state the actual company process, program or function that requires the waiver.\u201d Id. at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 35} The PUCO did find it appropriate, however, to extend its waiver of the financial-separation requirement. Id. at 51 (finding No. 22). The PUCO found that lackluster economic conditions inhibited the retirement of debt associated with FirstEnergy\u2019s generating facilities. Id. This, in turn, prevented FirstEnergy from removing existing financial obligations that would allow it to divest these facilities. Id. at 40. The PUCO concluded: \u201cIn consideration of the economic conditions that inhibited the retirement of the debt associated with the facilities, FirstEnergy has shown good cause to extend the financial separation waiver.\u201d Id. at 51 (finding No. 22). Thus, the PUCO did not waive a statutory requirement, as OCC asserts. Rather, as permitted by R.C. 4928.17(C), the PUCO authorized a functional-separation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 36} The governmental aggregators argue that the PUCO\u2019s approval of the extension violates R.C. 4928.17(A) and grants FirstEnergy undue preference, unfair competitive advantage, and abusive market power. These arguments, however, suffer from a lack of specificity and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 37} The PUCO approved an extension of FirstEnergy\u2019s alternative functional-separation plan issued in the electric-transition plan upon a finding of good cause. Id. This is a factual determination, and this court has consistently refused to substitute its judgment for that of the PUCO on factual matters. <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util.

We recognize that the PUCO faces a market that has not fully developed as envisioned by the General Assembly; however, this does not empower the PUCO to create remedies outside the perimeters of the law. Therefore, because the PUCO approved the implementation of a rate-stabilization plan in this instance for the purchase of retail electric service, the price of which had not been determined through a competitive-bidding process, and made a unilateral decision to eliminate the offer to customers of a price determined through competitive bids without developing a reasonable means for customer participation, its actions fell outside the perimeters of R.C. 4928.14(B) and are, in that regard, unlawful. Accordingly, we are compelled to remand that portion of the decision for further consideration of this plan by the PUCO and its compliance with R.C. 4928.14(B).

I believe that <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util.

According to the majority, the commission-approved rate-stabilization plan does not comport with R.C. 4928.14(B) because no reasonable means for customer participation is ensured. The conclusion, however, departs from the precedent of <em>Constellation, </em>which the majority minimizes on the grounds that it involved consumers who stipulated away their right to a competitive-bid pricing plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 42} Yet in <em>Constellation, </em>we did more than simply consider a stipulation. In that case, the PUCO had approved a rate-stabilization plan for Dayton Power &amp; Light Company (\u201cDP &amp; L\u201d) similar to that proposed here by FirstEnergy, and DP &amp; L\u2019s competitor, Constellation NewEnergy, Inc., mounted the same type of legal challenge in that case as do the appellants in this case. Constellation argued that DP &amp; L\u2019s rate-stabilization plan \u201cunlawfully circumvents Section 4928.14(B), Revised Code, by adopting an alternative to the statutorily mandated competitive bid-out before the rules on competitive bid-out were adopted.\u201d <em>Constellation, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, at \u00b644. In other words, just as the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel (\u201cOCC\u201d) argues, Constellation had argued that the PUCO had no authority to approve a market-based standard-service offer without entering a competitive-bid process under R.C. 4928.14(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 43} In <em>Constellation, </em>this court was convinced that the stipulation setting forth DP <em>&amp; </em>L\u2019s plan complied with R.C. 4928.14(B). 104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, at \u00b6 46-49. We also determined that DP <em>&amp; </em>L\u2019s plan satisfied the competitive-bidding requirements of the statute because (1) the stipulation \u201c \u2018provides for ongoing Commission review of market-based rates, through a competitive bidding process, if necessary,\u2019 \u201d (2) the stipulation \u201c \u2018provides that, if market-based rates do not reasonably reflect the rates established by the Stipulation, then the Commission may terminate the RSP [rate-stabilization plan] and trigger a competitive bidding process,\u2019 \u201d and (3) \u201c \u2018the Voluntary Enrollment Procedure provides DP <em>&amp; </em>L customers the opportunity to choose any certified competitive retail supplier, thus providing customers with an option to select a marketer and a reasonable method to participate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Constellation, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 48, quoting the PUCO decision. Applying the appropriate standard of review, we held that the PUCO\u2019s approval of DP &amp; L\u2019s plan was reasonable and lawful. Id. at \u00b6 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 44} In short, we have previously affirmed a PUCO decision approving a rate-stabilization plan similar to the one the PUCO approved in this case. In fact, the PUCO\u2019s planned ongoing review of FirstEnergy\u2019s rate is actually better than its review in <em>Constellation, </em>for FirstEnergy\u2019s rate was already tested in a competitive bid and was found to be the lowest. Just as in <em>Constellation, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>commission reserved the ability to terminate the rate-stabilization plan if it appears that it no longer provides customers with market-based rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">{\u00b6 45} The PUCO, in its June 9, 2004 order, summarized its rationale and addressed pertinent statutes in approving FirstEnergy\u2019s proposed rate-stabilization plan: \u201cThe Commission finds that the procedure set forth in the RSP [rate-stabilization plan], as modified by the Commission, does provide consumers with market-based rates. Based upon the pricing information provided by various parties to this proceeding, we find that the Applicants\u2019 4.6 cents/kWh price for generation during 2006 through 2008 is a reasonable reflection of what market prices may be during that period. Additionally, the Commission has substantially limited the cost adjustments for generation service to those relating to taxes and for distribution service to those set forth in the existing ETP [electric-transition plan] settlement. More importantly, however, adequate safeguards are in place to allow the Commission to monitor the prices and confirm that, over time, those prices remain market-based and that consumers have adequate options for choosing among generation suppliers. Through this order, the Commission is directing that FirstEnergy undertake a CBP [competitive-bidding process] to ensure that customers receive the benefits of CBP rates should they be lower than rates established through a RSP. The RSP that we propose complies with the requirements of Section 4928.14, Revised Code. Section 4928.14, Revised Code, provides the Commission with flexibility in approving processes for determining market-based rates for the standard service offer. We find that, for FirstEnergy, the methodology for establishing a MBSSO [market-based standard-service offer] set forth in this order is reasonable. We also find that, by establishing the MBSSO with price monitoring, the RSP provides a reasonable alternative to a more traditional CBP, provides for a reasonable means of customer participation, and fulfills the requirements of Section 4928.14(B), Revised Code.\u201d <em>In re Applications of Ohio Edison Co., the Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. &amp; the Toledo Edison Co. for Authority to Continue &amp; Modify Certain Regulatory Accounting Practices &amp; Procedures, for Tariff Approval &amp; to Establish Rates &amp; Other Charges Including Regulatory Transition Charges Following the Market Dev. Period, </em>case No. 03-2144-EL-ATA, 2004 WL 1493955 (June 9, 2004) 45 (\u201cJune 9, 2004 Commission Opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">{\u00b6 46} With <em>Constellation </em>as clear precedent, it is baffling how the majority can find unlawful the PUCO\u2019s order approving FirstEnergy\u2019s rate-stabilization plan. No one specifically complains that the plan is deficient for lack of a reasonable means for customer participation pursuant to R.C. 4928.14(B). Yet without anyone arguing that the rate-stabilization plan fails to meet requirements for reasonable means for customer participation, the majority finds this to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{\u00b6 47} The majority says that \u201cthe record here contains nothing to persuade us that a reasonable means for customer participation has been developed as required by R.C. 4928.14(B)\u201d and continues by stating that \u201c[t]he absence of a stipulation signed by customer groups factually distinguishes this case from <em>Constellation.\u201d </em>Apparently, it believes that \u201ca reasonable means for customer participation [was] developed\u201d in <em>Constellation </em>because the rate was developed through negotiation among representatives of broad customer groups. The last sentence in R.C. 4928.14(B), however, is a prospective requirement: \u201cThe commission <em>may determine at any time that a competitive bidding process is not required, </em>if other means to accomplish generally the same option for customers is readily available in the market <em>and a reasonable means for customer participation is developed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) As it explained in its order, the commission did find both requirements satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 48} Contrary to the majority\u2019s implication, the existence of a stipulation in <em>Constellation </em>and the absence of a stipulation signed by customer groups from each class in this case does not mean that one provided \u201ca reasonable means for customer participation,\u201d as required by R.C. 4928.14(B), while the other did not. In <em>Constellation, </em>the commission found, and we agreed, that the stipulation included a \u201c \u2018Voluntary Enrollment Procedure [that] provides DP <em>&amp; </em>L customers the opportunity to choose any certified competitive retail supplier, thus providing customers with an option to select a marketer and a reasonable method to participate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Constellation, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 48, quoting the PUCO\u2019s decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 49} Likewise, in this case, the commission-modified rate-stabilization plan extends shopping credits and enhances them to encourage customers to select energy generation supplied by a competitive retail electric service. In addition, the commission further provides customers reasonable methods to participate by ordering (1) \u201c[t]hat FirstEnergy undertake a CBP [competitive-bidding process] consistent with this order and schedule a meeting with [its] staff and other interested parties to this proceeding to establish further requirements of the CBP\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]hat interested parties to this proceeding * * * meet to determine the best approach for billing shopping customers for retail transmission, net congestion, and ancillary services once the MDP [market-development period] has ended.\u201d The requirement that reasonable means for customer participation be developed does not depend on whether a broad-based customer stipulation exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 50} Finally, in acting on FirstEnergy\u2019s application, the PUCO did not act arbitrarily to eliminate an offer determined through competitive bids. In its decision, the PUCO reviewed an affidavit and the testimony of four witnesses regarding projected wholesale and retail prices for electric generation for 2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>through 2008 and then made specific findings with respect to both R.C. 4928.14(A), June 9, 2004 Commission Opinion at 44^45, and R.C. 4928.14(B), id. at 52 (finding No. 27). In summary, the PUCO acted as the General Assembly authorized it to do and in a way we had previously approved in <em>Constellation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 51} As was indicated by Chief Justice Moyer in writing for the court in <em>Constellation:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cR.C. 4903.13 provides that a PUCO order shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds the order to be unlawful or unreasonable. Under this statutory standard, this court will not reverse or modify a PUCO decision as to questions of fact when the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show that the PUCO\u2019s determination is not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and is not so clearly unsupported by the record that it shows misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. v.

The RSC is also anti-competitive in violation of R.C. 4928.17. In addition, the PUCO acted unlawfully in approving the RSC in that there is no basis in Ohio law for such a charge. The PUCO also approved the so-called RSCs as to what costs the charge was designed to recover and without evidence to justify the amount of the charge. The lack of evidentiary basis for the RSC violated R.C. 4903.09, which requires that, in contested cases, the PUCO\u2019s opinions be based upon findings of fact established on the record of an evidentiary hearing\u201d; (3) \u201cThe PUCO erred when it approved discriminatory treatment among the same class of residential customers by requiring some customers to pay the entire unlawful RSC while allowing other customers to avoid certain percentages of the unlawful RSC based upon the date at which the customers shopped and the entity with which they shopped.
