Oldaker II, appeals the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals denying his request for a writ of mandamus that would require appellee Industrial Commission to award him compensation for working wage loss. The court of appeals determined that the evidence in the record supported the commission\u2019s decision to deny Oldaker\u2019s application, because he failed to make a good-faith effort to search for comparably paying suitable employment when unable to return to his former position as a firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 2} We agree and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 3} On April 20, 2009, Oldaker was injured in the course and scope of his employment with the city of Columbus, Division of Fire. He had been with the fire division since 1987 and was a lieutenant at the time of his injury. His workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for sprained right knee, right-knee medial meniscus tear, and substantial aggravation of preexisting right-knee degenerative joint disease. He received temporary-total-disability compensation for a period of time. On January 25, 2012, the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund granted Oldaker\u2019s application for a partial-disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">{\u00b6 4} On April 30, 2012, Oldaker accepted a position as a deer-herd manager with Crosswoods Whitetails, L.L.C., a company owned by his wife that raises deer for breeding, hunting, and meat. Oldaker worked 35 hours a week at $9.50 an hour, earning approximately $332.50 a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">{\u00b6 5} On June 18, 2012, Oldaker applied to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for wage-loss compensation to partially compensate him for the difference between his average weekly wage as a firefighter and his lower earnings from Crosswoods. A commission staff hearing officer determined that Oldaker\u2019s current position was medically suitable work but that it was not comparably paying because his earnings of $322.50 a week in that position were far below his average weekly wage of $1,677.85 as a firefighter. The hearing officer noted that after a relatively brief job search, Oldaker did not continue a good-faith search for comparably paying work once he was hired by Crosswoods, despite his obligation under former Ohio Adm.Code 4125-l-01(D)(l)(c), 1996-1997 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Monthly Record 1992-1993, effective May 15,1997, to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hearing officer denied Oldaker\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 6} Oldaker filed this action in the Tenth District Court of Appeals seeking a writ of mandamus. The court of appeals denied the writ, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">Relator searched for comparably paying suitable work for a little more than one month before taking a low paying job with his wife\u2019s company, working out of their home. Relator stopped all efforts to search for comparably paying suitable work after taking the job with his wife\u2019s company. Given these undisputed facts, we find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying [working-wage-loss] compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-288, 2014-0hio-470, 2014 WL 546894, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 7} Oldaker\u2019s appeal as of right is before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 4123.56(B) provides for compensation for wage loss for persons unable to return to a former position of employment due to a workplace injury or occupational disease, but still able to do some work. If eligible, the injured worker may be entitled to receive a percentage of the difference between the prior and current income for up to 200 weeks. <em>See State ex rel. Ameen v. Indus. Comm., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 161, 2003-Ohio-5362, 797 N.E.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">{\u00b6 9} To be entitled to wage-loss compensation, the worker must demonstrate an actual wage loss caused by the allowed conditions of the claim. <em>State ex rel. Reamer v. Indus. Comm., </em>77 Ohio St.3d 450, 452, 674 N.E.2d 1384 (1997); <em>State ex rel. Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp., </em>68 Ohio St.3d 118, 121, 623 N.E.2d 1202 (1993). At the time of Oldaker\u2019s application, former Ohio Adm.Code 4125-1-01(C) and (D), 1996-1997 Ohio Monthly Record at 1991-1993, were the provisions that required him to provide evidence of having made a good-faith effort to search for comparably paying suitable work along with a physician\u2019s opinion of all medical restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cSuitable employment\u201d is work within the claimant\u2019s physical capabilities. Former Ohio Adm.Code 4125-1-01(A)(7), 1996-1997 Ohio Monthly Record at 1990. Employment is \u201ccomparably paying work\u201d if the claimant\u2019s weekly rate of pay is equal to or greater than the average weekly wage paid in the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>position. Former Ohio Adm.Code 4125-1-01(A)(8), 1996-1997 Ohio Monthly-Record at 1990. \u201cA good faith effort necessitates the claimant\u2019s consistent, sincere, and best attempts to obtain suitable employment that will eliminate the wage loss.\u201d Former Ohio Adm.Code 4125-l-01(D)(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 11} When a claimant\u2019s subsequent job is lower paying than the former position, it is subject to scrutiny to ensure that the actual wage loss is caused by allowed conditions of the claim and not simply a lifestyle choice. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Kaiser Found. Hosp. Cleveland, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 405, 406-407, 704 N.E.2d 570 (1999). Under these circumstances, we use a broad-based analysis that looks beyond mere wage loss when deciding whether the worker\u2019s failure to search for another job should be excused. <em>State ex rel. Timken Co. v. Kovach, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 21, 2003-Ohio-2450, 788 N.E.2d 1037, \u00b6 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 12} Oldaker contends that his Crosswoods job is comparably paying work despite the obvious disparity in wages. Oldaker relies on the vocational evaluation conducted for his disability retirement, which resulted in a report stating that his earning capacity had been significantly reduced after he left the fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 13} The commission, as the exclusive evaluator of disability and employability, was not required to rely on this vocational evidence, even if it was uncontra-dicted. <em>See State ex rel. Jackson v. Indus. Comm., </em>79 Ohio St.3d 266, 270-271, 680 N.E.2d 1233 (1997). Furthermore, the vocational-evaluation report does not fully support Oldaker\u2019s position, given that it included the statement that Oldaker had \u201cexpressed no interest in beginning a new career at this time and plans on working on a part time basis only if he has too [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 14} Oldaker also maintains that he was not required to continue his job search because his new job was full-time with the potential for future growth. <em>See State ex rel. Brinkman v. Indus. Comm., </em>87 Ohio St.3d 171, 174, 718 N.E.2d 897 (1999) (claimant\u2019s failure to continue his job search was excused after he obtained lucrative part-time work with a realistic possibility that it would become full-time). The commission concluded that unlike the situation in <em>Brinkman, </em>there was no evidence that Oldaker reasonably expected his new job to soon develop into comparably paying work and he therefore remained obligated to continue his job search.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 15} The evidence demonstrates that Oldaker failed to make \u201cconsistent, sincere, and best attempts to obtain suitable employment that will eliminate the wage loss\u201d as required by former Ohio Adm.Code 4125-l-01(D)(l)(c). He accepted a low-paying, entry-level job in the family business after a relatively brief search for other work. As related in the staff hearing officer\u2019s order, Oldaker told the hearing officer that he had not searched for work since his date of hire, stating, \u201c \u2018Why would I? I have a job.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Law Office of Thomas Tootle Co., L.P.A., and Thomas Tootle, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AuN\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Stephen D.
