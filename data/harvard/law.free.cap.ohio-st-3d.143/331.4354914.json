On April 7, 2014, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Costabile with professional misconduct after Costabile, the former mayor and safety director of Mayfield Heights, Ohio, was convicted of violating Ohio public-official financial-disclosure laws by failing to include on a 2005 financial-disclosure statement $100,000 that he received as income from Hidden Woods, L.L.C., and by failing to include on a 2010 financial-disclosure statement the amount of income he received from Seagull Development Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Scott J. Drexel, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOa\">Richard C. Alkire Co., L.P.A., and Richard C. Alkire, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">{\u00b6 3} In the consent-to-discipline agreement, Costabile stipulates to the facts alleged in relator\u2019s complaint and agrees that his conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulate that the mitigating factors include the absence of a prior disciplinary record, Costabile\u2019s cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, evidence of his good character and reputation, and the imposition of other penalties and sanctions as a result of his criminal conviction. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), (e), and (f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties agree that there are no aggravating factors. Based upon Costabile\u2019s stipulated misconduct and these factors, the parties stipulate that the appropriate sanction is a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 5} The panel and board found that the consent-to-discipline agreement conforms to BCGD Proc.Reg. 11 and recommend that we adopt the agreement in its entirety. In support of its recommendation, the panel refers to <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Taft, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 155, 2006-Ohio-6525, 858 N.E.2d 414 (a public reprimand was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who violated public-official financial-reporting requirements), and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gwinn, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 167, 2014-Ohio-101, 4 N.E.3d 1039 (a public reprimand was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who violated election-law disclosure requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 6} We agree that Costabile violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) and that this conduct warrants a public reprimand. Therefore, we adopt the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 7} Accordingly, Gregory Steven Costabile is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs are taxed to Costabile.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-14\">.
