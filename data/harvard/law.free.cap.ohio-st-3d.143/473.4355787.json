Sheets sued in mandamus on November 7, 2014, in the Sixth District Court of Appeals, alleging that respondent failed to provide the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee filed no response to the complaint, but on December 2, 2014, the court of appeals nevertheless dismissed the case, finding that Sheets failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25(C)(2), which requires that an inmate\u2019s affidavit of indigency in a suit against a government entity or employee contain a statement of the inmate\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">{\u00b6 3} Sheets argues in his brief that R.C. 2969.25(C) should not apply to him because he is not filing a civil action against a government entity or employee. However, Sheets also asserts in his complaint that appellee is \u201ca governmental employee,\u201d that he \u201cperforms a governmental function,\u201d and that he \u201coperates on behalf of the state.\u201d Sheets\u2019s arguments are therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">{\u00b6 4} However, the definition of \u201cinmate\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2969.25 is \u201ca person who is in actual confinement in a <em>state </em>correctional institution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2969.21(D). The definition does not include persons in confinement in federal prison. <em>Id. </em>Sheets is an inmate in a federal prison, not a state prison. For that reason, the court of appeals erred in dismissing Sheets\u2019s complaint for failing to comply with R.C. 2969.25.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9hq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Daniel Sheets, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">{\u00b6 5} We therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b596-6\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
