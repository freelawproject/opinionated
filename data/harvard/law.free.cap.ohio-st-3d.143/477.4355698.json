We hold that the 12-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.111(C), which pertains to actions brought by victims of childhood sexual abuse, rather than the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2743.16(A), which pertains to civil actions filed against the state, applies to such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Uranus Watkins, was born on August 1, 1986. Watkins alleges that between April 2, 2000, and April 2, 2001, two employees of the Department of Youth Services sexually abused her while she was in custody at the Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility in Delaware, Ohio. Moreover, she alleges that the Department of Youth Services negligently and recklessly failed to sufficiently investigate acts of pedophilia despite its knowledge of abuse, it failed to follow or implement procedures to prevent sexual abuse, and it failed to protect th\u00e9 residents from sexual abuse. In addition, she asserts that by hiring and retaining the two employees, the Department of Youth Services negligently and recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress on her and breached a fiduciary duty to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 3} On July 31, 2012, Watkins filed a complaint in the Ohio Court of Claims against the Department of Youth Services (\u201cDYS\u201d) and the two employees. The court dismissed the two employees from the suit because, pursuant to R.C. 2743.02(E), only state agencies and their instrumentalities can be sued in that court. DYS moved to dismiss the complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), asserting that Watkins\u2019s complaint was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for civil actions against the state set forth in R.C. 2743.16(A). The court granted the motion and dismissed the action, holding that Watkins\u2019s claims were barred by R.C. 2743.16(A) because she filed her complaint more than two years after reaching the age of majority. The court explained that \u201cit is well-settled that the limitations period set forth in R.C. 2743.16(A) applies to all actions against the state in the Court of Claims and takes precedence over all other statutes of limitation in the Revised Code.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Dept. of Youth Servs., </em>Ct. of Cl. No. 2012-05851 (Sept. 18, 2012), at 2, citing <em>Cargile v. Ohio Dept. of Adm. Servs., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-743, 2012-Ohio-2470, 2012 WL 1997701, \u00b6 12; <em>Simmons v. Ohio Rehab. Servs. Comm., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 09AP-1034, 2010-Ohio-1590, 2010 WL 1408236, \u00b6 6; <em>Grenga v. Youngstown State Univ., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-165, 2011-Ohio-5621, 2011 WL 5185536, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 4} Watkins appealed, and the Tenth District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of Claims, stating that \u201cR.C. 2743.16 does not provide for the tolling of the statute of limitations through the operation of R.C. 2305.111.\u201d <em>U.W. v. Dept. of Youth Servs., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-959, 2013-Ohio-1779, 2013 WL 1838676, at \u00b6 5. The court wrote that \u201cthe statutory framework enacted when the State of Ohio partially waived governmental immunity has not been amended to allow any claims to be pursued against the State of Ohio more than two years after the claims accrued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 5} Watkins appealed to this court, asserting in her sole proposition of law that \u201c[t]he appellate court erred in sustaining the trial court\u2019s decision dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the plaintiffs claims pursuant to [Civ.R.] 12(B)(6) because the plaintiffs claims are not conclusively time-barred by the statute of limitations of a sex abuse action.\u201d The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 6} Watkins raises two arguments. First, she argues that the General Assembly intended R.C. 2305.111 to apply to all claims of childhood sexual abuse, whether the tortfeasor was a private or governmental actor. Second, she argues that if the General Assembly did intend that a separate, shorter statute of limitations should apply to claims against the state arising from childhood sexual abuse, such disparate treatment of victims violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 7} We conclude as a matter of statutory interpretation that the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.111(C) applies to claims against both public and private tortfeasors. Accordingly, we decline to address Watkins\u2019s constitutional argument; \u201cwhen a case can be decided on other than a constitutional basis, we are bound to do so.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Crabtree v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>71 Ohio St.3d 504, 507, 644 N.E.2d 361 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">\n<em>Statutes of Limitations for Claims of Childhood Sexual Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Ault v. Jasko, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 114, 637 N.E.2d 870 (1994), this court addressed the statute of limitations for sexual-abuse claims in cases where victims of childhood sexual abuse repressed memories of that abuse. This court held that the discovery rule applied in such cases. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, we further held that \u201c[t]he one-year statute of limitations period for sexual abuse in Ohio begins to run when the victim recalls or otherwise discovers that he or she was sexually abused, or when, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, the victim should have discovered the sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">{\u00b6 9} The statute of limitations itself was just one year. This court had held in <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 531, 629 N.E.2d 402 (1994), paragraph one of the syllabus, that a \u201ccause of action premised upon acts of sexual abuse is subject to the one-year statute of limitations for assault and battery\u201d as set forth in former R.C. 2305.111. But under the discovery rule, the cause of action accrued when a victim of childhood sexual abuse discovers that he or she was abused, so the one-year statute of limitations could be tolled for many years. The statute of limitations, tempered by the discovery rule, applied to claims against public as well as private actors, since R.C. 2743.16(A) mandates the use of shorter limitations periods when applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 10} In 2006, the General Assembly passed Am.Sub.S.B. No. 17 (\u201cS.B. 17\u201d), which substantially rewrote R.C. 2305.111, setting a firm accrual date as the date on which the victim attains the age of majority for claims based on childhood sexual abuse, but also greatly expanding the limitations period for such claims to 12 years. 151 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1108, 1127-1129. R.C. 2305.111(C), which contains those changes, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">An action for assault or battery brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse based on childhood sexual abuse, or an action brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse asserting any claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse, <em>shall be brought within twelve years after the cause of action accrues. </em>For purposes of this section, a cause of action for assault or battery based on childhood sexual abuse, or a cause of action for a claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse, <em>accrues upon the date on which the victim reaches the age of majority.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>Pratte v. Stewart, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 473, 2010-Ohio-1860, 929 N.E.2d 415, \u00b6 56, this court acknowledged that the General Assembly was likely responding to <em>Ault </em>in enacting the changes to R.C. 2305.111:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">We can reasonably infer that the General Assembly considered repressed memory by increasing the limitations period for claims of childhood sexual abuse from one year to 12 years. It is further reasonable to infer that the legislature was reacting to Ault\u2019s adoption of a discovery rule for repressed memory in enacting R.C. 2305.111(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 12} The question we face in this case is whether the General Assembly, in enacting S.B. 17, intended to change the statute of limitations only for claims against private citizens and not for claims against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">\n<em>Statute of Limitations for Claims Against the State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">{\u00b6 13} We consider that question by first taking into account R.C. 2743.16(A), which provides that \u201ccivil actions against the state permitted by sections 2743.01 to 2743.20 of the Revised Code shall be commenced <em>no later than two years after the date of accrual of the cause of action </em>or within any shorter period that is applicable to similar suits between private parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Certainly, R.C. 2305.03(A) provides the legislative authority for the state to opt out of the statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.111. R.C. 2305.03(A) states that <em>\u201cunless a different limitation is prescribed by statute, </em>a civil action may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>commenced only within the period prescribed in sections 2305.04 to 2305.22 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 14} By prescribing the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2743.16(A) for civil actions against the state, did the General Assembly intend to exempt the state from R.C. 2305.111(C)?</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Application of R.C. 2305.111(C) to Claims Against the State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 15} In S.B. 17, the General Assembly made it clear that R.C. 2305.111 applies without limitation to all civil actions filed on or after August 3, 2006, the effective date of the act. The bill not only amended R.C. 2305.111, but also amended R.C. 2305.10(E) to read, \u201cAn action brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse asserting <em>any </em>claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse, as defined in section 2305.111 of the Revised Code, shall be brought as provided in division (C) of that section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 1127. We read that sentence as starkly as it is written, i.e., that <em>any </em>claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse as statutorily defined \u2014 without exception and without regard to whether the tortfeasor was a private or state actor \u2014 must be brought as provided in R.C. 2305.111(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 16} Further, uncodified Section 3(B) of S.B. 17 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">The amendments to section 2305.111 of the Revised Code made in this act shall apply to <em>all </em>civil actions for assault or battery brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse based on childhood sexual abuse * * * [and] to <em>all </em>civil actions brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse for a claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">(Emphasis added.) 151 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1181. Again in that section, the General Assembly allows for no distinction between public and private tortfea-sors: R.C. 2305.111(C) applies to <em>all </em>claims. \u201cAny\u201d means any, and \u201call\u201d means all.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">{\u00b6 17} Moreover, by including the conduct of state actors in R.C. 2305.111\u2019s definition of childhood sexual abuse, the state has manifested its intent that claims against state actors are governed by the 12-year limitations period set forth in division (C) of that statute. For example, one of the forms of childhood sexual abuse defined in R.C. 2305.111(A) is sexual imposition or gross sexual imposition committed in certain specified circumstances. R.C. 2305.111(A)(1)(b). One of those circumstances occurs when \u201c[t]he victim is confined in a detention facility, and the actor is an employee of that detention facility.\u201d R.C. 2305.111(A)(l)(b)(vii). Detention-facility workers are often state employees. R.C. 2305.111(A)(1)(a) further defines childhood sexual abuse as including viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>tions of R.C. 2907.03, sexual battery. R.C. 2907.03(A) defines the crime of sexual battery as sexual conduct with another when certain factors apply, including when \u201c[t]he other person is confined in a detention facility, and the offender is an employee of that detention facility.\u201d R.C. 2907.03(A)(11). In addition to the acts of detention-facility workers, R.C. 2305.111 also applies to acts committed by other persons who could be employees of the state, e.g., teachers, coaches, administrators, and authority figures in schools and institutions of higher education, R.C. 2305.111(A)(l)(b)(iii) and (b)(iv). State actors might also have authority over persons who are \u201cin custody of law,\u201d another category of victim subject to the 12-year limitations period for claims of childhood sexual abuse. R.C. 2305.111(A)(l)(b)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">{\u00b6 18} Thus, the very definition of childhood sexual abuse includes the wrongful conduct of state employees. The plain language of R.C. 2305.111 reveals the legislature\u2019s intent that claims against the state resulting from childhood sexual abuse are subject to a 12-year statute of limitations and an accrual date of the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\n<em>Resolution of Conflict Between Statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 19} The statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.111 thus conflicts with the statement in R.C. 2743.16(A) that \u201ccivil actions against the state * * * shall be commenced no later than two years after the date of accrual of the cause of action or within any shorter period that is applicable to similar suits between private parties.\u201d However, \u201c[ujtilizing the rules of statutory construction contained in R.C. 1.12, 1.51, and 1.52, a specific statute, enacted later in time than a preexisting general statute, will control where a conflict between the two arises.\u201d <em>Davis v. State Personnel Bd. of Rev., </em>64 Ohio St.2d 102, 105, 413 N.E.2d 816 (1980). R.C. 2305.111(C), enacted in 2006, is a more recent statute than R.C. 2743.16(A), which was first enacted in 1975, 135 Ohio Laws, Part II, 869, 878, and took its essentially current form in 1977, 137 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1950, 1956-1957. R.C. 2305.111(C) is also more specific \u2014 it sets forth a limitations period that applies to only one category of civil actions, those resulting from childhood sexual abuse, whereas R.C. 2743.16(A) applies broadly to \u201ccivil actions against the state.\u201d Thus, as the more recent and more specific enactment, R.C. 2305.111(C) provides the limitations period for claims against the state resulting from childhood sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>Whether the Statute of Limitations on Watkins\u2019s Claims Expired Before the Enactment of S.B. 17</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 20} One more issue remains to be addressed: whether the statute of limitations for Watkins\u2019s claims had expired by August 3, 2006, the effective date of S.B. 17. This issue was not considered by the trial court or the appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>because each held that R.C. 2743.16(A) was the appropriate statute of limitations for claims involving sexual abuse committed by state actors. R.C. 2305.111(C) is retroactive, but includes within its reach only claims for which the former statute of limitations had not expired prior to the effective date of S.B. 17. <em>Pratte, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 473, 2010-Ohio-1860, 929 N.E.2d 415, \u00b6 43. Thus, R.C. 2305.111(C) applies to Watkins\u2019s claims only if the statute of limitations in place before S.B. 17 had not expired prior to August 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 21} Watkins turned 18 years old on August 1, 2004. Prior to S.B. 17, the statute of limitations for assault and battery was one year. Former R.C. 2305.111, 2002 S.B. No. 9, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1241, 1242. Thus, if Watkins\u2019s claims accrued on her 18th birthday, the statute of limitations on those claims would have expired on August 1, 2005, well before the August 3, 2006 effective date of S.B. 17. However, as we acknowledged in <em>Pratte, </em>under the former statute, the discovery rule determined the accrual date of a cause of action rooted in sexual assault. The plaintiff in <em>Pratte </em>was allegedly abused in 1984 and turned 18 years old in 1992, but due to repressed memories, she did not discover that she had been abused until 2007. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5-6. Thus, the limitations period under the former statute had not expired by the time S.B. 17 was enacted in 2006, and the plaintiffs claims were subject to the 12-year statute of limitations and accrual date of the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">{\u00b6 22} Which statute of limitations is applicable to Watkins\u2019s claims depends on when she discovered that she had been sexually abused. In her brief, Watkins claims that when S.B. 17 was enacted, \u201cshe had not yet discovered her abuse.\u201d Due to the procedural posture of the ease \u2014 dismissal on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion based on the supposed applicability of R.C. 2743.16(A) and without the development of a record \u2014 the question of when Watkins discovered her abuse has not been litigated. It may turn out that R.C. 2305.111(C) does not apply to Watkins\u2019s claims \u2014 not because the abuse was committed by a state actor but because her claims had expired before the effective date of S.B. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2305.111(C) is the statute of limitations for claims against the state resulting from childhood sexual abuse. The appellate court erred in holding that a claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse cannot be pursued against the state more than two years after the claim accrued. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals and remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Kilbane and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and French, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b606-4\">Mary Eileen Kilbane, J., of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting for Lanzinger, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b606-5\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AN0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 24} Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 25} The two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2743.16(A) pertaining to all civil actions filed against the state applies to the sexual abuse claims filed against the state in this case and dictates the outcome of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 2305.111(C) provides a general 12-year statute of limitations for an action for assault or battery brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse, or an action brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse asserting any claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 27} Although R.C. 2305.03(A) provides that a civil action may be commenced only within the period prescribed in R.C. 2305.04 to 2305.22, it contains a conditional clause and thereby creates an exception to the specified statute of limitations by stating, <em>\u201cunless a different limitation is prescribed by statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 2743.16(A) prescribes a two-year statute of limitations for civil actions filed against the state. Thus, this statute prescribes a different statute of limitations for claims filed against the state. R.C. 2305.03(A) and R.C. 2743.16(A) are to be read in pari materia, and that process dictates that R.C. 2743.16(A) controls. R.C. 2305.111(A)(1)(b) lists a broad range of childhood sexual abuse that is subject to a 12-year statute of limitations, but the smaller class of childhood sexual abuse cases filed against the state is subject to a two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">{\u00b6 29} The majority declines to address Watkins\u2019s equal protection claim, concluding that Watkins\u2019s claim need not be reached. Majority opinion at \u00b6 7. However, R.C. 2743.16(A) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because there is a rational basis for providing a two-year limitations period for childhood sexual abuse claims brought against the state \u2014 the timely discovery of childhood sexual abusers and the conservation of public resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, Watkins filed her childhood sexual abuse claim against the Department of Youth Services with the Court of Claims on July 31, 2012 \u2014 the day before her 26th birthday \u2014 and more than two years after she had reached the age of majority. By operation of law, that claim is time barred because R.C. 2743.16(A) is the two-year statute of limitations for all claims filed against the state. Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AR8h\">\n<em>Statutes of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 31} In accordance with R.C. 2743.02(A)(1), the state \u201cwaives its immunity from liability * * * and consents to be sued, and have its liability determined, in the court of claims created in this chapter in accordance with the same rules of law applicable to suits between private parties, <em>except that the determination of liability is subject to the limitations set forth in this chapter </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 32} One of those limitations is set forth in R.C. 2743.16(A), which provides that \u201ccivil actions against the state permitted by sections 2743.01 to 2743.20 of the Revised Code shall be commenced <em>no later than two years after the date of accrual of the cause of action </em>or within any shorter period that is applicable to similar suits between private parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By including a two-year statute of limitations period for claims brought against the state within R.C. Chapter 2743, the General Assembly evidenced its intent that the two-year limitations period prevail over other longer limitations applicable to claims against private parties. <em>See Simmons v.

We rejected this argument, explaining that \u201cR.C. 2125.04 does not implicate this right because, on its face, it addresses only the right to refile a wrongful death lawsuit. It does not address the parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that the right of a parent to sue for a child\u2019s wrongful death \u201cis not a fundamental right that merits strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 50} Although Watkins asserts that this case involves the fundamental right of privacy, R.C. 2743.16(A) does not implicate this right, because it pertains to the right to bring a civil action against the state, which is not a fundamental right. <em>See Conley, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 290-291, 595 N.E.2d 862, (\u201cthere is no fundamental right to sue the state or its employees\u201d); <em>see also Eppley </em>at \u00b6 16 (saving statute for wrongful death addresses only the right to refile a lawsuit; it does not implicate the fundamental right of parents to a relationship with their child). Thus, R.C. 2743.16(A) is subject to rational basis analysis rather than strict scrutiny review. <em>See Conley </em>at 289, quoting <em>State ex rel. Heller v.

Queen City Metro, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 27, 29, 550 N.E.2d 181 (1990), and <em>Fabrey </em>at 353. Accordingly, applying the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2743.16(A) to actions brought against the state involving childhood sexual abuse does not violate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 54} The General Assembly has specifically expressed its intent that the two-year statute of limitations for civil actions brought against the state takes precedence over the longer statute of limitations applicable to suits brought against private parties. Because R.C. 2743.16(A) prescribes a two-year statute of limitations for claims brought against the state, it falls within the exception to R.C. 2305.111(C) set forth in R.C. 2305.03(A) as a different limitation prescribed by statute. Also, R.C. 2743.16(A) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, as there is a rational basis for providing a two-year limitations period for civil actions arising out of childhood sexual abuse that are brought against the state. Unlike the majority, I would therefore conclude that R.C. 2743.16(A) governs claims involving childhood sexual abuse against the state in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 55} Because in this case Watkins filed her complaint alleging childhood sexual abuse against the Department of Youth Services in the Court of Claims more than two years after she reached the age of majority, her claims against the state are time barred pursuant to R.C. 2743.16(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 56} For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b613-10\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-11\">French, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">{\u00b6 57} I respectfully dissent. With respect to its discussion of the statute of hmitations that applies to sexual-abuse claims filed against the state, I join <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Justice O\u2019Donnell\u2019s dissenting opinion. The two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2743.16(A) applies to all civil actions filed against the state, unless a shorter limitations period applies to similar suits between private parties. Although R.C. 2305.111(C) establishes a 12-year statute of limitations for an action for assault or battery brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse, or an action brought by a victim of childhood sexual abuse asserting any claim resulting from childhood sexual abuse, the two-year statute of limitations applies when such claims are asserted against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 58} That result is evident from not only the plain language of R.C. 2743.16(A), but also the plain language of R.C. 2305.03(A), which states that a civil action may be commenced only within the period prescribed in R.C. 2305.04 to 2305.22, \u201cunless a different limitation is prescribed by statute.\u201d Here, a different limitation is prescribed by R.C. 2743.16(A), and that ends the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 59} I nevertheless dissent separately because I would not address the equal-protection challenge that appellant, Uranus Watkins, raises in her merit brief. Watkins argues that application of the R.C. 2743.16(A) two-year statute of limitations to plaintiffs suing the state violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection when the same claims against private entities would be subject to a 12-year statute of limitations. As Justice O\u2019Donnell notes, Watkins did not raise an equal-protection argument in the Court of Claims. Although Watkins did make a perfunctory equal-protection argument before the Tenth District Court of Appeals, that court did not address that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 60} Courts decide constitutional issues only when absolutely necessary. <em>State ex rel. Essig v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 481, 2004-Ohio-5586, 817 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 34, quoting <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 1, 7, 716 N.E.2d 1114 (1999). A constitutional challenge to a statute not raised in the trial court is waived, and an appellate court need not address that issue. <em>Gibson v. Meadow Gold Dairy, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 201, 204, 724 N.E.2d 787 (2000), citing <em>State v. Awan, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 120, 489 N.E.2d 277 (1986). Not only did Watkins not raise an equal-protection challenge in the Court of Claims, she has not raised an equal-protection challenge in a proposition of law before this court; her sole proposition of law states that her claims are not time-barred by the statute of limitations for claims of childhood sexual abuse. In light of Watkins\u2019s failure to raise an equal-protection challenge in the Court of Claims, it was not necessary for the court of appeals to address the equal-protection question, nor is it necessary for this court to opine on the constitutionality of applying the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2743.16(A) to Watkins\u2019s claims.
