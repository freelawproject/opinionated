We accepted the following propositions of law from appellant city of Toledo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">1. Neither R.C. \u00a7 1901.20 nor Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1 are offended when a home rule municipality enacts, by ordinance, a civil administrative process for photo enforcement of speed and red light violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">2. R.C. \u00a7 1901.20 does not confer exclusive jurisdiction over civil administrative violations of municipal codes to municipal courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">{\u00b6 2} We also accepted a proposition of law from appellant Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc., which asserts: \u201cOhio municipalities have the home-rule authority to maintain pre-suit administrative proceedings, including conducting administrative hearings, in furtherance of their civil traffic enforcement ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">{\u00b6 3} We reaffirm our holding in <em>Mendenhall v. Akron, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, that municipalities have home-rule authority under Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution to impose civil liability on traffic violators through an administrative enforcement system. We also hold that Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1, which authorizes the legislature to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>municipal courts, and R.C. 1901.20, which sets the jurisdiction of municipal courts, do not endow municipal courts with exclusive authority over civil administrative enforcement of traffic-law violations. Finally, we hold that Ohio municipalities have home-rule authority to establish administrative proceedings, including administrative hearings, related to civil enforcement of traffic ordinances, and that these administrative proceedings must be exhausted before offenders or the municipality can pursue judicial remedies. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 4} This case comes to us as an appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). \u201cIn construing a complaint upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, we must presume that all factual allegations of the complaint are true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co., </em>40 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 532 N.E.2d 753 (1988). Therefore, the facts are accepted as true as presented in appellee\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 5} In 2008, the city of Toledo enacted Toledo Municipal Code (\u201cTMC\u201d) 313.12, authorizing an automated traffic-law-enforcement system that assesses civil penalties against a vehicle\u2019s owner for speeding and red-light violations. The enforcement apparatus includes a camera and a vehicle sensor and automatically produces photos, video, or digital images of vehicles violating these traffic laws. TMC 313.12(b)(1). Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc., provides the equipment and shares the revenue with Toledo.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 6} Toledo transportation officials, as well as Toledo\u2019s police and law departments, administer the program. TMC 313.12(a)(2). When the Redflex equipment records a traffic violation, the city forwards a notice of liability to the vehicle\u2019s registered owner advising that a civil penalty of $120 has been assessed against him or her. TMC 313.12(a)(3)(B) and 313.12(d)(1) and (2). The notice of liability is not a criminal citation; it is a notice of civil liability and has no collateral consequences, such as the assignment of points against the owner\u2019s driver\u2019s license. TMC 313.12(c)(5) and 313.12(d)(1) and (2). The notice states that the owner must pay or file an appeal within 21 days of the date listed on the notice. TMC 313.12(a)(3)(C) and 313.12(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 7} Failure to pay or appeal within that period is deemed a waiver of the right to contest liability and is considered an admission. TMC 313.12(d)(4). If an owner appeals, an administrative hearing is held, and if the owner offers evidence to show the hearing officer that he or she was not driving the vehicle when the violation occurred, the owner will not be held responsible for the violation. TMC 313.12(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Under TMC 313.12(d)(4), appeals are heard through an administrative process established by the Toledo police department. That provision adds that a \u201cdecision in favor of the City of Toledo may be enforced by means of a civil action or any other means provided by the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2506.01 provides the mechanism for further appeal. It states, \u201c[E]very * * * decision of any officer * * * of any political subdivision of the state may be reviewed by the court of common pleas of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision is located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 10} Bradley Walker, appellee, received a notice of liability for a traffic violation under TMC 313.12, and he paid the city $120, without pursuing an administrative appeal. He then filed a class-action complaint against Toledo and Redflex for unjust enrichment, seeking their disgorgement of all civil penalties. The complaint asserted that TMC 313.12 is unconstitutional because it usurps the jurisdiction of the municipal court, is unconstitutionally vague, and violates due process. Appellants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 11} Walker appealed, and in a split decision, the Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed, holding that TMC 313.12 is an unconstitutional violation of Article IV, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution (\u201cThe judicial power of the state is vested in a supreme court, courts of appeals, courts of common pleas and divisions thereof, and such other courts inferior to the supreme court as may from time to time be established by law\u201d). The court held that without the express approval of the General Assembly, Toledo had divested the Toledo Municipal Court of the power granted to it by the legislature in R.C. 1901.20. That statute states that a \u201cmunicipal court has jurisdiction of the violation of any ordinance of any municipal corporation within its territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 12} The Sixth District also held that because the case was on appeal from a trial court\u2019s granting of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, Walker\u2019s allegation in his complaint that Toledo had never established an administrative appeal process must be accepted as true. Because Walker alleged that Toledo had offered him no notice and meaningful opportunity to be heard, the court of appeals said that Walker\u2019s due-process allegation survived the motion to dismiss. Toledo and Reflex appealed on the issue whether Toledo\u2019s civil administrative enforcement of its traffic ordinances violates the Ohio Constitution or R.C. 1901.20, and we accepted jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\n<em>A. A city\u2019s enacting an ordinance providing for civil administrative enforcement of traffic offenses does not violate the Ohio Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 13} We agree with appellants that a city\u2019s enacting an ordinance providing for a civil administrative enforcement of traffic laws does not offend R.C. 1901.20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>or Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1. We have already held that municipalities act within their constitutional home-rule powers when they establish automated systems for imposing civil liability on traffic-law violators. <em>Mendenhall v. Akron, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, syllabus. Walker invokes R.C. 1901.20 and Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1 to assert that TMC 313.12 impairs the Toledo Municipal Court\u2019s constitutionally protected jurisdiction over violations of local ordinances. However, this argument is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Mendenhall </em>and does not cause us to reconsider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 14} The facts of <em>Mendenhall </em>are instructive. After a child was killed in a hit-and-run accident in a school crosswalk, Akron passed an ordinance implementing an \u201cautomated mobile speed enforcement system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. According to the Akron City Council, the statute\u2019s purpose was to \u201c \u2018assist the Akron Police Department by alleviating the need for conducting extensive conventional traffic enforcement in and around school zones.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. The ordinance created a system that was purely civil in nature and did not modify any state speed limits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. Violators received notices of civil liability and could pay the civil fines or pursue an administrative appeal. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7-8. Kelly Mendenhall received a notice of liability for speeding, which was dismissed on administrative appeal. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10. Like Walker, Mendenhall filed a class-action suit against the municipality for a declaratory judgment, an injunction, and a monetary award. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. Mendenhall asserted that the Akron ordinance conflicted with Ohio\u2019s general laws regulating traffic, thereby exceeding Akron\u2019s home-rule authority and violating due process. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 15} The case was removed to federal court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, then certified to us the following issue pursuant to S.CtJPrac.R. XVIII (now S.Ct.Prac.R. 9.01): \u201cWhether a municipality has the power under home rule to enact civil penalties for the offense of violating a traffic signal light or for the offense of speeding, both of which are criminal offenses under the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 16} After examining this question, we issued \u201ca written opinion stating the law governing the question or questions certified.\u201d S.Ct.Prac.R. 9.08. We first analyzed a municipality\u2019s powers granted under Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3. It states, \u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d Section 7 of Article XVIII complements Section 3. It states, \u201cAny municipality may frame and adopt or amend a charter for its government and may, subject to the provisions of section 3 of this article, exercise thereunder all powers of local self-government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>{\u00b6 17} We then concluded: \u201c[Akron\u2019s] ordinance provides for a complementary system of civil enforcement that, rather than decriminalizing behavior, allows for the administrative citation of vehicle owners under specific circumstances. Akron has acted within its home rule authority granted by the Constitution of Ohio.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 42. We therefore reject Walker\u2019s claim that in creating a civil administrative traffic-law-enforcement system that is similar to the system set forth in the Akron ordinance at issue in <em>Mendenhall, </em>Toledo has unconstitutionally usurped the General Assembly\u2019s exclusive power to create courts under Article IV, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 18} Walker nevertheless counters that Article XVIII, Sections 3 and 7 of the Ohio Constitution do not authorize home-rule power in the area of administrative review of civil liability for traffic-law offenses unless the General Assembly specifically authorizes such administrative processes through statute. The Sixth District Court of Appeals found this point persuasive and noted that while many local boards review municipal-ordinance violations, \u201cmost\u201d of them do so under specific enabling authority from the General Assembly, and not under Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII alone. 2013-0hio-2809, 994 N.E.2d 467, \u00b6 35 (6th Dist.). Appellants concede that the General Assembly has not enacted statutes specifically authorizing municipalities to adopt civil traffic-law-enforcement ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 19} As Redflex emphasizes, however, \u201cmost\u201d is not all. Municipal taxi-cab review boards set licensing requirements, hold hearings, and review violations without specific statutory authority. Redflex notes that Columbus has a \u201crefuse-collection code,\u201d Columbus City Code Title 13, that the Revised Code does not authorize but that has provisions similar to TMC 313.12 in that it provides for sending notices of violation when residents and businesses are not in compliance with the city\u2019s refuse ordinances and sets out an appeal process in which a board hears appeals. Columbus City Code 1303.05 and 1303.10. Furthermore, the fact that the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2506.01, which provides for appeals from local administrative decisions, supports appellants\u2019 claim that charter cities have constitutional and legislative authority to self-govern in these ways under their home-rule authority. <em>See Bazell v. Cincinnati, </em>13 Ohio St.2d 63, 233 N.E.2d 864 (1968), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 20} Walker additionally claims that TMC 313.12 violates the separation-of-powers doctrine implicitly embedded in the framework of the Ohio Constitution because the municipality has taken over a judicial function bestowed exclusively on the municipal courts by R.C. 1901.20 and Ohio Constitution, Article TV, Section 1. We acknowledge that home-rule authority \u201cdoes not include the power to regulate the jurisdiction of courts.\u201d <em>Cupps v. Toledo, </em>170 Ohio St. 144, 163 N.E.2d 384 (1959), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b6 21} However, as noted above, the reality of municipal civil enforcement of ordinances does not involve regulating the jurisdiction of courts. As we made clear in <em>Mendenhall, </em>civil enforcement of municipal ordinances complements the work of the courts. It does not restrict it. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 42. Neither R.C. 1901.20 nor Ohio Constitution, Article TV\", Section 1 undermines our analysis in <em>Mendenhall. </em>We therefore reaffirm that Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Sections 3 and 7 grant municipalities the authority to protect the safety and well-being of their citizens by establishing automated systems for imposing civil liability on traffic-law violators. <em>Mendenhall </em>is dispositive on the constitutionality of municipalities\u2019 civil administrative processes for enforcement of red-light and speeding violations captured by automated systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\n<em>B. R.C. 1901.20 does not confer exclusive jurisdiction over traffic-ordinance violations on municipal courts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 22} We also agree with Toledo and Redflex that the Sixth District Court of Appeals misinterpreted R.C. 1901.20 in holding that it gives municipal courts exclusive authority over traffic-ordinance violations. Walker argues, and the Sixth District held, that the term \u201cany\u201d in R.C. 1901.20 means \u201cevery\u201d and \u201call\u201d: \u201cThe municipal court has jurisdiction of the violation of <em>any </em>ordinance of any municipal corporation within its territory\u201d except certain noncriminal parking violations that are handled by another bureau. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, he asserts, the Toledo Municipal Court must have exclusive authority over the notices of liability issued under TMC 313.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 23} We disagree. First, as discussed above, we have expressly held that Akron\u2019s civil traffic-law-enforcement ordinance (which is substantially similar to Toledo\u2019s) \u201ccomplements rather than conflicts with state law.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, \u00b6 37. Consequently, reading R.C. 1901.20(A)(1) as prohibiting civil enforcement of traffic ordinances under home-rule authority would require us to overrule <em>Mendenhall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 24} Consistent with <em>Mendenhall, </em>therefore, we agree with the dissenting opinion in the court of appeals in this case that no rule of statutory construction compels us to find that \u201cany,\u201d as used in R.C. 1901.20(A)(1), is synonymous with \u201cexclusive.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>97 (2002) does not list \u201cexclusive\u201d as a synonym of \u201cany.\u201d Instead, it defines \u201cany\u201d as \u201cone indifferently out of more than two\u201d; \u201cevery\u201d; and \u201cone or some of whatever kind,\u201d and the like. The same source defines \u201cexclusive\u201d as \u201chaving power to exclude\u201d; \u201climiting or limited to possession, control, or use\u201d; \u201csingle, sole.\u201d Neither term appears in the definition of the other. <em>Id. </em>at 97 and 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b6 25} Furthermore, the General Assembly does not use \u201cany\u201d and \u201cexclusive\u201d interchangeably. <em>See, e.g., </em>R.C. 2743.02(F) (Court of Claims has \u201cexclusive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>original jurisdiction to determine\u201d personal-immunity issues of certain defendants); R.C. 3781.20(B) (a certified local board of building appeals has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over rulings of the local chief enforcement official); R.C. 1901.181(A)(1) (housing division of municipal court has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d in a civil action to enforce local building code). \u201cWhen the General Assembly intends to vest exclusive jurisdiction in a court or agency, it provides it by appropriate statutory language.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Banc One Corp. v. Walker, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 169, 171-172, 712 N.E.2d 742 (1999). The Revised Code, <em>Mendenhall, </em>and other caselaw support appellants in their assertion that R.C. 1901.20(A)(1) allows complementary civil enforcement of traffic laws. R.C. 1901.20 does not confer exclusive jurisdiction over civil traffic-law violations on municipal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>C. Ohio municipalities have home-rule authority to establish presuit civil administrative proceedings in furtherance of their traffic-law enforcement ordinances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 26} Consistent with our disposition of Toledo\u2019s two propositions of law, we agree with Redflex\u2019s proposition that municipalities have home-rule authority to establish presuit civil administrative proceedings, including administrative hearings, on civil liability for traffic-law violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 27} In deciding otherwise, the court of appeals made much of our statement in <em>Mendenhall </em>that \u201cthere are due process questions regarding the operation of the Akron Ordinance and those similar to it,\u201d but that \u201cthose questions are not appropriately before us at this time and will not be discussed here.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, \u00b6 40. 2013-Ohio-2809, 994 N.E.2d 467, \u00b6 13. The court of appeals found this language to be \u201can express limitation on the scope of the <em>Mendenhall </em>decision,\u201d <em>id., </em>and a signal from this court that <em>Mendenhall </em>would have little general application, <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals misread <em>Mendenhall. </em>Our holding that a complementary system of civil enforcement of traffic laws is within a municipality\u2019s home-rule power acknowledges that administrative procedures must be established in furtherance of this power. See, for example, our discussion of Akron\u2019s ordinance, which sets forth civil administrative-appeal proceedings, which appear to be almost identical to Toledo\u2019s. <em>Mendenhall </em>at \u00b6 6-8. <em>See also State ex rel. Scott v. Cleveland, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 324, 2006-Ohio-6573, 859 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 24 (Cleveland\u2019s administrative disposition of civil traffic-law-violation liability was \u201can adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of the administrative proceedings\u201d). As Walker has brought nothing to our attention to show that Toledo\u2019s administrative proceedings are inconsistent with home-rule authority as sanctioned by this court in other cases, we must agree with Redflex that Toledo\u2019s administrative-enforcement proceedings are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b629} Based on the foregoing, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Mendenhall v. Akron, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, that municipalities have home-rule authority under Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, to impose civil liability on traffic violators through an administrative enforcement system. We also hold that Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1, which authorizes the legislature to create municipal courts, and R.C. 1901.20, which sets the jurisdiction of municipal courts, do not endow municipal courts with exclusive authority over traffic-ordinance violations. Finally, we hold that Ohio municipalities have home-rule authority to establish administrative proceedings, including administrative hearings, in furtherance of these ordinances, that must be exhausted before offenders or the municipality can pursue judicial remedies. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals with regard to its holding that the ordinance infringes upon the jurisdiction of the municipal court, and we remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Gwin and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b549-9\">Pfeifer, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b549-10\">W. Scott Gwin, J., of the Fifth Appellate District, sitting for O\u2019Donnell, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-11\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeR\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">{\u00b6 30} This case can be reduced to a single narrow issue: Does a city council have the power to limit the municipal court\u2019s jurisdiction in \u201ctraffic camera\u201d cases and confer jurisdiction on a nonelected hearing officer? The answer is a resounding <em>no. </em>As the Sixth District correctly concluded, one need only look at R.C. 1901.20(A)(1) for the answer. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">The municipal court has jurisdiction of the violation of <em>any </em>ordinance of any municipal corporation within its territory, <em>unless </em>the violation is required to be handled by a parking violations bureau or joint parking violations bureau pursuant to Chapter 4521. of the Revised Code, and of the violation of <em>any misdemeanor committed within the limits of its territory.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">{\u00b6 31} It is evident under this statute that the General Assembly has vested the municipal court with jurisdiction over the violation of <em>any </em>ordinance generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>and any misdemeanor specifically, other than parking violations. The term \u201cany ordinance\u201d does not need interpreting. It is clear on its face. Other than the specifically mentioned parking-violation ordinances, \u201cany ordinance\u201d covers \u201cany ordinance,\u201d which includes Toledo Municipal Code (\u201cTMC\u201d) 313.12. This is the only logical interpretation of this statute. Clearly, the legislature understands how to make exceptions to a general rule, as it did in R.C. 1901.20(A)(1) with parking violations. One principle of statutory construction is that \u201c \u2018if a statute specifies one exception to a general rule or assumes to specify the effects of a certain provision, other exceptions or effects are excluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Freeman, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 221, 224-225, 680 N.E.2d 997 (1997), quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>581 (6th Ed.1990). Hence, the \u201cany ordinance\u201d language in this statute covers TMC 313.12, since there is no specific exception set forth for ordinance violations captured by traffic cameras. The Sixth District was correct when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">Toledo Municipal Code 313.12 is an ordinance of a municipal corporation within the territory encompassed by the Toledo Municipal Court and is not a parking violation; therefore, the violation of Toledo Municipal Code 313.12 is subject to the jurisdiction of the Toledo Municipal Court. Any attempt, in whole or in part, to divest the court of that jurisdiction violates the authority of the General Assembly to set the jurisdiction of the court, thus violating Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">2013-0hio-2809, 994 N.E.2d 467, \u00b6 24 (6th Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 32} In this case, the Toledo City Council has divested the Toledo Municipal Court of part of its jurisdiction by vesting jurisdiction over traffic-camera cases in a hearing officer. A hearing officer is simply not a substitute for a municipal court judge who has been elected to preside over judicial matters. TMC 313.12 is a direct infringement of the municipal court\u2019s jurisdiction as well as the legislature\u2019s right to confer jurisdiction on the court and the right of the general population to elect those empowered to determine whether laws have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 33} The majority bases its decision, in part, on <em>Mendenhall v. Akron, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255. But <em>Mendenhall </em>addressed the issue of home-rule authority and the constitutionality of a municipality\u2019s imposing civil liability for traffic-law violations captured by traffic cameras. The present case is not about home rule and does not implicate <em>Mendenhall. </em>It is solely about the jurisdiction of the Toledo Municipal Court and whether TMC 313.12 unlawfully intrudes upon and reduces that jurisdiction. It does. Accordingly, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>would affirm the decision of the Sixth District Court of Appeals and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_eJ\">Mayle, Ray &amp; Mayle, L.L.C., Andrew R.
