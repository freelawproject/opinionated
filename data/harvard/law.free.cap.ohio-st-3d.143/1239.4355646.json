Quinn has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Douglas M. Rastatter from presiding over any further proceedings in the above-captioned case, which is pending before the common pleas court on Quinn\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">{\u00b6 2} Quinn claims that Judge Rastatter \u201clied\u201d in a July 28, 2014 entry and therefore the judge has a \u201cfixed view of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Specifically, Quinn asserts that the judge stated in the entry that he had reviewed the \u201ccase file, defendant\u2019s motion, and a transcript of the jury trial\u201d in order to decide Quinn\u2019s motion for new trial. Quinn avers, however, that the trial transcripts were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>filed until August 11 and 12, 2014, and therefore the judge could not have reviewed the transcripts before issuing his July 28 entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Rastatter has responded in writing to the allegations in Quinn\u2019s affidavit. The judge denies having a fixed view of Quinn\u2019s guilt and vows to consider any future motions fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 4} In disqualification requests, \u201c[t]he term \u2018bias or prejudice\u2019 \u2018implies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). R.C. 2701.03 requires the affiant to submit specific allegations of bias or prejudice. Additionally, \u201c[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 5} Here, Quinn has not set forth sufficient evidence to overcome Judge Rastatter\u2019s presumption of impartiality. Quinn\u2019s primary allegation is that the judge \u201clied\u201d in his July 28 entry by falsely claiming to have reviewed the transcripts prior to deciding Quinn\u2019s motion for new trial. In response, Judge Rastatter states that although he presently has no specific recollection of reviewing the trial transcripts in the underlying case, he routinely reviews incomplete and/or unedited transcripts with his court reporter before the official transcripts are filed. Given Judge Rastatter\u2019s explanation of his routine practice \u2014 and without more direct evidence \u2014 Quinn\u2019s speculative claim that the judge \u201clied\u201d in his July 28 entry is inadequate to remove the judge for bias or prejudice, especially considering that Judge Rastatter has already presided over the trial in this case. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation * * * are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1228, 1229, 763 N.E.2d 598 (2001) (\u201cabsent extraordinary circumstances, a judge will not be subject to disqualification after having presided over lengthy proceedings in a pending case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 6} Additionally, even if Judge Rastatter made a misstatement in his July 28 entry, a judge\u2019s misstatements or errors are generally corrected on appeal, not by filing an affidavit of disqualification. <em>See In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4 (an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>And more important, Quinn has not explained how the alleged misstatement necessarily shows that the judge has reached a fixed anticipatory judgment on Quinn\u2019s pending petition for postconviction relief. For his part, Judge Rastatter has vowed to consider all of Quinn\u2019s future motions with an open mind. Although a trial judge\u2019s subjective belief as to his or her own impartiality is not the decisive factor in deciding a disqualification request, \u201cthe judge\u2019s own assessment is certainly entitled to some weight,\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 11, especially when, as here, the affidavit of disqualification is based on speculative allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 7} Accordingly, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Rastatter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
