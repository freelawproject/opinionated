The en banc court recognized that its decision conflicted with <em>State v. Wallace, </em>6th Dist. Wood No. WD-11-031, 2012-Ohio-2675, 2012 WL 2196290, and certified the following two issues for our resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">(1) Whether a trial court commits plain error where multiple offenses present a facial question of allied offenses of similar import, yet the trial court fails to determine whether those offenses should merge under R.C. 2941.25 at sentencing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">(2) Whether the failure of a defendant to raise an allied-offense issue or to object in the trial court can constitute an effective waiver or forfeiture of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights against double jeopardy and a bar to appellate review of the issue when the record is silent on the defendant\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The en banc court subsequently recognized that its decision also conflicted with the decision of the Ninth District in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>21 Ohio App.3d 171, 486 N.E.2d 1242 (9th Dist.1985), and certified a third issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">(3) Whether an offender who receives, retains, or disposes of the property of two or more other persons in a single transaction may be convicted and sentenced for more than one count of receiving stolen property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">{\u00b6 2} We determined that the conflicts exist, and the parties have briefed the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>{\u00b6 3} We answer the first two questions in the negative. An accused\u2019s failure to raise the issue of allied offenses of similar import in the trial court forfeits all but plain error, and a forfeited error is not reversible error unless it affected the outcome of the proceeding and reversal is necessary to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, an accused has the burden to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the convictions are for allied offenses of similar import committed with the same conduct and without a separate animus; absent that showing, the accused cannot demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire whether the convictions merge for purposes of sentencing was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 4} We answer the third question in the affirmative. As we recently decided in <em>State v. Ruff, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, 34 N.E.3d 892, allied offenses are not offenses of similar import if the offender\u2019s conduct constitutes offenses against different victims or if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 5} In this case, it is undisputed that Frank Rogers failed to object to his sentences in the trial court; thus, he forfeited appellate review of the argument that he had been sentenced for allied offenses of similar import. And because he has failed to demonstrate that he has, in fact, been sentenced for allied offenses of similar import committed with the same conduct and without separate animus, his claim that the trial court committed plain error fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 6} We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals that is based on its holding that a trial court has a duty to inquire about allied offenses if the defense fails to raise it at sentencing, and we reinstate the sentences imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned indictments against Rogers alleging offenses in eight cases. This appeal concerns only the sentences imposed by the trial court in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas case Nos. CR-545992 and CR-553806.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">{\u00b6 8} On January 5, 2011, Rogers fled from Cleveland police officers who attempted a traffic stop. Upon his arrest and subsequent search of his van, the officers discovered four tires and rims, which had been taken from a stolen Ford F-150 pickup truck found sitting on cinder blocks. The grand jury indicted Rogers in case No. CR-545992 on two counts of receiving stolen property (\u201cRSP\u201d) \u2014 one count for the truck and the other for the tires and rims \u2014 and one count of possessing criminal tools (\u201cPCT\u201d) \u2014 a jack, a tow chain, and a lug-nut wrench.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">{\u00b6 9} While those charges were pending, officers subsequently rearrested Rogers for selling stolen jewelry and other items to a pawn shop. A grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>indicted Rogers in case No. CR-553806 for two additional counts of RSP involving two separate victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">{\u00b6 10} Rogers entered guilty pleas to these counts. In case No. CR-545992, the court sentenced him to a term of 12 months in prison for receiving the stolen truck, six months for receiving the tires and rims, and an additional six months for possessing the criminal tools. In case No. CR-553806, the court sentenced Rogers to a term of 12 months for receiving the stolen property belonging to the first victim, and six months for receiving the property belonging to the second victim. The trial court then imposed sentences for offenses in the other six cases, and it ordered all sentences to be served consecutively, for an aggregate eight-year term of imprisonment. Rogers did not assert that he had been convicted of allied offenses of similar import, nor did he object to the sentence imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, Rogers argued for the first time that some of his convictions should have merged for sentencing. The appellate court applied a plain error analysis, rejected the argument that the trial court had errantly imposed sentences for allied offenses of similar import, and affirmed Rogers\u2019s convictions and sentences, stating that it could not find plain error when it was not clear from the record whether an error had occurred. 2013-Ohio-1027, 990 N.E.2d 1085, \u00b6 5, 17, 19, 21 (8th Dist.). The court stated, \u201cThere is no plausible interpretation of the plain error doctrine that would allow an appellate court to find error simply because there are no facts to show whether any error occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 12} The appellate court then sua sponte granted en banc consideration. The en banc court upheld the separate sentences imposed in the case involving the stolen jewelry, explaining that the existence of two different victims established a separate animus for each of the two convictions. The court concluded, however, that the fact that the two RSP offenses related to the truck and the tires and rims involved the same victim and the fact that the PCT offense for having tools to remove the wheels from a vehicle had occurred on the same day as the RSP offenses suggested that the offenses may be allied, and it held that the trial court had committed plain error by failing to inquire into or address the allied-offense question. 2013-Ohio-3235, 994 N.E.2d 499, \u00b6 24, 25, 33, 34 (8th Dist.). The opinion of the en banc court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Where a facial question of allied offenses of similar import presents itself, a trial court judge has a duty to inquire and determine under R.C. 2941.25 whether those offenses should merge. A trial court commits plain error in failing to inquire and determine whether such offenses are allied offenses of similar import.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 63. The en banc court further recognized that it was \u201cunable to determine if these offenses were allied offenses of similar import,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 25, but it nonetheless reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court \u201cto establish the underlying facts of Rogers\u2019s conduct in CR-545992 and for the trial court to determine whether the subject crimes should merge for sentencing purposes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 13} The en banc court certified conflicts between its decision and the Sixth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>State v. Wallace, </em>2012-Ohio-2675, 2012 WL 2196290, and the Ninth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>21 Ohio App.3d 171, 486 N.E.2d 1242. We determined that the conflicts existed and sua sponte consolidated the cases. 137 Ohio St.3d 1456, 2013-Ohio-4657,1 N.E.3d 423; 137 Ohio St.3d 1458, 2013-Ohio-4657, 1 N.E.3d 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Positions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 14} The state does not dispute that when an error in failing to merge allied offenses is obvious, it rises to plain error. Nonetheless, it urges that entry of guilty pleas waives any claim that convictions are for allied offenses of similar import, and further, that the failure to object at sentencing forfeits any error and reversal is not appropriate unless the accused demonstrates that the outcome of the proceeding was unjust. It notes that the accused has a remedy for defense counsel\u2019s failure to argue that the convictions are for allied offenses of similar import by petitioning for postconviction relief and presenting evidence outside the record. According to the state, the en banc court improperly recognized a new form of error that is reversible error per se and imposed a new duty on trial courts to initiate a \u201cvoir dire hearing\u201d to determine in all cases whether sentences should merge.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 15} Rogers maintains that the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose separate sentences for allied offenses of similar import; thus, if it is possible to commit each offense with the same conduct, then a court may not impose sentences for each offense unless it first finds that the offenses were committed with separate conduct or with a separate animus. Otherwise, Rogers asserts, the sentences are contrary to law and must be reversed on appeal, even if the issue is not raised at sentencing. According to Rogers, an accused cannot waive double jeopardy rights at a sentencing hearing when the question of merger is not at issue, and the failure to object at sentencing does not relieve the trial court of its statutory and constitutional obligation to determine whether convictions that could have been committed with the same conduct were in fact committed separately or with a separate animus. Lastly, he maintains that an offender cannot be sentenced for multiple convictions for RSP if the offender received the property in a single transaction, regardless of whether the property belongs to multiple owners. In support, he points to R.C. 2913.61(B), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>provides that if more than one item is involved in a theft offense, the value of the stolen property is determined by the aggregate value of all property involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{If 16} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords protections against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997); <em>State v. Raber, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 350, 2012-Ohio-5636, 982 N.E.2d 684, \u00b6 24. However, when multiple punishments are imposed in the same proceeding, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court <em>from </em>prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended. <em>Garrett v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 793, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985); <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983); <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 17} As we recently explained in <em>State v. Washington, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 427, 2013-Ohio-4982, 999 N.E.2d 661, \u00b6 11, \u201c[a]bsent a more specific legislative statement, R.C. 2941.25 is the primary indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to prohibit or allow multiple punishments for two or more offenses resulting from the same conduct.\u201d R.C. 2941.25 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 18} This court construed this statute in <em>Whitfield, </em>noting that \u201cfor purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A), a conviction is a determination of guilt and the ensuing sentence,\u201d <em>Whitfield </em>at \u00b6 13, and recognizing that \u201cR.C. 2941.25(A)\u2019s mandate that a defendant may be \u2018convicted\u2019 of only one allied offense is a protection against multiple sentences rather than multiple convictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 18. Because \u201ca defendant may be found guilty of allied offenses but not sentenced on them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 17, \u201c[t]he defendant is not \u2018convicted\u2019 for purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A) until the sentence is imposed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 24. And, therefore, merger of allied offenses occurs at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\n<em>Waiver vs. Forfeiture</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 19} We reject the state\u2019s proposition that by entering , guilty pleas to offenses that can be construed to be two or more allied offenses of similar import, an accused waives the protection against multiple punishments provided by R.C. 2941.25. We have stated that \u201c \u2018[a] defendant who enters a voluntary plea of guilty while represented by competent counsel waives all nonjurisdictional defects in prior stages of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross v. Auglaize Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>30 Ohio St.2d 323-324, 285 N.E.2d 25 (1972), quoting <em>Crockett v. Haskins, </em>372 F.2d 475, 476 (6th Cir.1966). However, as <em>Whitfield </em>makes clear, the merger of allied offenses occurs at sentencing, a <em>subsequent </em>stage of the proceedings. Further, a guilty plea renders irrelevant only those claims \u201cnot logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt and which do not stand in the way of conviction if factual guilt is validly established.\u201d <em>Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 62, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975), fn. 2; <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1240 (11th Cir.2009). But in determining whether convictions are for allied offenses of similar import, finding factual guilt of each offense is a prerequisite to merger, and thus, an allied offenses claim is consistent with an admission of guilt and therefore is not waived by pleading guilty to offenses that might be allied offenses of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 20} And more fundamentally, \u201c \u2018waiver is the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Quarterman, </em>140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, 19 N.E.3d 900, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). It is possible for an accused to expressly waive the protection afforded by R.C. 2941.25, such as by \u201cstipulating in the plea agreement that the offenses were committed with separate animus.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 29. But nothing in this record indicates that by pleading guilty, Rogers intended to relinquish the opportunity to argue that he committed his offenses with the same conduct and the same animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 21} In contrast to waiver, forfeiture is the failure to timely assert a right or object to an error, and in <em>Quarterman, </em>we said, \u201cIt is a well-established rule that \u2018 \u201can appellate court will not consider any error which counsel for a party complaining of the trial court\u2019s judgment could have called but did not call to the trial court\u2019s attention at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15, quoting <em>State v. Awan, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 489 N.E.2d 277 (1986), quoting <em>State v. Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 236 N.E.2d 545 (1968), paragraph three of the syllabus. Thus, by failing to seek the merger of his convictions as allied offenses of similar import in the trial court, Rogers forfeited his allied offenses claim for appellate review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\n<em>Review for Plain Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 22} Crim.R. 52(B) affords appellate courts discretion to correct \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights\u201d notwithstanding the accused\u2019s failure to meet his obligation to bring those errors to the attention of the trial court. However, the accused bears the burden of proof to demonstrate plain error on the record, <em>Quarterman </em>at \u00b6 16, and must show \u201can error, <em>i.e., </em>a deviation from a legal rule\u201d that constitutes \u201can \u2018obvious\u2019 defect in the trial proceedings,\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). However, even if the error is obvious, it must have affected substantial rights, and \u201c[w]e have interpreted this aspect of the rule to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The accused is therefore required to demonstrate a reasonable <em>probability </em>that the error resulted in prejudice \u2014 the same deferential standard for reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 81-83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (construing Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), the federal analog to Crim.R. 52(B), and also noting that the burden of proving entitlement to relief for plain error \u201cshould not be too easy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 23} But even if an accused shows that the trial court committed plain error affecting the outcome of the proceeding, an appellate court is not required to correct it; we have \u201cadmonish[ed] courts to notice plain error \u2018with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and <em>only </em>to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Barnes </em>at 27, quoting <em>State v. Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 24} We have never recognized the hybrid type of plain error applied by the en banc court in this case, forfeited error that is presumptively prejudicial and is reversible error per se. Rather, in <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, we rejected the notion that there is any category of forfeited error that is not subject to the plain error rule\u2019s requirement of prejudicial effect on the outcome. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23. Writing for our court, Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer cautioned that \u201cany unwarranted expansion of Crim.R. 52(B) \u2018 \u201cwould skew the Rule\u2019s \u2018careful balancing of our need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time around against our insistence that obvious injustice be promptly redressed.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Perry </em>at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State v. Hill, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 191, 199, 749 N.E.2d 274 (2001), quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997), quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). Chief Justice Moyer further explained that \u201cour holdings should foster rather than thwart judicial economy by providing incentives (and not disincentives) for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>defendant to raise all errors in the trial court \u2014 where, in many cases, such errors can be easily corrected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">{\u00b6 25} There may be instances when a court\u2019s failure to merge allied offenses can constitute plain error, but this case does not present one of those instances. Rogers failed to demonstrate any probability that he has, in fact, been convicted of allied offenses of similar import committed with the same conduct and with the same animus, and he therefore failed to show any prejudicial effect on the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 26} It is entirely reasonable for a court to infer in this case that Rogers received or retained the stolen truck and then removed the tires and rims in order to dispose of them, thereby committing separate and distinct acts resulting in two separate and distinct counts of RSP, one for receiving or retaining the truck and the other for disposing of the tires and rims. The elements of PCT (R.C. 2923.24) are distinct from the elements of RSP (R.C. 2913.51), and thus, that offense was not committed by the same act and is not an allied offense of the RSP counts. Tellingly, Rogers has not argued that he committed these offenses together and with the same animus, and the trial court therefore reasonably sentenced him on each of these separate convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 27} In addressing the third certified question, we hold that the trial court did not commit plain error in imposing separate sentences for the two counts of RSP involving the jewelry and other items taken from two different victims. In <em>Ruff, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, 34 N.E.3d 892, we stated, \u201cwhen the defendant\u2019s conduct put more than one individual at risk, that conduct could support multiple convictions because the offenses were of dissimilar import.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23. There, we concluded, \u201ctwo or more offenses of dissimilar import exist within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25(B) when the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes offenses involving separate victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in imposing separate sentences for these offenses involving different victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 28} The en banc court correctly recognized that the failure to raise the allied offense issue at the time of sentencing forfeits all but plain error, and in the two counts of RSP involving the jewelry, the trial court did not err in sentencing Rogers on both counts of RSP because those crimes involved the property of two different victims. We therefore affirm that part of the appellate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 29} However, the en banc court misapplied settled principles of appellate review in noticing plain error regarding the separate sentences for the two counts of RSP relating to the truck and the tires and rims and for the count of PCT, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>because the court stated that it could not determine whether these offenses were allied offenses of similar import. The law required Rogers to demonstrate a reasonable probability that his convictions constituted allied offenses of similar import, and he failed to carry that burden. Accordingly, we reverse that part of the judgment of the en banc court and reinstate the sentences imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b516-6\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b516-7\">O\u2019Neill, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b516-8\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqU\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 30} I must respectfully dissent in part. The majority correctly resolves the second and third issues that were certified as being in conflict in this case. A defendant\u2019s failure to request merger forfeits the issue rather than waiving it, and <em>State v. Ruff, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, 34 N.E.3d 892, correctly resolved whether allied offenses against multiple victims represent offenses of dissimilar import. I therefore join the majority\u2019s resolution of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">{\u00b6 31} I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority opinion\u2019s holding on the first certified-conflict issue regarding whether it is plain error for a trial court to fail to consider merger in certain circumstances. The majority correctly states the standard for plain-error review and then misapplies that very standard. Citing <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 81-83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004), the majority correctly holds that an appellant must show only a reasonable probability that the error complained of resulted in prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">{\u00b6 32} There is a reasonable probability of prejudicial error when \u201cthe probability of a different result is \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u2019 of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Dominguez Benitez </em>at 83, quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Like the en banc panel of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, I believe that this standard is satisfied by the record in the case involving the truck and tires, case No. CR-545992.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">{\u00b6 33} The majority goes to great pains to characterize Rogers\u2019s case as one that can prevail only if he shows plain error within the subtleties of the indictments and hearing transcripts. But it is not the absence of facts in the record that gives rise to plain error in this case. The trial court\u2019s glaring failure to even consider merging the receiving-stolen-property (\u201cRSP\u201d) offenses was plain error standing all alone. The reality that these offenses were allied jumps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>out from the record. R.C. 2941.25(A) limits a court\u2019s sentencing authority by imposing a duty to merge offenses when a defendant\u2019s actions <em>\u201ccan be construed </em>to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2941.25(A). We have already determined that this duty \u201cis mandatory, not discretionary.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 26. We are required to interpret R.C. 2941.25 liberally in favor of Rogers and strictly against the state. R.C. 2901.04. Therefore, the duty to merge must arise when it is merely <em>possible </em>that offenses are allied offenses of similar import. Otherwise, the words \u201ccan be construed\u201d in R.C. 2941.25(A) have no meaning. Accordingly, I must agree with the en banc panel of the court of appeals that we should look for obvious error in the trial court\u2019s actions rather than search for something in Rogers\u2019s conduct to justify overturning well-reasoned case law. It is important to note that one RSP count in this case involves a truck and another RSP count involves the tires from that very same truck. How are these not allied offenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">{\u00b6 34} Imagine the following scenario for the sake of argument: John Doe has been charged with 24 counts of petty theft of a can of beer and one count of possessing criminal tools for using a cardboard box to carry the cans. The criminal complaint shows the same date for each theft and lists the local Mickey Mart gas station as the only victim. Doe enters a guilty plea. The parties agree that Doe will pay restitution of $17.99, roughly the cost of a 24-pack of beer. And at the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor represents that Doe had been apprehended near the Mickey Mart using the box to carry the 24 cans of beer. The municipal court imposes 25 consecutive 180-day sentences. The trial court does not consider that the offenses may be allied offenses of similar import. Inexplicably and without excuse, Doe fails to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 35} Admittedly, those limited facts do not conclusively establish that Doe\u2019s offenses were allied offenses of similar import. A court could <em>infer </em>that he walked into the Mickey Mart 24 separate times to steal a single can of beer, hiding them each time in a cardboard box behind the store. It is obvious, though, that Doe\u2019s conduct \u201ccan be construed\u201d as allied offenses of similar import arising out of a single act \u2014 stealing a 24-pack of beer. R.C. 2941.25(A). I believe that a trial court plainly deviates from the requirements of R.C. 2941.25 when it fails to address the issue of allied offenses \u2014 even if the issue is not raised by a party\u2014 when the record clearly shows a <em>possibility </em>that some offenses may be allied offenses of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 36} The United States Supreme Court was careful to advise courts not to confuse the reasonable-probability standard with \u201ca requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for error things would have been different.\u201d <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>157, fn. 9. The majority loses its way by focusing on the fact that \u201c[Rogers] has failed to demonstrate that he has, in fact, been sentenced for allied offenses of similar import.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 5. The most that the majority can say to support its holding on this issue is that \u201c[i]t is entirely reasonable for a court to infer * * * that Rogers * * * commit[ed] separate and distinct acts resulting in two separate and distinct counts of RSP * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26. That point is unhelpful. When the record supports only mere inferences that justify sentencing an offender to multiple prison terms for multiple allied offenses, alternative inferences are not automatically unreasonable. There can be very little confidence in a sentencing order that fails to address merger despite a record that indicates that some of the offenses might be allied offenses.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApH\">Timothy J. McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Adam M. Chaloupka, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ao9\">Robert L. Tobik, Cuyahoga County Public Defender, and Cullen Sweeney, Assistant Public Defender, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 37} Also, Rogers need not strain to establish the fact of prejudice and manifest injustice. If his RSP offenses should have merged, he suffered prejudice by \u201chaving more convictions than are authorized by law.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, at \u00b6 31. And if he should be sentenced for only one count of RSP, his consecutive sentences for each of the RSP offenses represent a manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 38} Rogers has shown a reasonable probability that the trial court\u2019s failure to consider merging the RSP offenses relating to the truck and its tires resulted in more punishment than the legislature authorized by R.C. 2941.25. He merely needed to show that the record indicates a possibility that the trial court should have <em>considered </em>merging his offenses. He did so, and that possibility is enough to undermine confidence that his sentence was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, I dissent from the majority opinion\u2019s holding regarding the first certified-conflict issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
