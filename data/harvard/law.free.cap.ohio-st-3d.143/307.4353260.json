Simpson, D.O., for a writ of mandamus. When a state employee elects on retirement to combine total contributions and service credits from the State Teachers Retirement System (\u201cSTRS\u201d) and the Public Employees Retirement System (\u201cPERS\u201d), the system administering the payments must apply its own statutory formulas for determining the retirement benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 2} Simpson was employed in two state positions. In one, she and her employer contributed to STRS, and in the other, she and her employer contributed to PERS. Members of STRS who are also members in another state retirement system may choose to combine their total contributions and service credits in determining eligibility for benefits. R.C. 3307.57. The retirement benefits are calculated and paid by the system in which the member had the greatest service credit. R.C. 3307.57(B)(4); R.C. 145.37. Under the STRS statutes, the pension benefit to be paid is calculated by determining a final average salary. The salaries used to calculate the final average salary must be capped under certain conditions. R.C. 3307.501. PERS has no similar statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">{\u00b6 3} Simpson retired, relying in part on advice from STRS personnel whose estimates of her retirement income (based on incorrect information she provided regarding her maximum PERS salary) did not specifically indicate to her that her PERS salary, once combined with her STRS salary, would be subject to STRS\u2019s capping provision. However, once she had retired, and based on her actual salary record, STRS applied the cap to the combined salaries when calculating Simpson\u2019s final average salary, thus decreasing Simpson\u2019s pension benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b64} Simpson timely appealed the STRS calculation to respondent, State Teachers Retirement Board, but the board denied her appeal. Simpson, having exhausted her administrative remedies, then filed this action in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 5} Because STRS administers the pension benefits for Simpson, STRS\u2019s statutes must be applied to the entirety of Simpson\u2019s retirement contributions. We therefore deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 6} Simpson is a doctor of osteopathic medicine. From 1994 until she retired in 2012, Simpson worked for Ohio University in Athens in a teaching position. Simpson was also employed from 2006 until her retirement at Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare as a physician. Both employers deducted pension contributions \u2014 one paid into STRS and one into PERS. Simpson considered the pensions a valuable part of her compensation in both positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 7} Before she retired, Simpson sought and received counseling from STRS staff regarding estimates of her retirement benefits, in part to determine a retirement date that would maximize her benefits. STRS staff prepared retirement-benefit estimates on several occasions in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The estimates were based in part on annual income amounts from her PERS employment that Simpson provided to STRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 8} For example, in March 2012, STRS prepared an estimate using figures provided by Simpson of her earnings for her PERS job of about $35,000 for each year of 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. She reported her 2011-2012 earnings as $52,000. STRS provided an estimate based on these numbers that included a limited final salary of $143,833. The estimate was based on earnings from STRS and the figures provided by Simpson regarding PERS earnings. Simpson claims that STRS did not inform her that her retirement benefit would be reduced because her PERS salary would be capped under the STRS capping statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 9} Simpson filed an application for retirement benefits with STRS, effective July 1, 2012. Ohio University agreed to purchase one year of service credit for Simpson and agreed to her anticipated retirement date. STRS obtained Simpson\u2019s service-credit information from PERS. PERS also transferred funds to STRS from Simpson\u2019s PERS account as required by R.C. 3307.57(B)(6)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 10} The information sent by PERS on Simpson\u2019s earnings did not match the earnings estimates that Simpson had given STRS in March 2012. The final earnings reported by PERS were $4,764 for 2009-2010, $50,598 for 2010-2011, and $90,216 for 2011-2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">{\u00b6 11} STRS calculates retirement benefits using a number of criteria, including \u201cfinal average salary.\u201d Final average salary is calculated by dividing by three the sum of the member\u2019s annual compensation for the three highest years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>compensation for which the member made contributions. R.C. 3307.501(C). Compensation includes all salary, wages, and other earnings paid by reason of employment. R.C. 3307.01(L)(1). However, STRS, unlike PERS, caps the salary for the two highest years based on the amount of salary increase during those years over previous years. R.C. 3307.501(B)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">{\u00b6 12} In October 2012, STRS notified Simpson of her final benefit, indicating that two of her three highest earning years were capped. STRS allowed an increase of only 7.42 percent for 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 rather than the actual, higher increase. STRS calculated her final salary for those years, with the caps, as $114,755 and $123,291 respectively. Her final average salary was then used to calculate a monthly retirement benefit of $3,163.39. Contributions made on the portion of salary that is not treated as compensation add some additional income (R.C. 3307.501(D)); in Simpson\u2019s case, this was an extra $105.81, for a total monthly retirement benefit of $3,269.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 13} STRS notified Simpson that she had the right to appeal its decision. Simpson appealed and requested a hearing before a review committee. The board reviewed the information provided and affirmed the determination of Simpson\u2019s benefit using a final average salary that was calculated based on two years of salary that were capped.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 14} Simpson filed this action in mandamus, requesting a writ ordering the board to recalculate her retirement benefit by not capping the PERS portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 15} STRS is required to calculate a member\u2019s final average salary according to R.C. 3307.501. A member who contests the calculation has the right to file an administrative appeal. There is no right to appeal the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 16} Because there is no right of further appeal, mandamus is the appropriate remedy to further challenge the board\u2019s actions. <em>Ohio Academy of Nursing Homes v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 14, 2007-Ohio-2620, 867 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 23 (\u201cwhen an agency\u2019s decision is discretionary and, by statute, not subject to direct appeal, a writ of mandamus is the sole vehicle to challenge the decision, by attempting to show that the agency abused its discretion\u201d); <em>State ex rel.

R.C. 145.37(B)(1)(d). In Simpson\u2019s case, that is STRS. R.C. 3307.57(B)(4). The question here is whether STRS is required to cap Simpson\u2019s total annual salary, including salary earned as a member of PERS, or only the portion that she earned as a member of STRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 21} Under R.C. 3307.501, STRS is required to cap the annual income for purposes of determining final average salary when the increase for the member\u2019s two highest years of compensation exceeds the greater of the highest percentage increase during any of the three years immediately preceding the earlier of the two years of highest compensation or exceeds, with some exceptions, a percentage increase paid to the member as part of a similar increase to others employed by the same employer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">(B) Notwithstanding division (L) of section 3307.01 of the Revised Code, for the purpose of determining final average salary under this section, \u201ccompensation\u201d has the same meaning as in that division, except that it does not include any amount resulting from a percentage increase paid to a member during the member\u2019s two highest years of compensation that exceeds the greater of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">(1) The highest percentage increase in compensation paid to the member during any of the three years immediately preceding the earlier of the member\u2019s two highest years of compensation and any subsequent partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>year of compensation used in calculating the member\u2019s final average salary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">(2) A percentage increase paid to the member as part of an increase generally applicable to members employed by the employer. An increase shall be considered generally applicable if it is paid to members employed by a school district board of education in positions requiring a license issued under section 3319.22 of the Revised Code in accordance with uniform criteria applicable to all such members or if paid to members employed by an employer other than a school district board of education in accordance with uniform criteria applicable to all such members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">R.C. 3307.501. PERS has no similar requirement. R.C. 145.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 22} STRS found that Simpson\u2019s three highest years of compensation, including both STRS and PERS employment, were 2009-2010, when she earned $106,847; 2010-2011, when she earned $155,676; and 2011-2012 when she earned $196,462. Her earnings in 2010-2011 were a 45.7 percent increase over her 2009-2010 earnings. This is a higher percentage than allowed by the capping provision, which allows an increase of either the greater of the member\u2019s largest increase in the three years preceding the earlier of the two highest years of compensation \u2014 7.42 percent in Simpson\u2019s case \u2014 or the generally applicable increase of the employer \u2014 in Simpson\u2019s case, 1 percent. STRS capped Simpson\u2019s 2010-2011 salary at $114,775, or 7.42 percent more than her 2009-2010 salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, Simpson\u2019s earnings for 2011-2012 were a 71 percent increase over the previous year\u2019s capped earnings. STRS again allowed her a 7.42 percent increase. The average of her highest three years of compensation was then calculated as $114,971, which STRS used to calculate her pension benefit. An additional annuity was added to her benefit because of the amounts not counted as salary, as required by R.C. 3307.501(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 24} As explained above, R.C. 3307.57 governs the coordination of retirement benefits for STRS and PERS members whose greater service credit is with STRS. Under that statute, \u201ctotal contributions and service credit in all retirement systems * * * shall be used in determining the eligibility for benefits.\u201d R.C. 3307.57(B). The \u201cboard of the state retirement system in which the member had the greatest service credit * * * shall calculate and pay the total benefit.\u201d R.C. 3307.57(B)(4); <em>see also </em>R.C. 145.37(B)(1) (\u201ctotal contributions and service credit in all state retirement systems * * * shall be used in determining the eligibility and total retirement or disability benefit payable\u201d) and 145.337(B)(1)(d) (\u201cThe board of the state retirement system in which the member had the greatest service credit, without adjustment, shall calculate and pay the total retirement or disability benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>{\u00b6 25} R.C. 3307.57 does not specifically state that the cap on salaries required for STRS members should not be placed on the total contributions in all retirement systems to be used in determining the total retirement benefit payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 26} An attorney general opinion has determined that when coordinating retirement benefits from two state plans, all benefits should be calculated by the system paying the benefit in accordance with that system\u2019s benefit calculator. 1988 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 88-072, *2. In that opinion, PERS asked the attorney general to address whether PERS, as the administering system, should apply each retirement system\u2019s benefit formula to the credits earned under that system. The attorney general opined that PERS was required to apply its own benefits formula to all of the retiree\u2019s credits rather than apply the formula of each system under which the benefits were earned. <em>Id. </em>The attorney general reasoned, in part, that a retirement system is a statutory entity that must follow its own governing statutes, including any formulas for calculating benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 27} The reasoning from the attorney general\u2019s opinion supports the board\u2019s position that STRS is to calculate the pension benefit based on the calculation required by STRS\u2019s statutes and not on separate calculations under each retirement system\u2019s statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 28} Simpson\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit. She first misinterprets R.C. 3307.501(B)(2): she asserts that the section contains an exception that allows the entire salary from the second retirement system to be included for determining a final average salary if it was \u201cpaid to members employed by an employer other than a school.\u201d However, this language is taken out of context. The statute does not state that such compensation is excluded from the capping provision. Rather, it states that the cap applies to exclude the amount that exceeds \u201c[a] percentage increase paid to the member as part of an increase generally applicable to members employed by the employer.\u201d In other words, an increase must exceed the amount given to an employee as a regular raise given to everyone to be excluded from the annual salary. This provision applies to both \u201cmembers employed by a school district board of education in positions requiring a license issued under section 3319.22 of the Revised Code in accordance with uniform criteria applicable to all such members\u201d and to \u201cmembers employed by an employer other than a school district board of education in accordance with uniform criteria applicable to all such members.\u201d That is, the statute does not explicitly exclude from the capping provision income from non-STRS employers. Moreover, Simpson\u2019s cap was based on R.C. 3307.501(B)(1), which does not rely on a \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d percentage increase in salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 29} Second, Simpson relies on comments in a Legislative Service Commission\u2019s bill analysis, but these comments were made in regard to a 1991 provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that was removed from the statutes in 2001 and that therefore no longer applies. Sub.H.B. No. 535, 148 Ohio Laws, Part III, 5831, 5960. Indeed, the later amendment severely undercuts Simpson\u2019s arguments, because it deleted a provision that excepted from the cap a percentage increase in income that \u201cresults from employment by a different employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if anything, after 2001, the General Assembly meant to include income from all employers (STRS and non-STRS) in the income considered for the cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">{\u00b6 30} Third, Simpson points out that Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-4-01 lists three instances in which a percentage increase is to be considered as an increase \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d to members employed by the employer for purposes of R.C. 3307.501(B)(2) and that all three instances involve pay by a board of education or a university, not by a non-STRS employer. Again, Simpson\u2019s cap was based on R.C. 3307.501(B)(1), which does not rely on a \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d percentage increase in salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 31} Fourth, Simpson asserts that R.C. 3307.351 provides that retirement benefits from non-STRS employers are to be combined with those from STRS employers with no reduction. However, the provision of that statute applicable to Simpson says nothing about how the final average salary is to be calculated. Instead, it allows an. employee to continue to contribute to a retirement fund in one job while retiring from another:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">Subject to division (E) of this section, a member of the state teachers retirement system who also holds one or more other positions covered by the other state retirement systems may retire under section 3307.57, 3307.58, or 3307.60 of the Revised Code or under an STRS defined contribution plan from the STRS position and continue contributing to the other state retirement systems if the annual compensation for the STRS position at the time of retirement is greater than annual compensation or earnable salary for the position, or any of the positions, covered by the other state retirement systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">R.C. 3307.351(B)(2). In other words, that provision allows an employee to retire from one system while continuing to work and contribute to another system. The statute does not address calculating the final average salary of an employee who retires from two systems, as Simpson did.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 32} Simpson also argues that the board should be estopped from capping her annual compensation for purposes of determining her final average salary because she relied to her detriment on the estimates given to her by STRS. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>However, equitable estoppel generally does not apply against a public retirement system. <em>Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emps. v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP-136, 2004-Ohio-7101, 2004 WL 2988444, \u00b6 51 (\u201cIf SERS can be estopped [from] reallocating costs or modifying health care plan features because of alleged promises by its employees/representatives, SERS would no longer have the discretion expressly granted to it by the General Assembly * * <em>*</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5LP\">Luper, Neidenthal &amp; Logan, Luther L. Liggett Jr., and Jacqueline M. Wirtz, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4h\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Lydia M. Arko, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 33} Even if estoppel could be applied to STRS, Simpson relied on STRS estimates based on erroneous information that she had provided. Specifically, she provided estimates of her PERS earnings of about $35,000 for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 and $52,000 for 2011-2012. The real numbers turned out to be $4,764, $50,598, and $90,216 respectively. Simpson cannot claim to have detrimentally relied on estimates based on incorrect information she herself provided to STRS to use in calculating those estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 34} Moreover, the STRS estimates gave Simpson clear notice that her final average salary might vary from the estimate and might be limited under statute. Both of the last two benefit statements stated, \u201cThese calculations are estimates, that have been prepared based on information provided in part by you and are for discussion purposes only. * * * Actual benefits will be paid in accordance with the law in effect at the time of retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 35} Under R.C. 3307.57(B)(4), STRS combined Simpson\u2019s PERS and STRS contributions and then correctly calculated her pension benefit using the provision in R.C. 3307.501(B) requiring that her combined annual salary be capped. The board\u2019s decision was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and was supported by some evidence in the record. It was not an abuse of discretion. {\u00b6 36} We deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
