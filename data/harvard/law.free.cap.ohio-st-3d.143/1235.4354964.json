According to Carulas, Judge Greene responded that she was not anxious for this trial to go forward if \u201cthere is a vengeance from 10 years ago.\u201d Carulas concludes that Judge Greene\u2019s comment that \u201cshe perceives the Defendants as acting with vengeance toward her\u201d raises a justifiable objection about her ability to be unbiased and unprejudiced in trying this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Greene has responded with her own affidavit, averring that she has no bias or prejudice against any party in the underlying proceeding. Judge Greene further states that nothing about the prior case involving defendants\u2019 insurance carrier \u2014 which the judge presided over more than ten years ago \u2014 will have an effect on how she conducts the underlying trial. And the judge disputes Carulas\u2019s characterization of her remarks at the February 2 conference. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>ing to Judge Greene, her actual comment upon learning of Carulas\u2019s previous objection was that it \u201csounded like a vengeance for what happened 10 years ago which has no place in a courthouse or courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">{\u00b6 4} Pamela Pantages, counsel for plaintiffs, has also filed an affidavit averring that Carulas misquoted Judge Greene. According to Pantages, after Judge Greene was apprised of Carulas\u2019s objection, the judge responded that it sounded like a vengeance from ten years ago, \u201cwhich has no place in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 5} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Greene.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 6} As an initial matter, the timeliness of the affidavit warrants discussion. R.C. 2701.03(B) requires that an affidavit of disqualification must be filed \u201cnot less than seven calendar days before the day on which the next hearing in the proceeding is scheduled.\u201d This statutory deadline may be set aside, however, \u201cwhen compliance with the provision is impossible,\u201d such as when the alleged bias or prejudice occurs fewer than seven days before the hearing date. <em>In re Disqualification of Leskovyansky, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1210, 723 N.E.2d 1099 (1999); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Squire, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 110, 2007-Ohio-5588, 876 N.E.2d 933, \u00b6 27. Here, Carulas filed her affidavit of disqualification on February 2, 2015, although a hearing was scheduled for the following day. Carulas contends that the affidavit could not have been filed earlier because the \u201cdirect incidence of bias and prejudice\u201d occurred at the February 2 conference. In light of Carulas\u2019s averments, the clerk properly accepted the affidavit for filing despite the seven-day requirement in R.C. 2701.03(B). <em>See In re Disqualification of Squire, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1202, 2005-Ohio-7157, 850 N.E.2d 709, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 7} Turning to the merits, Carulas has not set forth sufficient grounds for disqualification. First, the fact that Judge Greene ruled against defendants\u2019 insurance carrier in a prior case does not demonstrate that the judge was then or is now biased against defendants. \u201cState and federal courts have been virtually unanimous in holding that \u2014 absent a showing of actual bias \u2014 a judge who presided over prior proceedings involving one or more parties presently before the court is not thereby disqualified from presiding over later proceedings involving the same parties.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Bryant, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 4. This principle is especially true here, where defendants\u2019 insurance carrier is not a party to the underlying case and apparently ten years have passed since Judge Greene\u2019s previous action involving the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 8} Second, Judge Greene\u2019s alleged \u201cvengeance\u201d comment at the February 2 conference does not conclusively demonstrate that she is biased or prejudiced against defendants. In disqualification requests, \u201c[t]he term \u2018bias or prejudice\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>\u2018implies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). Here, Judge Greene\u2019s choice of words upon learning of Carulas\u2019s previous objection may not have been ideal. Attorneys should be free to challenge, in appropriate legal settings, a court\u2019s perceived partiality without the court misconstruing the intent of the challenge. <em>See Disciplinary Counsel v. Shimko, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 544, 2012-Ohio-5694, 983 N.E.2d 1300, \u00b6 32. However, the judge\u2019s comment, by itself, does not prove that the judge has hostile feelings or a spirit of ill will toward Carulas or her clients, nor does the comment indicate any fixed anticipatory judgment in the underlying case warranting the judge\u2019s removal. <em>See In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302 (judge\u2019s choice of words was not ideal, but the affidavits did not establish that the judge was unable to decide the remaining issues in the case fairly and impartially).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Given Judge Greene\u2019s assurances that she will hear this case fairly and impartially, those presumptions have not been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Greene.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
