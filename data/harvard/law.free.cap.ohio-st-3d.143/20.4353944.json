For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">{\u00b6 2} Smith was found guilty of several offenses in 2004. He filed an appeal and apparently several other actions based on that judgment. <em>See, e.g., State v. Smith, </em>1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-040348, 2005-Ohio-1325, 2005 WL 678532 (direct appeal). He filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the court of appeals, seeking to compel the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to file-stamp the original sentencing entry. He claimed that the entry was never file-stamped and therefore is not a final, appealable order. The court of appeals dismissed the action by entry on December 31, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">{\u00b6 3} We reject Smith\u2019s claim for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">{\u00b6 4} First, Smith actually appealed his convictions, and he successfully argued that his sentencing was deficient in that the court failed to advise him of the possibility of postrelease control. 2005-0hio-1325, 2005 WL 678532, \u00b6 22-23. Presumably, a new entry was issued correcting the deficiency and superseding the 2004 entry, although no party here has provided a copy. In any case, having successfully appealed the 2004 sentence, Smith cannot now claim that the entry was not final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">{\u00b6 5} Second, Smith has failed to show that the time stamp was inadequate. We have held that \u201ca judgment of conviction is a final order subject to appeal under R.C. 2505.02 when the judgment entry sets forth (1) the fact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>conviction, (2) the sentence, (3) the judge\u2019s signature, and (4) the time stamp indicating the entry upon the journal by the clerk.\u201d <em>State v. Lester, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 303, 2011-Ohio-5204, 958 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 14. What appears on the entry is a stamped box containing the printed words \u201cEntered Date\u201d and \u201cImage,\u201d next to which the date and image number have been written by hand.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ahm\">Courtney Smith, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Judith Anton Lapp, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 6} Smith argues that this method does not constitute a file stamp by the clerk. But he points to no case requiring the time stamp to be exclusively mechanical and without a handwritten date. One case he cites is inapposite because it involves a file folder containing handwritten notes by the judge, one of which had a date \u201c11-13-07.\u201d There was no indication that anything in the folder had been journalized, i.e., there was no time stamp at all. The case did not involve a file stamp with a handwritten date notation as we have here. <em>State v. Charlton, </em>9th Dist. Summit No. 24035, 2008-Ohio-3771, 2008 WL 2924654. Another, <em>State v. Domers, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 592, 575 N.E.2d 832 (1991), likewise does not apply because it states only that the entry was not file-stamped; it gave no indication whether the stamp was missing altogether or was inadequate in some Ayay.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 7} Smith has not shown that the 2004 entry was not file-stamped and was not a final, appealable order. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-17\">.
