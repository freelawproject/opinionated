On September 3, 2014, relator, Medina County Bar Association, charged Shirer with professional misconduct in one client matter. Relator alleged that Shirer was retained by a client to obtain the dissolution of her marriage. Relator claimed that Shirer failed to file an agreed qualified domestic-relations order (\u201cQDRO\u201d) with the domestic-relations court and with the entity that administered the pension of his client\u2019s ex-husband. Many years later, Shirer\u2019s client had to retain a new attorney to file the QDRO and to represent her when her former husband disputed that some of the retirement benefits existed at the time of the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 3} In the consent-to-discipline agreement, Shirer stipulates to the facts alleged in relator\u2019s complaint and agrees that his conduct violated DR 6-101(A)(3) of the Code of Professional Responsibility (prohibiting neglect of an entrusted legal matter).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulate that applicable mitigating factors include the absence of a prior disciplinary record, the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, Shirer\u2019s cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, and evidence of his good character or reputation. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (d), and (e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the panel\u2019s and the board\u2019s determinations that Shirer\u2019s payment of $800 to the client\u2019s current attorney, while not constituting \u201crestitution\u201d in the true sense of the word, nevertheless was an effort to rectify the consequences of Shirer\u2019s misconduct and qualifies as a mitigating factor. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(c). The parties agree that there are no aggravating factors. Based upon Shirer\u2019s stipulated misconduct and these factors, the parties stipulate that the appropriate sanction is a public reprimand.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5K\">Patricia A. Walker, Bar Counsel; and Jeandrevin &amp; Parker, L.L.C., and Andrew M. Parker, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AEO\">Bruce Hall Co., L.P.A., and Bruce E.

Therefore, we adopt the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 7} Accordingly, Albert Duane Shirer is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs are taxed to Shirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">.
