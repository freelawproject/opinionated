On October 15, 2009, we suspended his license to practice on an interim basis pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4) upon receiving notice that he had been convicted of a felony. <em>In re Ballato, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1427, 2009-Ohio-5467, 914 N.E.2d 1066. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we now indefinitely suspend Ballato on findings that by engaging in the conduct underlying his felony conviction for possession of child pornography, he violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude) and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). Neither party objects to the board\u2019s findings of misconduct or its recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">{\u00b6 2} On review, we find that Ballato committed the charged violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and we indefinitely suspend him from the practice of law in Ohio with no credit for the time served under his interim felony suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Findings of Fact and Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">{\u00b6 3} Over the course of his legal career, Ballato was fired on three separate occasions for using office computers to view Internet pornography. He voluntarily enrolled in a six-week residential treatment program for sexual addiction in 2002 \u2014 although he did not believe that he had a problem at that time \u2014 in an effort to save his first marriage. After the marriage ended the following year, he struggled to cope with the divorce and his former wife\u2019s efforts to curtail his visitation with their young son.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Although Ballato participated in some group counseling, he continued to view pornography and remained in denial of his addiction. In 2004, he responded to an online advertisement for \u201camateur pornography for sale,\u201d and in the course of an e-mail exchange, the seller revealed that the offer was for child pornography. Ballato placed an order and mailed a partial payment for the magazines. Although he testified that he later decided not to complete the transaction, he did not cancel the order. On October 4, 2004, the magazines were delivered by an undercover postal inspector to Ballato\u2019s home while he was at work. Shortly thereafter, federal officers arrived and conducted searches at both his home and office.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 5} The officers found an abundance of adult pornography and three images of child pornography on Ballato\u2019s office computer. At the panel hearing, Ballato testified that he had requested and received the images of child pornography online by instant message. He deleted them shortly after receiving them and reports that he did not use the images for sexual gratification. He reported that his sexual preference is adult women. Although he acknowledged that he developed a curiosity about teenage girls in pornography, he denied having any sexual interest in prepubescent children.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 6} In September 2006, Ballato was indicted on federal charges of receipt of child pornography and possession of child pornography as a result of the information obtained in the 2004 raid.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 7} Ballato eventually entered a conditional plea of guilty to a single charge of possessing child pornography, for which he received a sentence of 48 months in prison, a $100 fine, 100 hours of community service, and lifetime supervised release. He served 43 months in prison and was released in November 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 8} The board found that by ordering and possessing child pornography, Ballato engaged in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude and that that conduct adversely reflected on his fitness to practice, in violation of DR 1-102(A)(3) and 1 \u2014 102(A)(6). Because this conduct occurred in 2004, however, the board found no violation of the corresponding Rules of Professional Conduct, which were also charged in the complaint, because those rules apply only to conduct occurring on or after February 1, 2007. We adopt the board\u2019s findings that Ballato\u2019s conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(3) and 1-102(A)(6) and hereby dismiss the alleged violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">{\u00b6 9} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 10} The board found as aggravating factors that Ballato had a selfish motive in viewing and possessing child pornography, that he committed multiple offenses by downloading images from the Internet and ordering magazines, and that the victims of child pornography are inherently vulnerable. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (d), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 11} The board also found a number of significant mitigating factors. Ballato had practiced law for approximately ten years with no prior disciplinary offenses. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). From the beginning, he has accepted full responsibility for his misconduct and has fully cooperated in the disciplinary proceedings. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). And his misconduct did not harm any clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 12} Ballato also served 43 months in prison and has been sentenced to a lifetime of supervised release. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(f). Conditions of that supervised release currently prohibit him from using a computer unless it is necessary for his employment or approved by his probation officer and from having any unsupervised contact with minor children \u201cwith the exception of contact that may occur during the course of employment, provided that the [contact] occurs in a public setting and is in the discharge of his official job duties.\u201d He is also required to participate in mental-health counseling, submit to polygraph testing, and permit searches of his person and property (including papers and electronic data) at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 13} Shortly after the raid of his home and office, Ballato commenced counseling for his sex addiction and sought assistance from Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (\u201cSLAA\u201d), a 12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. He understands that he will likely need to attend these meetings for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 14} Once indicted, Ballato voluntarily ceased the practice of law, though he testified that he did not register his license as inactive until approximately January 1, 2008. From his arraignment in October 2006 until his sentencing hearing in April 2009, he remained on home detention with electronic monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">{\u00b6 15} Following his release from prison, Ballato submitted to a sex-offender assessment conducted by Susan Ullman, L.I.S.W.-S., who diagnosed him with major depressive disorder and a hypersexual disorder. He is not classified as a pedophile.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">{\u00b6 16} In January 2013, Ballato commenced individual and group therapy with Ullman, who has extensive experience providing sexual-offender counseling, and he continued to participate in therapy at the time of his disciplinary hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Ullman testified that he has been cooperative and eager to participate in counseling sessions and that despite a long commute, he has had no unexcused absences. She reports that unlike most untreated sexual offenders she has encountered, Ballato has always taken responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 17} Ullman also testified that Ballato\u2019s diagnoses of major depressive disorder and a hypersexual disorder were \u201cin large part responsible for the poor decisions that he made\u201d and that he does not present a high risk of reoffending. The board found, however, that he had not achieved a sufficient, sustained period of successful treatment and therefore determined that his mental disability did not qualify as a mitigating factor. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g) (providing that in order to accord mitigating effect to a mental disability, there must be (i) a diagnosis by a qualified healthcare professional, (ii) a determination that the mental disability contributed to cause the misconduct, (iii) a sustained period of successful treatment, and (iv) a prognosis from a qualified healthcare professional that the attorney will be able to return to the competent, ethical, professional practice of law under specified conditions). At the time of his hearing, he had been in counseling for less than ten months because no treatment was available to him in prison. But Ullman testified that the standard treatment program takes approximately two years and usually requires follow-up sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 18} With regard to Ballato\u2019s supervised release, Ullman testified that lifetime supervision is \u201ca relatively recent phenomenon\u201d and that she had no knowledge of anyone having sought to terminate a lifetime period of supervised release. Therefore, the board presumed that Ballato would actually remain on supervised release for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 19} In addition to the criminal penalties imposed for his conduct, Ballato testified that his addiction has cost him two marriages, his son, and his career. His biggest regret is the loss of his relationship with his son, whom he last saw in 2006, and who has since been adopted \u2014 with Ballato\u2019s consent \u2014 by his stepfather. Ballato currently works as a dishwasher and cook at a restaurant, earning $8.25 an hour. He is committed to informing potential employers and, one day, clients about his history.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">{\u00b6 20} Relator recommended that Ballato be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law with no credit for time served under his interim felony suspension. Ballato, however, sought some credit for time served. Comparing the facts of this case to <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Greenberg, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 430, 2013-Ohio-1723, 988 N.E.2d 559, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ridenbaugh, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 583, 2009-Ohio-4091, 913 N.E.2d 443, the panel recommended that we indefinitely suspend Ballato and give him credit for the time served under his interim felony suspension. Without stating its reasoning, the board, however, recommends that we give him no credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>{\u00b6 21} We indefinitely suspended Greenberg without credit for time served for possessing child pornography and transferring obscene materials to minors. <em>Greenberg </em>at \u00b6 4, 13. The panel, therefore, distinguished Ballato\u2019s conduct from Greenberg\u2019s on the basis that Ballato was convicted only of possessing child pornography and that he did not contact, or even attempt to contact a minor, as Greenberg had. And although Ballato\u2019s offense appeared to be less serious, the panel noted that he served a prison sentence almost twice as long as Greenberg\u2019s sentence and will be supervised for the rest of his life, while Greenberg received a five-year period of supervised release. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 22} The panel also found <em>Ridenbaugh </em>to be instructive, noting that Riden-baugh had pleaded guilty to pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor and illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. <em>Ridenbaugh </em>at \u00b6 7. Although Ridenbaugh\u2019s offenses appear to be more egregious than Ballato\u2019s, he served only 56 days of his 48-month federal prison sentence before he was released and placed on community control for five years, with requirements that he enter therapy and complete 300 hours of community service, among other restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 23} Ridenbaugh presented testimony from a social worker from the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d) that he had completed a sustained period of successful treatment for his dysthymia* chronic substance abuse, paraphilia, and attention deficit disorder. <em>Ridenbaugh, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 583, 2009-0hio-4091, 913 N.E.2d 443, \u00b6 32. But we expressed concern about the frequency of his psychotherapy appointments, which had been reduced from once every two weeks to once every three and one-half weeks due to his financial constraints, and we inferred that he needed greater psychiatric oversight than he could currently afford. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 31-33. We also found that his treating psychiatrist expressed \u201ctoo much equivocation\u201d in his optimism for Ridenbaugh\u2019s immediate future. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 24} Presented with the panel\u2019s recommendation that Ridenbaugh be suspended for two years, <em>without </em>credit for time served under his interim suspension, and the board\u2019s recommendation that he be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, <em>with </em>credit for time served \u2014 and thereby subject to the more stringent process of petitioning for reinstatement pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B) \u2014 we adopted the board\u2019s recommendation. In doing so, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">We order respondent\u2019s indefinite suspension from practice and rely on the reinstatement process to determine when respondent is capable of practicing within ethical constraints. On the other hand, we also see no reason to prevent respondent from attempting to qualify for reinstatement beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the two-year bar imposed by Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B) and therefore also afford credit for the interim suspension of his license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 25} Because we granted Ridenbaugh credit for time served, he was technically eligible to apply for reinstatement in February 2010 \u2014 two years after his interim felony suspension was imposed \u2014 but the opportunity to apply for reinstatement is not a guarantee that an attorney\u2019s license will, in fact, be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 26} Before an attorney can benefit from a grant of credit for time served, the attorney must first establish that he or she presently possesses all the mental, educational, and moral qualifications that are required of an applicant for admission to the practice of law in Ohio at the time of the applicant\u2019s original admission and must comply with the continuing-legal-edueation (\u201cCLE\u201d) requirements of Gov.Bar R. X(13) (requiring a suspended attorney to complete one hour of CLE for each month or part of a month of the attorney\u2019s suspension). <em>See </em>Gov.Bar R. V(10)(E)(l)(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 27} Furthermore, a suspended attorney who has been placed on community control must either demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he has completed his community control, Gov.Bar R. V(10)(E)(l)(d), <em>or </em>provide an affidavit from the trial judge stating that the attorney is in compliance with the terms of community control and establish by clear and convincing evidence that good cause exists for this court to waive the requirement that the attorney\u2019s community control be completed before reinstatement. Gov.Bar R. V(10)(E)(2). Thus, even with credit for the time he had served under his interim felony suspension, Ridenbaugh faced more than three years of community control that could prevent him from being reinstated. <em>Ridenbaugh, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 583, 2009-Ohio-4091, 913 N.E.2d 443, at \u00b6 1, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 28} At the time of Ballato\u2019s disciplinary hearing, he had not yet attained a sustained period of successful treatment for his depression and hypersexual disorder. He had not served a significant period of his term of supervised release, nor had he completed a single polygraph examination \u2014 though Ullman testified that the probation office generally requires them every six to twelve months. Ballato acknowledged that he was not ready to return to the practice of law, but he stated that he would like to work toward that goal and that it would probably take him a good year to complete his CLE requirements and get ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>to petition for reinstatement. He also expressed concern that the current conditions of his supervised release would leave his future client files open to search by his probation officer, and he expressed a desire to seek modification of those terms to protect his clients\u2019 confidentiality.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AsW\">Brian Douglas Weaver, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6y\">James Thomas Ambrose, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">{\u00b6 29} For these reasons, we believe that an indefinite suspension with no credit for time served will both protect the public and give Ballato the time that he needs to address these issues and demonstrate that he is ready to resume the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, Thomas Andrew Ballato is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio with no credit for time served under his interim felony suspension. Costs are taxed to Ballato.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-7\">Pfeifer, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b204-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, J., dissent and would disbar respondent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AGL\">Lanzinger, J., dissents and would grant credit for time served.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\">. Gov.Bar R. X(10)(E)(l)(e) requires a petitioner for reinstatement to establish by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe petitioner has complied with the continuing legal education requirements of Gov.Bar R. X, Section 3(G).\u201d However, amendments to Gov.Bar R. X, effective January 1, 2014, moved the CLE requirements for disciplined attorneys, formerly set forth in Gov.Bar R. X(3)(G), to Gov.Bar R.
