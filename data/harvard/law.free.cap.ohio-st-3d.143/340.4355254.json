We conclude that boards of revision do not. have that authority, and we hold that a board of revision must make a determination of value whenever a complaint properly invokes its jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBTA\u2019s\u201d) decision and remand the cause to the Auglaize County Board of Revision for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellees Charles and Christina Ginter filed a complaint with the Auglaize County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) challenging the auditor\u2019s valuation of their property for 2012 at $113,511. The Ginters proposed a value of $99,900. The complaint alleged that \u201c[cjomparable home sales and comparable market data of existing and recently sold homes reflect [the] requested change in value.\u201d In correspondence to the BOR dated April 15, 2013, the Ginters\u2019 attorney indicated that an arm\u2019s-length sale provided the basis for a reduced valuation. He submitted various documents supporting this argument, including a printout from the county auditor\u2019s website showing a transfer of the property on October 8, 2010, with a sale price of $99,900; a printout of the property-record card for the parcel, which notes the 2010 $99,900 sale price; a United States Department of Housing and Urban Development settlement statement relating to the sale that lists $99,900 as the \u201ccontract sale price\u201d; a printout from the website Zillow referring to the 2010 sale; and a copy of a BTA decision that granted a decrease in value to an owner based on evidence of an arm\u2019s-length sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">{\u00b6 3} The BOR notified the Ginters that a hearing would be held on May 30, 2013. Neither the Ginters nor anyone on their behalf appeared at the hearing. The absence of the complainants led to the dismissal of the complaint, which was embodied in an order and letter dated June 3, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">{\u00b6 4} The Ginters appealed. At the BTA, the BOR and the auditor moved for an order affirming the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">{\u00b6 5} The BTA stated in its decision that \u201ca board of revision has the discretion to dismiss a complaint when a complainant fails to appear at a duly scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>hearing,\u201d but that such discretionary authority \u201cis not without limits.\u201d BTA No. 2013-Y-1782, 2013 WL 6833846, *1. The BTA held that the BOR had exceeded those limits because the evidence presented raised the presumption that the sale furnished the criterion of value. The BTA concluded that the BOR had improperly dismissed the complaint. The BTA therefore reversed and directed the BOR \u201cto value the subject property in accordance with the sale amount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2. Appellants, the BOR and the county auditor, appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Boards of revision have the statutory duty to determine property value but lack authority to dismiss for failure to prosecute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"afi-dedup-0\">{\u00b6 6} We have long recognized that boards of revision are creatures of statute imbued only with the powers granted by their enabling laws. <em>Steward v. Evatt, </em>143 Ohio St. 547, 56 N.E.2d 159 (1944), paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Kohl\u2019s Illinois, Inc. v. Marion Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>140 Ohio St.3d 522, 2014-Ohio-4353, 20 N.E.3d 711, \u00b6 23. The statutes do not specifically confer a power to dismiss for failure to prosecute. Logic dictates, therefore, that boards of revision lack authority to dismiss for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 7} Twenty years ago, we departed from these basic legal precepts. In <em>LCL Income Properties v. Rhodes, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 652, 646 N.E.2d 1108 (1995), the property owner filed a complaint and failed to appear at the hearing, and the board of revision dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute. The BTA held that \u201cthe [board of revision] cannot avoid its statutory duty to render a decision on the value of the subject property by dismissing the action,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the available evidence supports the auditor\u2019s valuation, then the proper course would be to find value at the level determined by the auditor.\u201d BTA No. 92-J-1225, 1994 WL 93138, *1-2 (Mar. 18, 1994). On appeal, we reversed, stating that \u201c[t]he BTA\u2019s decision requiring the board of revision to revalue every property complained of, even if the complainant does not appear at a hearing to contest the valuation, and even if the complainant presents no evidence, is unreasonable.\u201d 71 Ohio St.3d at 653. Such a requirement \u201cignores the primary obligation of a property owner who challenges a real property valuation: to sustain the burden of proving that the property has been overvalued.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 8} Today we acknowledge that <em>LCL Properties </em>was wrongly decided and that the BTA was right. In doing so, we are setting aside the extrastatutory dismissal power and enforcing the statutory duty of boards of revision to hear and decide complaints by determining value.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>LCL Properties, </em>we relied on <em>Swetland Co. v. Evatt, </em>139 Ohio St. 6, 37 N.E.2d 601 (1941). That reliance was misplaced because <em>Swetland </em>was inappo-site to <em>LCL Properties. </em>In <em>Swetland, </em>the property owners had contested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>valuations by the county but made payment based on the assessed value without properly protesting the payment of the portion sought to be recovered. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. Under the law, the property owners thereby forfeited their right to relief from the overvaluation of their properties. <em>Id. </em>at 22 (\u201cWe conclude that the Board of Tax Appeals was right in holding that the payment of the 1937 taxes in full was voluntary and that the question before the county board of revision was moot\u201d). <em>See also id. </em>at paragraphs three and four of the syllabus. The board of revision, after giving the property owners multiple opportunities to submit evidence, issued a dispositive order retaining the auditor\u2019s valuation on the grounds that the property owners had not presented evidence of different values. <em>See id. </em>at 15, 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 10} On appeal, this court approved the action of the board of revision and the action of the BTA. As to the board of revision\u2019s disposition, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">Even after one dismissal of the complaints by the county board of revision, [the property owners] failed to appear or offer evidence before such board. Under such circumstances, the county board of revision was justified in determining and fixing the taxable valuation of the property both as to the land and improvements at the same figure indicated in the assessment made by the county auditor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 22-23. We affirmed the BTA, which had dismissed the appeals on the grounds of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 11} It is apparent that <em>Swetland </em>does not provide support for our holding in <em>LCL Properties </em>for the simple reason that <em>Swetland </em>did not involve a dismissal by the board of revision for failure to prosecute. Instead, <em>Swetland </em>involved the board of revision\u2019s decision to retain the auditor\u2019s valuation because of the lack of evidence presented by the property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 12} We stated in <em>LCL Properties </em>that \u201cthe practical result of the dismissal\u201d by the board of revision is that \u201cit fixes \u2018the valuation complained of in the amount assessed by the county auditor.\u2019 \u201d 71 Ohio St.3d at 653, quoting <em>Swetland, </em>139 Ohio St. 6, 37 N.E.2d 601, paragraph nine of the syllabus. The result of permitting dismissal by the board of revision was a new layer of litigation concerning the propriety of the board of revision\u2019s dismissal, which distracts from the proper focus: the valuation of the property. <em>See Snavely v. Erie Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 500, 678 N.E.2d 1373 (1997); <em>Kalmbach Wagner Swine Research Farm v. Wyandot Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 319, 691 N.E.2d 270 (1998); <em>Leach v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 170, 761 N.E.2d 36 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>{\u00b6 13} <em>LCL Properties </em>also states that there are \u201cmany situations in which dismissal is the proper solution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. We pointed to two such instances: failing to timely file a notice of appeal and filing a second complaint during the three-year interim period in violation of the triennial rule of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2). <em>Id. </em>But those situations are inapposite because they involve jurisdictional defects, and boards of revision have the same inherent authority that all tribunals must have to determine whether they can properly take jurisdiction of the matter presented to them. <em>See Kohl\u2019s Illinois, Inc., </em>140 Ohio St.3d 522, 2014-Ohio-4353, 20 N.E.3d 711, \u00b6 26 (acknowledging that a board of revision is \u201cjustified in dismissing a complaint when a violation of statutory requirements deprives the board of jurisdiction\u201d), citing <em>Kalmbach Wagner Swine Research Farm. </em>In <em>LCL Properties, </em>as in the present appeal, the issue is whether a complaint can be dismissed for failure to prosecute under circumstances in which the board of revision clearly possesses jurisdiction to determine the property\u2019s value. We erred in <em>LCL Properties </em>by relying on cases involving jurisdictional defects to justify a nonjurisdictional dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 14} In the instant case, the BOR clearly had jurisdiction and the Ginters submitted some evidence beyond the complaint. Despite this, the BOR concluded that the Ginters\u2019 failure to appear at the hearing justified dismissal for failure to prosecute. The unfairness of that result has led us to review <em>LCL Properties, </em>which, as noted, was wrongly reasoned and decided and began a practice of sanctioning dismissals of eases by boards of revision for reasons other than jurisdictional defects. We remedy our error today by overruling <em>LCL Properties. </em>In doing so, we return to the statutorily prescribed path of requiring a determination of value whenever a complaint properly invokes a board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 15} This change is procedural in character. Taxpayers will benefit because they will be assured of obtaining a determination of value, even if that determination retains the auditor\u2019s valuation. The result is that the issue of value will be front and center, as it should be, both before the board of revision and at the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 16} The foregoing discussion establishes that the BTA\u2019s decision is correct in determining that dismissal was improper, though for a different reason than that articulated by the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\n<em>The cause must be remanded to the BOR so that it may evaluate the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 17} The BTA regarded the sale-price evidence as raising an unrebutted presumption in favor of using the sale price to value the property. Appellants argue that the burden on the owner to make a prima facie case for relying on the sale price has not been met and that the evidence is not sufficient to raise the presumption, either at the BOR or at the BTA. Appellants assert that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>BOR\u2019s dismissal was improper, the BTA should have remanded the cause to the BOR for valuation. We agree.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ae1\">Rich &amp; Gillis Law Group, L.L.C., Kelley A. Gorry, and James A. Gorry, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 18} Because it dismissed the complaint, the BOR expressed no opinion concerning the sale price. Given that the October 2010 sale for $99,900 is noted on the property-record card as an \u201cunvalidated\u201d sale, the auditor is presumed to have considered and rejected the sale as an indication of value. <em>See Akron City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 92, 2014-Ohio-1588, 9 N.E.3d 1004, \u00b6 23-26. But the BOR has yet to determine the value of the property. As a result, it is premature for either the BTA or this court to address the issue of value. We agree with appellants that the cause must be remanded to the BOR for a determination of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 19} When the BOR deliberates on the property value in this case, further documentation might become part of the record, and that in turn might affect the review by the BTA. <em>See Mason City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 153, 2014-Ohio-104, 4 N.E.3d 1027, \u00b6 47-48 (the BTA is obliged to consider the specific findings by the board of revision), citing <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 27, 2009-Ohio-5932, 918 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 20} Because the BOR has not yet determined a value and because such a determination by the BOR might affect the manner in which the BTA decides the case on appeal, we decline to review the BTA\u2019s determination of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 21} For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the BTA\u2019s decision and remand the cause to the BOR for a determination of value. Because we have reached our decision based on the fourth proposition of law and remanded based on the fifth proposition of law, it is unnecessary for us to consider the first, second, and third propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Decision vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
