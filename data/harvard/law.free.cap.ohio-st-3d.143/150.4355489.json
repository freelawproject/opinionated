In exchange, some of the charges against Gilbert were amended or dismissed. The trial court proceeded to sentence Gilbert without waiting for him to testify against his father as anticipated in the plea agreement. Later, after he began serving his time in prison, he refused to testify as promised. A year after he was sentenced, the state claimed that Gilbert had breached the plea agreement by failing to give truthful testimony against his father. He was brought back to court from prison, the trial court threw out the former plea, and Gilbert entered a second plea. He was resentenced, and he then appealed to the First District Court of Appeals. That court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, holding that the trial court did not have the authority to reconsider its own final judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">{\u00b6 3} Once the final judgment was entered and Gilbert was sentenced to prison, the trial court lost jurisdiction to vacate its judgment of conviction and to resentence Gilbert. There must be finality to a court\u2019s judgment. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>authority for a court to revisit a sentence that has already been imposed based on a defendant\u2019s failure to fulfill his obligations under a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 4} Kareem Gilbert was indicted by the Hamilton County Grand Jury on March 12, 2009, on two counts of aggravated murder with firearm specifications, two counts of having weapons while under disability, and one count of intimidation of a witness. On May 18, 2010, Gilbert entered into a plea agreement whereby he would plead guilty to one count of manslaughter with a firearm specification, one count of having weapons while under disability, and one count of intimidation of a witness and be sentenced to 18 years in prison. In exchange, Gilbert agreed to cooperate with the state and testify in a murder prosecution against his father, Ruben Jordan. Gilbert was sentenced the same day to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 5} On May 18, 2011, exactly one year later, the state asked the trial court to vacate Gilbert\u2019s plea because he had failed to cooperate with the state in its prosecution of Jordan. The trial court granted the request, withdrew the original plea agreement, and vacated the sentence. Based upon the trial court\u2019s action, Gilbert entered into a second plea agreement and was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years to life. He filed a direct appeal on June 23, 2011, and subsequently filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no meritorious issues to argue. However, on March 30, 2012, the appellate court ordered briefing on the issue whether the trial court had authority to grant the state\u2019s motion to vacate Gilbert\u2019s original plea and then reconsider its own judgment and resentence Gilbert. 2012-Ohio-1366, 2012 WL 1072749, \u00b6 7-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 6} On January 30, 2013, the appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision by a two-to-one vote. 2013-Ohio-238, 2013 WL 359660. Specifically, the appellate court held that the trial court did not have the authority to reconsider its final judgment after the defendant had been sentenced. The fact that the defendant had breached the plea agreement was and is irrelevant. Once the defendant was sentenced, a final order existed, and there was no authority for the trial court to revisit its judgment even though the plea agreement had been breached. The court of appeals reversed and remanded to the trial court to vacate its May 2011 order granting the state\u2019s motion to vacate the original plea and sentence and to reinstate its May 2010 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">{\u00b6 7} The question at the center of this appeal is whether a trial court can revisit its earlier acceptance of a plea agreement and final judgment when a defendant fails to abide by the terms of that plea agreement. The answer to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>question is undoubtedly no. The state argues that the plea agreement is a contract between the state and the defendant and that a breach of that contract requires a court to revisit the original plea and treat it as though the agreement had never been made. While this may appear to be an equitable outcome, it simply is not supported by the law. It would require that a trial court have jurisdiction to reconsider its own valid final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 8} Crim.R. 32(C) lists the requirements for a valid final judgment in a criminal case. It provides that a judgment must set forth the fact of the conviction, the sentence, the judge\u2019s signature, and the time stamp indicating that the clerk entered the judgment in the journal. We have said that such a judgment \u201cis a final order subject to appeal under R.C. 2505.02.\u201d <em>State v. Lester, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 303, 2011-Ohio-5204, 958 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 1. <em>See also State v. Carlisle, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 127, 2011-Ohio-6553, 961 N.E.2d 671, \u00b6 11 (a judgment.of conviction is final when it meets each of the requirements of Crim.R. 32(C)). In the present case, the May 24, 2010 judgment of the trial court finding Gilbert guilty and sentencing him to 18 years in prison satisfied each of those four requirements. It was, therefore, a valid final order. Additionally, \u201c[a]bsent statutory authority, a trial court is generally not empowered to modify a criminal sentence by reconsidering its own final judgment.\u201d <em>Carlisle </em>at \u00b6 1. This court is committed to the principle that finality creates \u201c \u2018 \u201ccertainty in the law and public confidence in the system\u2019s ability to resolve disputes.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Nelson-Miller, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 381, 2012-Ohio-2845, 972 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Strack v. Pelton, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 172, 175, 637 N.E.2d 914 (1994), quoting <em>Knapp v. Knapp, </em>24 Ohio St.3d 141, 144-145, 493 N.E.2d 1353 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">{\u00b6 9} Once a final judgment has been issued pursuant to Crim.R. 32, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction ends. While this court does not dispute the fact that contract principles generally apply to the interpretation and enforcement of plea agreements, <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 50, those principles are not so flexible as to permit jurisdiction to be maintained in perpetuity to enforce such agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">{\u00b6 10} The state also argues that Gilbert submitted to the court\u2019s jurisdiction when he entered a second plea after he was brought back to the trial court for resentencing. But the trial court no longer had jurisdiction, and a defendant cannot waive that which does not exist. <em>Colley v. Colley, </em>43 Ohio St.3d 87, 92, 538 N.E.2d 410 (1989) (subject-matter jurisdiction generally cannot be effected by agreement or consent). In <em>State v. Purnell, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 446, 2006-Ohio-6160, 871 N.E.2d 613, \u00b6 12 (1st Dist.), the First District Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">The parties cannot confer by consent or acquiescence subject-matter jurisdiction on a court where it is otherwise lacking. See <em>Colley v. Colley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 87, 92, 538 N.E.2d 410, citing <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm. v. Schor </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 833, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 92 L.Ed.2d 675; see, also, <em>State v. Flynt </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 315, 317, 73 O.O.2d 373, 338 N.E.2d 554 (\u201cSince jurisdiction of subject matter is fixed by law, the consent of the defendant cannot create such jurisdiction\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">{\u00b6 11} The state relies on numerous cases to support its argument that the trial court retains jurisdiction when a defendant breaches a plea agreement, including <em>Bethel; State v. Adkins, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 114, 2005-Ohio-2577, 829 N.E.2d 729; and <em>State v. Gilroy, </em>195 Ohio App.3d 173, 2011-Ohio-4163, 959 N.E.2d 19. However, in each of these cases, the defendant had not been sentenced at the time the trial court considered whether the plea agreement had been breached. Thus, each of these cases is distinguishable because the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction was not an issue. Instead, in each of these cases, the state followed the common practice of ensuring that the defendant had complied with the plea agreement prior to imposing the sentence and entering a final judgment. Should a defendant experience a change of heart and renege on a plea agreement before a sentence has been imposed, the trial court is still able to ensure that the defendant does not receive anything that he or she is not entitled to receive regarding the dismissal of any charges or a lesser sentence. There is no justification to create an exception from this standard procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 12} In its second proposition of law, the state asserts that double jeopardy does not prevent the second prosecution of Gilbert. A review of the appellate court\u2019s opinion, however, reveals that it never addressed Gilbert\u2019s double-jeopardy argument but found, instead, that it was moot. It appears that the state raised this argument to preempt Gilbert\u2019s possible argument that the resentenc-ing was prohibited by double jeopardy. It is not an affirmative argument, and based on our decision to uphold the decision of the First District Court of Appeals that Gilbert could not be reconvicted and resentenced on grounds other than double jeopardy, it is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 13} Based upon the foregoing analysis, we hold that once a defendant has been sentenced by a trial court, that court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a motion by the state to vacate the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and sentence based upon the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of a plea agreement. If the trial court is concerned with the defendant abiding by the terms of the plea agreement, the solution is to postpone sentencing until after the defendant has performed the desired act. As every teacher knows, you reward the student after the desired behavior occurs, not before. Much like teaching, plea negotiations are driven by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the fact that the incentive to do the act in question disappears once the reward has been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">{\u00b6 14} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lanzinger, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b276-7\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b276-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 15} Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 16} This case presents two principal issues for our consideration: one, whether a court has inherent authority to vacate a judgment in a criminal case to correct a fraud perpetrated against it by a defendant and two, whether double jeopardy bars further prosecution of that defendant. My views are that the court does have such authority and that double jeopardy does not bar further prosecution of the defendant who purported to commit fraud against the court and who expressly waived that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 17} Appellee, Kareem Gilbert, perpetrated a fraud on the trial court by providing a 50-page written statement to the state and agreeing to testify truthfully about criminal violations of his father in exchange for a favorable plea to a lesser included offense and later recanting that statement. Because he did so, the court vacated his guilty plea to a lesser but included offense and the judgment of conviction. Double jeopardy is not at issue in this case, because Gilbert expressly waived this constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">{\u00b6 18} Around 1:00 a.m. on the morning of October 16, 2008, Kareem Gilbert, Bryan Austin, and Victor Davis were near the intersection of Elder and Republic Streets in Cincinnati, Ohio. Gilbert began to argue with Austin, and Austin hit Gilbert with a meatball sub sandwich that spilled onto Gilbert\u2019s white T-shirt. Gilbert left, retrieved a handgun, returned, and shot Austin numerous times, killing him. The state alleged that Gilbert later shot and killed Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">{\u00b6 19} On March 12, 2009, a Hamilton County grand jury indicted Gilbert on two counts of aggravated murder with firearm specifications, one count of witness intimidation, and two counts of having a weapon while under disability. Gilbert pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">{\u00b6 20} About 14 months later \u2014 on May 18, 2010 \u2014 the parties entered into a plea agreement, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>2. The Defendant agrees to provide truthful, complete, and accurate information during the investigation and prosecution of any criminal offenses of which he has relevant information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">3. The Defendant agrees to testify truthfully, completely, and accurately in any legal proceeding in which he is called to testify as a witness, including but not limited to any juvenile proceeding, grand jury, or trial, whether civil or criminal in nature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">4. Specifically, the Defendant agrees to give truthful and complete testimony as a State\u2019s witness against Ruben Jordan. The Defendant states the statement he provided to the Cincinnati Police Department on May 17, 2010, regarding Mr. Jordan was truthful and complete. The Defendant additionally agrees to testify truthfully before the Hamilton County Grand Jury. * * * Furthermore, the Defendant agrees to testify concerning any criminal violations against any and all individuals targeted in these investigations resulting from cooperation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">5. In exchange for and in consideration of the aforementioned cooperation, the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office agrees to resolve the Defendant\u2019s pending cases in the following manner: Defendant will plea to Count one as voluntary manslaughter with a firearm specification, count two weapon under disability, and count three intimidation of crime victim/witness. The State will dismiss all remaining counts and specifications. The State would enter into an agreed prison sentence of 18 years in the Ohio Department of Corrections. The Defendant further states that he has been promised nothing in addition to that which is stated herein, and that this document fully incorporates the complete understanding of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">6. The Defendant agrees and understands that completion of the terms of this agreement is to be determined by the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. If it is determined by the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office that at any time the Defendant fails to cooperate fully, refuses to testify, or testifies falsely in any proceeding, intentionally gives false, misleading, or incomplete information or testimony, compromises his value as a witness, or otherwise violates any terms of this agreement, then the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office may reinstate the original charges against the Defendant as well as any additional charges which may be appropriate. The parties will be returned to their respective positions prior to the execution of this agreement with the expressed exception that the proffer statement taken of the Defendant is admissible in the prosecution against him, as provided in Paragraph Two: (\u00b6 2) above. Additional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ly, the Defendant specifically waives an argument of double jeopardy or speedy trial rights with regard to any charges against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">7. The Defendant waives any Constitutional or statutory rights to a speedy trial during the life of this agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">8. The Defendant waives any Constitutional right against twice being placed in jeopardy with respect to any offenses that the State may prosecute if this agreement is terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 21} In accordance with this agreement, Gilbert withdrew his not guilty pleas and pleaded guilty to one count of voluntary manslaughter with a firearm specification, one count of having a weapon while under a disability, and one count of witness intimidation, with the parties agreeing to an aggregate 18-year prison term. At the May 18, 2010 sentencing hearing, Gilbert specifically agreed to abide by the plea agreement. In exchange for the reduction of one aggravated murder charge to voluntary manslaughter and the dismissal of the other aggravated murder charge and a charge of having a weapon while under disability, the state represented to the court that Gilbert</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">agreed and entered into a written agreement with the State to provide truthful, complete, and accurate information during the investigation and to testify in the prosecution of his father, Ruben Jordan, who [was] charged with the aggravated murder of Victor Davis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">By entry dated May 24, 2010, the trial court convicted Gilbert of three offenses, dismissed two charges, and imposed the recommended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">{\u00b6 22} Later, the state moved to vacate the plea agreement. At the hearing on its motion to vacate, it argued that Gilbert had failed to give truthful testimony against his father. The prosecutor represented that Gilbert \u201crecanted his 50-page \u2014 some of it \u2014 -statement, especially as it pertained to Mr. Jordan, him eyewitnessing the murder of Mr. Davis and saying his father was the one that killed him. I think he said they were both at home * * * watching a football game.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">{\u00b6 23} Gilbert did not object to the state\u2019s motion, and his counsel conceded that Gilbert</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">broke his contract with the State by, at some point, giving incomplete information or perhaps inaccurate testimony at the time that the plea agreement was made and thereby not following through with that contract. And so, for that reason, he doesn\u2019t object to the plea being vacated, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>is his position that he gave truthful testimony during the trial against his father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Gilbert\u2019s counsel also stated: \u201cIt is his position that he told the truth on the stand and that he had lied prior to that to the State and to the officers in order to get a better deal for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 24} The court granted the state\u2019s motion and set aside Gilbert\u2019s plea. Pursuant to a second plea agreement, Gilbert pleaded guilty to one count of murder with a firearm specification and one count of having a weapon while under disability, with a recommended aggregate sentence of 18 years to life. The court convicted Gilbert of the two offenses and imposed the recommended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 25} Gilbert appealed. His counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw as appellate counsel. The appellate court determined that legal points arguable on their merits remained to be resolved, granted the motion to withdraw, appointed new counsel, and ordered briefing on whether the trial court \u201chad authority to grant the state\u2019s motion to vacate Gilbert\u2019s pleas and to reconsider and modify its May 2010 criminal sentence, and on any other matter counsel may discover in a diligent review of the record.\u201d 2012-Ohio-1366, 2012 WL 1072749, at \u00b6 10. The court of appeals subsequently reversed the trial court judgment, determining that the trial court \u201clacked the authority to reconsider the May 2010 valid final judgment.\u201d 2013-Ohio-238, 2013 WL 359660, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 26} The state appealed to this court. We accepted jurisdiction on two propositions of law raising these issues: whether, when a party breaches a plea agreement, a trial court has authority to vacate the plea and whether the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the reprosecution of Gilbert, when he \u201cunderstood that if he breached the agreement the original charges could be reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cFraud connotes perjury, falsification, concealment, misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Knauer v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 654, 657, 66 S.Ct. 1304, 90 L.Ed. 1500 (1946). While Gilbert maintained that he testified truthfully at his father\u2019s trial, the record suggests that he acted fraudulently in negotiating his first plea agreement. He essentially admitted to making misrepresentations to the state as demonstrated by his attorney\u2019s statement that Gilbert gave \u201cincomplete information and perhaps inaccurate testimony at the time that the plea agreement was made\u201d and he \u201chad lied * * * to the State and to the officers in order to get a better deal for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Gilbert also perpetrated a fraud on the trial court because, by fraudulently entering into the plea agreement, he tampered with the administration of justice and subverted the integrity of the judicial process as a whole. <em>See Coulson v. Coulson, </em>5 Ohio St.3d 12, 15, 448 N.E.2d 809 (1983) (\u201c \u2018Fraud upon the court\u2019 is an elusive concept. * * * It is generally agreed that \u2018 * * * [a]ny fraud connected with the presentation of a case to a court is a fraud upon the court, in a broad sense.\u2019 11 Wright <em>&amp; </em>Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure (1973) 253, Section 2870\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">(\u00b6 29} A federal court has inherent power to vacate a judgment upon proof that a fraud has been perpetrated on it. <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 44, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). In <em>Chambers, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">This \u201chistoric power of equity to set aside fraudulently begotten judgments,\u201d <em>Hazel-Atlas [Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.], </em>322 U.S. [238] at 245, 64 S.Ct. [997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944)] is necessary to the integrity of the courts, for \u201ctampering with the administration of justice in [this] manner * * * involves far more than an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong against the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 246, 64 S.Ct., at 1001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">{\u00b6 30} In the context of divorce, this court has established a trial court\u2019s authority to vacate a judgment after a party has committed a fraud upon the court. <em>Jelm v. Jelm, </em>155 Ohio St. 226, 98 N.E.2d 401 (1951), paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Van DeRyt v. Van DeRyt, </em>6 Ohio St.2d 31, 36, 215 N.E.2d 698 (1966) (a court \u201cdoes have inherent power to vacate after term a judgment * * * which is voidable for fraud or collusion\u201d). In <em>Van DeRyt </em>at 36, we recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">A court draws the power to vacate from the reason for its existence \u2014 to render justice; for where fraud or collusion is practiced on a court, the court ceases to function as a court and its judgment becomes an official stamp lent to the subversive intentions of the abusing parties. To protect its integrity, a court has inherent power to crush the fruits of fraud and collusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">{\u00b6 31} Notwithstanding any commitment this court may have to the principle of finality of judgments, <em>see </em>majority opinion at \u00b6 8, such a pledge cannot oversha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>dow its duty to preserve the integrity of the judicial system and \u201ccrush the fruits of fraud,\u201d <em>Van DeRyt </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">{\u00b6 32} In my view, a trial court has inherent authority to vacate a judgment in a criminal case due to a fraud committed upon it, apart from its authority to reconsider a valid, final judgment when a void sentence has been imposed or when a judgment contains a clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 33} The majority\u2019s holding that once \u201ca defendant has been sentenced by a trial court, that court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a motion by the state to vacate the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and sentence based upon the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of a plea agreement,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 13, conflates the concepts of a court\u2019s inherent power and its jurisdiction. As early as 1896, this court recognized that there is a difference between a court\u2019s inherent power and its jurisdiction. In <em>Hale v. State, </em>55 Ohio St. 210, 213, 45 N.E. 199 (1896), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The difference between the jurisdiction of courts and their inherent powers is too important to be overlooked. In constitutional governments their jurisdiction is conferred by the provisions of the constitutions and of statutes enacted in the exercise of legislative authority. That, however, is not true with respect to such powers as are necessary to the orderly and efficient exercise of jurisdiction. Such powers, from both their nature and their ancient exercise, must be regarded as inherent. They do not depend upon express constitutional grant, nor in any sense upon the legislative will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 34} Article IV, Section 4(A) of the Ohio Constitution provides that there \u201cshall be a court of common pleas and such divisions thereof as may be established by law serving each county of the state,\u201d and Section 4(B) establishes that \u201ccourts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters * * * as may be provided by law.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 2931.03, a court of common pleas \u201chas original jurisdiction of all crimes and offenses, except in cases of minor offenses the exclusive jurisdiction of which is vested in courts inferior to the court of common pleas.\u201d The trial court convicted Gilbert in May 2010 in accordance with its original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 35} The record shows that Gilbert did not object to the trial court\u2019s exercise of subject matter or personal jurisdiction at the hearing regarding the state\u2019s motion to vacate. \u201c \u2018Once a tribunal has jurisdiction over both the subject matter of an action and the parties to it, \u201c * * * the right to hear and determine is perfect; and the decision of every question thereafter arising is but the exercise of the jurisdiction thus conferred * * \u2019 \u201d <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pizza v. Rayford, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 382, 384, 582 N.E.2d 992 (1992), quoting <em>Sheldon\u2019s Lessee v. Newton, </em>3 Ohio St. 494, 499 (1854). Because Gilbert did not challenge the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction after subject matter and personal jurisdiction were perfected, he forfeited any claim of jurisdictional error, absent plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 23. However, in this case, no plain error exists because, when the trial court vacated the May 2010 judgment, it properly exercised jurisdiction of the cause pursuant to its inherent authority and Gilbert acquiesced to its exercise of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Avl\">Joseph T.

While the appellate court determined that Gilbert\u2019s assignment of error asking that court to determine whether the trial court\u2019s order violated Gilbert\u2019s constitutional protections against double jeopardy was moot, 2013-Ohio-238, 2013 WL 359660, \u00b6 20, we accepted jurisdiction of the state\u2019s second proposition of law, which states: \u201cThe double jeopardy clause did not bar the prosecution of [Gilbert] where both parties bargained for and received substantial benefits, and [Gilbert] understood that if he breached the agreement the original charges could be reinstated.\u201d 135 Ohio St.3d 1458, 2013-Ohio-2285, 988 N.E.2d 578. The state\u2019s second proposition of law thus asserts an affirmative argument. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>70 (10th Ed.2014) (affirmative means \u201c[supporting the existence of certain facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 37} Second, because in Gilbert\u2019s first plea agreement, he expressly waived any double jeopardy argument as to any charges against him as well as any protection from twice being placed in jeopardy relating to any offenses that the state might bring against him if the agreement were terminated, double jeopardy is not a concern in this case. <em>See State v. D.W., </em>133 Ohio St.3d 434, 2012-Ohio-4544, 978 N.E.2d 894, \u00b6 24 (a party may waive constitutional rights as long as the waiver is made knowingly and intelligently and is an intentional relinquishment of a known right).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals because a court has inherent authority to reconsider its judgment to protect the integrity of the judicial system when a defendant perpetrates a fraud upon it.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-8\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ant\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Steven L.
