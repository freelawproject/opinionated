Calabrese, of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, to journalize a decision denying a motion to suppress. The court of appeals\u2019 judgment was proper because the complaint failed to satisfy the requirements of R.C. 2969.25(C) and because the action is moot.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ap7-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Lawrence B. Jackson, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-q\">Timothy McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and James E. Moss, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">{\u00b6 2} In his complaint, Jackson claimed that he filed a motion to suppress in his criminal action on June 28, 2011. Judge Calabrese overruled the motion in open court on September 29, 2011, and indicated that she would journalize an entry on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 3} Jackson alleged that the entry was never filed and that he has a right to have the oral decision reduced to writing. He also requested that the entry set forth Judge Calabrese\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 4} Jackson filed this mandamus action on June 20, 2014, in the Eighth District Court of Appeals. Judge Calabrese filed a motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals granted the judge\u2019s motion on September 4, 2014. Jackson appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm for two reasons. First, the court of appeals correctly found that Jackson failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25(C). That statute requires that an inmate who seeks a waiver of the prepayment of filing fees shall also file a statement, certified by the institutional cashier, setting forth the balance of his inmate account for the six months previous to the filing of the complaint. Jackson did not file the statement. \u201c \u2018The requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory, and failure to comply with them subjects an inmate\u2019s action to dismissal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boles v. Knab, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 222, 2011-Ohio-2859, 951 N.E.2d 389, \u00b6 1, quoting <em>State ex rel. White v. Bechtel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 11, 2003-Ohio-2262, 788 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 5; <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. McDonnell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 511, 2010-Ohio-4726, 935 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 1. Moreover, even though Jackson attempted to amend his complaint to include the statement, the statute does not permit delayed statements. R.C. 2969.25(C); <em>Boles </em>at \u00b6 2; <em>Fuqua v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 211, 2003-Ohio-5533, 797 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b6 6} Second, the court of appeals properly granted summary judgment because Judge Calabrese had, in fact, filed an entry on the motion to suppress. The entry sufficiently journalized Judge Calabrese\u2019s decision overruling Jackson\u2019s motion and therefore rendered Jackson\u2019s action in mandamus moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
