These convictions are not at issue in this case. Beverly was also found guilty of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. R.C. 2923.32(A)(1). The pattern involved Beverly and Brandon Imber stealing or receiving stolen vehicles outside of Clark County. Beverly and Imber would then return to Clark County in the stolen vehicle and begin knocking on doors of private homes. If somebody opened the door, they would invent some excuse for knocking, by, for instance, claiming to work for a tree service. If nobody answered the door, they would break in and steal valuables, primarily electronics, jewelry, and guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, the conviction for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity was reversed. The court of appeals concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record that Beverly and Imber were involved in any type of ongoing organization, functioning as a continuing unit, with a structure separate and apart from the pattern of corrupt activity.\u201d 2013-0hio-1365, 2013 WL 1390414, \u00b6 30. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal. 137 Ohio St.3d 1414, 2013-Ohio-5096, 998 N.E.2d 512 (on reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A. RICO and Proving \u201cEnterprise\u201d in Ohio</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 3} The federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. 1961 et seq., was the general model for Ohio\u2019s own corrupt-activity statute. <em>State v. Schlosser, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 329, 332, 681 N.E.2d 911 (1997). Ohio\u2019s RICO statute, R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), provides: \u201cNo person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise shall conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity or the collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d \u201cEnterprise\u201d is defined as including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, corporation, trust, union, government agency, or other legal entity, or any organization, association, or group of persons associated in fact although not a legal entity. \u201cEnterprise\u201d includes illicit as well as licit enterprises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">R.C. 2923.31(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 4} The state\u2019s sole proposition of law states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">In order to prove the existence of an \u201centerprise\u201d to sustain a conviction for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity in violation of R.C. 2923.32, the State is not required to prove that the organization is a structure separate and distinct from the pattern of activity in which it engages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">{\u00b6 5} As we have stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">A RICO offense is dependent upon a defendant committing two or more predicate offenses listed in R.C. 2923.31(1). However, a RICO offense also requires a defendant to be \u201cemployed by, or associated with\u201d an \u201centerprise\u201d and to \u201cconduct or participate in\u201d an \u201centerprise through a pattern of corrupt activity.\u201d R.C. 2923.32(A)(1). \u201cSuch pattern must include both a relationship and continuous activity, as well as proof of the existence of an enterprise. Thus, the conduct required to commit a RICO violation is independent of the conduct required to commit [the underlying predicate offenses].\u201d <em>State v. Dudas, </em>11th Dist. Lake Nos. 2008-L-109 and 2008-L-110, 2009-Ohio-1001 [2009 WL 580791], \u00b6 46. * * * The intent of RICO is \u201c \u2018to criminalize the pattern of criminal activity, not the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>predicate acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>3d Dist. Allen Nos. 1-11-25 and 1\u201411\u201426, 2012-Ohio-5577 [2012 WL 6017971], \u00b6 61, quoting <em>State v. Dodson, </em>12th Dist. Butler No. 2009-07-1147, 2011-Ohio-6222 [2011 WL 6017950], \u00b6 68.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>State v. Miranda, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 184, 2014-Ohio-451, 5 N.E.3d 603, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 6} In <em>Miranda, </em>we held that \u201ca RICO offense does not merge with its predicate offenses for purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. Today, we conclude, in essence, that a \u201cpattern of corrupt activity\u201d does not merge with the concept of \u201centerprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 7} There is no question that a RICO conviction depends on the state being able to \u201cprove both the existence of an \u2018enterprise\u2019 and the connected \u2018pattern of racketeering activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). <em>See Miranda </em>at \u00b6 13. The question in this case is whether the same evidence can be used to prove both the existence of an enterprise and the associated pattern of corrupt activity. We conclude that it can and, therefore, also conclude that the state is not required to prove that the defendants were associated with an organization having an existence as an entity or structure separate and distinct from the pattern of activity in which it engages.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 8} Nothing in R.C. Chapter 2923 implies or explicitly states that an enterprise and a pattern of corrupt activity must be proved with separate evidence. The definition of \u201centerprise\u201d is remarkably open-ended. It includes \u201cany individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, corporation, trust, union, government agency, or other legal entity, or any organization, association, or group of persons associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d R.C. 2923.31(C). <em>See Boyle v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 938, 944, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009) (similar enumeration in 18 U.S.C. 1961(4) of what constitutes an enterprise is \u201cobviously broad\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 9} The statutory scheme does not indicate how the existence of an enterprise is to be proved, though various decisions of Ohio courts <em>(Miranda </em>and cases cited therein; <em>State v. Welch, </em>3d Dist. Wyandot No. 16-06-02, 2006-Ohio-6684, 2006 WL 3702650), and the United States Supreme Court have provided insight. It is easy to prove the existence of certain enterprises, especially those with licit purposes: there is a document memorializing the creation of a partnership or corporation, etc. But here and in most cases involving a RICO-type conviction, the existence of an enterprise is more difficult to establish because the enterprise is entirely an \u201cassociation in fact,\u201d i.e., a de facto enterprise. <em>Turkette </em>at 583. An association-in-fact enterprise has been defined as \u201ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Id. See Boyle </em>at 948 (\u201can association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 10} The Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe existence of an enterprise is an element distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity and \u2018proof of one does not necessarily establish the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyle </em>at 947, quoting <em>Turkette </em>at 583. <em>See Miranda, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 184, 2014-Ohio-451, 5 N.E.3d 603, \u00b6 13. We agree with this conclusion, that proof of one essential element does not \u201cnecessarily\u201d prove another. But we emphasize that, logically, evidence that proves one of the elements can sometimes prove the other, even though it doesn\u2019t necessarily do so. The court in <em>Boyle </em>accentuated this point when it stated that \u201cthe evidence used to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise \u2018may in particular cases coalesce.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Turkette </em>at 583. In so stating, the court expressly rejected the notion that \u201cthe existence of an enterprise may never be inferred from the evidence showing that persons associated with the enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 11} The court in <em>Boyle </em>concluded that the following jury instruction was not error: \u201cthe existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.\u201d <em>Boyle, </em>556 U.S. at 951, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265. The penultimate sentence of the <em>Boyle </em>opinion essentially answered the question before us when it stated that \u201cproof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a particular case to permit a jury to infer the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 12} At least one court of appeals in Ohio has wrangled with the issue before us, resolved the case consistent with our decision today, and done so without reference to <em>Turkette </em>or <em>Boyle. Welch, </em>2006-Ohio-6684, 2006 WL 3702650. The court in that case reviewed the evidence under a sufficiency standard and concluded that \u201cany reasonable trier-of-fact could have found that Welch was operating as part of an enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. In the very next sentence, the court stated, \u201cThe same evidence cited above also supports the \u2018pattern of corrupt activity\u2019 element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">{\u00b6 13} We hold that the existence of an enterprise, sufficient to sustain a conviction for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity under R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), can be established without proving that the enterprise is a structure separate and distinct from a pattern of corrupt activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">{\u00b6 14} We emphasize that we reach our conclusion after analyzing the statutory scheme and applying it to the question before us. We have relied on <em>Turkette </em>and <em>Boyle </em>for guidance, not because they are the law of the land (they are not in Ohio, R.C. 2923.31 and 2923.32 are), but because the reasoning applied by the Supreme Court is logical and apt. <em>See Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1044, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) (United States Supreme Court will not review state cases that rely \u201con an adequate and independent state ground\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals concluded that \u201cBeverly\u2019s conviction for Engaging in a Pattern of Corrupt Activity is not supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d 2013-Ohio-1365, 2013 WL 1390414, \u00b6 31. We disagree. The standard when testing the sufficiency of the evidence \u201c \u2018is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 70, quoting <em>State v. Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 16} The record is replete with examples of Beverly and Imber associating together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. Beverly and Imber drove (and perhaps stole) an Ohio Department of Transportation truck and used it to steal an expensive stump grinder. They used a stolen Chevrolet Caprice in the course of an attempted burglary. And most notoriously, for purposes of this case, they used a stolen truck to commit several burglaries on January 28, 2011. It is clear to us that the record provides ample support for a rational trier of fact to conclude that Beverly and Imber constituted an association-in-fact enterprise and that they engaged in a pattern of corrupt activity. Indeed, we cannot imagine a trier of fact concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">B. Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 17} The court of appeals determined that Beverly\u2019s argument that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence was moot. The argument is no longer moot, but we summarily reject it sua sponte. When testing manifest weight, the court \u201c \u2018 \u201creviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>McKnight </em>at \u00b6 71, quoting <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting <em>State v. Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1983). Having reviewed the record in this case, we can only conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">C. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">{\u00b6 18} The court of appeals also concluded that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the \u201centerprise\u201d element of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. The appellate court did not have the benefit of our recent decision in <em>State v. Griffin, </em>141 Ohio St.3d 392, 2014-Ohio-4767, 24 N.E.3d 1147. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>We, sua sponte, on the authority of <em>Griffin, </em>reject the argument that the jury instructions were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">{\u00b6 19} The jury instructions in this case comprise 50 pages of transcript. The portion that discusses count one, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, comprises just over two pages. That instruction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">Count One, the defendant is charged with engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity in Count One of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">Before you can find the defendant guilty of this offense, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that between November 1st 2010, and January 28, 2011, at Clark and Madison Counties and Clermont County he did while employed by or associated with any enterprise conduct or participate in, either directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">Enterprise includes any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, corporation, trust, union, government agency or other legal entity or any organization, association or group of persons associated, in fact, although not a legal entity. Enterprise includes illicit as well as licit enterprises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Conduct means to direct. Participate means to take part in and is not limited to those who have directed the pattern of corrupt activity. It encompasses those who have performed activities necessary or helpful to the operation of the enterprise whether directly or indirectly without an element of control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">Pattern of corrupt activity means two or more incidents of corrupt activity. Whether or not there has been a prior conviction that are related [sic] to the affairs of the same enterprise, are not isolated and are not so closely related to each other and connected in time and place that they constitute a single event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">Corrupt activity means engaging in, attempting to engage in, or soliciting, coercing or intimidating another person to engage in any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">Conduct constituting a violation of burglary under the Ohio Revised Code Section 2911.12. Or conduct constituting a violation of receiving stolen property under Ohio Revised Code Section 2913.51, that is a felony of the first, second, third or fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">If the property involved in the receiving stolen property offense is a motor vehicle or a firearm, receiving stolen property is a felony of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Motor vehicle and firearm will be defined for you below under Counts Two and Six respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">If you find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, your verdict must be guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">If you find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the essential elements of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, your verdict must be not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">If your verdict is guilty, you will then go on to separately determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether or not at least one of the incidents of corrupt activity is a felony of the first, second or third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 20} As was true in the instruction reviewed in <em>Griffin, </em>the definitions of \u201centerprise\u201d and \u201cpattern of corrupt activity\u201d are quoted from R.C. 2923.31. The essence of the jury charge appears early in the instructions when the court stated that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Beverly, \u201cwhile employed by or associated with any enterprise conducted] or participate^] in, either directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b621} Again, as in <em>Griffin, </em>the instructions in this case could have been differently, perhaps even better, stated. Nevertheless, it is clear in reviewing the instructions in this case that they are substantially similar to the instructions that we approved in <em>Griffin. </em>Accordingly, we summarily reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment that the jury instructions were insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 22} We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-13\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Axv\">French, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b386-14\">Lanzinger and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b386-15\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aux\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">{\u00b6 23} I would affirm the judgment of the Second District Court of Appeals. I do not quarrel with the syllabus as it is stated, but I respectfully dissent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>manner in which the principle is applied here. Both the element of \u201centerprise\u201d and the element of \u201cpattern of corrupt activity\u201d must be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction under R.C. 2923.32(A)(1). But when the majority concludes that \u201cthe state is not required to prove that <em>the defendants were associated with </em>an organization having an existence as an entity or structure separate and distinct from the pattern of activity,\u201d it goes too far and annihilates the element of enterprise. (Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 24} At the very least, the majority opinion reduces the element of enterprise to the idea of an association-in-fact, or \u201c \u2018a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Boyle v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 938, 948, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). That view of the term \u201centerprise\u201d waters the concept down to mean two or more people acting together to commit the same crime. Yet \u201c[t]he obvious intent of the General Assembly in enacting the RICO statutes was to reduce the influence and power of organized crime in the state.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 247, 2014-Ohio-1932, 11 N.E.3d 252, \u00b6 16. It is not enough for a defendant to simply act in concert with someone or be involved with a pattern of corrupt activity. As the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">The evidence in the record establishes that Beverly and Imber were acting in concert when they engaged in the crime spree leading to these charges. But there is no evidence in the record that Beverly and Imber were involved in any type of ongoing organization, functioning as a continuing unit, with a structure separate and apart from the pattern of corrupt activity. At best, the evidence establishes that Beverly and Imber\u2019s actions were disorganized and chaotic in the commission of the burglaries and thefts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">2013-Ohio-1365, 2013 WL 1390414, at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 25} The majority focuses here on the evidence relating to the \u201cpattern\u201d of crime by Beverly and Brandon Imber \u2014 stealing or receiving stolen vehicles outside of Clark County and breaking into homes and stealing valuables. I agree that the pattern of corrupt activity was established but do not see how Beverly and Imber were involved in any type of ongoing organization, functioning as a continuing unit with a common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 26} I would also hold that inadequate instructions were given on the element of enterprise based on the reasons stated in my dissent in <em>State v. Griffin, </em>141 Ohio St.3d 392, 2014-Ohio-4767, 24 N.E.3d 1147, \u00b6 20 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting). The term \u201centerprise\u201d could have been clarified using language in <em>Boyle, </em>556 U.S. at 945-946, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (an enterprise requires a showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>at least three structural features: (1) purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and (3) sufficient longevity to permit the associates to pursue the purpose), or in <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (an enterprise is \u201cproved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5sb\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Eric E.
