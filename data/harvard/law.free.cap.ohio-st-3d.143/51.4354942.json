In that complaint, relator alleged that Eisler had violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by appearing and presenting oral argument on behalf of an appellant before the Ninth District Court of Appeals while his license was under suspension for failure to comply with the continuing-legal-education (\u201cCLE\u201d) requirements of Gov.Bar R. X. Eisler admitted in his answer that he engaged in the charged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">{\u00b6 3} The parties entered into stipulations of fact, misconduct, and aggravating and mitigating factors and agreed that Eisler should be suspended from the practice of law for six months for appearing and presenting oral argument before the Ninth District Court of Appeals while knowing that his license was under suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">{\u00b6 4} Having considered Eisler\u2019s conduct, the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, and the sanctions we have imposed for comparable misconduct, the panel recommended that Eisler be suspended for two years with the second year stayed on conditions. The board adopted the panel\u2019s report in its entirety. No one has objected to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>{\u00b6 5} We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and agree that a two-year suspension with the second year stayed on conditions is the appropriate sanction for Eisler\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Procedural History and Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 6} Eisler\u2019s license <em>to </em>practice law in Ohio was suspended on November 13, 2012, for his failure to timely comply with the CLE requirements of Gov.Bar R. X. <em>See In re Continuing Legal Edn. Suspension of Eisler, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2012-Ohio-5238, 978 N.E.2d 198. That suspension remains in effect, and on September 1, 2013, Eisler registered his license as inactive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">{\u00b6 7} The board found that Eisler received notice of his CLE suspension on November 20, 2012 \u2014 the Tuesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. He was scheduled to appear and present oral argument on behalf of a client in the Ninth District Court of Appeals on Tuesday, November 27, 2012. The court was closed on November 22 and 23, 2012, for the Thanksgiving holiday. Concluding that any pleading he would file with the court to address his suspension would not be processed until after the oral argument had occurred, Eisler decided to travel to Ohio to appear before the court and address it in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">{\u00b6 8} Eisler appeared before the Ninth District Court of Appeals on November 27, 2012, and presented argument on behalf of the appellant, making no mention of the fact that his license to practice law in Ohio was under suspension. In an affidavit attached to the parties\u2019 revised stipulations, Eisler averred that (1) his client, who was and continued to be his employer, was aware that he was delinquent in completing his CLE requirements, but was not aware that his license had been suspended, (2) he had the opportunity to address the court and disclose the fact that he had been suspended, but \u201cchose to rely on reflex and commence to present the oral argument\u201d, (3) he expected opposing counsel to disclose to the court that he had argued the case while his license was suspended, and (4) opposing counsel made such a disclosure before presenting her oral argument. Upon learning of his suspension, the appellate court denied him the opportunity to present a rebuttal argument on behalf of his client. The administrative judge for the court reported his misconduct to disciplinary counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>{\u00b6 9} After Eisler answered relator\u2019s complaint and admitted the charged misconduct, the parties submitted a consent-to-discipline agreement and then an amended consent-to-discipline agreement that the panel rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">{\u00b6 10} Following a prehearing telephone conference, the parties submitted agreed stipulations of fact and law and moved to waive the panel hearing.' The panel chair denied the motion, noting that the parties\u2019 stipulation that Eisler did not have a prior disciplinary record was inconsistent with this- court\u2019s records, which reflect that from 2005 through 2009, Eisler\u2019s license was suspended and subsequently reinstated on three separate occasions for his failure to timely register as an attorney. <em>See In re Attorney Registration Suspension of Eisler, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1431, 2005-Ohio-6408, 838 N.E.2d 671, and <em>In re Reinstatement of Eisler, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1429, 2006-Ohio-2065, 846 N.E.2d 858; <em>In re Attorney Registration Suspension of Eisler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1420, 2007-Ohio-6463, 877 N.E.2d 305, and <em>In re Reinstatement of Eisler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1498, 2008-Ohio-290, 880 N.E.2d 97; <em>In re Attorney Registration Suspension of Eisler, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1475, 2009-Ohio-5786, 915 N.E.2d 1256, and <em>In re Reinstatement of Eisler, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1603, 2010-Ohio-4979, 935 N.E.2d 48. Concluding that additional evidence was necessary for the panel to determine the appropriate weight to assign to Eisler\u2019s prior disciplinary record as an aggravating factor, the panel chair set a hearing for March 10, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">{\u00b6 11} The parties jointly moved for reconsideration of the motion to waive the hearing and submitted revised stipulations of fact and law in which they modified the aggravating factors to include Eisler\u2019s prior registration suspensions. The panel chair denied the motion for reconsideration, citing the need for the panel to \u201cexamine Respondent under oath to assist with the panel\u2019s obligation to determine the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s admitted misconduct.\u201d While the panel chair granted Eisler\u2019s motion to continue the March 10, 2014 hearing to permit him to retain counsel, the chair denied his second motion for a continuance \u2014 submitted just one day before the April 3, 2014 hearing \u2014 which alleged that he did not have money to retain counsel or pay for his travel to Ohio for the hearing. However, Eisler did not appear for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 12} Based on these undisputed facts, the board found that relator had proven by clear and convincing evidence that Eisler violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction) and 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) but recommended that we dismiss an alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law) that relator sought to withdraw. We adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the board\u2019s findings of fact, find that Eisler\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a) and 8.4(d), and dismiss the alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 13} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 14} The board noted that Eisler engaged in a single instance of misconduct and that he acknowledged the wrongful nature of his misconduct. However, the board found that Eisler acted with a dishonest and selfish motive \u2014 an aggravating factor \u2014 because he made a conscious decision to appear before the court of appeals and argue on behalf of his client while remaining silent as to his suspension. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). The board also found that while Eisler admitted his misconduct and reached an agreement with relator regarding the appropriate sanction, he sought two last-minute continuances \u2014 the first claiming that he wished to seek counsel and the second claiming that he could neither afford to retain counsel nor travel to Ohio for the hearing \u2014 and failed to appear before the panel. Therefore, contrary to the parties\u2019 stipulations, the board found that Eisler failed to cooperate in the disciplinary process. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(e). The board also found that his three attorney-registration suspensions constitute prior disciplinary offenses and are an additional aggravating factor pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6 15} We have stated that \u201c[t]he normal penalty for continuing to practice law while under suspension is disbarment.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Koury, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 433, 436, 674 N.E.2d 1371 (1997). However, citing a number of cases in which we have imposed lesser sanctions for attorneys who have engaged in the practice of law while their licenses have been suspended, the parties stipulated that a six-month suspension is the appropriate sanction for Eisler\u2019s misconduct. <em>See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Bancsi, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 392, 394, 683 N.E.2d 1072 (1997) (imposing a one-year suspension with six months stayed on an attorney who practiced law while his license was suspended, where mitigating factors included the attorney\u2019s prompt effort to cure the CLE deficiency, immediate payment of the outstanding fine, and the short duration of the attorney\u2019s suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Because the record does not contain evidence of significant mitigating factors \u2014 such as Eisler\u2019s character and reputation apart from the charged misconduct or evidence of a chemical dependency or mental disability that may have contributed to his misconduct \u2014 the board recommends that we suspend Eisler for two years with the second year stayed on the conditions that he satisfy all of the requirements to be reinstated to active status, that he commit no further misconduct, and that he pay the costs of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">{\u00b6 17} We have routinely imposed indefinite suspensions on attorneys who have continued to practice law while under suspension for CLE and registration violations and who have then failed to respond to the ensuing disciplinary investigation. <em>See Disciplinary Counsel v. Freeman, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 389, 2010-Ohio-3824, 934 N.E.2d 328, \u00b6 14, citing, <em>e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Higgins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 473, 2008-Ohio-1509, 884 N.E.2d 1070; <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Crandall, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 444, 2003-Ohio-1637, 786 N.E.2d 872; <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Barron, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 167, 707 N.E.2d 850 (1999). In some of those cases, however, the relator obtained a default judgment after the respondent failed to respond to the disciplinary investigation and failed to appear in the board proceedings. In contrast, Eisler responded to relator\u2019s initial letter of inquiry and admitted his ethical lapse, promptly answered the formal complaint and admitted all of the allegations contained therein, worked with relator to submit two proposed (but rejected) consent agreements, and submitted stipulations of fact, misconduct, and aggravation and mitigation as well as a proposed sanction. Although Eisler failed to appear for the disciplinary hearing despite the panel\u2019s expressed desire to hear his testimony, his conduct is not as egregious as that of the attorneys who completely failed to participate in the disciplinary process and who received indefinite suspensions for their misconduct. Therefore, we find that the board\u2019s recommendation of a two-year suspension with the second year stayed on conditions strikes the proper balance of protecting the public while deterring future misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, David Charles Eisler is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years, with the second year stayed on the conditions that he engage in no further misconduct and satisfy all requirements to be reinstated to active status. If Eisler fails to comply with these conditions, the stay will be revoked and he will serve the full two-year suspension. Costs are taxed to Eisler.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-7\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b177-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissents and would indefinitely suspend the respondent from the practice of law in Ohio.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"APn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Scott J.
