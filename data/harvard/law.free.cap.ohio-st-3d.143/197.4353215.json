We hold that an insurance provision that excludes coverage for acts committed with the deliberate intent to injure an employee precludes coverage for employer intentional torts, which require a finding that the employer intended to injure the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Duane Allen Hoyle, brought this action to recover for injuries he sustained when he fell from a ladder-jack scaffold while working as a carpenter on a construction project for his employers, appellees, DTJ Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cDTJ\u201d) and Cavanaugh Building Corporation (\u201cCavanaugh\u201d). Hoyle describes a ladder-jack scaffold as an apparatus consisting of two extension ladders positioned vertically, with a horizontal walkway platform supported by brackets spanning the space between them. Ladder jacks are the brackets that support the platform. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1262 (3d Ed.1993). They are generally secured to the ladder with a bolt or pin that goes though the ladder jack and is secured in back by a nut.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-18\">{\u00b6 3} Phillip L. Colleran, a certified safety professional and professional member of the American Society of Safety Engineers who executed an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>affidavit on Hoyle\u2019s behalf, states that, for worker safety, each ladder-jack bracket must be secured to the ladder and the platform must be secured to each bracket. When Hoyle assembled the ladder-jack scaffold on this project, however, he did not have the bolts or pins to secure the ladder jacks to the ladders. Hoyle claims that the job superintendent, Kevin Everett, kept the bolts in his office and told employees they did not need them because they take too much time to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 4} On March 25, 2008, Hoyle fell approximately 14 feet from the ladder-jack scaffold and landed on a concrete pad. Just before his fall, Hoyle stepped onto a portion of the platform that extended past the ladder jack on one end, causing the ladder jack on the opposite end to lift and detach from its ladder. As Hoyle moved back toward the center, the detached ladder jack lowered, but missed the rungs of the ladder and pushed the ladder outward. The ladder and Hoyle fell to the concrete below.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 5} Hoyle sued DTJ and Cavanaugh in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, alleging claims of employer intentional tort. Appellant, the Cincinnati Insurance Company (\u201cCIC\u201d), which insured DTJ and Cavanaugh under a commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy, intervened and filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that it has no obligation to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh for Hoyle\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only issue before us in this appeal is whether CIC has a duty to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh should Hoyle prevail on his employer-intentional-tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{If 6} Unlike the broader duty to defend, an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify its insureds is based on whether there is, in fact, actual liability. <em>Chemstress Consultant Co., Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>128 Ohio App.3d 396, 402, 715 N.E.2d 208 (9th Dist.1998). Before turning to the language of the CIC policy and the procedural history of this case, we first briefly examine the history and scope of civil liability for employer intentional torts in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>Employer Intentional Torts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 7} Because of the immunity conferred by R.C. 4123.74 and Article II, Section 35, Ohio Constitution, for the vast majority of workplace injuries a workers\u2019 compensation claim is an employee\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>See generally Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., </em>36 Ohio St.3d 100, 110, 522 N.E.2d 489 (1988). But when an employee seeks damages resulting from an act or omission committed by the employer with the intent to injure, the claim arises outside of the employment relationship, and the workers\u2019 compensation system does not preempt the employee\u2019s cause of action. <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp., </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722 (1991), paragraph one of the syllabus. This court first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>recognized an employee\u2019s right to sue his or her employer for an intentional tort in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc., </em>69 Ohio St.2d 608, 433 N.E.2d 572 (1982), syllabus. We reasoned that extending the immunity afforded to employers by the workers\u2019 compensation system to intentional torts would not further the legislative goals underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act: \u201cAffording an employer immunity for his intentional behavior certainly would not promote [a safe and injury-free work environment], for an employer could commit intentional acts with impunity with the knowledge that, at the very most, his workers\u2019 compensation premiums may rise slightly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 8} An intentional tort involves an act committed with the specific intent to injure or with the belief that injury is substantially certain to occur. <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co., </em>15 Ohio St.3d 90, 95, 472 N.E.2d 1046 (1984), citing 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Section 8A (1965). When the employer proceeds despite knowledge that injuries are certain or substantially certain to result, \u201che is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.\u201d <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc., </em>59 Ohio St.3d 115, 118, 570 N.E.2d 1108 (1991). Under <em>Fyffe, </em>an employee could establish intent based on substantial certainty by demonstrating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">(1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition within its business operation; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2745.01, which now governs employer intentional torts in Ohio, took effect on April 7, 2005, and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">(A) In an action brought against an employer by an employee * * * for damages resulting from an intentional tort committed by the employer during the course of employment, the employer shall not be liable unless the plaintiff proves that the employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">(B) As used in this section, \u201csubstantially certain\u201d means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(C) Deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard * * * creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal * * * was committed with intent to injure another if an injury or an occupational disease or condition occurs as a direct result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">R.C. 2745.01 passes constitutional muster, <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, syllabus, despite this court\u2019s having struck down as unconstitutional prior attempts to codify employer-intentional-tort liability in Ohio. <em>See Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722; <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 225, 631 N.E.2d 582 (1994); <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 298, 707 N.E.2d 1107 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2745.01(A) incorporates the definition of an employer intentional tort from <em>Jones, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 95, 472 N.E.2d 1046, and requires a plaintiff to prove either deliberate intent to injure or a belief that injury was substantially certain. But R.C. 2745.01(B) equates \u201csubstantially certain\u201d with \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d to injure. Thus, the \u201c \u2018two options of proof [under R.C. 2745.01(A)] become: (1) the employer acted with intent to injure or (2) the employer acted with deliberate intent to injure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kaminski </em>at \u00b6 55, quoting <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>175 Ohio App.3d 227, 2008-Ohio-1521, 886 N.E.2d 262, \u00b6 31 (7th Dist.). \u201c[W]hat appears at first glance as two distinct bases for liability is revealed on closer examination to be one and the same.\u201d <em>Rudisill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>709 F.3d 595, 602-603 (6th Cir.2013) (describing R.C. 2745.01 as \u201ca statute at war with itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 11} The General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting R.C. 2745.01 was to \u201csignificantly restrict\u201d recovery for employer intentional torts to situations in which the employer \u201cacts with specific intent to cause an injury.\u201d <em>Kaminski, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066 at \u00b6 57; <em>Stetter v. R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, \u00b6 26, citing <em>Kaminski </em>at \u00b6 56. \u201c[A]bsent a deliberate intent to injure another, an employer is not liable for a claim alleging an employer intentional tort, and the injured employee\u2019s exclusive remedy is within the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d <em>Houdek v. ThyssenKrupp Materials N.A., Inc., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 491, 2012-Ohio-5685, 983 N.E.2d 1253, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2745.01(C) permits an employee to prove the employer\u2019s intent without direct evidence. When the employee is injured as a direct result of the employer\u2019s deliberate removal of an equipment safety guard,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. 2745.01(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer intended to injure. It \u201cis not a separate tort, it merely provides a legally cognizable example of \u2018intent to injure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irondale Indus. Contractors, Inc. v. Virginia Sur. Co., Inc., </em>754 F.Supp.2d 927, 933 (N.D.Ohio 2010). The <em>Irondale </em>court rejected the suggestion that R.C. 2745.01(C) permits liability without a finding of intent to cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>Hoyle\u2019s Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 13} In his complaint, Hoyle alleged that DTJ and Cavanaugh \u201cacted with deliberate intent (under R.C. \u00a7 2745.01) to cause injury\u201d and that their actions \u201cconstitute^] or [were] equivalent to the \u2018deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard\u2019 as set forth in R.C. \u00a7 2745.01.\u201d DTJ and Cavanaugh moved for summary judgment on Hoyle\u2019s claims, arguing that he could not prove that they acted with intent to injure or that injury was substantially certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of DTJ and Cavanaugh \u201c[t]o the extent that [Hoyle\u2019s] claims rely on R.C. 2745.01(A) &amp; (B) alone\u201d because Hoyle \u201cprovide[d] no evidence that the Defendants acted with a specific intent to injure\u201d him. But the trial court stated that its decision \u201cdoes not apply\u201d to the extent that Hoyle\u2019s cause of action relies upon R.C. 2745.01(C), which \u201cnecessarily include[s] the \u2018intent to injure.\u2019 \u201d The trial court found genuine issues of material fact as to whether the pins normally used to secure the ladder jacks constitute an equipment safety guard and whether DTJ and/or Cavanaugh deliberately removed them. Thus, the trial court has not finally adjudicated Hoyle\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 15} In light of R.C. 2745.01 and this court\u2019s precedent regarding employer intentional torts, and because the question before this court is whether CIC is obligated to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh for any liability Hoyle may establish, we now turn to the language of the CIC policy. CIC maintains that even if Hoyle prevails on his employer-intentional-tort claims, any liability would be excluded from coverage because it must be premised upon the employer\u2019s deliberate intent to injure the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\n<em>The Insurance Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">{\u00b6 16} The CIC policy covered a policy period of March 31, 2007, through March 31, 2010. The policy\u2019s CGL Coverage Form states, \u201cWe will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury * * * to which this insurance applies.\u201d But the CGL Coverage Form excludes coverage for bodily injuries that may reasonably be expected to result from the insured\u2019s intentional acts or that the insured expected or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>intended. It also excludes bodily injury to employees sustained in the workplace or arising out of duties related to the insured\u2019s business. Thus, the CGL Coverage Form provides no coverage for Hoyle\u2019s injuries. But the policy\u2019s coverage is not limited solely to that provided by the CGL Coverage Form.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 17} The question of coverage here depends entirely upon a policy endorsement entitled \u201cEmployers Liability Coverage Form \u2014 Ohio,\u201d which DTJ and Cavanaugh purchased for an additional premium. The Employers Liability Coverage Form provides coverage for \u201cthose sums that an insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by your \u2018employee\u2019 in the \u2018workplace\u2019 and caused by an \u2018intentional act\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d The Employers Liability Coverage Form defines \u201cintentional act\u201d as \u201can act which is substantially certain to cause \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the Employers Liability Coverage Form purports to extend coverage to substantial-certainty employer intentional torts that would otherwise be excluded from coverage under the CGL Coverage Form. But the Employers Liability Coverage Form also expressly excludes coverage for \u201cliability for acts committed by or at the direction of an insured with the deliberate intent to injure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 18} In a summary entitled \u201cNotice to Policyholders: Ohio Employers Liability,\u201d CIC informed its insureds that the Employers Liability Coverage Form \u201cprovides coverage for employment intentional torts in which the employer had knowledge of the existence of a danger, knowledge that the danger would be substantially certain to result in harm, and required the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.\u201d CIC also informed its insureds that R.C. 2745.01 \u201cchanges the current law\u201d and permits recovery for employer intentional torts only upon proof of the employer\u2019s \u201cintent to injure\u201d or \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d to injure. In the notice, CIC implicitly recognizes the contradiction of providing coverage for substantial-certainty employer intentional torts in light of R.C. 2745.01, which excludes liability for such torts, but CIC states that until challenges to R.C. 2745.01 have been resolved, CIC will continue to offer and provide employers liability coverage. According to CIC\u2019s appellate brief, following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kaminski, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, which rejected constitutional challenges to R.C. 2745.01, CIC ceased issuing indemnity coverage for employer intentional torts in Ohio in lieu of defense-only coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>CIC\u2019s Declaratory-Judgment Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 19} In its complaint, CIC alleged that it has no duty to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh under the CIC policy and that, additionally, R.C. 2745.01 and Ohio public policy preclude coverage for the employer intentional torts alleged against DTJ and Cavanaugh. CIC argued in its motion for summary judgment that any recovery on Hoyle\u2019s claims must be based upon a finding of intent to cause injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and would therefore be excluded from coverage under the Employers Liability Coverage Form. Hoyle responded that an employer intentional tort proven with the rebuttable presumption of intent under R.C. 2745.01(C) does not involve deliberate intent to injure and would therefore not be excluded from coverage. The trial court rejected Hoyle\u2019s argument and instead held that any recovery under R.C. 2745.01 requires a finding that the employer acted with intent to cause injury. The trial court concluded that any liability Hoyle might establish would fall within the policy exclusion for acts committed by an insured with the deliberate intent to injure. Accordingly, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of CIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 20} A divided panel of the Ninth District Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment in favor of CIC. The majority framed the issue as \u201cwhether, if deliberate intent <em>were to be presumed </em>by operation of [R.C. 2745.01(C)], the claim- would be excluded from coverage under the Employer Liability policy for actions taken with the \u2018deliberate intent\u2019 * * * to injure.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 2013-Ohio-3223, 994 N.E.2d 492, \u00b6 17. The court held, \u201cAlthough the deliberate intent to injure may be presumed <em>for purposes of the statute </em>where there is a deliberate removal of a safety guard, * * * this does not in itself amount to \u2018deliberate intent\u2019 <em>for the purposes of the insurance exclusion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. The court suggested that an employee may prevail on an employer-intentional-tort claim without proving deliberate intent under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. Judge Hensal dissented, concluding that \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d has the same meaning under the policy as under R.C. 2745.01 and rejecting the conclusion that liability may be imposed without a finding of deliberate intent under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 21} This court accepted CIC\u2019s discretionary appeal. 137 Ohio St.3d 1421, 2013-Ohio-5285, 998 N.E.2d 1177. CIC argues that both the terms of its policy and Ohio public policy preclude coverage. Resolution of this appeal involves interpretation of statutory and contractual language, both of which present questions of law that we review de novo. <em>Ceccarelli v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 231, 2010-Ohio-5681, 938 N.E.2d 342, \u00b6 8; <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 22} At the outset, we reiterate that the trial court has not determined the merits of Hoyle\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim under R.C. 2745.01(C). The court found that Hoyle did not present direct evidence of DTJ\u2019s and Cavanaugh\u2019s intent but held that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether Hoyle could prevail on his claim by using the rebuttable presumption under R.C. 2745.01(C). Thus, Hoyle may still demonstrate that DTJ and/or Cavanaugh deliberately removed an equipment safety guard and that his injuries occurred as a direct result, at which point he will be entitled to a presumption that DTJ and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Cavanaugh intended to injure him. But the question before us is a legal one \u2014 if the CIC policy excludes coverage for all employer intentional torts, CIC would have no duty to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh, even if Hoyle is able to establish liability. In that regard, CIC is entitled to a declaratory judgment if its policy excludes coverage for an employer intentional tort using the R.C. 2745.01(C) presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 23} The parties dispute the significance of the R.C. 2745.01(C) presumption and any resulting liability. A presumption is a procedural device that courts resort to \u201conly in the absence of evidence by the party in whose favor [the] presumption would otherwise operate.\u201d <em>Ayers v. Woodard, </em>166 Ohio St. 138, 140 N.E.2d 401 (1957), paragraph three of the syllabus. A legal presumption \u201cimputes to certain facts or [a] group of facts a certain prima facie significance or operation.\u201d <em>Shepherd v. Midland Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>152 Ohio St. 6, 15, 87 N.E.2d 156 (1949). \u201cTo establish a \u2018presumption\u2019 is to say that a finding of the predicate fact * * * produces \u2018a required conclusion in the absence of explanation * * \u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993), quoting 1 D. Louisell &amp; C. Mueller, <em>Federal Evidence, </em>Section 67, 536 (1977). Under R.C. 2745.01(C), the predicate facts \u2014 an employer\u2019s deliberate removal of an equipment safety guard and directly resulting injury \u2014 give rise to a prima facie finding of intent to injure. For purposes of this appeal, we must assume that Hoyle can establish that DTJ or Cavanaugh deliberately removed an equipment safety guard and that the removal was a direct cause of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 24} The presumption under R.C. 2745.01(C) does not shift the ultimate burden of proof from Hoyle, but \u201ca presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption.\u201d Evid.R. 301. If that party produces evidence that \u201ccounterbalances the presumption or * * * leave[s] the case in equipoise,\u201d then the presumption disappears and the case must be disposed of on the evidence presented, without reference to the presumption. <em>In re Guardianship of Breece, </em>173 Ohio St. 542, 555, 184 N.E.2d 386 (1962); <em>Shepherd </em>at 25. But if the employer fails to produce evidence to rebut the presumption under R.C. 2745.01(C), then the effect of the presumption is that \u201cthe employee \u2018proves that the employer committed the [removal] with the intent to injure another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Ivex Protective Packaging, Inc., </em>S.D.Ohio No. 3:13\u2014 cv-175, 2014 WL 6687150, *2 (Nov. 26, 2014), quoting R.C. 2745.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 25} It is tempting to look to the merits of Hoyle\u2019s claims and hold that CIC has no duty to indemnify because, despite the presumption in R.C. 2745.01(C), the trial court found that Hoyle produced no evidence that DTJ and Cavanaugh acted with a specific intent to injure him. But \u201c[t]he whole point of [R.C. 2745.01(C)] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to presume the injurious intent required under divisions (A) and (B)\u201d in the absence of direct evidence. <em>Fickle v. Conversion Technologies Internatl., Inc., </em>6th Dist. Williams No. WM-10-016, 2011-Ohio-2960, 2011 WL 2436750, \u00b6 32, fn. 2. Because the trial court has not determined whether the presumption arises in this case, it cannot have determined whether DTJ and Cavanaugh can rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 26} If Hoyle establishes that DTJ and Cavanaugh deliberately removed an equipment safety guard and that the removal directly caused his injuries, he will be entitled to a presumption that DTJ and Cavanaugh acted with the intent to harm him. If DTJ and Cavanaugh do not rebut the presumption, then Hoyle will have established that they acted with intent to harm him as a matter of law. In any case, liability on Hoyle\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim will be based upon a finding that DTJ and Cavanaugh acted with intent to injure Hoyle. <em>Houdek, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 491, 2012-Ohio-5685, 983 N.E.2d 1253, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 27} The Employers Liability Coverage Form purports to extend coverage for substantial-certainty employer intentional torts, but not direct-intent employer intentional torts. While DTJ and Cavanaugh rely on the language of the Employers Liability Coverage Form to argue that \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d has a more limited meaning under the policy than under R.C. 2745.01, that argument does not address the overarching prohibition against legal liability for employer intentional torts in the absence of the employer\u2019s deliberate intent to cause injury. <em>See Kaminski, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, \u00b6 56. Under R.C. 2745.01, which took effect two years prior to the commencement of the policy period, DTJ and Cavanaugh cannot be legally obligated to pay damages for an employer intentional tort except based upon a finding that they acted with the intent to injure Hoyle. Whether Hoyle proves that intent with direct evidence under R.C. 2745.01(A) or with an unrebutted presumption under R. C. 2745.01(C), intent to injure is an essential element of his claim for an employer intentional tort. <em>Id. </em>Thus, although Hoyle might prevail without direct evidence of a deliberate intent to injure, he cannot recover without a finding that DTJ and Cavanaugh acted with the intent to injure. <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>S.D.Ohio No. 3:13-cv-175, 2014 WL 6687150, at *12. Because the Employers Liability Coverage Form excludes from coverage \u201cliability for acts committed by or at the direction of an insured with the deliberate intent to injure,\u201d there is no set of facts under which DTJ and Cavanaugh could be legally liable to Hoyle that falls within the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\n<em>Public Policy Against Insuring for Employer Intentional Torts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">{\u00b6 28} CIC additionally argues that it is not required to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh because any coverage under the Employers Liability Coverage Form would violate Ohio\u2019s long-standing public policy prohibiting insurance against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>liability for an insured\u2019s own intentional torts, now that it has been established that R.C. 2745.01 is constitutional. That public policy is based on \u201c \u2018the assumption that [intentionally tortious] conduct would be encouraged if insurance were available to shift the financial cost of the loss from the wrongdoer to his insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harasyn v. Normandy Metals, Inc., </em>49 Ohio St.3d 173, 176, 551 N.E.2d 962 (1990), quoting Farbstein &amp; Stillman, <em>Insurance for the Commission of Intentional Torts, </em>20 Hastings L.J. 1219, 1245-1246 (1969). But not all intentional torts are uninsurable in Ohio. <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. New England Ins. Co., </em>87 Ohio St.3d 280, 283, 720 N.E.2d 495 (1999). <em>Harasyn </em>carved out from the general rule prohibiting insurance for intentional torts those employer intentional torts based solely on the substantial certainty of injury. We reasoned that \u201cwhere intent is inferred from \u2018substantial certainty\u2019 of injury, the presence of insurance has less effect on the tortfeasor\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Harasyn </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 29} Because the terms of the Employers Liability Coverage Form preclude coverage in this case, we need not broadly determine whether the rationale in <em>Harasyn </em>remains applicable in light of the subsequent enactment of R.C. 2745.01 or whether Ohio public policy prohibits any type of indemnity coverage for employer intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Illusory Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, we turn to DTJ and Cavanaugh\u2019s argument that if, as we have found, the CIC policy does not provide indemnity coverage for employer intentional torts, then the Employers Liability Coverage Form provides no coverage at all and is illusory. Relying on <em>Ward v. United Foundries, Inc., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 292, 2011-Ohio-3176, 951 N.E.2d 770, CIC responds that the endorsement is not illusory, because even if it did not provide the coverage that DTJ and Cavanaugh intended to purchase, it provided other coverage, including negligence-only coverage when employers are sued in dual capacities and coverage in situations not involving the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 31} DTJ and Cavanaugh did not raise the issue of illusory coverage in the trial court, and neither the trial court nor the court of appeals addressed this issue. \u201c \u2018Ordinarily, reviewing courts do not consider questions not presented to the court whose judgment is sought to be reversed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Quarto Mining Co. v. Foreman, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 78, 81, 679 N.E.2d 706 (1997), quoting <em>Goldberg v. Indus. Comm. of Ohio, </em>131 Ohio St. 399, 404, 3 N.E.2d 364 (1936). Therefore, we decline to address DTJ and Cavanaugh\u2019s argument that the Employers Liability Coverage Form provided only illusory coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\n<em>Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 32} On July 1, 2014, subsequent to oral argument, CIC moved this court for leave to file supplemental authority, pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 17.09(A), which provides, \u201cUnless ordered by the Supreme Court, the parties shall not tender for filing and the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall not file any additional briefs or other materials relating to the merits of the case after the case has been orally argued.\u201d CIC requests leave to file an affidavit from a vice president in its Commercial Lines Department regarding CIC\u2019s actions with respect to employers\u2019 liability coverage following this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kaminski, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, and <em>Stetter, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092. CIC states that it obtained the new affidavit in response to questions posed by various justices during oral argument. DTJ, Cavanaugh, and Hoyle oppose CIC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 33} The affidavit that CIC presents, having been obtained following oral argument, was not in the record before either the trial court or the court of appeals. It is a fundamental principle that an appellate court is constrained to review only those matters contained in the record. <em>See Brown v. Cleveland, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 93, 98, 420 N.E.2d 103 (1981). The record on appeal in this court consists of the original papers and exhibits, transcripts, journal entries, and the docket from the trial court and the court of appeals. S.Ct.Prac.R. 15.01(A). Thus, the new affidavit is not properly a part of the record, and we may not expand the record by permitting the filing of evidentiary material that was not before the lower courts. Moreover, the substance of the evidence CIC requests to file \u2014 that CIC credited DTJ and Cavanaugh $15 for the eight-day period between our decisions in <em>Kaminski </em>and <em>Stetter </em>and the end of the applicable policy period \u2014 is not relevant to the legal questions we answer in this appeal. Accordingly, we deny CIC\u2019s motion for leave to file post-oral-argument supplemental material.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 34} Because liability for an employer intentional tort under R.C. 2745.01 requires a finding that the employer acted with the intention to injure an employee, we conclude that an insurance provision that excludes from coverage liability for an insured\u2019s act committed with the deliberate intent to injure an employee precludes,coverage for employer intentional torts. As a result, no facts could give rise to a duty upon CIC to indemnify DTJ or Cavanaugh, even if Hoyle were to prevail on his claims against them. Accordingly, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of CIC on its claim for declaratory judgment. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Ninth District Court of Appeals and reinstate the summary judgment in favor of CIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b330-4\">Lanzinger and Kennedy, JJ., concur in syllabus and judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b330-5\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\">.

Even if a plaintiff proves the employer\u2019s intent to injure directly under R.C. 2745.01(A) or (B), or by an unrebutted presumption under R.C. 2745.01(C), the act is not insurable as was the old substantial-certainty intentional tort. <em>Harasyn v. Normandy Metals, Inc., </em>49 Ohio St.3d 173, 176, 551 N.E.2d 962 (1990). There is now nothing less than deliberate intent. As a practical matter, employees will be limited to workers\u2019 compensation remedies for their workplace injuries.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-8\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b330-9\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIa_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">{\u00b6 36} Thirty-three years ago, the Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chem., Inc., </em>69 Ohio St.2d 608, 433 N.E.2d 572 (1982), declared that the very proposition that an employer could be immune from civil liability arising from intentionally injuring its workers was an outrage. Today is a good day to review the sordid history of so-called intentional torts in the workplaces of Ohio. The case before us demonstrates the money-driven efforts to return once again to the <em>pre-Blankenship </em>days, when profits were never placed in peril by the egregious acts of management.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">{\u00b6 37} Let\u2019s take a look at why <em>Blankenship </em>was so important. The facts speak for themselves. In <em>Blankenship, </em>the complaint alleged that workers had been intentionally exposed to toxic chemicals without warning and as a result had suffered chemical intoxication. The trial court had dismissed the claim as insufficient under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and held that workers\u2019 compensation was the exclusive remedy for the poisoned workers, and the court of appeals had affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">{\u00b6 38} The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed. The court concluded, \u201cSince an employer\u2019s intentional conduct does not arise out of employment, R.C. 4123.74 does not bestow upon employers immunity from civil liability for their intentional torts and an employee may resort to a civil suit for damages.\u201d <em>Blankenship </em>at 613. The court held, \u201cAn employee is not precluded by Section 35, Article II of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the Ohio Constitution, or by R.C. 4123.74 and 4123.741 from enforcing his common law remedies against his employer for an intentional tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. The court determined that it was unreasonable to equate the negligent conduct covered by the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with intentional conduct in terms of the degree of risk facing Ohioans while at work. <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 39} In response, the General Assembly enacted former R.C. 4121.80, Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 733-737. R.C. 4121.80 was invalidated by this court in <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Carp., </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722 (1991). Eight years later, this court affirmed the holding in <em>Brady </em>and clearly stated that \u201cany statute created to provide employers with immunity from liability for their intentional tortious conduct cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\u201d <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 298, 304, 707 N.E.2d 1107 (1999). In 1995, the General Assembly enacted yet another statute intended to eliminate liability for employer intentional torts. Based on our holding in <em>Brady </em>and <em>Blankenship, </em>former R.C. 2745.01 was invalidated by this court in its entirety because it was unconstitutional and because the excessive statutory requirements and heightened burden of proof in the statute \u201ccreated a cause of action that is simply illusory.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 40} The current version of R.C. 2745.01 was challenged and upheld in <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066. As Justice Pfeifer lamented in his dissenting opinion, \u201cthe General Assembly has found a court that agrees with it: workers have no constitutionally protected right to seek redress for injuries suffered from their employers\u2019 intentional torts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). - The gradual extinction of the rights of workers to recover for injuries they suffer as a result of intentional conduct by their employers serves no one. Indeed, \u201cthis abdication of employer responsibility * * * is an affront to the dignity of every single working man and working woman in Ohio.\u201d <em>Blankenship, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 617, 433 N.E.2d 572 (Celebrezze, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 41} The lead opinion states that this case is merely about the insurability of employer intentional torts. The lead opinion states and reiterates that Hoyle\u2019s intentional-tort claim against his employer has yet to be decided and remains viable under the statute. Lead opinion, \u00b6 14, 22. I wish I could agree. Hoyle deserves his day in court. Unfortunately, I believe that Justice Lanzinger is correct when she writes that as a result of this decision, \u201c[t]here is now nothing less than deliberate intent\u201d and that the practical effect of the lead opinion is that injured employees will be limited to workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 35 (Lanzinger, J., concurring in syllabus and judgment only).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>{\u00b6 42} Now we have insurance agents selling worthless pieces of paper that will never pay a claim to assuage the fears of managers as they, in the name of increased production and reduced labor costs, remove saw guards, disable air-filtration systems, and store time-consuming safety equipment in their offices. After all, they have been assured by their insurance agent that if they get caught intentionally injuring their employees, it will be an insured event.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 43} In this case, DTJ Enterprises, Inc., and Cavanaugh Building Corporation stand in the spotlight and very well may be found culpable for the missing safety device. In that event, they could be legally liable to Hoyle under R.C. 2745.01(A) if he can show that the employer acted with intent to injure. One of the ways that Hoyle can show intent, should this matter ever see the inside of a courtroom, is by using the presumption under R.C. 2745.01(C). Most important to our inquiry here is that the insurance policy in question explicitly excludes coverage only for <em>deliberate </em>intentional torts. And while the policy defines an intentional act as an act <em>substantially certain </em>to cause bodily injury, it is significant that the policy does not limit the definition of intent to mean <em>deliberate </em>intent. Thus DTJ and Cavanaugh could be legally liable to Hoyle for intentional conduct under the statute and within the scope of the policy. But somehow the lead opinion reaches the conclusion that there is no set of facts under which DTJ and Cavanaugh could be legally liable to Hoyle that falls within the policy\u2019s coverage. I disagree. A single act could in fact be found to be substantially certain to cause an injury but not be driven by a deliberate intent to injure.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 44} The lead opinion rationalizes its erroneous conclusion by adopting the assertion of Cincinnati Insurance Company (\u201cCIC\u201d) that it is not required to indemnify DTJ and Cavanaugh, because any coverage under the Employers Liability Coverage Form \u2014 Ohio violates Ohio\u2019s long-standing public policy prohibiting insurance against liability for an insured\u2019s own intentional torts. CIC\u2019s brazen assertion here is disingenuous at best, considering that it drafted the policy and collected premiums from DTJ. Can this court truly countenance an insurance company\u2019s assertion that it should be permitted to collect a premium for an event that is never going to happen?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 45} More important, as the lead opinion points out, this court has determined that not all intentional torts are uninsurable. Lead opinion, \u00b6 28, citing <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. New England Ins. Co., </em>87 Ohio St.3d 280, 283, 720 N.E.2d 495 (1999) (minority opinion). \u201c[Ijnsurance coverage should be prohibited only for direct-intent torts.\u201d <em>Buckeye Union </em>at 283. As Justice Pfeifer explained in his opinion in <em>Buckeye Union, </em>\u201cin <em>Harasyn, </em>this court discussed the different levels of intent involved with intentional acts. \u2018The first level, * * * direct intent,\u2019 is where the actor does something which brings about the exact result desired. In the second, the actor does something which he believes is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>substantially certain to cause a particular result, even if the actor does not desire that result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, quoting <em>Harasyn v. Normandy Metals, Inc., </em>49 Ohio St.3d 173, 175, 551 N.E.2d 962 (1990). Nobody in this case seems to be arguing that DTJ or Cavanaugh directly intended Hoyle to fall 14 feet from the ladder-jack scaffold onto a concrete pad. Rather, the genuine issue of material fact here is whether or not the job superintendent kept the bolts necessary to secure the ladder jacks to the ladders in his office because they took too much time to use. That is the real question before this court. This court has everything it needs to hold in favor of the policy holder in this case. It has a statute, a policy bought and paid for, and relevant caselaw of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Regardless of these binding guideposts, the majority forges ahead in the wrong direction. \u201cWhat is good for workers is good for Ohio.\u201d <em>Blankenship, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 620, 433 N.E.2d 572 (Brown, J, concurring). This statement is no less true today than it was in 1982. The courthouse doors should not be closed to a person who suffered an intentional injury merely because he was at work. Indeed, the \u2022 General Assembly has clearly made that proposition the law of Ohio. You intentionally hurt someone, you must pay \u2014 even if it happens in the workplace. And until that determination has been made by a competent court, the duty to indemnify requires a defense. There is no other logical explanation for accepting the premiums on this particular insurance policy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ava-dedup-0\">Plevin <em>&amp; </em>Gallucci and David R. Grant; and Paul W.
