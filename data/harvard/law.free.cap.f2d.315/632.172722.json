We appointed Mr. John E. Burruss, Jr., of Jefferson City, Missouri, as counsel to represent appellant on the appeal, and Mr. Burruss has since filed an able and exhaustive brief in support of appellant\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in making denial of the petition without holding a hearing thereon. The Attorney General of Missouri has now filed a motion to have the case remanded to the District Court for such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">On consideration of the motion, the order of the District Court denying the petition for a writ is hereby vacated, and the cause is remanded to that Court, with directions to grant appellant a hearing on the petition, to appoint counsel to represent him for purposes thereof, and to make appropriate disposition of the matter on the basis of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
