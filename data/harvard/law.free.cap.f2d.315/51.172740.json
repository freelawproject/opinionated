The first cause of action was based on the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 51 et seq.), herein sometimes referred to as \u201cF.E.L.A.\u201d The second cause of action was a common law action for negligence. Both were submitted to a jury, which found, in answers to special interrogatories: That Great Northern Railway was negligent; that such negligence was a proximate cause of appellant\u2019s fall and injuries; that Spokane International Railroad was not negligent; that appellant himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>was not negligent; that the appellant was not an employee of either defendant; that appellant sustained damages in the sum of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The F.E.L.A. thus being out of the case, the trial judge (as he had strongly indicated he would do when he submitted the issue of employment to the jury)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the defendant Great Northern Railway Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The sole question on appeal is whether the jury verdict was properly set aside and whether the judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly entered. This was a diversity case (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332), if not an F.E.L.A. case (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331). Jurisdiction exists here under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The circumstances leading up to the accident itself were generally undisputed. They were these:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">On March 19, 1959, Kaiser Aluminum had a shipment of aluminum sheets to be moved from its Trentwood plant near Spokane to Seattle and Honolulu. Spokane International Railroad, as the only railway company serving Kaiser\u2019s Trent-wood plant, was the originating carrier. The shipment was to move piggyback via Spokane International Railroad from Trentwood to Spokane, thence Great Northern Railway Company to Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The Spokane International Railroad had a contract with Ross Transfer Company for the handling of such trailer on flatcar movements. Under this arrangement, Ross Transfer would deliver a trailer to the shipper for loading of the aluminum, after which Ross Transfer Company would deliver the trailer to rail site and would load the trailer aboard the rail flatcar, secure it to the flatcar, and cover the load with a tarpaulin if required by the shipper.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Pursuant to this arrangement, plaintiff, Dale Ross, on March 19, 1959, delivered a trailer to Kaiser for loading of aluminum. After supervising the loading of the aluminum, he returned with the loaded trailer to the Great Northern Railway Company tracks near its freight house at Spokane and proceeded to load the trailer upon a flatcar provided by the Great Northern. In the loading of the trailer onto the flatcar, he was assisted by employees of Ross Transfer. He was also assisted by them in securing the trailer to the flatcar and covering the load with a tarpaulin which he had procured from the Great Northern freight house. In the process of turning or unfolding the tarpaulin on top of the load of aluminum on the trailer, which was then on the flatcar, he fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Plaintiff had been one of the partners and owners of Ross Transfer Company until January 1959, when the partnership, which had been incorporated, was sold to Riverside Warehouse. Before he picked up the load of aluminum from Kaiser, plaintiff picked up a tarp to cover the load at the Great Northern warehouse in Spokane. Plaintiff was told by a Great Northern employee where the tarps were located and plaintiff selected his own tarp from the warehouse. We have assumed for the purpose of this opinion that it was a tarp owned by the Great Northern Railway Company, although the tarps in the warehouse from which plaintiff selected the one involved here were owned by various trucking companies, as well as Great Northern Railway Company. When these tarps were returned to Spokane by railroad, they were consigned to Great Northern Agent McFarland and placed at door 11 of the Great Northern freight house, regardless of ownership. According to plaintiff, the tarpaulin which he selected was no different than the others at the freight house. It weighed close to 200 pounds and folded was about 4 feet across, about 1% feet high, dark green in color, massive, heavy, halfway dirty, and in a used condition. The tarp was bulky, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>made of canvas and had eyelets on it, much the same as Exhibits Nos. 31 and 32. They (the tarps) were also expensive, costing between $180.00 and $200.-00 apiece and, of course, were waterproof, inasmuch as their purpose was to protect the shipment from damage by rain and the elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">When plaintiff Ross arrived at the Great Northern piggyback loading ramp with the load of aluminum, he then backed the trailer load of aluminum onto the railroad flatcar and put the original tarp he had selected earlier in the day up on top of the load of aluminum. Plaintiff\u2019s brother, Gerald Ross, was helping him with the tarpaulin on top of the load of aluminum. Plaintiff Ross was an expert in the piggyback business and did not need anyone to tell him how to do the details of his job. After plaintiff Ross and his brother Gerald had started to unroll the tarp on top of the load of aluminum, plaintiff had to get down for a moment to get the bill of lading out of the cab of the truck. While plaintiff was away from the tarp for a moment, his brother found that the tarp was placed on the load the wrong way and would have to be turned. When plaintiff got back on the load, his brother told him of the problem and they started to turn the tarp. According to Gerald Ross, his brother grabbed hold of the tarp to help turn it and pulled on the tarp and fell backwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Getting to the details of appellant\u2019s fall, it was appellant\u2019s theory of negligence that there were wires passing through the \u201ceyelets\u201d of the tarp, left on when wires had been used previously to secure the tarp to flat cars, later to be cut (as were the ropes sometimes alternately used) when the tarp was removed as a cover for the aluminum shipped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These wires, with their sharp points, could easily, say appellant\u2019s counsel, have caught in the tarp and when force was used by appellant to unfold the tarp, could have \u201cunexpectedly\u201d given way, \u201cplunging\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or \u201ccatapulting\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the appellant to the concrete floorway of the loading dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">There exists a considerable difference of opinion between counsel, both as shown by their briefs and expressed at the time of oral argument, as to just how the accident occurred; what force appellant exercised and against what object; where he was standing; whether the tarp was <em>folded </em>\u201cwrong\u201d, or was <em>placed </em>\u201cwrong\u201d on the load, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">For that reason we have carefully searched the record, and rely only on what was testified to by the various witnesses :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">(1) Appellant testified the tarp \u201cwas not folded correctly\u201d (Tr. 97,l. 3); \u201cit was folded wrong\u201d (Tr. 97, l. 6); the tarp was placed \u201ccrosswise of the car\u201d (Tr. 98, l. 13); and not completely unfolded (Tr. 98, ll. 18-19).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">\u201cIf it was folded right, you could set it on top of the load, in the center of the load, and roll it from both ends out * * * and it will automatically fall down over the load\u201d (Tr. 99, ll. 14-18); but is \u201cnot [then] completely unfolded\u201d (Tr. 100, l. 18). \u201c[A]fter you get it elongated out lengthwise,\u201d you \u201cput it on over the sides of the load\u201d (Tr. 100,1. 25,101,l.l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">After the tarp was found \u201cin the wrong direction, folded wrong * * we had to put it longways * * * we left it partially unfolded and proceeded to turn it partially unfolded (Tr. 101) * * * We had to turn it so it would fold longways over the load. (Tr. 101) After we had it turned it a ways, we started to unfold it some more\u201d (Tr. 102) and saw wire \u201ctwo pieces * * * four to six inches long,\u201d through the eye<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>lets (Tr. 103). \u201cWe were in the process [of turning the tarp]. I stepped across the load to the south side at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cQ. And then what happened at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\u201cA. I reached down, we were pulling and stretching or moving the tarp out, and I was over the side * * * [Tr. 108] * * * I was off about the center [of the load]. * * * [W]e were having a little trouble moving it, not too much, and as I was unfolding it and turning it, it seemed to give way and I went over the side. [Tr. 109] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cQ. Tell us how you happened to lose your grip on the tarp and fall off the load.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cThe Court: Let me put it this way, just tell us again, Mr. Ross, what you did at the time and what happened to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\u201cA. Well, as I was moving the tarp and unfolding it, I ran into trouble, or it was holding up, and I braced myself to keep the tarp moving and unfolding and something gave way. And I stepped back, I slipped, my hand slipped, I was over the side. I catapulted to the ground. I did not touch the side of the car.\u201d (Tr. 113.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">He had been standing sideways, not endwise to the load, facing north, with his back in the direction he fell. (Tr. 207-8.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">(2) On cross-examination, Dale Ross, who was an expert on the piggyback business of putting truck trailers on railway cars (Tr. 178-9; 196), testified he could have put the tarp on at the Kaiser plant when he picked up the load of aluminum or at the loading dock of the Great Northern spur before the trailer went on the flatcar, but \u201cmy time was behind\u201d (p. 162), and this was not done, in order \u201cto speed up the operation.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">\u201cQ. * * * [I] t was because you were in a hurry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">\u201cA. Yes. [Tr. 163]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">\u201cQ. * * * [I]t would have been safer to have taken the tarp down onto the ground and unfolded it and refolded it if it needed refolding? [Tr. 164]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-16\">\u201cA. * * * if we had time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">Ross had a six o\u2019clock deadline to meet. (Tr. 200.) His watch, broken in the accident, stopped at thirteen minutes to six. (Tr. 199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-18\">(3) Mr. Gerkensmeyer, warehouse foreman for the Great Northern Railway Company, testified he had visited Mr. Ross at his house a week or more after the accident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-19\">\u201cQ. Did you inquire about the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-20\">\u201cA. Yeah \u2014 well, I asked Mr. Ross-what happened, and he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-21\">\u201cQ. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-22\">\u201cA. He said, \u2018Just one of those things, Dick,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just lost my balance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-23\">\u201cQ. Did he make any mention of anything wrong with the tarp?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-24\">\u201cA. No.\u201d (Tr. 228-9.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-25\">(4) On the evening of the accident,. Emery Wellman, Manager of Ross-Transfer Company and plaintiff\u2019s supervisor, went to the hospital and talked to&gt; Mr. Ross. Testimony regarding this, conversation between Mr. Wellman and plaintiff Ross at the hospital was as follows (Tr. 320-1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-26\">\u201cQ. All right. Now, referring to the accident itself, you have just stated that you saw Mr. Ross on the night of the accident, is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-27\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-28\">\u201cQ. And as a matter of fact, did. you talk to him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-29\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-30\">\u201cQ. And during that discussion\u2019 didn\u2019t he state that he was careless?'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-31\">\u201cA. As I recall the conversation, he-made the comment that he was in a hurry, and that he guessed he was a. little careless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cQ. And that is the language he himself used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201cA. I believe so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">(5) Mr. Thomas Griffin, an employee of Ross Transfer Company, assisting plaintiff Ross and Gerald Ross in the loading at the time of the accident, testified as follows (Tr. 385-6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact, at the time or shortly thereafter, it was your impression that he slipped or tripped on the skids of aluminum, isn\u2019t \"that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201cMr. Kimer: I object. That wasn\u2019t \u25a0covered in the direct examination. I don\u2019t recall him testifying to anything about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I think you inquired about the nature of his fall and this would be in that general area. If he has any knowledge on this. I think he should be interrogated about it. Put him a question, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201cMr. Wetzel: Will you read the question ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201c(Whereupon, the previous question was read as follows: \u2018Q. As a matter of fact, at the time or shortly thereafter, it was your impression that he slipped or tripped on the skids of aluminum, isn\u2019t that correct?\u2019)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201cA. That would be the natural impression I would have, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">\u201cQ. (Mr. Wetzel) Is that the impression you had at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-14\">\u201cA. That is right, at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">The same Mr. Griffin testified as follows at Tr. 386-7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Hamblen) Mr. Griffin, you said this was an adequate tarp, I think that is the word you used, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-18\">\u201cQ. Speak up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-19\">\u201cA. Yes, that is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">(6) Plaintiff\u2019s brother, Gerald Ross, who was within a few feet of plaintiff when the accident happened, describes the accident as follows (Tr. 399-400):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ac-dedup-0\">\u201cA. Well, Dale got down off the load and I was working with the tarp and I unfolded it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-22\">\u201cQ. How far more did you unfold it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-23\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, I folded it out far enough to see what we had \u2014 it was the wrong way that we had it. We would have to turn it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-24\">\u201cQ. Then did he get back up on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-25\">\u201cA. Yes, he got back up on top of the load.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-26\">\u201cQ. What did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-27\">\u201cA. He crossed over the load and he got \u2014 he was facing north, standing, and he grabbed ahold of the tarp and I told him when he got up on the load that we would have to turn it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-28\">\u201cQ. What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-29\">\u201cA. He either saw or I told him. \u201cQ. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-30\">\u201cA. He grabbed ahold of the tarp and he pulled on the tarp, and he fell backwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-31\">\u201cQ. What happened in relation to whether or not his body \u2014 what happened to him, as he went backwards, you say, what happened to his body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMc\">\u201cA. He went \u2014 seemed to go straight back when I saw him going. I knew he was going to be hurt pretty bad, he was off balance, he was going backwards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-34\">In further testimony about the actual accident, plaintiff\u2019s brother Gerald testified as follows (Tr. 405):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-35\">\u201cQ. Now, with regard to the accident, isn\u2019t it your statement that Dale slipped or tripped and then lost his hold on the tarp, and then fell over the south side of the load ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-36\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-37\">\u201cQ. Was the flatcar standing still at the time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-38\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cQ. There were no switch engines or switch crew in the vicinity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201cA. Not right at that moment, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">\u201cQ. Now, it was also your statement that Dale could have tripped on the edge of the crates or slipped on one of the steel bands, is that not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cQ. Now, you had an uneven footing on top of the load, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"al-dedup-0\">\u201cA. Yes, that is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The jury found the plaintiff Ross was not an employee of either railroad. The Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act is therefore not in the case. The trial judge, out of an abundance of caution, permitted the jury to determine if there was any inference of employment by either railroad, so as to bring the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act into play. (Tr. 423.) When that aspect of the case was eliminated by the special findings of the jury, the ease became one purely of common law negligence. The federal statutes, and cases decided in interpreting them, have no place, then or now, in our consideration of the issues now remaining in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Counsel for appellant urges that the railroad failed to present any evidence to explain the fall \u2014 that the railroad \u201cfailed to bring forward any theory to explain the hanging up and instantaneous release of the tarpaulin,\u201d (Brief, p. 38); that \u201cthe presence of the only items that could cause the tarp to hang up and then suddenly release, were found by the jury to be the wires through the eyelets of the tarp.\u201d (Brief, p. 45.) The jury\u2019s interrogatories did not explicitly cover or refer to the wires, nor what caused the fall, nor were any such interrogatories requested or proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The difficulty with appellant\u2019s factual position on appeal is' that he interprets the language: \u201ca slip \u2014 my hand slipped, \u2014something gave way\u201d into a \u201csudden release <em>of the wires </em>\u2014 the only items that could cause the tarp to suddenly release.\u201d The story told by appellant best suited to his counsel\u2019s theory of the case does not support the language used on his behalf in his briefs. It assumes the slip of appellant\u2019s hand, the bracing pull appellant made; his moving from the center of the load to the south side, facing north, and his uneven footing all <em>could not </em>have caused or proximately contributed to the occurrence of the accident. This without reference to appellant\u2019s deadline, his admitted haste, his alleged admitted loss of balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">As the trial court carefully pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">\u201cMr. Ross\u2019s testimony does not show directly or justify the inference that in his handling of the tarpaulin \u2018the something\u2019 that \u2018gave way\u2019 was a wire or wires in the eyelets of the tarpaulin or some condition in the tarpaulin caused thereby. It is a matter of common experience that heavy canvas when compactly folded is more or less stiff and subject to crinkling and catching in folding. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony does not reasonably exclude this and several other equally probable causes of his fall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Counsel for appellant urgently suggest that the second sentence quoted above constitutes the taking by the trial judge of judicial knowledge of a fact that is not true, and obviously not in evidence; that all heavy canvas may be stiff and subject to catching in unfolding. Without passing on this issue, we do not find it interferes with the validity of the court\u2019s conclusion in his third sentence, that appellant\u2019s testimony, considered fairly, and honestly, does not reasonably exclude several equally probable causes of his fall, other than the one he urges; the two or three four or six inch wires through the eyelets.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">Substantial evidence of appellee\u2019s negligence and the proximate causal relationship between it and appellant\u2019s injuries are required under Washington law. Substantial evidence is required, and a \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence is insufficient under that law. Wilson v. North. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Pac. Ry. Co., 1954, 44 Wash.2d 122, 265 P.2d 815; Evans v. Yakima Valley Transp. Co., 1952, 39 Wash.2d 841, 239 P.2d 336; Carley v. Allen, 1948, 31 Wash.2d 730, 198 P.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In Wilson v. North Pac. Ry. Co., supra, involving a crossing accident and common law negligence, the Washington Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cWe have held that negligence may be proven by circumstantial evidence. * * * We have also held that proof of negligence does not have to be beyond a reasonable doubt. * * * But this court has never held * * * that the proof of the proximate cause could be left to conjecture or speculation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a motion notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In Carley v. Allen, supra, the Washington Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cNegligence will not be presumed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u201cThe party alleging negligence must prove that negligence existed * * *, and, further, that the negligence was the proximate cause of the injury.\u201d (Citing Washington cases in support of each proposition.) (* * * 198 P.2d p. 831.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">And further, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">\u201cAnother rule of the same tenor is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">\u201c \u2018 * * * if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.\u2019 Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wash.2d 802, 180 P.2d 564, 569.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">\u201cAnother statement of the law is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">\u201c Tn showing that the negligence charged was the proximate cause of the injury, it is not enough for the plaintiff to prove that the negligence might perhaps have caused the injury. If, for example, the injury complained of might well have resulted from any one of many causes, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to produce evidence which will exclude the operation of those causes for which defendant is under no legal obligation. If the cause of the injury to the plaintiff may be as reasonably attributed to an act for which the defendant is not liable as to one for which he is liable, the plaintiff has not sustained the burden of fastening tortious conduct upon the defendant. The fact that a defendant joins issue upon a complaint containing a general averment of negligence, without moving to make the pleadings more definite, does not relieve the plaintiff from proving a particular act of negligence upon which to base his right to recover.\u2019 38 Am.Jur. 975, Negligence, \u00a7 285.\u201d 198 P.2d Id. at 831-832.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">De Young v. Campbell, 1957, 51 Wash.2d 1111, 315 P.2d 629, upon which appellant heavily relies, merely emphasizes the previously well recognized rule that inferences based upon circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to establish proximate cause. There \u201c[t]he evidence favorable to plaintiff, if believed by the jury, <em>reasonably excluded the possibility </em>that the accident was the result <em>of any cause other </em>than [her tires] contact with the street car rail.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It was, as the court emphasized, \u201cthe only conclusion that could fairly and reasonably be drawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">No such factual situation exists in this case. Many conclusions could fairly and reasonably be drawn from the evidence, including the conclusion that the wires attached to the tarp\u2019s eyelets had no proximate relationship whatsoever to the accident and appellant\u2019s injuries. As the trial court stated herein below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-20\">\u201cThe testimony does not * * * rise to the quality and substance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the evidence before the * * * court in De Young v. Campbell [supra] the cited decision most favorable to plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">And see Gardner v. Seymour, 1947, 27 Wash.2d 802, 150 P.2d 564, particularly pp. 569 and 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Any award, by jury or court, would herein on the evidence before us, rest on speculation or conjecture. As the Washington Supreme Court said in Nelson v. West Coast Dairy Co., 1940, 5 Wash.2d 284, 105 P.2d 76, 130 A.L.R. 606: \u201c[There must.be] more than a mere possibility that an accident or injury may have occurred in a particular way.\u201d There must exist a reasonable probability the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the proximate result of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Here the appellant, an admitted expert on the proper way to place tarpaulins on loaded trailers placed piggyback on freight cars (flats or gondolas), working without instructions as to how or in what manner he was to place the tarp; facing a deadline and in a hurry to finish his work; moving as he was over an uneven surface to such place and position on top of the load as he desired; without proof of any defective condition in the freight car, trailer, binding chains, tarpaulin, wires, ropes or any other equipment; with no proof anything gave way, or caught, or was suddenly released, has only proved that \u201csomething\u201d gave way, including the appellant\u2019s grip on the tarpaulin.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">This, of course, is not to say that appellants cannot win cases based on inferences arising from circumstantial evidence alone. They may, but as we have pointed out, the evidence must then \u201creasonably exclude\u201d any other proximate cause. This the evidence here presented to the jury failed to da</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The order of the district court, dismissing the action notwithstanding the general verdict of the jury for the appellant, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">. \u201cIf this was unquestionably a common law negligence case, I would not have the slightest hesitancy in dismissing the case for want of proof of either negligence or proximate cause.\u201d (Tr. 423)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-15\">. Appellant noticed two wires, in two eyelets, four to six inches in length.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-17\">.
