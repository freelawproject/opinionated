He also petitions for modification of our Order imposing costs upon him on the ground that it \u201cconstitutes a serious financial hardship to him and his family, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Since the defendant in its Answer to the Petition for Rehearing and Modification of Order Relating to Costs has stated that it will waive the collection of its costs \u201csolely because of the claim of hardship upon plaintiff\u2019s family\u201d the Order relating to costs will be amended so as to provide that each party is to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">There is no merit to the petition for rehearing. The reasons advanced therein are simply a rehash of the contentions previously advanced by the appellant. On our earlier review of the record we found them to be so specious as not to require our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The sum of appellant\u2019s position is that the District Court erred (1) in entering judgment in favor of the defendant on a jury\u2019s finding that he had not been induced by alleged fraudulent conduct on the defendant\u2019s part to enter into a release on February 1, 1957 in settlement of his then existing lawsuit under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, and (2) in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on a count in his Complaint which sought damages for an alleged breach of defendant\u2019s promise to give him \u201csuitable employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The record discloses that in June 1955 the appellant brought an action against the defendant railroad under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act alleging that he had sustained severe and permanent injuries while at work as a machinist in October 1950. The defendant paid the appellant $30,000 in settlement of his action on February 1, 1957 on his execution of an unconditional release at the office and in the presence of the experienced attorney who then represented him. An order of \u201cdismissal of prejudice\u201d was entered thereafter on February 14, 1957 by the District Court, pursuant to the execution of the release. The latter, it may be noted, stated in capital letters in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">\u201cThis Release Is Executed by Me Solely for the Consideration Above Expressed, Without Any Representation Whatsoever, and Has Been Carefully. Read by Me and .Understood by Me Before Signing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">The release also contained the following statement in the appellant\u2019s own handwriting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-13\">\u201cI have read and understand this statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">It may be noted parenthetically that the record discloses the appellant is a high school graduate.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">The day after the release was executed the appellant made application to the Railroad Retirement Board for disability benefits. Following a medical examination on March 8,1957 the Board granted the appellant a total disability annuity effective as of January 1, 1957. The section of the statute under which the annuity was granted states in part that it applies to \u201cIndividuals whose <em>permcty nent physical or mental condition </em>is such that they are unable to engage in any regular employment\u201d 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228b (a), subsection 5. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The appellant continued to receive total disability annuity payments from the Railroad Retirement Board, pursuant to annual renewal applications which he filed, \u201cuntil just a week or so\u201d before March 26, 1962 when the trial concerned in the instant appeal commenced. In connection with the foregoing it should be noted that in his Complaint in the instant action the appellant alleged that he \u201cwas physically able to work in January 1957 and so told the claim agent, and plaintiff at all times subsequent to January 1, 1957, was ready, able and willing to return to work and so informed defendant.\u201d The allegation stated was in support of the appellant\u2019s prayer for \u201cdamages represented by lost wages from the date of signing said release to the time of filing this action.\u201d (November 30, 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">At the trial appellant testified that it was not until November 1957 that he applied for re-employment as a machinist \u2014 his old job.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The Complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s claim agent \u201cwas acting within the scope of his authority\u201d in promising the appellant \u201cthat if he would sign, a release and settle his claim, defendant would immediately give him such employment as would be suitable to his condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The Complaint further prayed for recision of the 1957 release as \u201cinvalid\u201d and the reinstatment of Civil Action No. 13477 which had been dismissed with prejudice in 1957 pursuant to the application of the appellant\u2019s counsel and the defendant subsequent to the execution of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">At the conclusion of the testimony the case was sent to the jury with instructions to answer the following interrogatories which had been agreed upon by the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">(1) \u201cDid the defendant through its claim agent, Mr. Moneyhun, make an oral promise to the plaintiff on February 1, 1957, that in return for plaintiff\u2019s settlement of his lawsuit, the railroad would immediately employ the plaintiff at work suitable to his condition?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">(2) \u201cWas the oral promise false and made with knowledge of its falsity and with the intention of inducing plaintiff to enter into the settlement of his lawsuit and was the plaintiff induced thereby to enter into the settlement of his lawsuit against the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">(3) \u201cSubsequent to February 1, 1957, was the plaintiff physically able to safely perform the promised work?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">The jury answered \u201cYes\u201d to the first and third interrogatories and \u201cNo\u201d to the second interrogatory. The trial judge thereupon granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the Complaint insofar as it sought recision of the release and reinstatement of Civil Action No. 13477 which had been dismissed with prejudice in February, 1957, and directed the appellant to proceed to the jury on the breach of contract count in consonance with the jury\u2019s answers to the first and third interrogatories. The appellant rested after offering in evidence (1) Rule 20 of the bargaining agreement between the defendant and the appellant\u2019s union which provided that \u201cemployees who have given long and faithful service in the employ of the company, and who have become unable to perform arduous work, will be given preference of such light work in their line (or other duties mutually agreed to with local committee) as they are able to handle\u201d, and (2) the agreement between the defendant and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The defendant then moved for a directed verdict on these grounds (1) the terms of the February 1957 release could not be varied by parol evidence; (2) the alleged oral contract of \u201csuitable employment\u201d was unenforceable in that it was indefinite in its terms, and (3) the record lacked competent evidence as to the authority of the defendant\u2019s claim agent to enter into an oral contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The trial judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and dismissed the jury. He did not at the time, nor later, spell out the reasons for his action, although in his \u201cOrder for Judgment\u201d he noted that \u201ca motion for a directed verdict having been granted on the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the oral promise to provide the plaintiff a job suitable to his condition, judgment is hereby entered in favor of the defendant * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It is regrettable that the trial judge did not specify his reasons for granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict either at the trial or thereafter. It would seem highly desirable that such specification should have been made either at the trial or in a subsequent memorandum opinion although it must be pointed out that the appellant did not move below to effect reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s Order for Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">However, it is clear that independent of the other reasons advanced by the defendant in its motion for a directed verdict the alleged oral contract of \u201csuitable employment\u201d was so indefinite and vague as to be unenforceable. Laseter v. Pet Dairy Products Co., 246 F.2d 747 (4 Cir., 1957); Seiss v. McClinticMarshall Corp., 324 Pa. 201, 188 A. 109 (1936); 1 Williston on Contracts, Third Edition, \u00a7 37, p. 107 and \u00a7 42, pp. 135-137; 1 Restatement of the Law, Contracts, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> The Complaint in the instant case asserted jurisdiction \u201cby virtue of diversity of citizenship of the parties\u201d alleging that the plaintiff is a citizen of Pennsylvania and that the defendant is a Maryland corporation. The oral contract is alleged to have been entered into in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and accordingly Pennsylvania law controls. Seiss v. McClintic-Marshall Corp., supra, is accordingly dispositive in its holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u201cThe contract here set up is so lacking in precision, so indefinite and vague, that nothing certain about it can be formulated. \u2018In order that a contract may be enforceable the promise or the agreement of the parties to it must be certain and explicit, so that their full intention may be ascertained to a reasonable degree of certainty\u2019. Edgcomb v. Clough, 275 Pa. 90, 103, 118 A. 610, 614; McNeely v. Bookmyer, 292 Pa. 12, 15, 140 A. 542, 543; Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 32; Williston on Contracts (Rev. Ed.) \u00a7 42; What is \u2018suitable employment\u2019? Who is to determine what it is? What is implied by \u2018any employment that I was able to do\u2019 ? Without more these words are too indefinite to predicate anything upon with certainty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">The Federal rule is in accord. Laseter v. Pet Dairy Products Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">The defendant\u2019s third point that the record failed to disclose evidence establishing the authority of its claim agent to enter into an oral contract of employment was also well taken. Indeed the appellant did not offer testimony which even tended to establish that the defendant\u2019s claim agent was clothed with authority to enter into an oral contract of employment in defendant\u2019s behalf or that it was within the apparent scope of the agent\u2019s authority to enter into such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">The appellant only offered in evidence the following stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-13\">\u201cW. J. Moneyhun is Assistant General Claim Agent of defendant railroad company. He assists in the investigation, handling of trial preparations, and in settlement of tort claims against defendant railroad.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-14\"> In its Answer to the Complaint the defendant denied that its claim agent had authority to enter into an oral contract of employment. It is settled that the scope of the authorization of a claim agent is not defined by law and if put in issue must be proved as a matter of fact and the burden of proof is on the one suing for the breach of the oral agreement.

Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>85 Kan. 568, 118 P. 60, 38 L.R.A., N.S., 826 (1911); St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. Co. v.

Co., 70 N.H. 526, 49 A. 103, 104 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In view of what has been said it is unnecessary to dwell any further on this petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The petition for rehearing will be denied. The Order relating to costs will be amended to provide that each party pay its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">. \u201cAnd Now, to wit, this 5th day of April, 1962, the above case having come on for trial and the Court having submitted to the jury the question of fraud concerning the validity of the release and taking into consideration the answers to the interrogatories returned by the jury, the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal of the claim in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for reinstatement of Civil Action No. 13477, which is an action under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, was granted; plaintiff having withdrawn his claim under Rule 20 of the union contract; and a motion for a directed verdict having been granted on the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the oral promise to provide the plaintiff a job suitable to his condition, judgment' is hereby entered in favor of the defendant, The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and against the plaintiff, Walter B.
