Appellant was arrested by Louisiana authorities on the basis of an affidavit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dated June 18, 1962. Extradition papers from Mississippi arrived on July 20 and 24,1962. Rendition proceedings were held in the State Criminal District Court July 21 and August 6, 1962 at which time appellant pled the thirty day prescriptive period set out in LSA-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>R.S. 15:168, but the court held that the \u00a7 168 prescriptive period \u201cwas of no moment\u201d inasmuch as the prisoner was then being held under the Louisiana Governor\u2019s warrant of arrest, LSA-R.S. 15:160. The court below denied a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">LSA-R.S. 15:168 is a state statute <em>implementing </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3182<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in that the federal statute provides that, <em>after </em>request by the executive authority of the fugitive state, the executive authority of the asylum state shall have the fugitive arrested and held thirty days. Th\u00e9 Louisiana statute is a holding statute, allowing an arrest on affidavit <em>pending </em>an extradition request.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">State v. Commisso, 214 La. 1055, 39 So.2d 729 (1949) held that \u201cThe state cannot hold the accused by successive affidavits for any time beyond the thirty day period to await extradition. * * * [but] There is nothing to prevent the authorities from proceeding under a warrant of the governor of this state issued upon a proper demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We agree. Assuming that the appellant was held for three days without legal authority, no federally-protected rights were violated and to hold that Louisiana\u2019s alleged misbehavior deprived Mississippi of its Constitutional<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> right to the fugitive would amount to allowing the State of Louisiana to amend the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">The judgment of the court below is right and is</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">WISDOM, Circuit Judge. I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\">. LSA-R.S. 15:108</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">\u201c\u00a7 168.
