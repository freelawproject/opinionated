Moreover, no motion was made at the conclusion of the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>trial for a verdict of acquittal on a basis of the failure of the government to introduce evidence sufficient to carry the case to the jury. Thus the trial court was given no opportunity to examine this particular criticism as to the fo.rm of the question. We are convinced that no substantial injustice resulted from the form of the question, and therefore we do not consider that the point should be the basis of reversal by this Court in the absence of a timely motion in the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-17\">. Section 4705 of Title 26 U.S.O.A. makes criminal the sale of narcotic drugs \u201cexcept in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold * * * on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-14\">. We think it only appropriate to comment that different counsel tried the case than counsel who appear before this Court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
