The Court, John 0. Henderson, District Judge, denied the application as \u201cwithout merit\u201d. The District Court also denied permission to appeal in forma pauperis. This Court granted permission to appeal in forma pauperis and to dispense with appendices and took the appeal on submission of the parties\u2019 briefs and exhibits and appellee\u2019s appendix. We find no merit in the appeal and affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-24\">It appears from the material submitted by appellant that a dictionary and al-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>manae were taken from him when he was placed in segregation for disciplinary reasons. There is no claim that he is denied periodic access to the limited prison law library or access to the courts, state and federal, through the mails. Indeed, this appeal itself demonstrates neither difficutly in access to the courts nor lack of facility in presenting argument. Refusal to allow Williams to keep in his segregation cell the two books which had somehow come into his possession violated no federal right of Williams and is not sufficient basis for a civil rights action, even under the most liberal view of the propriety of court review of prison disciplinary action. See the critique \u201cComplaints of Convicts\u201d, 72 Yale Law Journal 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The order of the District Court denying permission to bring an action in for-ma pauperis is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
