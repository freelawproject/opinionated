(These four Illinois public utilities will hereinafter be referred to as plaintiffs). Plaintiffs serve some 2,500,000 consumers with electric light and power.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-27\">The district court\u2019s original jurisdiction was invoked under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Sections 4, and 5(b) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15, and 16(b)). The effect of these price fixing conspiracies, it is alleged, was the creation of \u201chigh and artificial levels\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>prices for the electrical equipment purchased by plaintiffs. All of these cases arise out of the so-called Philadelphia Electrical Conspiracy Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Attorney General of Illinois seeks to intervene in these proceedings for the State of Illinois. Intervention is sought as of right in order to represent and protect the interests of the public consumers of plaintiffs who it is claimed were injured by defendants\u2019 price fixing conspiracies in that plaintiffs were caused to pay high and artificial prices for electrical equipment used in its utility operations, which excessive prices were in turn collected from the public consumers through higher utility rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The State of Illinois in support of its motion for intervention urges that it has in behalf of the public consumers a direct interest in the recoveries which may be realized in these proceedings and that its participation is' necessary to effectuate a proper and equitable distribution among the injured parties of any monies or fund so recovered. It is further urged that, \u201cThe representation of this public interest by existing parties may be inadequate and the applicant may be bound by a judgment or order in the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Permissively, the Attorney General seeks to intervene on behalf of state agencies and institutions which have made purchases from defendants of the involved electrical equipment during the period of the conspiracy. It is alleged that the claims arising from these purchases present questions of law and fact which are common to the main action.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Both plaintiffs and defendants oppose the motion of the State of Illinois to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The district court denied the State\u2019s application for intervention both as of right and permissively. The district judge\u2019s memorandum stating his reasons for the ruling appears in 207 F.Supp. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">This appeal was taken in the first of these eighteen related cases under a stipulation among the parties that this court\u2019s determination in this appeal shall govern the matter of intervention by the State of Illinois in all of the related cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">I. Intervention As op Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">We agree that the district judge was correct in not allowing the State of Illinois by its Attorney General to intervene in behalf of the consumers of the four public utility plaintiffs; we reach that result, however, for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">The primary essential element, that must exist for an applicant to intervene in a pending action as of right under Rule 24(a) Fed.R.Civ.P. is that he have-a direct personal or pecuniary interest in-the subject of the litigation; in this, the-mandatory provisions differ from the permissive under Rule 24(b) Fed.R.Civ.P. See Securities &amp; Exchange Comm\u2019n. v. United States Realty Co., 310 U.S. 434, 459, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 84 L.Ed. 1293 (1940). All other essential elements, i. e., \u201crepresentation of the applicant\u2019s interest by existing parties is or may be inadequate and the applicant is or may be bound by a judgment in the action\u201d (Rule 24(a) (2)), as well as \u201cthe applicant is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property which is in the custody or subject to the-control or disposition of the court * (Rule 24(a) (3)), are secondary to the-existence of a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the subject of the litigation by the applicant for intervention as-of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">We hold that the State of Illinois-as agent or <em>parens patriae </em>of the consumers (accepting arguendo that the State off Illinois can properly assume such role) or even the consumers themselves do not have any direct personal or pecuniary interest in these antitrust actions. Our-holding renders moot any discussion off the existence of the subsumed secondary-elements. The rationale for our holding-folio ws.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">The interests of plaintiffs and the consumers are different and arise from separate though related operative facts. The legal interest of plaintiffs which they are attempting to vindicate in these actions arises under the federal antitrust. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>statutes. The damages, if any, to which they are entitled are measured by the hurt they may have suffered by reason of the alleged conspiracies claimed to be vio-lative of the antitrust laws. That hurt is measured by the excessive prices they claim were paid for equipment purchased from defendants. The alleged conspiracies spent themselves on these purchasers. The aftereffects of the hurt on the consumers are consequential and too remote for the consumers to gain rights against the conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The consumers\u2019 rights, if any, to reparation for their consequential hurt arise from higher rates and charges for services provided by plaintiffs. That is the proximate cause of their injury, not the antitrust violation. See Keogh v. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183 (1922). The consumers\u2019 rights do not penetrate through to the antitrust conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">To put it differently, the question whether the State of Illinois, in behalf of the consumers, can as of right intervene may be answered by posing another question which underlies and is vital to the first. The underlying question is: Could the State of Illinois bring a direct action against defendants? The answer is \u201cno\u201d, because there was no direct proximate impact of the conspiracies on the consumers. The impact on them was remote and took the shape of allegedly higher rates paid for utility services\u2014 rates established as legal by the Illinois Commerce Commission. Although these rates may be determined to have been unreasonable because of conspiratorially fixed equipment costs which went into the basic rate structure, that is another issue not cognizable in these antitrust actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We do not feel called upon to determine whether such issue embraces legally vindicate rights possessed by the consumers or what means of recovery, if any, should be pursued. All we are deciding is that the consumers\u2019 rights may not be asserted in these antitrust actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The State of Illinois, by asking to intervene in behalf of the consumers, is in effect attempting under the guise of intervention to substitute itself in the role of protector of the consumers\u2019 interests for plaintiffs, in part at least, as the aggrieved party in these antitrust actions; or what seems more likely, is tendering a collateral issue having it genesis outside the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">In either event, the asserted mutuality of antitrust interest is lacking; hence, the State of Illinois fails to satisfy the mandatory intervention prerequisites of Rule 24 Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">II. Permissive Intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of the State of Illinois\u2019 motion for permissive intervention as a purchaser of defendants\u2019 products that has suffered damage by reason of the alleged conspiracies. In support of its motion to intervene, the State claims common issues of law and fact. As stated by the district judge in his memorandum, \u201cWhile it is apparent that the State\u2019s claim as to the issue of the conspiracy will present questions of law and fact in common with the main actions, this is not true as to the question of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The State may start an independent action against defendants if it chooses. At that time the district court may decide in its sound discretion whether the State\u2019s action should be consolidated for trial with the pending actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">The order denying the motion of the State of Illinois to intervene as a party plaintiff, both as of right and permissively, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
