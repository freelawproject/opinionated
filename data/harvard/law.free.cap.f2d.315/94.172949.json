After a trial without a jury, the defendant was found guilty of engaging in wagering transactions without paying the special tax imposed by 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 4411 and of failing to register as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4412, and was sentenced to pay a fine totalling $2,000 and a penalty of $50. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7262, 7203, 7272. The defendant\u2019s contentions of error at trial are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-22\">By order dated October 1, 1962, Judge McGohey denied the defendant\u2019s motion for the return of money seized by Internal Revenue Service agents at the time of his arrest. The money having been seized and being subject to forfeiture under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7302, and having been administratively forfeited as prescribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7325, the motion for the return of the money was properly denied. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7327, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618. See United States v. Heckinger, 163 F.2d 472 (2 Cir., 1947); United States v. One Pontiac Coupe, 298 F.2d 421 (7 Cir., 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
