In the election District 50 received five votes, the third union received three votes, and appellant received none. The basis for this challenge is that District 50 is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d as defined in Section 2(5) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act because its members do not participate in the election of its officers. The record before the Board indicates that the officers of District 50 are simply appointed by the national headquarters of the United Mine Workers, there having been no election in at least eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">Appellant claims that election of officers is the bare minimum \u201cparticipation\u201d required and that, therefore, certification of District 50 is in \u201cplain contravention\u201d of a statutory requirement, vesting jurisdiction in the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. See Leedom v. Kyne, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 398, 249 F.2d 490 (1957), affirmed, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>asserts that admission of employees to membership satisfies the statutory requirement of \u201cparticipation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">This case raises the important question of the responsibility of the Board with respect to the internal affairs of unions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since an unsuccessful union in a certification proceeding before the Board has no adequate remedy by review,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and it appearing that certification of an organization as bargaining agent which is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d would be in direct contravention of the Act, the jurisdiction of the District Court in a Leedom v. Kyne type of action should be determined. Unfortunately, this case does not provide the proper vehicle since the issue was presented to the Board only three days before the election in a motion for rehearing. The Board denied the motion without opinion. Consequently, we are unaware of the basis of the Board action. Since appellant here failed properly to raise this issue before the Board, his independent suit in the District Court lacks equity. We therefore decline to exercise jurisdiction for this reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">WASHINGTON, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">. 49 Stat. 453 as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">.
