There are no other claims and the legal issue is such that it is unnecessary to distinguish between the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-20\">\n<em>Application Prosecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\">The prosecution of this application was truly compact. On the first action the examiner rejected the claims on a single reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-21\">\u201cRobins et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 78, pp. 2418-2422 (1956)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">The action is so brief and to the point that we quote it in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-23\">\u201cClaims 1-3 are rejected as being unpatentable over Robins et al. Note Compound XVI. The ethyl and n-butyl side chains depicted in applicant\u2019s claims 2 and 3 are <em>obvious homologs of the methyl groups shown in identical positions in the reference compound </em>and the method of preparation is substantially the same. (In re Henze, 636 O.G. 698).\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-24\">Compound XVI of the Robins et al. article is described by its structural formula which would be identical with that of appellant\u2019s claim 1, supra, if all of the three R\u2019s therein were methyl, -CH3, producing a trimethyl compound. There is textual reference to this and two other formulae, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-25\">\u201cMethylation of 5,7-dihydroxy-pyrazolo [4,3-d]-pyrimidine with dimethyl sulfate in the presence of sodium hydroxide gave a compound C8H10O2N4 isomeric with caffeine, presumably 1,4,6-trimethylpyrazolo [4,3-d] pyrimidine-5,7-dione (XV), although <em>the possibility of the isomeric structure XVI for this compound has not been entirely eliminated. </em>It is interesting to note that under the conditions of the experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ment only one isomer was isolated.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">By reason of this speculation on the part of Robins et al. as to whether they really produced XV or XVI, appellant points out that what the Patent Office relies on as prior art to show obviousness of the claimed compounds is the formula considered least likely by the authors. However, we give no weight to the speculative nature of the prior art compound because we do not believe that, in final analysis, appellant does so. His brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cThe Robins et al. reference discloses, at best, that the lower homo-log of the claimed compounds may possibly exist, as a less likely alternative, and, if it does, how it is formed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The case is really argued, however, on the assumption that a lower homolog of the claimed compounds is in the prior art and we shall proceed on that assumption. In other words, comparing the specific compound of claim 2 with the prior art, the compounds differ only in that where appellant has three ethyl groups the prior art has three methyl groups, a total difference of three -CH2 groups. Whether this meets the usual definitions of \u201chomology\u201d (according to two additional references to chemical texts made of record by the Patent Office) we do not stop to consider inasmuch as appellant has not argued the point.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, we do not see why the.Robins et al. compound XVI is not \u201cthe related trimethyl compound\u201d referred to in the specification, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The claims having been rejected on Robins et al., appellant responded by filing the affidavit of Dr. Francis J. Saunders (Ph,D.1937), physiologist and a member, since 1938, of the Biology Division of G. D. Searle &amp; Co., owner of the application at bar. Dr. Saunders has been in charge of Searle\u2019s endocrinological and related physiological research. The affidavit reports comparative tests of the Robins et al. trimethyl compound and appellant\u2019s triethyl compound which show that the latter is an active anti-inflammatory agent while the prior art compound is completely inactive in that respect. We need not examine the tests in detail because the Patent Office has accepted the factual conclusions of the affiant based on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">We have before us, therefore, a single clean-cut issue of law. The claims are rejected only on the ground that they are unpatentable over a single reference which discloses what is conceded to be a lower homolog of the claimed compounds (whether or not all chemists would so consider it) and proof has been given showing that the compound of claim 2, \u201ca representative member of\u201d the group of compounds claimed, possesses an advantageous pharmacological property shown not to be possessed by the prior art compound. In filing the affidavit, appellant stated in his response to the office action that the compounds of his claims 1 and 3 included more distantly related compounds than the triethyl compound tested and submitted that the showing of unpredictable and \u201ccompletely dissimilar biological properties\u201d established the patentability of the compounds he claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">\n<em>The Examiner\u2019s Views</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">The reply to this first response was a final rejection stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-16\">\u201cThe claimed compounds are obvious under 35 USC 103 in view of the reference. * * *. The affidavit is interesting but irrelevant to the rejection since it is not directed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>subject <em>matter </em>\u2018sought <em>to be </em>patented\u2019, namely, the use <em>in </em>the arts of the compounds. The obvious compound is not made less obvious by its properties in an art use. * <em>*. *. </em>It appears that if an invention is present, it resides in the use of the claimed compounds as anti-inflammatory agents and should be claimed as such. Therefore, it is held that the subject matter of the claim is obvious in view of the reference and unpatentable thereover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The applicant appealed to the board, which took no notice of the criticism that the invention should have been claimed as a \u201cuse.\u201d Before leaving this rejection, however, we make the observation that the ground of rejection seems to us somewhat confused, that it is unclear whether the affidavit was deemed truly <em>irrelevant </em>to the patentability of the claimed <em>compounds, </em>which alone were the \u201csubject matter sought to be patented,\u201d and unclear to what extent, if any, obviousness of the compounds was predicated on <em>the </em>contention that the applicant should claim his invention as a process, .which is the only way a \u201cuse\u201d can be claimed. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 100(b) and 101. The last sentence of the above quotation seems to involve a non sequitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The examiner who made the above rejection next filed a very long and very argumentative Examiner\u2019s Answer, which reverts to the theme that appellant\u2019s \u201ccontribution\u201d was not in the novel compounds claimed per se, \u201cbut rather in the newly discovered properties which are advantageous for a particular utility.\u201d Said the examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">\u201cSuch contribution may properly be protected by claims to the mode of employing the compounds for their unexpected novel use, but does not support claims covering compounds which are structurally obvious and which also exhibit a family of properties and characteristics common to, and not differing significantly from, those of the homologue known and available to the prior art. An unexpected difference in a single property should not be adequate to support a claim for a novel, but obvious, homologue, which claim will dominate all properties and uses of the homologue, including those differing only in the expected manner from the known product.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>This passage being only an expression of what might be termed the background sentiments of the examiner, the actual rejection was legally predicated by him on section 103 and its essence is contained in the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\"><em>\u201cIn view of </em>the known general relationship of homology, the disclosure of an organic chemical structure immediately suggests and renders obvious to the organic chemist of ordinary skill its homologues, as organic compounds. The homologous compound being obvious it is not seen how it can become less obvious, as a <em>compound, </em>merely by discovering that in addition to the community of common physical and chemical properties expected of members of an homologues [sic], series it also has other improved or valuable properties. Such discovery is not proper support for a patent for the compound per se. (In re Gauerke [24 CCPA 725, 86 F.2d 330] 31 USPQ 330 and the decisions supra).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We will dispose now of the Gauerke case, which has no bearing on the issue here. It held only that it was not a patentable invention to use in an old resin composition containing drying oil, sunflower seed oil, which was <em>known, </em>and known also to be a drying oil, in place of other drying oil formerly used. The court said that incorporating sunflower seed oil in the resin was \u201ca use which any one skilled in the art, following the teachings of the prior art, might make of it.\u201d We are here concerned with the patentability of <em>a new chemical compound </em>having an inherent <em>unknown, </em>un-obvious, pharmacologically advantageous property. Furthermore, nobody would be led by the prior art to use it for any purpose, so far as the record shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">\n<em>The Board Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"avi-dedup-0\">The Patent Office, for reasons undisclosed, convened a 5-man Board of Appeals to hear this case. It adopted a relatively long opinion (9 printed pages). We have tried as best we can to extract from it the essence of the board\u2019s reasons for denying patentability, taking into consideration the supporting brief filed by the Patent Office Solicitor. We believe the reasoning to be along these lines:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">1. The section 103 requirement of un-obviousness is no different in chemical cases than with respect to other categories of patentable inventions. (We would accept that, in principle.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">2. From the viewpoint of the organic chemist the structures of the claimed compounds would be \u201cobvious\u201d from the Robins et al. reference disclosure of the related trimethyl compound as well as from the disclosure of methylation by conventional methods, which would suggest to a chemist \u201cthe use of ethylating or other alkylating agent of short chain length\u201d as a possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">3. Appellant relies on a <em>pharmacological </em>property as the significant characteristic.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">4. The statutory unobviousness required of a claimed chemical compound to make it patentable must be \u201cconsidered from a chemical viewpoint,\u201d i. e., from the viewpoint of chemists rather than pharmacologists, inasmuch as it is the chemists \u201cwho are involved with the synthesis of new compounds, and in their identification by physical characteristics and by reactions with other agents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">5. In conclusion the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">\u201cWe have considered the facts in this case from the viewpoint of the chemist and find that the compounds would, without a shadow of doubt, be obvious to the chemist from the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>closure in the Robins et al. publication. In these circumstances, the showing made in the affidavit cannot be considered persuasive of pat-entability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-3\">As in the case of the examiner\u2019s rejection, it is not clear from the above quotation whether or not the affidavit showing was ignored on the ground that the compounds would be obvious to a chemist, or because it did not relate to \u201cchemical\u201d properties. The solicitor argues that the above quoted paragraph shows that the board \u201cweighed the effect of the affidavit\u201d but he also says that the board considered that the homologous relationship and the \u201cchemical facts\u201d made the claimed compounds \u201cso obvious * * * that the showing of the affidavit was <em>ineffective by itself </em>to demonstrate the unobviousness of the claimed compounds.\u201d (Our emphasis.) Probably the best indication of how the board itself looked upon the affidavit is this paragraph from its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201cSuch proof of advantages is not seen to occupy a different relationship than proof of commercial success or of the \u2018filling of a long-felt want\u2019 often considered as sufficient to establish patentability in cases <em>where some doubt of unobviousness exists, </em>but which have been consistently held as <em>insufficient alone </em>to override the holding of unpatenta-bility <em>in a clear case </em>of obviousness.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In view of that statement, and since the board found the compounds to be obvious \u201cwithout a shadow of doubt,\u201d we are bound to conclude that the board\u2019s process of reasoning was first to look at the compounds as chemists to see if they were obvious and, having no doubt that they were, it found no reason to consider the \u201cpharmacological\u201d facts shown by the affidavit, the existence of which facts has never been questioned. This conforms with the solicitor\u2019s oral argument which asked us to ignore the pharmacological properties on the ground that the claimed compounds were \u201cso obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The problem of \u201cobviousness\u201d under section 103 in determining the patenta-bility of new and useful chemical compounds, or, as it is sometimes called, the problem of \u201cchemical obviousness,\u201d is not really a problem in chemistry or pharmacology or in any other related field of science such as, biology, biochemistry, pharmacodynamics, ecology, or others yet to be conceived. It is a problem of <em>patent law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">As everyone knows, section 103 is the statutory version of what was, prior to January 1, 1953, the effective date of the latest revision of the patent statutes, the judge-made requirement of \u201cinvention.\u201d We are not unaware that we are, in this case, in the field of what has come to be called the \u201cHass-Henze Doctrine,\u201d though the briefs do not mention it by name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Hass and Henze cases, which <em>are </em>mentioned, antedate section 103 and suggest, by way of dicta, that proof of the existence of unobvious or unexpected beneficial properties in a new compound, which would otherwise appear to be obvious (along with its properties), is indicative of the presence of \u201cinvention\u201d and hence of patentability. What this comes down to, in final analysis, is a rather simple proposition: If that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>which appears, at first blush, to be obvious though new is shown by evidence <em>not </em>to be obvious, then the evidence prevails over surmise or unsupported contention and a rejection based on obviousness must fall. Many cases, both before and after the enactment of section 103, have been decided according to such reasoning and we shall now discuss a few of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Schering Corp. v. Gilbert, 153 F.2d 428 (C.C.A.2d) was decided in 1946. The claim sustained was to a specific chemical compound. It was proved to possess unobvious and highly useful properties as an X-ray contrast agent in cholecystography. The court characterized the claimed invention, \u201ca short claim for one definite chemical compound not found in nature and never previously synthesized,\u201d as a \u201cseemingly slight departure from the old.\u201d Its approach to the question of patentability was stated thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201c * * * it is necessary to understand what the inventors did as well as what they sought to accomplish and <em>give recognition to their end result </em>as a novel and useful improvement, <em>not in the art of organic chemistry but in that of cholecys-tography.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In Parker v. Marzall, D.C., 92 F.Supp. 736, a suit under R.S. 4915 decided in 1950, the District Court for the District of Columbia entered, among others, the following findings of fact and conclusion of law after having filed an \u201cInformal Memorandum.\u201d The findings of fact read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201c7.

In view of the evidence of unobvious, unexpected and beneficial properties of the compounds of plaintiffs\u2019 claims 1, 2 and 3 not possessed by the homologous compound disclosed in the prior art, such claimed compounds constitute patentable invention.

Biological function was taken into account in deciding in favor of patentability as shown by the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">\u201cWe are convinced after a review of the record herein that, as appellants contend, there is a considerable degree of unpredictability in the insecticide field with homologs, isomers and anologs of known effective insecticides having proven ineffective as insecticides. In view of this, and the other factors previously discussed, we conclude that all the compounds of the subgroup in Markush claim 48 are inventive and patentable over the prior art of record, albeit they include isomers and ho-mologs of the compounds shown in LaForge et ah Considering the history of the act at the time of the invention, the occasion for the invention, and its success, we think such a conclusion unavoidable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Though the Patent Act of 1952 had just become effective and the court recognized its existence in referring to section 112, no mention was made of section 103 or the necessity of finding \u201cunobviousness.\u201d The court was still speaking'in terms of the requirement of \u201cinvention,\u201d its pre-revision equivalent in most respects. The court had previously stated, referring to In re Hass and another case, \u201cWe also implicitly indicated in the decisions here cited that homologs and isomers may be patentable if they are inventive over known prior art compounds,\u201d citing Parker v. Marzall, supra, with evident approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In Ruskin v. Watson, D.C., 123 F.Supp. 33, the District Court for the District of Columbia decided in. favor of patent-ability of a compound differing structurally from a compound already patented to the plaintiff only in the substitution of two ethyl groups in place of two hydrogen atoms. The compound was a - therapeutic preparation used to control muscular spasm. The court quoted with approval the following dictum from the opinion of this court in the Henze case (footnote 3, supra):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cTo those skilled in the chemical art, one homologue is not such an \u2018advance\u2019 over an adjacent member of the series as requires invention, unless the beneficial properties realized in the new homologue lie clearly outside of the expectations which knowledge of his science would inform the trained chemist should be inherent in the product.\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0A\">Finding that the claimed product had been shown by evidence to possess un-obvious and unexpected beneficial properties not possessed by the previous patented compound, the court disapproved of the rejection and held the two compounds patentably distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The same court in Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Watson, D.C., 135 F.Supp. 173, gave judgment, in part, for plaintiff against the Commissioner of Patents in a suit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 to obtain a patent on claims to levo-arterenol and dextro-arterenol. The prior art showed the racemic dl-arterenol and also the known next adjacent homologs of the claimed substances. The court found that \u201cThe evidence at the hearing abundantly supports the contention of the plaintiff that i-arterenol in the form here claimed has phenominal therapeutic properties with respect to the treatment of irreversible shock and coronary occlusion. * * * These qualities are utterly unattainable either by the di-compound, from which the pure i-arterenol is derived, or the admixture of i-arterenol with its homo-logues.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201cAnd there can hardly be any serious question that these beneficial characteristics were both unexpected and unobvious, which is the test to be applied in the matter of the patent-ability of a compound that is a homologue of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">* . * * * \u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201cI have no hesitance in reaching the firm conclusion that the i-artere-nol * * * and the acid salt of i-arterenol * * * and the i-ar-terenol acid d-tartrate * * * are patentable. There is a difficulty with respect to claim 10, and that is that it also includes the claim to d-arterenol, and there has been no showing of any beneficial unexpected and unobvious properties of d-artere- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>. nol, and I, therefore, cannot con-elude that d-arterenol is patentable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">It is interesting to observe here the applied' principle working both ways. Where what we may call the apparent obviousness of the compound (including its properties) was overcome by evidence of unexpected advantageous properties the claim to it was held patentable; but where no such properties were shown to exist it remained an obvious compound' with obvious properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In re Bergel et al., 292 F.2d 955, 48 CCPA 1102, involved, inter alia, claims to chemotherapeutic agents rejected as unpatentable over the prior art. As to the position of the Patent Office on the closeness of the claimed compounds to the prior art, the opinion of the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7c\">\u201cThe examiner states that the compound of claims 1 and 2 is \u2018a chlorine analog\u2019 of the Harper et al. compound, by which he apparently means that a part' of the hydrogen of the Harper et al. compound is replaced by chlorine to form the claimed compounds. The examiner further 'noted that Everett et al. disclose compounds generally similar to those claimed by appellants and prepared by chlorination, and propose the use of such compounds in anti-tumor therapy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">In reversing the rejection the opinion says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">\u201cIt is true that Harper et al. disclose compounds which, by the substitution of chlorine, a halogen, for part of the hydrogen, may be converted to the compounds recited in appealed claims 1 and 2, but, in our opinion, <em>such conversion would not be obvious in \u25a0 the absence of any suggestion in the prior art as to why it should be made.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">And further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">\u201cThe mere fact that it is <em>possible </em>to find two isolated disclosures which might be combined in such a way to produce a new compound does not necessarily render such production obvious unless the art also contains something to suggest the desirability of the proposed combination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">In re Larsen, 292 F.2d 531, 49 CCPA 711 (cert. denied, Larsen v. Ladd, 370 U.S. 936, 82 S.Ct. 1580, 8 L.Ed.2d 806), was an appeal taken only on process claims, claims to the product made by the process having been allowed. The appellant\u2019s arguments drew into consideration-by the court, however, the patentability of the products, as to which Chief Judge Worley made the following observations which are relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">\u25a0\u201c * * * the allowance of the claims to the compounds was based on the fact that they possessed unique, and presumably unexpected, properties. <em>Since there was nothing to indicate that the compounds, when made, would have these properties, it was not obvious to make the compounds. </em>In such a case the allowance of claims to the compounds must depend on the proposition that <em>it was unobvious to conceive the idea of producing them, </em>within the meaning of Title 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.\u201d [Emphasis added.] <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">The writer, in a concurring opinion, made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-16\">\u201cThere is a certain amount of logic in holding a product to be un-obvious because of the discovery in it of unobvious properties, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>its ability to act as a nontoxic X-ray contrast agent, <em>because the properties inhere in the product.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In re Lambooy, 300 F.2d 950, 49 CCPA 985, reversed the rejection of a single claim to an isoalloxazine compound. The decision was not handed down until after the briefs herein were filed. The only difference between the claimed compound and the prior art compound, riboflavin, was very much like the difference here \u2014 where riboflavin had two methyl groups, the claimed compound had two ethyl groups. It differed from riboflavin in a \u201cpharmacological\u201d property; where riboflavin acted in the animal body as a metabolite, the claimed compound, in spite of its \u201cstructural similarity,\u201d acted as an antimeta-bolite. Judge Martin, speaking for a unanimous court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>comparison of the structural formulas of these two compounds shows clearly that there is substantial <em>structural </em>similarity. But more appears from the facts of this case than structural similarity, facts which raise genuine questions as to the real significance of such bare <em>structural </em>similarity, whatever label may be attached to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201c* * * There is no evidence <em>in the record </em>which would lead one skilled in this art to expect that the differences in molecular structure between riboflavin and appellant\u2019s compound would cause this difference in properties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The next two quotations are so apt with respect to the arguments brought before us in the present case as to sound almost repetitious. We said in the Lam-booy case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201cThe solicitor urges that \u2018there is no specific evidence in the record of differences in <em>chemical </em>and <em>physical </em>properties of the prior art compound [riboflavin] and the claimed compound.\u2019 In view of the biochemical differences which we have just discussed, we can only assume the solicitor is urging that while differences in <em>chemical </em>properties might be persuasive of patentability of the claimed compound, differences in <em>biochemical </em>[original emphasis] properties are not to be considered. <em>We see no reason to distinguish between chemical and biochemical properties and no reason or authority for this position has been presented to us. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">* -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">\u201cAt the most, we think one skilled in this art would be taught by the reference patents that other groups than those present in the riboflavin structure can be attached to the parent isoalloxazine structure. We doubt that this fact is a noteworthy addition to the knowledge of an . organic chemist of ordinary skill <em>because he knows this is true of all such parent chemical structures. </em>Though <em>this </em>would be obvious to him, it does not follow that all new <em>compounds </em>so produced would be <em>obvious in the sense of the patent law.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">In re Petering and Fall, 301 F.2d 676, 49 CCPA 993, also dealt with compounds stated to have antimetabolite activity as riboflavin antagonists. The rejection of claims 5, 11, and 12 on art was reversed. Judge Martin, again speaking for a unanimous court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">\u201cAlthough it is also true that some of the specific compounds of Karrer [the reference] * * * are <em>structurally rather similar </em>to the compounds defined in claims 5, 11 and 12, * * * there is a <em>significant difference in properties </em>between appellants\u2019 compounds and Karrer\u2019s compounds. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-16\">* * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-17\">\u201cWe do not agree with the board that the unexpected properties of the compounds defined in claims 5, 11 and 12 should not be considered in determining the patentability of these claims. The compounds are not <em>described </em>in Karrer within the-meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>determining </em>whether the claimed compounds are <em>obviotis </em>within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, we think their properties may and should be considered, and having considered the properties, we are convinced the compounds * * * are patentable over Karrer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In that case, the board had taken essentially the same position it took in the present case, saying, \u201cwe are not convinced that the ascertainment of the property referred to could make such obvious compounds unobvious as compounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">From the foregoing cases it will be seen that this and other courts, both before and after the enactment of section 103, have determined the unobviousness and patentability of new chemical compounds by taking into consideration their biological or pharmacological properties. Nine of the ten cases above considered, directly and indirectly, involved such properties. Patentability has not' been determined on the basis of the obviousness of structure alone. In fact, where patentability was found in the above cases it was found in spite of close similarity of chemical structure, often much closer similarity than we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Returning now to the decision of the board in this case, we think that it rests on one fundamental error of law, namely, the failure to take into consideration the biological or pharmaceutical property of the compounds as anti-inflammatory agents on the ground that to chemists the structure of the compounds would be <em>so </em>obvious as to be beyond doubt, and that a showing of such properties is to be used only to resolve doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> From the standpoint of patent law, a compound and all of its properties are inseparable; they are one and the same thing. The graphic formulae, the chemical nomenclature, the systems of classification and study such as the concepts of homology, isomerism, etc., are mere symbols by which compounds can be identified, .classified, and compared. But a formula is not a compound and while it may serve in a claim to <em>identify </em>what is being patented, as the metes and bounds of a deed identify a plot of land, the <em>thing </em>that is patented is not the formula but the compound identified by it. And the patentability of the thing does not depend on the similarity of its formula to that of another compound but of the similarity of the former compound to the latter. There is no basis in law for ignoring any property in making such a comparison. An assumed similarity based on a comparison of formulae must give way to evidence that the assumption is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The argument has been made that patentability is here being asserted only on the basis of <em>one </em>property, the anti-inflammatory activity, and that the compounds claimed and the compound of the prior art presumably have many properties in common. <em>Presumably </em>they do, but presumption is all we have here. The same is true of all of the compounds of the above eases which were held patentable over compounds of the prior art, many of which must have had more in common by way .of properties than the compounds here because the relationships, structurally, were even closer than here.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">As to the examiner\u2019s view that in a case such as this the applicant should claim his invention as a process utilizing the newly discovered property, the board appears to have ignored it, properly we think. It is contrary to practically all of the above decisions wherein no fault was found with granting product claims. Such claims have well-recognized advantages to those in the business of making and selling compounds, in contrast to process-of-use claims, because competitors in the sale of compounds are not generally users.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">The solicitor relies heavily on In re Finley and similar cases which we will now consider, arguing that there may be other factors to consider than a difference of a single advantageous property, which is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In re Finley, 174 F.2a 130, 36 CCPA 998 (1949), was an appeal on a single claim reading: \u201cAs a composition of matter, 2 ethyl hexyl salicylate.\u201d It was held unpatentable over several references which admittedly disclosed homo-logs and at least one isomer whose salts were all used as lubricant \u201cadditants,\u201d the same use disclosed for salts of the claimed compound. An affidavit was submitted in the case showing that the calcium salt of the claimed compound had two to three times the thermal stability as lubricant \u201cadditant\u201d as the calcium salt of the prior art isomer n-octyl salicylate. The board held the tests made on the calcium salts too remote, affirming the examiner who had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cBut to assert that the property of the salt or of the oil is the property of the ester is clearly a confusion of the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The passage in the Finley opinion relied on by the Patent Office is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201cObviously appellant construes our holding in those [Hass et ah] cases to mean that if a new and useful product does show unobvious or unexpected beneficial properties it follows that such a product is patentable. We did not affirmatively, or even by implication, so state in our decisions there. Our statement meant merely that unless a product does show the defined characteristics it is not patentable. Even if they be shown, the consideration of other factors may be required. As we said in our decision in the second Hass et al. case, supra, \u2018Whether novel chemical compounds are patentable over prior art isomers and homo-logues, is a question to be determined in each case.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The principle of the above passage was also reiterated the next year in In re Henze, 181 F.2d 196, 37 CCPA 1009, in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201cPatentability is not resolved conclusively even where unexpected or unobvious beneficial properties are established to exist in novel members of a homologous series over prior art members, as the circumstances of the case <em>may </em>require a consideration of other factors, [citing Finley] <em>A mere difference in degree </em>is not the marked superiority which ordinarily will remove the unpatent-ability of adjacent homologues of old substances. In re Loring Coes, Jr., supra [36 CCPA 1067, 173 F.2d 1012, 81 USPQ 369].\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">In the Loring Coes case the invention was an abrasive grinding wheel. It was specifically found that \u201cthe improvement, if any, is one of degree viewed only from a single aspect.\u201d The new grinding wheel was shown to wear longer, but the old wheel was shown to be more efficient in the amount of metal removed per unit of time. The invention related to the synthetic resin binder in the wheel which differed only slightly in composition from prior resin binders, the difference residing only in the hardening agent used. The hardener selected differed from a known prior art <em>hardening agent </em>only by the omission of one -CH2 group out of six, found in triglycol dichloride, and was held to be an unpatentable selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The other factor of importance which was present in the Finley, Henze, and Coes cases and others of their type is that the prior art disclosure was not merely of a structurally similar compound but also, at least to a degree, of <em>the same desired property </em>relied on for patentability in the new compound. Such an \u201cother factor\u201d must of course be considered because it bears on the obviousness of the compound, which is, realistically and legally, a composite of both structure and properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">As should be apparent from the foregoing, we regard the board\u2019s opinion and decision as contrary to well established law. We see no reason to change that law. The decision is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, concurs in result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">. In this connection, see \u201cThe Forgotten Chemistry of the Hass-Henze Doctrine,\u201d by Bruce M. Collins, Journal of the Patent Office Society, April, 1962, Vol. XLIV, No. 4, page 284. Note also that in the first office action the examiner did not say that appellant\u2019s <em>compounds </em>are hornologs of the Robins et al. compound XVI. He said, \u201cThe ethyl and n-butyl <em>side chains * * </em>* in applicant\u2019s claims * * * are obvious homologs <em>of the methyl groups </em>* * * in the reference * * [Emphasis ours.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">. It is noted that certain supposed facts are here being assumed. It is true that the applicant submitted pro^f as to only one unexpected, unobvious, beneficial property. The examiner\u2019s statements about the existence of a family of other properties common to the claimed comjDOunds and the compound of the prior art finds support in the record, however, only on the basis of assumptions in turn based on assumed \u201chomology.\u201d In his answer, the examiner cited a new reference, Wertheim \u201cTextbook of Organic Chemistry\u201d (2d Ed.), page 37 (1945). From it he quoted the following statement about members of \u201cany one homologous series:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201cThese compounds have similar chemical traits, because their structures are closely related; therefore we can learn the chemistry of the entire group with no more effort than would otherwise be required to study a single compound.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Tie had previously cited in his final rejection another new reference, Fieser and Fieser, \u201cOrganic Chemistry,\u201d 3d Ed. pages 30-31 (1956), which pages deal, so far as pertinent, only with the progressive relationships in the CnH2n+2 homologous series, with bare mention of similar relationships existing in the halogens: chlorine, bromine, and iodine.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Wertheim, at the point from which the above quotation was taken, was discussing the same \u201cmethane series of hydrocarbons\u201d as Fieser and Fieser. The examiner stopped his quotation just before the sentence reading, \u201cOf course we may anticipate certain \u2018exceptions\u2019 to this general rule, but such exceptions will make very little trouble.\u201d We are not here dealing with the methane series or with the type of \u201chomology\u201d which it illustrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">We have had sufficient contact with \u201chomology\u201d on this court to agree with the examiner that such similarity in structure as exists here <em>probably </em>indicates similarity in <em>some </em>undisclosed properties; but we are past giving too much legal significance to the bare term \u201chomolog,\u201d even where there is an admission of homology, as there appears to be here. The term is often used loosely. So far as we know, the <em>assumed </em>similarities referred to by the examiner are of little</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>or no practical or commercial significance. Certainly lie has pointed to none. On the other hand, the <em>proven, dissimilarity </em>is a matter of pharmacological significance, on which the examiner would be quite willing to grant a patent if the invention were claimed as a process. As to the <em>other </em>properties, nothing in the record gives us any information, not even the Robins et al. reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-6\">. This \u201cdoctrine\u201d was evolved by the bar from this court\u2019s opinions in the three eases called In re Hass et al., 141 F.2d 122, 127, 130, 31 CCPA 895, 903, 908, and in In re Henze, 181 F.2d 196, 37 CCPA 1009.
