We conclude that the evidence touching on the 8(a) (1) violation of threatening and interrogation is amply supported on the record. Furthermore, the fact that several representatives of the management-clearly indicated by direct statements that certain of the dis-; charges had been for the purpose of get- |v ting rid of the men identified with the 1 union, in light of the knowledge that the j respondent had of the union activities of each of those discharged, is sufficient for the Board to draw the inference that the union activity was the motivating cause for the discharge of these five employees. See National Labor Relations Board v. Ferguson, 5th Cir., 257 F.2d 88, where we said: \u201cThe effect of this evidence was an admission, in the sense of a position contrary to that taken in the pending proceeding, Cox v. Esso Shipping Co., 5 Cir., 247 F.2d 629, that each and all had been fired for union membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">Under the circumstances of this case, we do not believe that the order is too broad. See National Labor Relations Board v. Galloway Manufacturing Corp., 5th Cir., 312 F.2d 322.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
