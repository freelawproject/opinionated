FOLEY, Jr., District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b685-21\">Beginning in 1957, the appellant, appearing without counsel, brought three successive separate actions against Frank Sinatra and others, in the Court from which this appeal is taken, alleging infringement of copyrights. The three cases, brought against substantially the same defendants, each came on before a different District Judge, and in each instance motions to dismiss were granted. There has not been a trial on the merits. From the record before us, the alleged acts of infringement appear to be substantially the same in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-22\">The complaint filed in the initial action, Civil No. 1161-57 PH, was dismissed with prejudice and without leave to amend for, among other grounds, failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. That judgment of dismissal was entered November 21, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">The second action, Civil No. 43-59 TC, was filed in January of 1959, and was terminated by an order of dismissal without leave to amend, but without prejudice on June 29, 1959. Two of the grounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>dismissal were the failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that the complaint was unintelligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The case before us was commenced on December 2, 1980. There followed a number of defense motions and on January 9, 1961, the appellant was ordered to file a supplemental pleading alleging in detail the infringements charged as to each defendant. Appellant filed a supplemental complaint consisting of some 67 pages. Defense motions, previously filed, were heard and the complaint and supplemental complaint were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">At this juncture, some four years from the commencement of the first case, for the first time, appellant appeared through counsel. So represented, appellant filed an amended complaint on March 7, 1961. Defense motions were considered at a hearing held April 18, 1961.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The transcript of April 18, 1961, reflects that over strong objections from appellees, who complained of being harassed by seemingly endless and expensive litigation, the Court below, after a painstaking examination of the record of this case and apparently of the two former cases, offered appellant another opportunity to attempt to state a claim that could be understood and tried. Appellant made the selection of both the picture and the defendants. Appellant suggested, and the Court ordered, that he file a second amended complaint, limiting the subject matter to the one motion picture \u201cHIGH SOCIETY,\u201d and limiting the defendants to the persons associated with that picture, to wit: Frank Sinatra, Henry Sanicola, William Morris Agency, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., and Capitol Records, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-26\">On May 26, 1961, appellant filed \u201cAMENDED COMPLAINT II FOR INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND' UNFAIR COMPETITION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-27\">The defendants named in the Amended Complaint II, filed May 26, 1961, included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-28\">\u201cFrank Sinatra, Henry Sanicola, William Morris Agency, Inc., Dore Schary, Sol Siegel, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., Samuel Goldwyn, Rudolph Monta, Joseph Pasternak, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Harry Lillis Crosby, George Murphy, Cole Porter, John Patrick, Sammy Cahn, Nicholas Brodzsky, Helen Rose, George Wells, June Allison, Lauren Bacall, Gregory Peck, Brod-erick Crawford, George Seaton, Gordon Jenkins, Capitol Records, Inc., Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., National Broadcasting \u25a0 Company, Inc., Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., American Broadcasting Company-Paramount Theatres, Inc., Lig-gett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company, Inc., Bulova Watch Company, General Motors Corporation, Decca Records, Inc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Paragraph VIII of Amended Complaint II begins as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201cAfter July 12, 1955, defendants conspired and confederated, combined, concerted and agreed to infringe, and they have infringed said copyrights by copying and appropriating from manuscript and printed copies thereof and private letters of plaintiff referring thereto, submitted and communicated to defendants and retained in the possession of the defendants, and by marketing, exhibiting and selling to the general public against the will and secretly and without the consent, authority or license of the plaintiff, copyright proprietor, and by using the language, dialogue, wordings, writing, sequence, story, songs, lyrics, scenes, settings, costumes, characters, sense substance, point, purpose, expression and effect of the plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted writings and private letters the motion pictures: \u201cHigh Society,\u201d \u201cThe Opposite Sex,\u201d \u201cDesigning Woman,\u201d \u201cWings of Victory,\u201d \u201cThe Joker is Wild,\u201d or \u201c The Joker,\u201d \u201cRoyal Wedding,\u201d \u201cGigi,\u201d \u201cSay One for Methe musical \u201cManhattan Tower;\u201d the programs: \u201cEntertainment Programs, National Conventions of 1956,\u201d the \u201cDemocratic Fund Raising Program, October 20, 1956,\u201d the \u201cFrank Sinatra Show 1957-58\u201d and the same May, 1960, and November, 1960, the \u201cBing Crosby Show,\u201d October, 1958 and September, 1959; the record album \u201cLover\u2019s Hour;\u201d the songs: \u201c11th Hour Melody\u201d and \u201cMr. Success;\u201d the play: \u201cThe Defender ;\u201d press releases; the \u201cAcademy Awards Ceremonies,\u201d 1957, 1958, 1959; broadcast: \u201cEd Sullivan Show,\u201d February, 1959, and re-performance of the motion pictures: \u201cHigh Society,\u201d March 22-28, 1961, \u201cDesigning Woman,\u201d April 5-11, 1961, and re-broadcasts from the motion picture \u201cHigh Society,\u201d March 5, 1961 and May 2, 1961, by and in the following manner and means:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"pAcqc\">On June 27, 1961, after defense motions had been filed, a hearing was held.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>On July 12, 1961, the Court below entered its order \u201cOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss and Judgment of Dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-A\">This Order and Judgment of Dismissal, the basis of this appeal, sets forth ten separate grounds in support of the Court\u2019s decision. Affirmance of any one or more of these grounds will be disposi-tive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Perhaps the most clearly apparent ground for dismissal relied upon by the District Court and that upon which we base our holding is appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the order of April 18, 1961, limiting the subject matter to one motion picture and the persons associated with that picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The question before this Court is whether, based upon the foregoing facts taken from the record before us as designated by the parties hereto, the District Court, as a matter of law, abused his discretion in dismissing Amended Complaint II.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Both the state and federal courts have almost universally held or recognized that there is inherent power in the courts, in the interest of the orderly administration of justice, to dismiss for disobedience of court orders. Refior v. Lansing Drop Forge Co., 6th Cir., 124 F.2d 440, certiorari denied, 316 U.S. 671, 62 S.Ct. 1047, 86 L.Ed. 1746.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">This is not a situation, however, where specific authorization is lacking. Rule 41(b), F.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-18\">\u201cFor failure of the plaintiff * * to comply with * * * any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him. * * * Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">We acknowledge the long standing practice of dismissing without prejudice when dismissing a complaint prior to reaching the merits. Swan Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. Frank, 1893, 148 U.S. 603, 13 S.Ct. 691, 37 L.Ed. 577. Also we are aware that dismissal of a party\u2019s cause of action is a severe and drastic measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-21\">In the instant case, however, there are numerous factors which, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>considered together, justify as a matter of law, deviation from the general rule and further act in mitigation of the apparent harshness of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The plaintiff here is not the victim of any error or inadvertence of his attorney. On the contrary, appellant chose to represent himself during the prior cases and during a substantial portion of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Secondly, in view of the history of this litigation, the numerous amendments allowed, the opportunities given appellant to plead, and the exceedingly generous consideration and patience afforded by the District Court, it would be an understatement to say that appellant has not had his day in court. Olsen v. Muskegon Piston Ring Company, 6 Cir., 1941, 117 F.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Also to be considered are the rights of the defendants. Certainly they have been prejudiced and put to considerable expense. It becomes the obligation of the Court to determine at what point plaintiff would be foreclosed from further harassing defendants with confused and confounding complaints. We do not attempt to identify the exact point in the proceedings below where the Court would have become justified as a matter of law, in exercising his discretion to dismiss. Such is not the question before us. Suffice it to say that the point had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Finally, there is not the slightest suggestion in the record that appellant\u2019s failure to amend in accordance with the order was the result of misunderstanding or inadvertence. It is clear, upon examination, that Amended Complaint II was the result of a conscious and deliberate decision not to abandon the form and content of the prior complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">We recognize, as did the District Court, that appellant conceivably had a cause of action. We also agree that the District Court, as well as the defendants, was entitled to have the claim or claims stated in a justiciable manner. Appellant chose not to meet the requirement which was not only reasonable but was absolutely essential to the eventual termination of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The situation is not unlike Package Machinery Company v. Hayssen Manufacturing Company, 7 Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 56, where it was stated, at page 57:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">\u201cWe are convinced that plaintiff\u2019s unyielding determination not to define the trade secrets which it claimed were pirated by defendants was solidly arrayed against the almost inexhaustible patience of the district judge, who insisted that plaintiff comply with the court\u2019s orders. For a considerable period of time, plaintiff\u2019s determination prevailed. But, fortunately, the court overcame the inertia in the situation created by plaintiff; it was able to protect itself by invoking rule 41(b) which authorized it to enter the order of dismissal with prejudice, of which plaintiff now complains. We hold that this order was properly entered and it is hereby affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">Reference is also made to Blake v. DeVilbiss Co., 6 Cir., 1941, 118 F.2d 346, and to Rossi v. McCloskey and Company, 1957, 149 F.Supp. 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">In conclusion, we hold that the trial judge acted well within the scope of his discretionary powers granted under rule 41(b) and inherent in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">We do not deem it necessary to pass upon the sufficiency of the nine remaining grounds upon which the trial court relied in its judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\">. Transcript, April 18, 1961.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Before you proceed on this case, I notice that the plaintiff in a memorandum filed today says that it is necessary for the court to take this case in hand. I think that is the truest thing that the plaintiff has ever said. It is necessary for the court to take this case in hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cDuring the past week I went over the amended complaint again and I have come to the conclusion that the amended complaint does not state a claim. It consequently has to be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cTwo other courts have dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint upon the ground it didn\u2019t state a claim. It is just possible that the plaintiff may have a cause of action. I don\u2019t know whether he does or not, but the plaintiff in this action, as in other litigation, has been hunting with a shotgun and just aiming a gun in the general direction and letting it go. I think it is time for him to get rid of his gun and get down to actual facts in the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\u201cI have been thinking about how the case could be handled. I don\u2019t want to deprive the plaintiff of his day in court. If he has got a cause of action against any of these defendants, I want him to be able to present it. I want to rule on it but I can\u2019t rule on it under the complaint that is before me at the present time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-12\">\u201cThe plaintiff in this case has taken a number of different transactions and included them in the complaint. The plaintiff says he has a copyright that the defendants have infringed, but there is absolutely no relationship between the defendants and the infringement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\">(Tr. pp. 4-5)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-14\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am going to drop all these parties except one, with the understanding that if you want to, you can file a separate suit for each one of the parties so dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-17\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Andrews (plaintiff\u2019s counsel), you suggested the other day when you were here that if you had handled this case from the inception, you would have filed a separate action against each one of them rather than trying to join them all in one action.\u201d *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-21\">\u201cNow, I don\u2019t care who you keep in this ease, whether you keep Sinatra or keep Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer or whether you keep Loew\u2019s Incorporated. I don\u2019t care who you keep, but I am not going to litigate but one defendant at a time. If you reduce your complaint so that we have one defendant at a time, then maybe we can get something we can work on, but at the present time the complaint is so voluminous and includes so many matters that I can\u2019t make head nor tail of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-22\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: Tour Honor, under the ruling of the court, I would like to keep the High Society \u2014 what is the name? Frank Sinatra and the suit involving the copyright by the play High Society, because I think that is one of the most flagrant violations we have before this court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: Tou don\u2019t have to do that today, Mr. Andrews. You can think about this matter. You may decide you want to keep someone else. I don\u2019t mind that. If you want to use the picture High Society, I don\u2019t mind if you join in the case the man who produced High Society, the man who wrote High Society, the actor in High Society, just so you reduce your scope to one picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-24\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: Your Honor, as you well know, this case was filed in pro per.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-26\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-27\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: The statement I made the other day was this. If I had had the case first in my hands, as an attorney, I would concentrate at [on] one defendant at first. I feel that Frank Sinatra, Henry Sanicola, William Morris Agency, Dore Schary, et al., in the High</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aab-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Society cause of action, we would like to retain and proceed on that basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">* * &amp; :}: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: If your Honor will make an order as stated by the Court, we would like to continue and proceed against the canse of action involving Frank Sinatra, Henry Sanicola, William Morris Agency, MGM, and Capitol Records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: On this one picture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: Yes, High Society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: If you will prepare the order and drop all the other defendants without prejudice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-13\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: I will do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014so that at some future time, if you are successful in this case, you may proceed against these other people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-15\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-16\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: \u00bb * * With your honor\u2019s order, then I will prepare a new complaint against the parties mentioned in connection with High Society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: And drop the other defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-19\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: I want you to prepare a new complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-21\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: In other words, file it and get a separate number?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, you can file it in this case. You don\u2019t have to pay another filing fee. But I want an amended complaint filed in which you only include the people who are directly connected with this picture High Society, and I want to you to set out in your complaint just how they are connected, what did they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-23\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: Yes, sir, we will do so * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-24\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-29\">\u201cMR.

ANDREWS: Now, then, in other words, we will have to finish that ease one way or the other before we can file a new amended suit against the other defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-33\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, I am going to dismiss as to the other defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-34\">\u201cMR. ANDREWS: Without prejudice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-35\">\u201cTHE COURT: Without prejudice. Just as soon as you tell me what defendants you want to keep in this case, I will enter a dismissal as to the other case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-38\">(Tr. pp. 6-13)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-39\">\u201cTHE COURT: The complaint is in such condition at the present time I cannot adequately dispose of it except to say that it doesn\u2019t state a claim and does not comply with the rule relative to a short concise statement of the claim. Consequently, by eliminating a large number of the defendants and a large number of the things that you say have been infringed and reducing it to one picture, we may be able to get some place where we can intelligently decide whether or not there is a cause of action here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-40\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-41\">\u201cTHE COURT: I prefer to handle all these matters at one time and I will dismiss all the defendants who are not named in this amended complaint, and if any of the defendants who are named want to have a dismissal, if they will come in and make a motion to dismiss, 1 will hear them, but I think that is a more orderly way to do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-42\">(Tr. pp. 17-19)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">.
