These claims totaled $1,-577,841.53, upon which 6% interest was claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">After the filing of an answer on October 17, 1957, depositions were taken by the plaintiff and defendant, plaintiff\u2019s request for admissions under Rule 36, Rules of Civil Procedure, was answered, and a stipulation with respect to certain facts and documents was filed. The defendant filed an amended answer on September 6, 1960. The answer, as amended, admitted the execution of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and many of the allegations of the complaint but took issue with the plaintiff on its construction of the contract, denied liability on the claims asserted by the plaintiff, and pleaded several defenses claimed under the provisions of the contract and the defenses of estoppel and accord and satisfaction. In this connection the amended answer asserted that the plaintiff had no right to rely upon the laboratory reports of the defendant made of the samples of concrete aggregates submitted by the plaintiff or the acceptance of the aggregates by defendant\u2019s engineer, and that said materials, as shown by a later laboratory report, did not meet the specifications of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">On March 20, 1961, the defendant moved for summary judgment and filed three affidavits and its brief in support of the motion. On June 19, 1961, plaintiff filed its brief opposing the motion. The defendant filed a reply brief on August 1, 1961, and the plaintiff filed a supplemental memorandum in opposition to the motion on October 4, 1961. On November 24, 1961, plaintiff filed another supplemental memorandum in opposition to the motion, and the affidavits of Charles W. Billow, Jr., and Karl E. Mc-Leister in support thereof. On December 5, 1961, the defendant moved to strike these affidavits from the file for the reason that they were not timely served or filed in accordance with Rule 56(e) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On March 30, 1962, the Court sustained defendant\u2019s motion to strike the two affidavits and also handed down a memorandum ruling that defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be sustained. Judgment to that effect was entered on April 24, 1962, from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">This case has been thoroughly and extensively briefed and orally argued to the court on its merits by counsel for the respective parties. Irrespective of the merits of the case, appellant contends that by reason of the complexity of the issues involved, the scope and volume of the evidence, both documentary and otherwise, pertaining thereto, and the necessity for a full development of the facts for the purpose of clarifying the application of the law, this is not a case for disposition on motion for summary judgment. Ap-pellee contends that regardless of the complexity of the issues and the scope and volume of the evidence, most of which is documentary, it was ultimately shown through the use of pretrial discovery proceedings that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists, that the question for decision is purely one of law for the Court, and that disposition of the case on motion for summary judgment was proper under Rule 56(c), Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">This Court has on several occasions expressed the view that a trial judge should be slow in disposing of a case of any complexity on a motion for summary judgment, that while such a judgment wisely used is a praiseworthy and timesaving device, yet such prompt dispatch of judicial business is neither the sole nor the primary purpose for which courts have been established, and that a party should not be deprived of an adequate opportunity to fully develop his case by witnesses and a trial, when the issues involved make such procedure the appropriate one.

Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 192 F.2d 889, C.A.6th; Bellak v. United Home Life Ins. Co., 211 F.2d 280, 283, C.A.6th; Hoy v. Progress Pattern Co., 217 F.2d 701, 704, C.A.6th. See: Sartor v. Arkansas Gas Corp., 321 U.S. 620, 64 S.Ct. 724, 88 L.Ed. 967; White Motor Co. v. United States, 83 S.Ct. 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">It is often the case that although the basic facts are not in dispute, the parties in good faith may nevertheless disagree about the inferences to be drawn from these facts, what the intention of the parties was as shown by the facts, or whether an estoppel or a waiver of certain rights admitted to exist should be drawn from such facts. Under such cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>cumstances the case is not one to be decided by the Trial Judge on a motion for summary judgment.

Vancouver Plywood Corp., 266 F.2d 535, 539-540, C.A.9th; Girard v. Gill, 261 F.2d 695, 697, C.A.4th; Stevens v. Howard D. Johnson Co., 181 F.2d 390, 394, C.A.4th; United States v. Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Company, 287 F.2d 601, C.A.10th; Severson v. Fleck, 251 F.2d 920, 923, C.A.8th; Oil Trading Associates, Inc. v. Texas City Refining, Inc., 201 F.Supp. 846, S.D.N.Y. These principles are, in our opinion, applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">This case is not a simple one. It involves complex facts and issues. It was filed June 4, 1957. It has been strenuously contested. Motion for summary judgment was not made until March 20, 1961. The motion was not sustained until March 30, 1962. In the oral argument before this Court on the merits the maximum time allowance was used by both parties. It is stated in appellant\u2019s reply brief that appellant\u2019s appendix of 121 printed pages and appellee\u2019s appendix of 49 printed pages set forth affidavits and excerpts from more than 1800 pages of contract documents, plans, specifications, correspondence, reports, depositions, admissions and the like. More than the construction of the written contract is involved. The issues of defendant\u2019s breach of an implied warranty, es-toppel, and accord and satisfaction must be considered in the light of the actions of the parties. It seems that a direct factual issue is presented by the defendant\u2019s contention that the concrete aggregates stockpiled by the plaintiff and rejected by the defendant did not meet the specifications of the contract. There are no findings of fact by the District Judge, since none are required or considered necessary by Rule 52(a), Rules of Civil Procedure, in summary judgment proceedings. Yet we find ourselves unable to satisfactorily review this judgment on the record before us without such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We are of the opinion that this case is one where a full inquiry into the facts under usual trial procedure is advisable to develop the facts for the purpose of clarifying the application of the law, and that it is not a case suitable for disposition through summary judgment procedure. Knapp v. Kinsey, supra, 249 F.2d 797, 802-803, C.A.6th; Bohn Aluminum &amp; Brass Corp. v. Storm King Corp., supra, 303 F.2d 425, 427, C.A.6th; Stevens v. Howard D. Johnson Co., supra, 181 F.2d 390, 394, C.A.4th.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The judgment of the District Court is set aside and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
