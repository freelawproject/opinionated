The ground for the dismissal was that the proceedings were brought within six years of a prior discharge in bankruptcy. Since the entry of the order we have held that Section 14, Sub. c(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, 66 Stat. 422 (1952), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32, sub. c(5), should not be construed to bar a wage earner plan under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act in which the debtor seeks to pay his debts, not to discharge them. In re Holmes, 10 Cir., 309 F.2d 748. For the reasons stated in that opinion, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
