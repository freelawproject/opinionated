For his personal injuries and damage to his automobile, he recovered a judgment of $11,297.20, entered upon a jury verdict. On this appeal, the appellant railroad asks reversal upon the single ground that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Its motion for directed verdict on that ground was denied. Jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship and Kentucky law controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-30\">The crossing in question is made by the railroad\u2019s double main line tracks, running north and south, and a country road which runs east and west. The main line tracks come up to the crossing through what was described as a \u201ccut\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>with a bank of varying height along the east side of the right of way. The road, as it approaches the crossing from the east \u201cdrops off\u201d from a hard surfaced portion thereof and goes \u201cdown\u201d to the crossing. The train which collided with plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was coming north through the cut at a speed which the jury could find to have been 60 miles an hour. Plaintiff was proceeding westerly into the crossing at 5 miles an hour. The right front corner of the defendant\u2019s engine struck the left front fender of plaintiff\u2019s automobile. A spur track, paralleling the main line track, crosses the road at a point 69% feet east of the easterly main line track. The only dimensional description of the degree of drop of the road was that the top of the rail of the spur track was 1% feet higher than the top of the rails of the main line at the crossing. That the road may have actually been lower than the main line tracks somewhere between them and the spur track could be inferred from plaintiff\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither plaintiff nor defendant provided any more accurate information as to the grade of the road in relation to the main line tracks between the place where it \u201cdropped off\u201d the hard surface and the intersection with such tracks. Accurate information in this regard would have aided the jury as well as the District Judge and this Court in considering the question of contributory negligence. Critical to the determination of whether plaintiff was, as a matter of law, guilty of contributory negligence is the opportunity plaintiff had to see the approach of defendant\u2019s train as he came down to, and into, the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">The accident occurred in the early daylight of March 7, 1960. It was snowing and windy. The road was \u201ca solid sheet of ice.\u201d Plaintiff testified that as he approached the crossing, there was a string of boxcars standing on the spur track north of the road (to plaintiff\u2019s right). To the west of these, also north of the road, were a house trailer and a small building, the latter being 23% feet east of the east track of the main line. These objects on the north side of the road, plaintiff said, obscured his view to his right and required him to give special attention in that direction, at least until he had passed them. What he saw to his left and what, according to him, was his ability to see to his left, would permit an inference that he had to be substantially \u201cup to\u201d the crossing before a satisfactory view could be had.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other witnesses corroborated plaintiff\u2019s testimony that a motorist had no adequate view of the track <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>to the south of the crossing until he was on the edge of the crossing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">From the foregoing testimony, however lacking in preciseness, we think that a jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s view to his left was in some degree impaired until the front of his car was close to the track upon which he was struck. He testified that he first saw the train when it was a few feet from him and substantially at the instant when it struck him. Having in mind that the train was going 60 miles an hour, it cannot be said that reasonable minds could conclude only that plaintiff must have, or should have, seen the train on the occasions when he looked preparatory to entering the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"> There was conflict in the evidence as to whether a whistle was blown or a bell rung by defendant\u2019s train crew. While some of plaintiff\u2019s proof on this subject was negative evidence, there was testimony by one or more witnesses that, at their proximity to the scene, they could have heard such signals, if given, and that none were heard. The plaintiff, alert to his approach to the crossing, testified that he heard no signals. Whether the required signals were given was a jury question. Lousiville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Ratliff\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 260 Ky. 380, 386, 85 S.W.2d 1006; Green, Adm\u2019r v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, 299 F.2d 837, 839 (C.A. 6, 1962). Defendant concedes that the signals were not given for the required distance of 50 rods south of the crossing (K.R.S. \u00a7 277.190) and does not question but that the jury could find the defendant guilty of negligence proximately a cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. In the testimony of plaintiff and his witnesses there were some conflicts and inconsistencies and some statements that could support a finding that plaintiff should have seen the train for a substantial time and distance prior to coming onto the crossing. Two witnesses much farther to the east of the crossing saw the train approaching it, but they were on higher ground than was the plaintiff. It was for the jury to resolve any conflicts and inconsistencies in this evidence and make its finding of the fact thereon. Dickerson v. Shepard Warner Elevator Co., 287 F.2d 255, 259 (C.A. 6, 1961); Bathory v. Procter &amp; Gamble Distributing Co., 306 F.2d 22, 25 (C.A. 6, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\"> Defendant\u2019s position is that its evidence was so positive and irrefutable on the question of plaintiff\u2019s view of the crossing that plaintiff\u2019s evidence, above reviewed, was overcome and could not permit a jury to exonerate plaintiff from defendant\u2019s charge of contributory negligence. We mention, preliminarily, the familiar rule that considering the question of directing a verdict on the ground of contributory negligence, the evidence and inferences justifiably drawn therefrom will be viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Hinton v. Dixie Ohio Exp. Co., 188 F.2d 121, 124 (C.A. 6, 1951); Honaker v. Crutchfield, 247 Ky. 495, 501, 57 S.W.2d 502. Likewise, contributory negligence is an affirmative defense and the burden of proving it lies with the defendant; Rule 8.03, Ky.R.C.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">In support of its contention, defendant relies on some photographs taken at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>scene and some engineer\u2019s measurements. The engineer gave figures as to the height of the bank along the east side of defendant\u2019s right of way. At 100 feet south of the crossing, the top of the bank is two feet above the top of the rail of the nearest track. At 200 feet, such dimension is 2% feet; at 400 feet, it is 7.9 feet; at 500 feet, it is 8.6 feet; at 600 feet, it is 7.3 feet and at 700 feet, it is 11 feet. At 745 feet south of the crossing, where a bridge or overpass crosses the tracks, the height of the bank above the rails is \u201csomething over 11 feet, but less than 22 feet.\u201d Defendant\u2019s diesel engine which pulled the train involved is 15 feet 3 inches high. Defendant\u2019s engineer further testified that the top of the rail of the spur track (69% feet east of the main line) is 1% feet above the top of the rail of the nearest main line track. Defendant claims that such figures establish beyond dispute that plaintiff by the exercise of ordinary care, could and should have seen defendant\u2019s train at all times during his journey from the spur track to the main line. We cannot agree. The engineer\u2019s findings did not include any information as to the grade of the road between the spur track and the main line, in which distance there was evidence that plaintiff went down \u201cinto a hole.\u201d Certainly it was permissible for the jury to find that the grade of the road between the spur and the main track was such as to increase the bank\u2019s impairment of the view beyond what the engineer\u2019s figures disclosed. From the engineer\u2019s figures, it cannot be said that when plaintiff reached the spur track the train was necessarily within the 734 feet between the crossing and the overpass. It was going 60 miles per hour or 88 feet per second; the plaintiff was going about five miles per hour. The meager engineering data provided, and the lack of information as to the grade of the road forbids an unimpeachable calculation as to when, if ever, the train came into plaintiff\u2019s view prior to the time the front of his vehicle arrived at the east main line track. Having in mind defendant\u2019s burden of proof, if some measurement or calculation essential to defendant\u2019s theory that plaintiff was contribu-torily negligent is missing, the absence of such essential must be charged to defendant. McFall v. Tooke, 308 F.2d 617, 621 (C.A. 6, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Defendant\u2019s photographs, with the distortions inherent in them, likewise do not, in our opinion, destroy the verbal testimony of plaintiff and his witnesses that no practical view of the oncoming train was available to plaintiff prior to the immediate imminence of collision. While these pictures might, indeed, be persuasive to a finder of the facts, it was for the jury to weigh their probative value against the opposing proofs. The pictures also disclose some amount of brush (leafless at the time) on top of the bank. This brush appears to be of varying height and density along the bank and whether, and how much, such brush added to the bank\u2019s obstruction of the view is uncertain. We recognize that there can be situations where photographs, engineering data and physical facts can leave opposing verbal testimony without probative value. Silver Fleet Motor Express v. Wilson, 291 Ky. 509, 165 S.W.2d 48. Defendant\u2019s evidence, however, does not so unerringly destroy the legitimacy of inferences that could be drawn from plaintiff's proofs as to leave defendant\u2019s claim as the only permissible inference. National Linen Supply Co. v. Snowden, 288 Ky. 374, 156 S.W.2d 186; Reed v. Hostetler, 245 S.W.2d 953, 955 (Ky.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\"> Under Kentucky law, contributory negligence is a defense in bar. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. v. Bailey, 307 Ky. 386, 211 S.W.2d 154. It will constitute such bar, however, only when defendant has met its burden of proving \u201cthat plaintiff was guilty of some specific act, or omission to act, which did not meet the standards of conduct exacted by law.\u201d Eichstadt v. Underwood, 337 S.W.2d 684, 686 (Ky.1960). A verdict convicting a plaintiff of contributory negligence will be directed only \u201cwhere the only fair and reasonable conclusion that can be drawn by reasonable minds is that plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>own negligence was a contributing proximate cause of the injury.\u201d McFall v. Tooke, supra, 308 F.2d at 621; Eichstadt v. Underwood, supra; Neal v. Ashland-Ironton Transfer &amp; Ferry Co., 201 Ky. 332, 256 S.W. 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">What are the applicable \u201cstandards of conduct\u201d exacted by Kentucky law? The rigid \u201cstop, look and listen rule\u201d does not obtain in Kentucky. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Applegate\u2019s Adm\u2019x, 268 Ky. 458, 468, 105 S.W.2d 153; Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Mitchell\u2019s Adm\u2019x, 276 Ky. 671, 677, 124 S.W.2d 1025 and cases cited in those opinions. The rigidity of the stop, look and listen rule, pronounced as federal common law in Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company v. Goodman, 275 U.S. 66, 70, 48 S.Ct. 24, 25, 72 L.Ed. 167, 168, was relaxed by Pokora v. Wabash Railway Company, 292 U.S. 98, 54 S.Ct. 580, 78 L.Ed. 1149. Both of such decisions preceded Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, but we think that Kentucky law has been, and continues to be, compatible with Pokora.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">It is the law of Kentucky that a motorist has the right to place some reliance upon a train crew giving the signals which the Kentucky law prescribes, Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Ratliff\u2019s Adm\u2019r., 260 Ky. 380, 85 S.W.2d 1006. Such right does not permit inattention to obvious dangers. Where, however, because of factors beyond his control, a motorist\u2019s opportunity to discover danger is impaired, he should not, as a matter of law, be barred from recovery because he did not insure his own safety by stopping or employing the extra caution that a reasonably careful driver would use had he reason to anticipate a failure of the train crew to counterbalance his disadvantages by signalling, as the law required it to do. It is, of course, the duty of a motorist to exercise greater care in the face of known hazards. Layman v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co., 266 S.W.2d 111, 113 (Ky.1954). We think, however, that plaintiff\u2019s description of his repeated looks to the north and south in an unsuccessful effort to overcome the hazards to his discovery of defendant\u2019s train might well persuade reasonable minds that he was proceeding with due care under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Not to be misunderstood, we make it clear that if the proofs of the case contained photographic, testimonial or topographic information which, beyond permissible controversy, established that plaintiff had, or in the exercise of due care could have had, an unimpaired view of defendant\u2019s northbound train at a time when there yet remained that opportunity that a reasonably prudent man, under like circumstances, would have employed to avoid the collision, we would, as a matter of law, convict Baird of contributory negligence. Its decisions have announced Kentucky\u2019s adherence to the general rule that a motorist will not be heard to say that he did not see what was clearly to be seen or that he did not hear what was plainly to be heard. Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Stagner, 305 Ky. 717, 719, 720, 205 S.W.2d 493. We, however, are of the opinion that a jury could find that the speed of the train, the obstructions on Baird\u2019s right, the impairment of his view to the left (caused by the bank, the brush and his being \u201cdown in a hole\u201d as he came up to the crossing) all could have combined to prevent Baird from seeing the approaching train in time for protective conduct. Further, we believe that a jury could likewise find that such conditions combined and cooperated to persuade Baird, as a reasonably prudent man, that his look was adequate to discover any train in time to avoid collision. If a reasonably prudent man would have been aware that his views were inadequate and that he was moving into a blind crossing, it was plaintiff\u2019s duty to take commensurate caution. We cannot say that reasonable minds could come only to the conclusion that Baird had an adequate view under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Contributory negligence is, ordinarily, a question for the jury. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Hicks\u2019 Adm\u2019r., 248 Ky. 510, 58 S.W.2d 910; Cincinnati, Newport &amp; Covington Ry. Co. v. Henneberry, 253 S.W.2d 7 (Ky.1952); Louis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ville &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Ratliff\u2019s Adm\u2019r, supra, 260 Ky. 380, 85 S.W.2d 1006. We are of the opinion that under the evidence in this case, plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-4\">. \u201cI dropped off the road down to enter the tracks\u201d at a point 60 to 90 feet from the tracks.
