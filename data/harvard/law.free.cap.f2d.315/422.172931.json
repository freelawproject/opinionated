Appellants urge that the assignments did not come within Cal.Civ.Code, \u00a7 3017, but rather Cal.Civ.Code, \u00a7 955, which requires no recordation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Appellants originally urged a second point, i. e., that the bankruptcy court had no summary jurisdiction to litigate the rights of appellants. This point was formally withdrawn and waived by appellants on oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">We adopt the summary of facts alleged by appellee, assuming they reveal the evidence most favorable to the successful litgant below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201cAccounts,\u201d as defined by California Civil Code, \u00a7 3017(1), <em>may not be </em>validly assigned as against a creditor, unless that creditor has <em>actual </em>notice, or a <em>recorded </em>notice is filed \u201cat the time of, or before, the execution of the assignment, or within five days thereafter.\" (Cal.Civ.Code, \u00a7 3018.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">It is stipulated no such notice was given, and that a creditor exists who is without actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Section 3017(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201c \u2018Account\u2019 means a debt, due or to become due, arising out of the sale, storage, transportation, care, repair, processing, manufacture or other improvement of tangible personal property, or arising out of a contract therefor, or arising out of the rendition of personal services which in the regular course of business will result in an open book account; * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Section 3017(1) and section 955 are mutually exclusive by the precise terms of \u00a7 955.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The sole point of controversy, then, is whether the transaction which here took place created an account within the description found in \u00a7 3017(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The trustee urges that the account was a debt arising out of the sale of food and drink. Appellants urge that the obligation of The Diners\u2019 Club to the bankrupt arose out of the express terms of a prior written contract created only when (a) the customer subsequently lawfully signed the tab at the restaurant, and (b) the charge was subsequently approved by The Diners\u2019 Club. Whose debt was this <em>after </em>the tab was signed by the customer, and <em>before </em>the approval by The Diners\u2019 Club? No one but the customer\u2019s !</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">It may be true that the <em>obligation </em>of The Diners\u2019 Club arose in the way described; and that there was a time lag between the signing of the tabs and The Diners\u2019 Club acceptance of the charges within thirty days after they were incurred. It may be that until The Diners\u2019 Club acted upon and accepted the charges transmitted by the bankrupt, no <em>obligation </em>was created in The Diners\u2019 Club in favor of the bankrupt. Yet in either case the obligation arose from a debt, created by the customer, which \u201cbecame due\u201d and \u201carose out of the sale\u201d of tangible personal property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-17\">The charge slips may be merely evidences of the sale of food, but to permit them and not the account they create to be assigned without notice so as to defeat creditors would prostitute the purpose of California Civil Code, \u00a7 3017(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-18\">Let us suppose that \u201cX\u201d guaranteed that he would stand good for \u201cY\u2019s\u201d charges at \u201cZ\u201d restaurant. \u201cY\u201d dines regularly, and as soon as \u201cX\u201d verifies the authenticity of \u201cY\u2019s\u201d signature on the tab, he pays. Suppose \u201cX\u201d agrees to pay some other of \u201cZ\u2019s\u201d creditors at \u201cZ\u2019s\u201d direction, instead of paying \u201cZ\u201d directly. Could \u201cZ\u201d then say the account was not with \u201cY\u201d \u2014 that it was with \u201cX\u201d? It may be ultimately the <em>obligation </em>of \u201cX,\u201d and \u201cX\u201d may ultimately <em>pay </em>it, but it is payment for a debt created by \u201cY\u201d out of the sale of food. Nothing can be created by such an understanding unless and until \u201cY\u201d buys food and creates a debt therefor. This constitutes an account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>within the meaning of California Civil Code, \u00a7 3017.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-16\">. \u201cThe Bankrupt, San Fernando Valley Restaurant, Inc., was prior to bankruptcy, in the restaurant business. On September 9, 1958, it entered into an agreement with The Diners\u2019 Club, Inc. By the terms of this agreement when a customer presented a valid membership card to the Bankrupt, the customer could \u2018sign\u2019 the check and the Bankrupt was authorized to extend credit for the purchase by the customer. The Bankrupt could not bill the customer, but instead if the Bankrupt presented the charge slip to The Diners\u2019 Club in a certain manner, The Diners\u2019 Club would pay the Bankrupt for the customer\u2019s meal, less certain charges. It is the obligation of The Diners\u2019 Club to pay the Bankrupt, which is the subject matter of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">Thereafter, and under date of July 23, 1959, the Bankrupt agreed to assign The Diners\u2019 Olub charges to Atlas Insurance Agency as security for the Bankrupt\u2019s sale tax bond obligation to Atlas Insurance Agency; and that The Diners\u2019 Club would make all payments on said assigned charges to \u2018J. H. Pingree and/or J. N. Bandeen as Trustees for Continental Casualty Co.\u2019 From time to time, thereafter the Bankrupt assigned monies due from The Diners\u2019 Club; and The Diners\u2019 Olub in due course paid to Continental all monies due on said charges, with the exception of charges totalling $6,000.27. It is the monies due on these unpaid charges with which this litigation is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\">Subsequent to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, Jack N. Bandeen (one of the respondents) filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court for money owed by the bankrupt to Jack N. Bandeen\u2019s insurance business, Atlas Insurance Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-20\">At the present time The Diners\u2019 Club holds and has set aside in a separate \u2018hold\u2019 fund the sum of $7,599.94, of which the sum of $6,000.27 is the subject of this litigation. The Diners\u2019 Club makes no claim to this fund.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-13\">. California Civil Code, Section 955.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">\u201cExcept as provided in Section 955, and subject to compliance with any applicable statute requiring recording or filing, the transfer of any right to payment, not constituting an account as defined in Section 3017 of this Code and not constituting a negotiable instrument, shall be deemed perfected as against third persons upon their being executed and delivered to the transferee an assignment thereof in writing; provided, however, that as between bona fide assignees of the same right for value without notice, the as-signee first giving notice thereof to the obligor in writing shall have priority; but such assignment shall not be, of itself, notice to the obligor so as to invalidate any payments made by him to the transferor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-20\">.
