An attorney present in the courtroom was appointed to represent him. Counsel was given a copy of a proposed information and waiver of indictment, and he and appellant were \u201cexcused temporarily * * * to consult * * * about this matter.\u201d Shortly thereafter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant appeared again before the coui\u2019t, waived indictment, and tendered a plea of guilty. In response to the court\u2019s questions, appellant disclaimed any promise, threat, or coercive influence, and stated that he offered the plea because he was guilty. The court accepted appellant\u2019s plea, and continued the matter three days for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">On the day set for sentencing, appellant moved to withdraw his plea of guilty. The motion was denied. The-entire colloquy between the court and' appellant\u2019s counsel with respect to the-motion is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">Appellant was sentenced and judgment was entered. He appealed, asserting that: (1) the court violated Rule 11,. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, by-accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea without first determining whether it was made with an understanding of the nature of the charge and consequences of the plea;. (2) he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to adequate representation by counsel; and (3) the court erred in denying his motion under Rule 32(d), Federal' Rules of Criminal Procedure, to withdraw his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">(1) Rule 11 provides that the court \u201cshall not accept\u201d a plea of guilty \u201cwithout first determining that the plea is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court in the present case determined only that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary. The court did not determine whether the plea was made with understanding of \u201cthe nature of the charge\u201d; i. e., the court took no steps to satisfy itself that appellant understood \u201cthe <em>meaning </em>of the charge, and what acts amount to being <em>guilty </em>of the charge, and the <em>consequences </em>of pleading guilty thereto.\u201d Edwards v. United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 256 F.2d 707, 710 (1958).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201c[R]eal notice of the true nature of the charge * * * [is] the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.\u201d Smith v. O\u2019Grady, 312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S.Ct. 572, 574, 85 L.Ed. 859 (1941). It is \u201cindispensable to a valid plea.\u201d United States v. Davis, 212 F.2d 264, 267 (7th Cir. 1954). Rule 11 is intended to assure that the defendant possesses that understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">We need not decide whether noncompliance with Rule 11 in this case constituted reversible error, as in some circumstances it may.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are satisfied that this omission, together with other factors indicated below, required that appellant\u2019s motion under Rule 32(d) to withdraw his plea of guilty be granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">(2) Similarly, we do not reach the question of whether appellant was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but we hold that the brevity of appellant\u2019s consultation with his court-appointed attorney supports the conclusion that denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the motion to withdraw his plea was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">(3) The right of an accused to trial by jury has a favored place in our law. Concern for its protection is reflected in the statutes by which Congress empowered the Supreme Court to promulgate procedural rules for the federal courts. Section 3772 of Title 18 contains an express proviso that the rules of criminal procedure may not \u201cabridge the right of the accused to apply for withdrawal of a plea of guilty, if such application be made within ten days after entry of such plea, and before sentence is imposed.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No other restriction upon the power of the Supreme Court over the content of the Rules was prescribed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Accordingly, Rule 32(d) imposes no limitation upon the withdrawal of a guilty plea <em>before </em>sentence is imposed, and such leave \u201cshould be freely allowed.\u201d Poole v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 71, 250 F.2d 396, 400 (1957). See also Gearhart v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 272 F.2d 499, 502 (1959).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the other hand, withdrawal of a guilty plea <em>after </em>sentence is conditioned by Rule 32(d) upon a showing of \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d This distinction rests upon practical considerations important to the proper administration of justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before sentencing, the inconvenience to court and prosecution resulting from a change of plea is ordinarily slight as compared with the public interest in \u25a0protecting the right of the accused to trial by jury. But if a plea of guilty could be retracted with ease <em>after </em>sentence, the accused might be encouraged to plead guilty to test the weight of potential punishment, and withdraw the plea if the sentence were unexpectedly severe.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The result would be to undermine respect for the courts and fritter away the time and painstaking effort devoted to the sentencing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was submitted before sentencing and within three days of his plea of guilty. It was therefore to be freely allowed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">The record disclosed substantial considerations in support of granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>motion, and little justifying denial- Appellant was faced with a serious charge. He was far from home. He had neither a lawyer nor funds to employ one. Appointed counsel, apparently selected from those available in the courtroom at the time of arraignment, presumably had no prior knowledge of appellant, of the charge against him, or of the legal and factual issues involved. The period of consultation and opportunity for deliberation were brief at best. Appellant was not informed by the court of either the nature of the accusation or the consequences of his plea. Appellant asserts that he in fact lacked that knowledge, and pleaded guilty under a misapprehension as to the possible penalty and despite the existence of a meritorious defense. No countervailing interest of the court or prosecution weighed against withdrawal; the record discloses no suggestion that either imposition upon the court or prejudice to the prosecution would have resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">We conclude that in these circumstances denial of the motion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to permit the appellant to change his plea.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b719-6\">ORR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In this circuit, the granting of a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Goo v. United States, 187 F.2d 62 (9th Cir. 1951); cf. Vasquez v. United States, 279 F.2d 34 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">A reading of the record fails to convince me that such an abuse occurred in the instant case. It is true that the trial court failed to instruct the appellant of the nature of the charge against him and the penalty prescribed; but this omission, in my opinion, does not justify reversal if it can be reasonably inferred that a defendant in a given case has that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">The facts from which such knowledge can be inferred in the instant case are: appellant had appointed counsel, with whom he expressed satisfaction, to consult with; and it appears that he has a prior conviction for an identical offense. He is no novice in the courtroom.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">. Appellant asserts in his brief that \u201cin fact only a matter of minutes elapsed.\u201d The record shows the time of both appearances as 10:00 a. m. This is obviously a stenograph error, but it is conceded that both occurred during a single morning court session.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">. \u201cCOUNSEL: It is on behalf of the defendant I would like to move to withdraw his plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">\u201cCOUNSEL : I was informed by the defendant that he has not had as long consideration as he would have previously like to have entered the plea of guilty, and after three or four days I think he has decided that really he would be in a better position if he had entered a plea. of not guilty because he feels he has a meritorious defense to the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, that involves the question of which time does the Court \u25a0 \u2014 should the Court believe the defendant \u2014 -I believe he was asked previously if he entered the plea because he thought he was guilty of the charge, and he said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">\u201cCOUNSEL: That is correct, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: In view of that, I do not think the Court should approve the change of the plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-22\">\u201cCOUNSEL: Well, might I go on further and state, that I believe Mr. Kad-well, I have learned subsequently, entered: this plea to protect the other person in this matter, the young girl; and on the-basis that she would then be returned to-Canada that \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: He told me that he-did it of his own free will and voluntarily,, and it was not because of a promise of a favor or any threat or of any intimidation, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-24\">\u201cCOUNSEL: That is correct, he did so-state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is there anything else-you wish to say ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-26\">\u201cCOUNSEL: Well, I can\u2019t say anything further except that after discussing the matter with Mr. Kadwell, I am also of the opinion that perhaps he-may have a defense to the action; and I also am of the opinion that he, apparently, was protecting the young lady who-was with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-28\">\u201cTHE COURT: The Court very respectfully considers what counsel has said, and the motion made, but the Court in view of the record in this case, also very respectfully denies the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. The court was required to discharge the duty which the Rule imposed, even though appellant was represented by counsel. \u201cThe rule is simply and concisely stated, and it makes no such exception.\u201d United States v. Davis, 212 F.2d 264, 267 (7th Cir. 1954). See Domenica v. United States, 292 F.2d 483, 486 (1st Cir. 1961) ; Gundlach v. United States, 262 F.2d 72, 76 (4th Cir. 1958) (dictum); United States v. Lester, 247 F.2d 496, 500 (2d Cir. 1957) (dictum). Of course, \u201cpresence of counsel * * * is a circumstance which may fairly be taken into account in determining the nature and extent of the inquiry to be made.\u201d Gund-lach v. United States, supra at 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\">. A proposed amendment to Rule 11, recently submitted by the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules appointed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331, would also require the court to make \u201csuch inquiry as may satisfy it that the defendant in fact committed the crime charged.\u201d Rule 11, Proposed Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure, Dec. 15, 1962; 31 F.R.D. No. 5 (Feb. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\">. See Julian v. United States, 236 F.2d 155, 158-159 (6th Cir. 1956). But see United States v. Lester, 247 F.2d 496, 500 (2d Cir. 1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b717-13\">. If Rule 11 is not complied with when a guilty plea is accepted, the District Court must make the determination which Rule 11 requires in a subsequent hearing on a motion under Rule 32(d). United States v. Lester, 247 F.2d 496, 500 (2d Cir. 1957). Similarly, failure to comply with Rule 11 may contribute to the necessity for a hearing under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Domenica v. United States, 292 F.2d 483, 486 (1st Cir. 1961); Reed v. United States, 291 F.2d 856 (4th Cir. 1961); United States v. Mack, 249 F.2d 421 (7th Cir. 1957). In the present case, appellant filed a Section 2255 proceeding, prematurely in view of this appeal raising the issues that might be expected. Conversely, careful compliance with Rule 11 will remove grounds for subsequent motions under Rule 32(d) and Section 2255. As Judge Sobeloffi said in Gundlach v. United States, 262 F.2d 72, 76 (4th Cir. 1958): \u201cThese rules [Rules 10 and 11] are designed not only to safeguard important rights of defendants, but their observance serves also to protect proper administration of the criminal law. When the trial judge fully complies with these rulos and is careful to have the record plainly show that this has been done, it may go far to foreclose irresponsible challenges in the future and the necessity for a hearing under Section 2255 at a time when the facts surrounding the arraignment, plea and sentence may not be as fresh and readily available as they were in this instance.\u201d See also Bailey v. United States, 312 F.2d 679, 681 n. 3 (10th Cir. 1963); Reed v. United States, 291 F.2d 856, 858-859 (4th Cir. 1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b717-24\">. Compare Reed v. United States, 291 F.2d 856, 859 (4th Cir. 1961), with United States v. Wight, 176 F.2d 376, 379 (2d Cir. 1949). Authorities are collected in Brubaker v. Dickson, 310 F.2d 30, 39 n. 48 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. See S.Rep.No. 257, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">. Prior to the adoption of tlie Rules the Supreme Court had said, \u201cThe court in exercise of its discretion will permit one accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial if for any reason the granting of the privilege seems fair and just.\u201d Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 224, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">. There is a technical basis for the distinction: the plea gains finality from the imposition of sentence, and is merged in the judgment. High v. United States, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 25, 288 F.2d 427, 429 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">. As the decisions repeatedly emphasize, disappointment in the sentence imposed is no ground for withdrawal of a guilty plea. See, e. g., Verdon v. United States, 296 F.2d 549, 553 (8th Cir. 1961); United States v. Parrino, 212 F.2d 919, 921 (2d Cir. 1954); Friedman v. United States, 200 F.2d 690, 696 (8th Cir. 1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\">. The colloquy between court and counsel (note 2) suggests that the court may have applied the more exacting standard applicable to motions filed after sentence. Since Rule 32(d) provides that a plea of guilty may be withdrawn after sentence \u201cto correct manifest injustice,\u201d some courts have held that in disposing of such a motion \u201cthe guilt or innocence of the petitioner is controlling.\u201d Watts v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 367, 278 F.2d 247, 251 (1960). See also United States v. Parrino, 203 F.2d 284, 286 (2d Cir. 1953). But see Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 224, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927); Woodring v. United States, 248 F.2d 166, 169 (8th Cir. 1957); Friedman v. United States, 200 F.2d 690, 696 (8th Cir. 1952). Guilt or innocence is not relevant, however, in the determination of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea before sentence. See Poole v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 71, 250 F.2d 396, 400 (1957). \u201cWhere the accused seeks to withdraw his plea of guilty before sentencing, on the ground that he has a defense to the charge, the District Court should not attempt to decide the merits of the proffered defense, thus determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d Gearhart v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 272 F.2d 499, 502 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\">. Dandridge v.
