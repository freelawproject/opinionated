Treating the document filed as a petition for a writ of coram nobis, the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>was denied because not directed to the court which actually sentenced plaintiff. At that hearing plaintiff was present, and acted by choice as his own attorney. A transcript of this proceeding is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On December 15, 1961, plaintiff in addition to this complaint alleging peonage and a motion for a restraining order filed in the district court, also filed in the district court (a) a motion addressed <em>to the Supreme Court of the United States </em>for a restraining order; and (b) civil complaints addressed to the Supreme Court of the United States, based on alleged peonage.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Upon hearing of a motion to dismiss, filed by the Attorney General of the State of Washington, a hearing was had and plaintiff was present in court on January 2, 1962. The motion to dismiss was granted on said date.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">A letter was written the court by the plaintiff and was treated as a proposed amended complaint. It was received on January 11, 1962, and on January 25, 1962, the court directed the filing of this letter as an amended complaint and required a responsive pleading to be filed by the Attorney General of the State of Washington. On February 12, 1962, an answer was filed by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Meanwhile, on November 29, 1961, plaintiff had filed with this court a petition for a writ of mandamus, Miscellaneous Number 1341, asking us to require the district court to act on plaintiff\u2019s complaint. This was denied as moot on January 31, 1962. A purported <em>amendment </em>to the petition for a writ of mandamus was filed with this court on January 26, 1962. On January 31, 1962, this court made the following order in Miscellaneous Number 1387:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201cThe purported amendment to petition for a writ of mandamus, received by the court on January 26, 1962, cannot be considered as such since the original petition has heretofore been denied. Considering such document a motion for leave to file a new application for a writ of mandamus, the same is denied. If petitioner desires to have such document considered a notice of appeal from the district court order of December 13, 1961, in Cause No. 1675, United States District Court, Eastern District of Washington, Southern Division, he should notify the clerk of this court to that effect and apply to the district court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. In the event such a motion is denied by the district court it may be renewed here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Again meanwhile, and on February 8, 1962, plaintiff filed (a) a motion for the issuance of a certificate of probable cause, and (b) a notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">On February 16, 1962, plaintiff\u2019s \u201cReply to Respondent\u2019s Answer\u201d was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The record before us does not disclose what document was filed by the plaintiff with the Supreme Court of the United States in the matter presently pending therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, we note that in No. 817, Miscellaneous (Supreme Court\u2019s 1961- 1962 Term Calendar), Draper v. Washington, 370 U.S. 935, 82 S.Ct. 1589, 8 L.Ed.2d 806, plaintiff\u2019s \u201cMotion for Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis\u201d and the \u201cPetition for a Writ of Certiorari\u201d were granted. The case was transferred to the Appellate Docket and placed on the Summary Calendar for argument, immediately following No. 476 (Douglas v. California, 370 U.S. 930, 82 S.Ct. 1579, 8 L.Ed.2d 804). Number 817, Miscellaneous, on the 1961-1962 Calendar became No. 201 on the Appellate Docket, 1962- 1963 Term Calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">Plaintiff thereafter during the next month made various motions and filed at least four new complaints. On March 20, 1962, the district court heard seven various motions, and on March 28, 1962, ruled on them. The district court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>on March 20, 1962, with plaintiff present in court, considered the plaintiff\u2019s oral motions (a) to strike the notice of appeal, and (b) to withdraw notice of appeal. The latter motion was granted by order dated March 27, 1962. We have read the transcript of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The court then ordered plaintiff\u2019s oral motion granted, allowing him to file an amended complaint, combining in one amended complaint \u201call claims for relief that the plaintiff now has filed in this cause under seven different complaints.\u201d This was filed on March 29, 1962; an answer was filed April 9, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Plaintiff thereafter made several motions, all denied. He then filed a \u201cNotice of Appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d Plaintiff's \u201creply\u201d to respondent\u2019s answer was then filed, and various other motions made and denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">There thus is now pending no appeal filed with or to this court. Technically, nothing is before us. If we assume, however, that the Notice of Appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States is an attempted appeal to this court, we can and will proceed to hear the matter, considering as the Notice of Appeal the document entitled \u201cMotion for Docketing of Appeal\u201d and \u201cNotice of Appearance\u201d attached to the \u201cOpening Appeal Brief and Argument,\u201d filed September 21, 1962 in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We note first that appellant complains of matters not before the district court at the time it made its ruling; of matters not before this court at this time\u2014 \u201cof all 16 adverse rulings\u201d on various motions made below. Appellant then lists his \u201cQuestions Presented\u201d; thirty-four in number, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u201c1. Can an administrative agency punish by decree, for an act, when a Court of Law is prohibited from punishing for the same act, by a properly enacted and wholly valid statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201c2. Does not a special and specific statute govern over general statutes on the same subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c3.

Can a Federal Court protect the civil and Constitutional Rights of a State prisoner when the violations of such, are done under the name of internal discipline by an institution of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">\u201c5. Can the pretext of internal discipline by a State institution be legally used to deny United States Constitutional and Civil Rights to a prisoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">\u201c6. Is not a citizen of the State of Washington also a citizen of the United States of America and therefore entitled to the Civil and Constitutional Rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-17\">\u25a0 \u201c7. Is a citizen of the United States entitled to his Constitutional Rights at all times, and to use such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-18\">\u201c8. If a citizen has certain Civil Rights is he entitled to exercise them, and exercise them at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-19\">\u201c9. If a citizen has certain Civil Rights can he be denied these Rights for a continuing period of time under the theory that he can bring additional suits for damages, and thereby be denied those Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-20\">\u201c10. Is a citizen entitled to use his Civil Rights without having to sue for such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-21\">\u201c11.

Is a citizen entitled to a temporary injunction or other suitable process to protect his Civil Rights until the Cause is determined according to law, by the Courts of this Nation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-24\">\u201c14. Can United States Constitutional Rights be denied or withheld because a State Statute or \u2018process\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>is in direct conflict therewith, legally-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c15. Which is controlling the United States Constitution and the decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court, or State Statutes, \u2018process\u2019 and case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201c16. Do not my United States Civil Rights guarantee me the equal protection of State Statutes and Rights also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201c17. Can any State enact a legal statute which conflicts with the United States Postal Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c18. Can a citizen be deprived of his Right to contact the courts of this Nation, and to litigate therein, under any theory or reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201c19. Can slavery and/or peonage and/or involuntary servitude be practiced in this Country, in any manner, before there is a final judgment of conviction for a felonious crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201c20. Can a citizen, who is not finally convicted of a felonious crime be legally placed in confinement in a penitentiary, against his will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">\u201c21. What are the rights of a citizen who has been convicted of a felonious crime but appeals the conviction, during the time between the finding of guilty, and the decision of the appellate Court, is rendered affirming or reversing the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\u201c22. When a poor person, a layman, is forced to represent himself before the Courts of this Nation, is it not a denial of due process and/or his Civil Rights, to deny him access to the reference material (books) he needs to litigate, and to establish or help to establish his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">\u201c23. When a plaintiff seeking relief from alleged violations of his Civil Rights and damages therefore in a United States Court has alleged a conspiracy to deny and deprive him thereof, can the Court- legally refuse to join the parties who are alleged to have supplied the legal advice, knowing to what use it would be placed by the receivers of such knowledge, and thereby deny plaintiff the opportunity to establish such parties willfull participation in said conspiracy, and thereby removes said parties from liability and responsibility for the willfull participation in such an illegal conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">\u201c24. Where questions of law only are presented to a United States Court in a Civil Rights case, is it not the duty of said Court to determine the rights of the parties, and within twenty (20) months of continuous seeking upon the part of the layman plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">\u201c25.

Can a State Institution under any condition legally decide what material, and which briefs, a layman litigating before a Federal Court may submit to the Courts, Attorneys, or Public Officials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-19\">\u201c29. Can any person, institution, or group of persons, under any circumstances delay or deny to any person or citizen within the United States the Constitutional Right to Appeal and/or the Constitutional Right to Petition and Litigate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-20\">\u201c30. Can a State process, rules, and Institutions be used in any manner to deny or deprive a citizen of the use and protections of United States Constitutional Rights</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cSPECIAL QUESTIONS FOR THIS COURT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201c31. Can a Federal Judge in any case before his Court refuse to file, honor, and accept an Affidavit of Bias and Prejudice, when it is the First Motion made in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201c32. Can a Federal Court refuse to issue injunctive relief until the issues are brought on for trial, after a prima facie case therefore is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c33. Can a Federal Court refuse to issue restraining orders until the issues are brought on for trial, after a prima facie case therefore is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u201c34. Can a Federal Court refuse a motion for a three judge court when State Statutes are challenged on Constitutional grounds and permanent injunctive relief is sought, when the motion is presented under the provisions of the special three judge federal statutes and injunctive statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">No answer we could give to these questions would, we are certain, satisfy the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Fundamental to appellant\u2019s appeal are his three positions: (1) That he cannot be forced to perform any labor in the penitentiary because his appeal from his final judgment of conviction has not been heard in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington; (2) that he is being denied his right to contact the courts or correspond with attorneys; (3) appellant is continually being placed in the \u201chole\u201d because he will not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The voluminous record before us proves there is no merit in the second point. To support his first and third points, appellant cites numerous cases, many of which represent sound law on the facts there involved, but have no application to the facts disclosed by the record now before us. For example, appellant relies heavily on the case of Bailleaux v. Holmes, 1959, D.C., 177 F.Supp. 361.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He fails to realize or recognize that that case was reversed by this court in Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 1961, 290 F.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Because a defendant appeals a conviction, or questions it by a collateral attack, he is not entitled, pending a final determination, to his freedom; nor to enunciate to the warden the rules by which he is to be governed during his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">There is no federally protected right of a state prisoner not to work while imprisoned after conviction, even though that conviction is being appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">Prison rules may require appellant to work but this is not the sort of involuntary servitude which violates Thirteenth Amendment rights. Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S. 328, 332, 36 S.Ct. 258, 259, 60 L.Ed. 672, where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-19\">\u201cThis amendment was adopted with reference to conditions existing since the foundation of our Government, and the term involuntary servitude was intended to cover those forms of compulsory labor akin to African slavery which in practical operation would tend to produce like undesirable results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-20\"> Where a person is duly tried, convicted, sentenced and imprisoned for crime in accordance with law, no issue of peonage or involuntary servitude arises. Lindsey v. Leavy, 9 Cir., 149 F.2d 899. The Thirteenth Amendment has no application where a person is held to answer for a violation of a penal statute. Blass v. Weigel, D.C., 85 F.Supp. 775, 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">It follows, therefore, that whether appellant is being held in the state penitentiary or the county jail, he may be required to work in accordance with institution rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">Appellant asserts, however, that he is being improperly held in the state penitentiary, and that in accordance with state law he should be in the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>jail. Due process questions do not arise merely because appellant has been treated at variance with state law. Hughes v. Heinze, 9 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 864, 869. No denial of equal protection is shown unless there is shown intentional or purposeful discrimination between persons or classes. Hoffman v. Halden, 9 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 280, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The sum of appellant\u2019s position is that the district court\u2019s actions were \u201cso arbitrary and capreciuos (sic) as to deny him\u201d constitutional rights and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Appellant raised many points on appeal that relate to unappealable orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We have read the transcript of proceedings had on December 14,1961, on March 20, 1962 and on April 19, 1962. We find no arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We also note that there is no final judgment of the court below. There being none, there is nothing before us upon which an appeal can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The appeal is, therefore, herewith dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\"> From the Minutes of the Supreme Court of the United States of June 25, 1962, we take this to have been an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. State v. Long, 58 Wash.2d 830, 365 P.2d 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\">. Cited by appellant under various names, such, as \u201cBallixuea v.
