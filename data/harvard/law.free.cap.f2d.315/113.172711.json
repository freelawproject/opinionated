Upon pleas of not guilty to each count, the trial judge severed Count III. A jury found appellant guilty of Counts I and II, and appellant was sentenced to two concurrent five year terms. Count III was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">Appellant urges as grounds for appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">I. Insufficiency of the evidence of possession as to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">II. The federal rule that an accused can be convicted by the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice should be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">III. Error in instructions with respect to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-23\">a) the burden of proof on defendant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-24\">b) presumptions created by unexplained possession of drugs</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-25\">IY. The presumption in 21 U.S.C.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-26\">\u00a7 174 is unconstitutional:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-27\">a) because it violates the due process clause</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-28\">b) because no rational basis therefor</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-29\">V. Prejudicial error of prosecutor in argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-30\">We adopt the government\u2019s statement as to the facts of the case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as we must. Glasser v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"> Possession need not be actual possession, if there is circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish dominion and control. Rodella v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 286 F.2d 306; Cellino v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 941. There was sufficient, substantial evidence to go to the jury, and to convict, if the jury believed the testimony of Keith Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Counsel asks us to change the federal rule on the lack of necessity of corroboration of the testimony of an accomplice. This we have refused, and do refuse, to do. Audett v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 837, notes 45 and 46, and cases cited; Williams v. United States, 9 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 664; Toles v. United States, 9 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 590; Bible v. United States, 9 Cir., 1963, 314 F.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\"> The first instruction objected to was favorable to appellant. But whether it was or not, no objection was made to it when it was given, and any objection was waived. Walker v. United States, 9 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 217; O\u2019Neal v. United States, 9 Cir., 1962, 310 F.2d 175. No point is made that the instruction is an incorrect statement of law, merely that it is not applicable to the facts of this case. Under such circumstance, it is peculiarly defense counsel\u2019s obligation to make timely objection. Defendant\u2019s interpretation of the facts would eliminate and fail to consider much testimony favorable to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">The second instruction complained about would be error only if the presumption contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-18\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b163-19\">Section 174 of Title 21 United States Code, with its presumption, is not unconstitutional. Caudillo v. United States, 9 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 513, certiorari denied. Romero v. United States, 357 U.S. 931, 79 S.Ct. 1375, 2 L.Ed.2d 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-20\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b163-21\">Under this point, appellant cites good law, Berger v. United States, 1935, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314, wholly inapplicable to the factual situation disclosed by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>clearly no prejudicial misconduct, just the good, ordinary and usual arguments presented to juries by prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">But even had there been a taint of unfairness or prejudice, no voice was raised in protest \u2014 no objection ever raised \u2014 no chance given the trial court to cure any alleged error. This is a complete waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Finding no error, and the record disclosing appellant had a fair trial, the judgments of conviction on Counts I and II are</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-16\">. \u201cOn June 21, 1959 Wallace saw White at a theatre in Beverly Hills. Wallace asked White to meet him on the following day. They agreed to meet at Tiny Naylor\u2019s Drive-in on June 22,1959. Wallace met with Federal agents on the morning of June 22, 1959. Wallace was searched. His car was searched. Wallace was supplied with $100 in Government funds. Wallace, followed by a Federal agent, drove to Tiny Naylor\u2019s Drive-in. Wallace parked his car and went inside the Drive-in. As soon as White arrived Wallace left the Drive-in and got into White\u2019s automobile. They drove around for a few minutes. White was given the $100 in official funds. White agreed to furnish Wallace with heroin. White directed Wallace to a specific Standard gas station. White told Wallace that the heroin would be under the sink in the men\u2019s room. White dropped Wallace at Tiny Naylor\u2019s Drive-in. Wallace got into his car and drove to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>7th and Normandie where he met with Federal agents. Wallace was searched. His car was searched. Wallace drove to the Standard gas station and looked in the men\u2019s room for the heroin. Wallace did not find the heroin in the Standard gas station. Wallace looked in another gas station across the street. Again Wallace did not find the heroin. Wallace returned to his apartment. Wallace was searched by Federal agents. Wallace then left his apartment and drove to a bowling alley near Santa Monica and La Cienega. Wallace parked his car parallel to White\u2019s car. White and a man named Burley were in White\u2019s car. Wallace told White and Burley that he could not find the heroin at the Standard gas station. Wallace was then directed to another gas station. Wallace went to the gas station and picked up the heroin. Wallace then drove back to his apartment and surrendered the heroin to a Federal agent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-13\">. The four instances of alleged prejudicial misconduct are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">(a) \u201cWe are not dealing here with East Los Angeles, simple marihuana</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-22\">peddlers, these are West Los Angeles people, clever.

There is no Fargo Device and counsel makes a point, why didn\u2019t you have a transmitting device? They happen to have one device for 40 agents.
