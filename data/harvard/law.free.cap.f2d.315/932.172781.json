Sun-Glo counterclaims by seeking cancellation of the Frostie Company\u2019s registration of \u201cFROSTIE.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissed both the opposition and counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-26\">Appeal No. 6908 is by the Frostie Company from dismissal of the opposition, and Appeal No. 6920 is by Sun-Glo from dismissal of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-27\">Both parties took testimony and introduced documentary exhibits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>board summarized the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-4\">\u201cThe record shows that opposer, through a predecessor in business, through more than 200 franchised bottlers of soft drinks, and through franchised processors of root beer syrup made in accordance with opposer\u2019s specifications and used in soda fountains and vending machines, has since as early as 1939 continuously used the term \u2018FROSTIE\u2019, either alone or in association with other more or less ancillary matter as a trademark for root beer and for syrups used in the manufacture thereof. \u2018FROSTIE\u2019 root beer is marketed both in bottle and in draft form throughout a substantial part of the United States, and it has been advertised both by opposer and its franchised bottlers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">\u201cAccording to its testimony, applicant has, since about February 1959, used the mark \u2018FROSTY INN\u2019 for syrups used in making a variety of soft drinks, including root beer, which it sells exclusively to a number of drive-in-stands operating under a franchise agreement with applicant and doing business under the trade designation \u201cFROSTY INN\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The board also noted that Sun-Glo introduced in evidence a number of third party registrations for marks comprising the words \u201cFROST\u201d or variations thereof in support of its contention that Frostie Company\u2019s mark \u201cFROSTIE\u201d is merely a descriptive term as applied to soft drinks. Referring to the definition of <em>\u201cFROSTY,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the board found that neither \u201cFROSTY\u201d nor \u201cFROSTIE\u201d describes any characteristics or properties of root beer or other soft drinks, and stated that the third party registrations were insufficient to prove that those words would be regarded by purchasers as descriptive of such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">It was the opinion of the board that \u201cFROSTY\u201d or \u201cFROSTIE\u201d as applied to a soft drink suggests one that is cold, chilled, or refreshingly cool. The board then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201cConsidering therefore the suggestive connotation of the word \u2018FROSTY\u2019 or \u2018FROSTIE,\u2019 the fact that it has been registered by numerous others in combination with other words as trademarks for beverages, and the substantial differences between the marks here involved in sound, meaning, and appearance, it is concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azi-dedup-0\">Sun-Glo, in support of its counterclaim for cancellation, contends that \u201cFROSTIE\u201d is merely descriptive of a soft drink in its condition as it is consumed. We are in full agreement with the board that neither \u201cFROSTY\u201d nor \u201cFROSTIE\u201d describes any property of root beer or other soft drinks. Thus they are not descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">While we have, in certain cases, e. g., Murray Corporation of America v. Red Spot Paint and Varnish Co., 280 F.2d 158, 47 CCPA 1152, cited by the board, treated the suggestiveness of a mark as a factor to be considered in determining the question of likelihood of confusion, each case must be determined on its own particular facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">Here, \u201cFROSTY INN\u201d is applied to the same goods as those for which the trademark \u201cFROSTIE\u201d is registered. In practical effect the former incorporates the latter in its entirety. The additional word \u201cINN\u201d is short and forms the terminal part of Sun-Glo\u2019s mark, thereby minimizing any effect it might have in distinguishing from the single word mark, \u201cFROSTIE,\u201d in either sound or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>appearance. Considering the marks as a whole, we think \u201cFROSTY INN\u201d so resembles the registered mark, \u201cFROSTIE,\u201d as to be likely, when applied to Sun-Glo\u2019s syrups and concentrates, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is reversed as to the dismissal of the opposition, and affirmed as to the dismissal of the counterclaim for cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-14\">.
