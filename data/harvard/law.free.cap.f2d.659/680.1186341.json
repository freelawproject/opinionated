Mr. Ferguson died when he and two other men were attempting to erect a citizens band radio antenna at the site of a mobile home. The facts giving rise to this appeal are not in dispute. On September 12, 1976, Howard Haynes and Randy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>McDaniel attempted to erect a CB radio antenna at the mobile home where they lived. Using a post hole digger, Haynes dug a hole beside the mobile home for the base of the antenna. He then put a bracket on the mobile home to secure the antenna to the side. Haynes then laid the 35-foot-long antenna out on the ground, and he and McDaniel unsuccessfully attempted to raise it. Elzie Ferguson was then recruited to assist, and together, the three men were able to raise the antenna to within two or three feet of being upright. At that point, it came in contact with an overhead electrical transmission line. Elzie Ferguson was killed instantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The line that the antenna touched, owned by the Southwestern Electric Power Company (\u201cSWEPCO\u201d), carried 7,200 volts of electricity. SWEPCO had an easement across the property for the purpose of transmitting electricity and two uninsulated lines, the lower one neutral, had been strung across the property since 1965. The height, location, and construction of the lines were proper and maintained in compliance with industry standards and the National Electrical Safety Code. SWEPCO\u2019s conductor wire was 26 feet 9 inches above the ground, and the neutral wire was 20 feet 7 inches above the ground. Since 1973 there had been a 10-foot 5-inch high mobile home beneath the wires. The National Electrical Safety Code requires 7,200 volt transmission lines to be 8 feet above, or 3 feet horizontal to, buildings. Either of these clearances is sufficient to meet code requirements. SWEPCO\u2019s line was 16 feet 4 inches above the mobile home.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The case was tried to a jury, the trial judge instructing the jury that, as a matter of law, both SWEPCO and Elzie Ferguson were guilty of negligence. The jury found 25 percent of the negligence of Elzie Ferguson and 75 percent of the negligence of SWEPCO contributed to the fatal accident. The jury\u2019s $1 million award of damages was apportioned and reduced to take into account Elzie Ferguson\u2019s contributory negligence. The court entered judgment for $450,000 in behalf of Mrs. Mosby and $300,-000 in behalf of Mr. Ferguson\u2019s children, plus interest and costs of suit. Defendant SWEPCO appeals here from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motions for an instructed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a new trial. Alternatively, the defendant urges us to reexamine the \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d jury award. Because we conclude that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for an instructed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we do not reach the damages issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The litigants acknowledge that the key issue is foreseeability. In Texas the liability of an electric company for injuries resulting from contact with overhead power lines is based on the traditional concept of negligence requiring proof that the electric company could reasonably anticipate injury resulting from its conduct. <em>Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. v. Brooks, </em>161 Tex. 32, 336 S.W.2d 603 (1960). The Texas courts have rejected attempts to gauge liability by stricter standards. <em>Erwin v. Guadalupe Valley Electric Co-op, </em>505 S.W.2d 353 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014San Antonio 1974, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.) (rejection of strict or products liability theories in electrocution case).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\"><em>Brooks </em>is apparently the most recent opinion by the Texas Supreme Court on the rule of law in this case. There the plaintiff was injured while working on a building being constructed in close proximity to a high voltage line. The line met National Electrical Safety Code clearance requirements and had been in place several years prior to construction of the building. The electric company was aware of the construction of the building, but no request had been made to de-energize the line, and the company did not know of the proposed work by the plaintiff. The Texas Supreme Court held, as a matter of law, that these facts did not establish that the electric company could reasonably foresee contact with its line. The court\u2019s rationale could not have been clearer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">There is nothing in the record to show any concern over the progress of the building from a structural standpoint on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the part of petitioner or its employees. The record wholly fails to show any facts which would be a basis for holding that petitioner could reasonably anticipate the timing for pouring concrete on top of the second floor. Of course petitioner knew the location of the lines in relation to the building, but since they were properly located in accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code the knowledge of. such location in itself gave no reason to anticipate danger to respondent. Respondent wholly failed to establish any reason why petitioner should anticipate the injury of which he complains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">If the reason to anticipate injury is not established, then no duty arises to act to prevent such an unanticipated injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">There is no evidence that petitioner in this instance had actual knowledge of probable danger to respondent, and there are no facts in the record upon which to base constructive notice to petitioner. To hold petitioner liable under the facts of this case we would necessarily have to arbitrarily impute foresight to petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">336 S.W.2d at 606. The court further observed, <em>id. </em>at 608, that it was unaware of <em>any </em>Texas case \u201cholding the owner of previously franchised and established lines in accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code liable to a member of the public without there being shown some reason for the utility to anticipate danger to him <em>ft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">Our position is much like that faced by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Brooks. </em>All that plaintiffs proved at trial was that SWEPCO was aware that (1) a mobile home was beneath its lines, and (2) it is dangerous to raise an antenna into an electric line.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In essence, the plaintiffs argue that an electric company should anticipate fatal contact with its lines from the mere presence of a residence beneath the lines. Like the Texas Supreme Court, we are unaware of any Texas case that reaches or even implies such an extraordinary result. None of the cases cited by the plaintiffs support a finding of negligence on the meager evidence here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and there is considerable Texas law standing precisely for the contrary proposition that an electric company is not bound to anticipate contact with its lines when these are at a proper height and the company is without knowledge of the proposed activity near its lines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>also cited an impressive array of cases from other jurisdictions that have reached the same results as the Texas courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Plaintiffs have only shown that a fatal accident was within the range of possibilities. As <em>Brooks </em>shows, foreseeability requires more. Note that we are not saying that compliance with the National Electrical Safety Code, standing alone, frees a power company from liability. As defendant correctly points out in its brief, code compliance is one of the many facts in this case negating a conclusion that SWEPCO should have anticipated contact with its line. Here there was undisputed evidence that the line was properly designed and met the code clearance requirements even after the mobile home was placed beneath it. The hazard of which the power company was shown to be aware was only the universal danger of contact with electric lines. The unfortunate accident that occurred had little to do with the mobile home\u2019s location and, indeed, the accident might have happened regardless of where the mobile home was located. Evidence of code compliance is a proper factor to consider in determining if a power line meets the common law standard of care in a particular case. <em>City of Brady v. Finklea, </em>400 F.2d 352, 356 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the defendant should have placed a warning on the line is also without merit. There is considerable evidence in the record that Mr. Ferguson and his friends, while uncertain of whether the line was \u201clive,\u201d were aware of the danger of striking the line with the antenna and sought to avoid it. In addition, plaintiffs did not here challenge the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that, as a matter of law, Mr. Ferguson was guilty of negligence in contacting the line. That instruction, as defendant points out in its brief, necessarily encompasses awareness of the line and the danger in contacting it. Even if we assume that the trial court was wrong on this, a claim of ignorance of the properties and dangers of electricity is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>worthy of credence in this day and age.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under Texas law, there is no duty to warn a person who is already aware of a danger. <em>Kenny v. El Paso Electric Co., </em>371 S.W.2d 777 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014El Paso 1963, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Admittedly, an electric company is aware that people and objects contact uninsulated wires. Yet this hazard exists wherever lines exist, and Texas grounds liability only in cases of negligence. Absent an indication that the Texas legislature or the Texas courts have done so, federal courts are not to transmute a state\u2019s traditional concept of negligence into a species of strict liability. This is, in effect, what the plaintiffs successfully asked the trial court to do here. We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Viewing all the evidence in this case in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the plaintiffs, as we must do, <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir. 1969), we conclude that the defendant could not have reasonably anticipated this accident. Reasonable and fair-minded persons in the exercise of impartial judgment could only arrive at this conclusion, and the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict or, alternatively, judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">REVERSED and RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. The nature of the evidence presented on this point suggests just how tenuous was the proven \u201cknowledge\u201d on the part of SWEPCO. At trial, a SWEPCO employee testified that he would not live in a mobile home under a 7,200-volt line. SWEPCO\u2019s expert witness admitted that there was a danger of people contacting electric lines with antennae, and SWEPCO\u2019s general manager testified that he was aware of newspaper accounts of accidents such as these occurring all over the United States. Finally, there was evidence presented that SWEPCO had, for some time, broadcast general warnings of the dangers of raising antennae near high-voltage transmission lines. There was no evidence that anyone had ever attempted to erect a CB antenna at this mobile home or in this area at any time in the past. SWEPCO had not been notified of the work to be done, nor had it been requested to de-energize, cover, or take any other action with respect to its lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. <em>Texas Power &amp; Light Co. v. Culwell, </em>34 S.W.2d 820 (Tex.Com.App.1931), and <em>Texas Public Serv. Co. v. Armstrong, </em>37 S.W.2d 294 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Austin 1931, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.), involved insulated service wires that had negligently been allowed to have constant physical contact with other objects until the insulation had worn off. <em>City of Brady v. Finklea, </em>400 F.2d 352 (5th Cir. 1968), involved a rotted crossarm, and in <em>Texas Power &amp; Light Co. v. Jacobs, </em>323 S.W.2d 483 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Waco 1959, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.), the electric lines were not in compliance with National Electrical Safety Code clearance requirements. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument based on <em>Texas Power &amp; Light Co. v. Holder, </em>385 S.W.2d 873 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Tyler 1964, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.), is completely specious. In <em>Holder </em>it was admitted that the electric line causing the accident crossed a roadway and was below statutory requirements for lines <em>across </em>roadways. In referring to the statute, the Court of Civil Appeals inadvertently referred to the statute as applying height requirements for lines \u201calong or across\u201d roadways, and it was this dictum misstating the law that was disapproved in the Texas Supreme Court per curiam opinion, 393 S.W.2d 821 at 822.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-14\">. <em>American General Ins.

Southwestern Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>115 F.2d 706 (5th Cir. 1940) (although electric company had been notified prior to accident that work would be performed and had had one of its engineers present at the site, company could not have reasonably fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>seen that a crane would hit the power line; instructed verdict in favor of power company affirmed); <em>Wilson v.

(instructed verdict in behalf of power company affirmed, as company could not have foreseen that crane would strike power line; company should have been notified and asked to turn off the electricity); <em>Havens v. Dallas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>256 S.W.2d 689, 691 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1953, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.) (constructive knowledge of mere presence of building near electric line did not create any duty on part of power company).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">. In <em>Georgia Power Co. v. Williams, </em>132 Ga.App. 874, 209 S.E.2d 648 (1974), <em>cert. denied </em>(Ga.), two men were injured while attempting to raise a TV antenna near a house. The evidence established that the house had been built first and that the line clearances were in compliance with the National Electrical Safety Code. The court held that, as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the close proximity of the wire to the house and the area custom of raising antennae were insufficient to raise a jury issue on the foreseeability of the accident to the power company. <em>See also Tallahatchie Valley Electric Power Ass\u2019n v. Clinton, </em>347 So.2d 348 (Miss.1977); <em>Vital v. Housing Authority of New Iberia, </em>360 So.2d 1182 (La.App.1978); <em>Daniel v. Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>329 P.2d 1060 (Okl.1958); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson City, </em>41 Tenn.App. 148, 292 S.W.2d 794 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Cases cited by plaintiffs from other jurisdictions are easily distinguishable. In <em>Burk v. Missouri Power &amp; Light Co., </em>420 S.W.2d 274 (Mo.1967), the defendant was electrocuted while standing on top of a trailer. A witness testified that the antenna got no closer than two feet from the wire. There was testimony that the electric line carried 34,500 volts and could arc several feet. The court said that the case was factually distinguishable from those cases where there is actual touching of the wire. <em>Id. </em>at 278. <em>In Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>285 So.2d 725 (Miss.1973), three different antennae had been used at a house by former residents, and antenna/electric line contact had occurred nearby prior to the accident. The court said, \u201cpractically every home\u201d in the town had an antenna attached to its house. The later case of <em>Tallahatchie Valley Electric Power </em>Ass\u2019n v. <em>Clinton, </em>347 So.2d at 351, described <em>Shepard </em>as involving a \u201cveritable forest of television antennas\u201d and said that this was a distinguishable fact that affected the electric company\u2019s duty. In the case here, as we have noted, there was no proof that anyone at the mobile home or in the area had ever raised an antenna near SWEPCO\u2019s electric lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">. <em>See, e. g., Cates v.
