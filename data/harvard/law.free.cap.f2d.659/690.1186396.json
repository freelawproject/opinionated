United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), the district court heard evidence and entered a \u201cfinal order\u201d determining the rights of individual class members to relief. The EEOC appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of relief to five class members and attacking a purported finding of fact. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-20\">I. <em>The Four Memphis City Drivers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-21\">The district court determined that four former \u201ccity drivers\u201d at T.I.M.E.-D. C.\u2019s Memphis terminal \u2014 Charles E. Taylor, Charles D. Glover, Gerald Jacques, and Herbert Gene Kelly (the \u201cclaimants\u201d) \u2014 were not entitled to relief. Taylor and Glover are black; Jacques and Kelly are white. In 1969, all four men transferred from \u201ccity\u201d to \u201cline\u201d jobs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court expressly found that all four had made application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>such transfer \u201cas of July 2, 1965, prior to that time, and subsequent to that time.\u201d It is undisputed that it was the company\u2019s policy, from 1958 until 1969, not to allow transfer from city to line jobs. It was the EEOC\u2019s theory at trial that this policy had a discriminatory purpose: to prevent blacks (who held only city jobs) from becoming line drivers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The district court did not make a finding expressly stating that it adopted the EEOC\u2019s theory. Such a finding is necessarily implied, however, by its grant of relief to Julius Glasper, a class member whose situation was similar to the four claimants in every way but one: when the company discontinued the \u201cno-transfer\u201d policy in 1969, Glasper declined the opportunity to transfer from his city job to a line job.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied relief to the other four claimants solely because they took the opportunity to transfer, stating: <em>\u201cOrdinarily relief would have been given to these men </em>but, at the time of transfer to line, each agreed with T.I.M.E., as evidenced by waiver-letters in their personnel files, that their seniority date on the line roster would be as of the date of their transfer (emphasis added). We think that denying relief on this ground was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">The so-called \u201cwaiver-letters\u201d signed by each of the four claimants provided in full: \u201cTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: This is to certify I hereby <em>understand </em>and <em>agree </em>my seniority date with T.I.M.E.-D.C., Inc., as a line driver is [the date of my transfer]\u201d (emphasis added). This statement signifies nothing more than that the employee \u201cunderstood\u201d and \u201cagreed\u201d that, under the applicable collective bargaining agreement, any employee who transferred from one line of work to another had seniority in that new line only as of the date of his transfer. The letter does not purport to act as a waiver or a settlement of any pre-existing claim, Title VII or otherwise, against the company. Moreover, the defendants did not take the position nor introduce any evidence at trial that the parties understood or intended the letter to operate as a waiver or settlement of any such claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">It would be ironic indeed to hold that these four drivers are barred from relief simply because the company finally gave them what they were long entitled to by removing an illegally-motivated barrier to their transfer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It would be equally ironic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>to put these four in a worse position than Glasper because they lent credence to their allegations that they requested transfer between 1965 and 1969 by actually transferring as soon as they were given the opportunity. The district court has held, in effect, that by taking the incentive to better their positions in 1969, rather than waiting twelve years for the EEOC to vindicate their claims, they have surrendered their right to relief. In the absence of any evidence that they knew they were doing so, we cannot uphold this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The document at issue would not suffice as proof of settlement of any claim; it follows a <em>fortiori </em>that it cannot suffice as proof of settlement or waiver of a Title VII claim. This court has been so rigorous in requiring a \u201cvoluntary and knowing\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> waiver of Title VII rights that it has required proof that claimants \u201ccomprehended the rights that they were relinquishing\u201d when they signed a \u201cconciliation agreement\u201d expressly waiving all Title VII rights. <em>Cox v. Allied Chemical Corp., </em>538 F.2d 1094, 1098 (5th Cir. 1976). Since the document in question here cannot pass as a \u201cwaiver,\u201d it certainly cannot pass as a \u201cvoluntary and knowing\u201d one.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Title VII rights can be waived and Title VII claims can be settled. But there must be some evidence of waiver or settlement. There is none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In so holding, we express no criticism of the court below. That court\u2019s handling of this lengthy, massive, important ease has been outstanding. We simply hold that of the hundreds of claims for relief in this case, four were denied on an improper ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">We remand these four claims for a determination of the proper seniority dates of the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">II. <em>Virgil Hardin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">It is difficult to understand the EEOC\u2019s position concerning Virgil Hardin. Hardin was granted retroactive seniority by the district court\u2019s original decree in 1973. He held a position as a line driver in the Los Angeles terminal through 1977. In 1975, he was laid off. In 1977, Hardin was terminated, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, because he failed to accept any of three opportunities to return from layoff. Thus, the EEOC cannot be complaining that Hardin was never given the relief to which he was entitled; it must be complaining that his termination was a violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">We doubt very much that this claim has anything to do with the \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of discrimination in \u201chiring, assignment, and promotion policies\u201d established by the government in the liability phase of this case, <em>see Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 329, 334-43, 97 S.Ct. at 1851, 1854-58. Even if Hardin\u2019s claim were a proper part of this case, we think that he would have the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case that he was terminated because of his race, a burden which he and the EEOC did not even attempt to satisfy at trial. But even giving Hardin, as the district- court did, the benefit of the presumption of discrimination established in the pattern and practice suit,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the company unquestionably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>demonstrated a legit\u00edmate, non-discriminatory reason for his discharge: it proved that it sent him three recall letters and he failed to accept the positions offered. There was no evidence that this reason was a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-57, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (burdens of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief to Hardin.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Finally, the EEOC objects to the following paragraph in the district court\u2019s \u201cfinal order\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">There has been no criticism by this court, or any of the appellate courts reviewing the ease, as to the good faith efforts of T.I.M.E.-D.C. to remedy the effects of past discrimination in its hiring and initial assignment practices since the original court orders in this case. The Consent Decree provided that T.I.M.E.-D.C. agreed to hire in the \u201cratio of at least one black or one Spanish surnamed American for each white hired or transferred,\u201d Sec. 13(b), [and] the reports on file with this court indicate that this provision of the Consent Decree has been complied with and honored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The EEOC attacks the final portion of this statement as a \u201cfinding\u201d that T.I.M.E.-D.C. has complied with the consent decree, a \u201cfinding\u201d which, it says, is not supported by the evidence. We need not concern ourselves with the evidence, however, because the statement neither is nor purports to be a \u201cfinding.\u201d The company\u2019s compliance was not an issue before the district court, and this statement forms no part of the relief ordered by the court. The statement would not preclude any person who might otherwise have the right to challenge the company\u2019s compliance from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The paragraph is simply one of many preceding the decretal paragraphs of the court\u2019s order. The paragraphs that precede and follow it discuss the history of the litigation and the general equitable principles the court has followed in framing its relief. Taken in context, the paragraph is merely a commendation of the efforts T.I. M.E.-D.C. has made to remedy the effects of its past practices. We similarly commended the company in our prior opinion in this case. <em>United States v. T.I.M.E.-D.C., </em>517 F.2d 299, 316 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">. We use the terminology adopted by the Court in <em>Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 329 n.3, 97 S.Ct. at 1852 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-5\">. Although Jacques and Kelly are white, they may be \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d by discrimination against blacks, provided that they can establish a personal injury. <em>EEOC v. Mississippi College, </em>626 F.2d 477, 483 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 3143, 69 L.Ed.2d 994 (1981). The injury to Jacques and Kelly seems more substantial than that held sufficient in <em>Mississippi College </em>\u2014 not only can each claim a violation of his \u201cpersonal right to work in an environment unaffected by racial discrimination,\u201d <em>id., </em>but each can also claim a deprivation of the same employment opportunity denied to the black claimants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\">. The district court found that Glasper \u2014 spelled \u201cGlesper\u201d in the court\u2019s order, but compare Glasper\u2019s own spelling in his trial testimony, Tr. 394 \u2014 applied for a line job in October 1965. The court also found that there was no vacancy for a line job until March 29, 1966. On January 31, 1966, Glasper became a regular city driver. Therefore, the company\u2019s no-transfer policy was as applicable to him when a position became available as it was to the four claimants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">. Instead, defendants argue that the four drivers have no claim because their seniority was awarded in accord with the seniority system found by the Supreme Court to be <em>bona fide </em>in <em>Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 355, 97 S.Ct. at 1865. But these drivers\u2019 Title VII claim for the company\u2019s refusal to transfer them between July 2, 1965. \u2014 -the date Title VII went into effect \u2014 and 1969 involves no challenge to the <em>bona tides </em>of the seniority system. In <em>Teamsters, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that a finding of <em>bona tides </em>\u201cdoes not bar the award of retroactive seniority to job applicants who seek relief from an employer\u2019s post-Act hiring discrimination.\u201d 431 U.S. at 346, 97 S.Ct. at 1860. Thus, the fact that the seniority system is <em>bona fide </em>is irrelevant; the question is whether the \u201cwaiver-letter\u201d provides any ground for refusing relief for established violations of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b780-15\">. Not only did the company make no concession other than what the law required it to make, but in fact it attempted to extract a concession from these claimants by making them give up their company seniority along with their job seniority, in violation of the collective bargaining agreement. The claimants declined to accept the company\u2019s original offer, and waited until the offer was changed to conform to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Defendants point out that this change in the offer came about when other city drivers accepted the company\u2019s original offer, but then won back their company seniority through the bargaining agreement\u2019s grievance procedure. Defendants make the strange argument that the claimants should be estopped because they benefitted from the grievance procedure. If the grievance award shows anything, it shows that acceptance of the company\u2019s offer was not even considered a \u201cwaiver\u201d of the very thing the claimants are purported to have waived, <em>i. </em>e., any claim concerning their seniority rights under the bargaining agreement. Much less could it operate as a waiver of their Title VII rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b781-15\">. <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 52 n.15, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1021 n.15, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b781-16\">. Because it is not a \u201cwaiver,\u201d the district court\u2019s finding that it was not \u201cthe result of any discrimination or other pressure\u201d is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b781-17\">. <em>See Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 362, 97 S.Ct. at 1868 (\u201cOn remand, . . . every post-Act minority group <em>applicant </em>for a line-driver position will be presumptively entitled to relief, subject to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>showing by the company that its <em>earlier refusal to place </em>the applicant in a line-driver position was not based on its policy of discrimination.\u201d) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">. The EEOC argues at length concerning Hardin\u2019s testimony that he never received two of the three certified letters. We fail to see the relevance of this argument. The EEOC does not dispute that the company sent the letters. Thus, whether or not Hardin received them would appear to have little bearing on the company\u2019s good faith in terminating him, unless it were also proved that the company knew that Hardin had not received the letters. There is no evidence in the record that Hardin ever brought the alleged misdeliveries to the attention of the company when he was terminated. Finally, we note that Hardin had an opportunity to testify before the trial court, and that court was entitled to disbelieve his testimony, as it obviously did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
