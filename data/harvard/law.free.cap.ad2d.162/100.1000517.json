Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that it sustained damages in the form of $322,140 in premiums paid as a result of defendants\u2019 procurement of worthless excess insurance is sufficient as a matter of law <em>(see generally, </em>20 Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 11276 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s cause of action seeking declaratory judgment relief presents a justiciable controversy. Declaratory judgment is available under the circumstances presented because plaintiff has demonstrated that potential liability may extend into the coverage contracted for <em>(see, e.g., Cabrini Med. Center v KM Ins. Brokers, </em>142 AD2d 529, <em>appeal dismissed </em>73 NY2d 785; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v LiMauro, </em>103 AD2d 514, <em>affd </em>65 NY2d 369). Concur\u2014Murphy, P.
