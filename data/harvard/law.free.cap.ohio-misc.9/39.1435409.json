Be it resolved: that reference is made to our recent meeting regarding the vacation of two township roads, Bed-ford Township Boad No. 367 and Salisbury Township Boad 78, which intersect with proposed Boute 33 improvements in Meigs County. After much deliberation and consultation with various responsible citizens of Meigs County, it is our opinion that we do not wish to vacate the above township roads. We sincerely hope that you will concur in this opinion. Motion by Mr. Clark, seconded by Mr. Karr. On roll call, McElhinny, Yea, Karr, Yea, Clark, Yea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Briefly, plaintiffs contend the foregoing constitutes <em>res </em>judicata, on the basis of which they are entitled to permanently enjoin the commissioners \u201cfrom further attempting to vacate said road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Plaintiffs say that the action so recorded was taken upon a certain petition of P. E. Masheter, director of highways, authorized under Section 5553.041, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It appears from the evidence taken upon trial of this lawsuit, that the director\u2019s petition was received in the office of the board on March 8, 1966. The sole action taken by the commissioners was such as disclosed by the aforesaid entry of March 21, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">This being so, plaintiffs must fail in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The General Assembly enacted Section 5553.041, Revised Code, to aid the state highway director in the construction of modern highways. An arterial system adequate for the lifeblood of Ohio commerce is one demand made at every session of our lawmakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">It was not without reason that this law requires the county commissioners to proceed in the same manner as is mandatory in the case of a petition presented by twelve freeholders of the county residing in the vicinity of the proposed improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Is it not significant that Section 5553.01, Revised Code, defines an improvement as including any \u201cvacation\u201d of a public road or part thereof?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Reconciliation of all of the provisions of Sections 5553.04 to 5553.11, inclusive, Revised Code, compels one to conclude that the law contemplates a public view and a public hearing to enable the commissioners to dispose of a road matter with an order approaching <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Public, because roads and highways, safety of their construction, adequacy for intended and indicated traffic, are matters of public convenience and necessity. Public, because Section 5553.05, Revised Code, requires the commissioners to give notice of the time and place of the view and the final hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">This court holds that mere \u201cdeliberation and consultation with various responsible citizens\u201d is not a lawful substitute for the mandatory procedure commissioners must afford petitions by the state highway director, when he is of \u201cthe opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>it is in the public interest to vacate a public highway or portion thereof under the jurisdiction of the county commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">One might deduce that the objector (the evidence discloses only one) to the vacating of Bedford Township Eoad No. 367 was permitted to deliberate with the commissioners (the entry recites this) as well as enjoy the opportunity for private persuasion. Private not in the sense that it was secret, but in that objections were taken <em>ex parte </em>and not at a public hearing as provided by law. Surely the petition and opinion of the head of the state\u2019s multi-billion-dollar highway complex cannot be voided in the manner the record discloses.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Our lawmakers recognized that the vacation of lesser public roads or portions thereof would be in the public interest, and in order to obtain early construction of safe, modern highways went on to require that the commissioners \u201cact\u201d upon such petitions within thirty days. Does this imply they must conclude their action within that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">This court holds that the General Assembly deemed it expedient to include some requirement of early action, which is directory. The acceleration the assembly expressly desires does not eliminate the necessity for lawful procedure, nor does it invalidate the director\u2019s petition if action is not completed within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">There is another reason plaintiffs\u2019 action must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Again, our lawmakers deemed the petition of the state\u2019s highway director of such consequence, they enacted the further requirement that the commissioners could refuse to vacate only by showing such action by a proper resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">In what the plaintiffs say was a rejection on March 21,1966, of the director\u2019s petition, it is significant that the title reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u201cCommissioners Send Letter to John Dowler, Division Engineer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The words, \u201cBe it resolved\u201d are there. But they merely spread upon the minutes their letter in which they refer to some conversation they have had with the addressee, and advise him that after much deliberation and consultation with the objector the commissioners were of the opinion that they do not \u201cwish\u201d to vacate. They further wish or \u201chope\u201d that \u201cyou\u201d will concur in this opinion. The \u201cyou\u201d in this case being the recipient of their letter, Mr. Dowler, highway division engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>There is no reference to the petition of anyone. One must incorporate the title to identify the addressee, and it is his opinion the board hopes to change. There is no connotation of any action by the commissioners. On the contrary, by expressing their \u201chope that you will concur,\u201d they invite further communication and advice. The phrase shouts indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Be it that the March 21, 1966, entry was addressed to the director\u2019s petition! Nowhere can be found an expression of rejection. By inviting concurrence in the opinion or \u201cwish\u201d of the commissioners, the addressee is asked to assent, to consent, to accord in opinion, to agree, to acquiesce, to accommodate. Surely asking one to concur is not assigning a rejection, but is in fact making an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Equity regards substance and not form. Surely, the spreading upon the minutes (a phrase much used in parliamentary proceedings) of a letter the commissioners wished to send to Mr. Dowler, expressing an opinion, wish or hope, is not that proper resolution required by Section 5553.041, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">This very case demonstrates the wisdom of the lawmakers in requiring that there be an unequivocal rejection by proper resolution. The proviso immediately following allows the director to perfect an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, if his petition is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Was it contemplated that the director appeal from a proper resolution of rejection, or that the director appeal from a wish expressed in a letter to the division engineer? Taking one step further, must the director appeal from an appeal by the commissioners to the division engineer to concur?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Road matters demand that the commissioners consider public convenience and necessity. A proper resolution then would require some finding thereon, as well as an unequivocal decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">This court expressly holds that the letter of March 21,1966, addressed to Mr. Dowler, highway division engineer, does not meet the requirements of Section 5553.041, Revised Code. The vote of the commissioners to record it in the journal did not alter its substance nor dignify it in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">An entry may be prepared in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
