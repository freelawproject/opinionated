J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUo\">Defendant and appellant, Servando Arellano, appeals from the judgment entered following his conviction, by jury trial, for special circumstances murder (lying in wait), premeditated attempted murder, making criminal threats (5 counts), disobeying a restraining order (4 counts), and stalking, with firearm-use enhancement findings (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 190.2, subd. (a)(15), 664, 422, 273.6, 646.9, 12022.5, 12022.53).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sentenced to state prison for life without possibility of parole, plus 49 years and 8 months to life, he contends there was trial and sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The judgment is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rule of appellate review <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103]), the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Angelica Arellano married defendant Servando Arellano in 1997, when she was 17 years old. After having a son, they separated sometime around September 2001. Angelica ultimately went to live at her parents\u2019 house, on 81st Street, just before the Arellanos\u2019s second son was bom. Angelica lived with her parents until she was murdered on June 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Arellano\u2019s sister, Julissa, saw him assault Angelica several times. She once saw Arellano hit Angelica during an argument at a time when Angelica was pregnant. Arellano once hit Julissa in the face when she tried to prevent Arellano from striking Angelica. On another occasion, Angelica telephoned Julissa, said she and Arellano were fighting, and asked Julissa to take her to Julissa\u2019s house in Pasadena. Julissa did so. When Arellano telephoned to ask where Angelica was, Julissa lied and said she didn\u2019t know. But Arellano came over later that night and, when he discovered Julissa had lied, he pointed a gun at her and said, \u201cI should shoot you right now.\u201d Angelica managed to calm him down.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Angelica got a restraining order against Arellano in December 2001, but he continued to make threatening telephone calls. On April 4, 2002, police responding to Angelica\u2019s house found Arellano on the property in violation of the restraining order. On May 8, 2002, Angelica told police Arellano had accosted her in the parking lot of Southwest College, where she was a student, and said, \u201cJust wait until you\u2019re alone. I am not afraid to go to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Between May 13 and May 24, 2002, Arellano left a series of threatening messages on Angelica\u2019s phone machine. He said he was going to get a gun and kill her. Among his threatening statements were the following: \u201cI am going to catch you slipping when your [sic] not with the kids. . . . I\u2019ll catch you slipping, I\u2019ll catch you slipping when you by yourself, I am not stupid.\u201d \u201cI am right here by the 99 Cents Store. I\u2019ll wait for you in the mornings. I\u2019ll catch you in the morning, I\u2019ll catch you later on tomorrow or some other day.\u201d \u201cSo I am waiting for you tomorrow after you drop off Ernesto [their son] for school. I will just wait for you whenever I catch you.\u201d \u201cNext time I see you I am going to smoke your ass man.\u201d \u201c[L]ike I said, you are going to make me payments.\u201d \u201c[F]our people you really love in this world. They\u2019re going down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Sometime between May 31 and June 1, 2002, Angelica\u2019s car was vandalized, and she believed Arellano had done it.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">When Angelica started working at a Staples store in February 2002, she told the manager, Karen Rutherford, about the restraining order and her domestic situation. Arellano sometimes showed up at the store looking for Angelica and, in late May, he was verbally abusive when Rutherford told him Angelica would not be working that day. On May 28, Angelica got upset when Arellano called her at the store, so Rutherford said she would take Arellano\u2019s calls. When he called back and asked to speak to Angelica, Rutherford said she was unavailable. Arellano reacted by threatening to kill Rutherford and all her employees. Rutherford testified Arellano \u201csaid if I don\u2019t start cooperating with him he is going to come down and shoot me and everybody else.\u201d Rutherford was scared and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">On June 7, 2002, Angelica and her sister Daisy went to the movies. Angelica gave Daisy her cell phone, which Daisy wore on her left hip. While they were waiting for the movie to start, Arellano left messages on Angelica\u2019s cell phone. Angelica and Daisy listened to one message in which Arellano complained about not being able to see his children and about Angelica going out with other men. Arellano said, \u201cJust wait until I get my turn though,\u201d and \u201cYour time is coming though man. Your time is coming.\u201d Arellano had called Angelica\u2019s house earlier that night and asked to speak to his son. When Angelica\u2019s mother refused, Arellano responded by saying \u201che was going to kill [Angelica].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The movie ended about 11:30 p.m. Angelica and Daisy arrived home shortly after midnight. Daisy testified she did not see anyone on the street when Angelica turned onto 81st Street, entered the driveway and parked. They talked for a few minutes. Daisy did not see anyone in the driveway area during that time. Just as she and Angelica were opening the car doors, Daisy heard three loud noises. She shut her eyes. When she opened them, she saw that the cell phone on her hip had exploded and that Angelica\u2019s face was covered with blood. Angelica had sustained three gunshot wounds, two of which, one to the face and one to the chest, were fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Francisco Perez, who lived across the street from Angelica\u2019s house, had been sitting by his front window that night. He initially saw Arellano walking back and forth about 20 minutes before Angelica and Daisy returned from the movie. Perez saw Angelica drive up. He saw Arellano approach the car, go up to the driver\u2019s side door and start shooting. Arellano then fled on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>Pedro Rodriguez had once worked at a restaurant with Arellano. The day after Angelica was murdered, Arellano called and asked for a place to stay. Although Rodriguez refused, Arellano showed up saying he had no place to go. Rodriguez put him up for one night and then checked him into a motel. Rodriguez later discovered that a bag Arellano left behind had a gun in it, and he notified the police. After his arrest, Arellano called Rodriguez from jail several times and insisted that Rodriguez visit him. When Rodriguez refused, Arellano indicated he wanted to use Rodriguez as an alibi. Rodriguez testified Arellano said if Rodriguez refused to cooperate, \u201chis homies was going to smoke me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\"><em>A </em>housekeeper who worked at the former Days Inn in Long Beach recognized Arellano as someone she had seen at the hotel several times. In 2002, she saw him with a woman and a little child. Estela Mendoza also worked at the Days Inn in Long Beach. She had seen Arellano two or three times in 2002. She did not recall ever seeing Arellano with a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">1. The lying-in-wait special-circumstance statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">2.

There was insufficient evidence to support the verdict of premeditated attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">4. Imposition of consecutive sentences on counts 6, 10 and 11 violated section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">5.

An incorrect sentence was imposed for the premeditated attempted murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">7. A parole revocation fine was improperly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">8. An aggravated term was imposed in violation of the <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">1. <em>Lying-in-wait special-circumstance statute is constitutional.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">\n<em>2. Sufficient evidence of lying-in-wait special circumstance.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Arellano contends there was insufficient evidence to sustain the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">\u201cIn assessing a claim of insufficiency of evidence, the reviewing court\u2019s task is to review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] The federal standard of review is to the same effect: Under principles of federal due process, review for sufficiency of evidence entails not the determination whether the reviewing court itself believes the evidence at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but, instead, whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] The standard of review is the same in cases in which the prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cAlthough it is the duty of the jury to acquit a defendant if it finds that circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence [citations], it is the jury, not the appellate court[,] which must be convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2018 \u201cIf the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">One element of the lying-in-wait special circumstance is that the victim be taken by surprise, even if the victim is aware of the murderer\u2019s presence. Arellano argues Angelica could not have been taken by surprise because \u201che had forewarned her for months on end that he was going to \u2018smoke her\u2019 and that he would go anywhere to accomplish his mission. The telephone calls and harassment were non-stop. He even called her that night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>on the cell phone [and] complained about her mother not allowing him access to their children and how she was going to get \u2018hers.\u2019 \u201d Arellano argues he \u201cwas hell bent on killing Angelica and she knew it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The Attorney General replies: \u201c[Fallowing appellant\u2019s analysis, anyone who has made any prior threats to a potential victim would not be accountable for murder by means of lying in wait and would insulate himself. This could not be the state of the law. Clearly, the focus is on the element of surprise and the defendant\u2019s conduct and intent at the time of the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We agree. While a victim of domestic violence and continuing death threats might well suspect she will be attacked sometime in the future, she has no way of knowing exactly when or where that attack will occur. The very fact Arellano <em>repeatedly </em>told Angelica her death was imminent tended to dilute the effect of those warnings. Indeed, Daisy testified Angelica pointedly refused to curtail such activities as going to the movies in the face of Arellano\u2019s continual death threats. We conclude Arellano\u2019s death threats did not negate the surprise element of lying in wait.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Another element of the lying-in-wait special circumstance is that the murderer act by means of concealment. Arellano argues there was insufficient evidence of concealment because he was seen on the street shortly before the murder by Angelica\u2019s neighbors. However, \u201cphysical concealment from, or an actual ambush of, the victim is not a necessary element of the offense of lying-in-wait murder. <em>(People v. Sutic </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 483, 492 [261 P.2d 241] [concealment in ambush unnecessary]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuthill </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 92, 100-101 [187 P.2d 16] [victim aware of defendant\u2019s physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>presence prior to attack]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Byrd </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 200, 208-209 [266 P.2d 505] [defendant waited for four hours in front of his former wife\u2019s home, entered it, conversed with her, and shot her]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sassounian </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 361, 407 [226 Cal.Rptr. 880] [concealment of defendant\u2019s purpose is sufficient] ....)[!]... HI] \u25a0 \u2018The concealment which is required, is that which puts the defendant in a position of advantage, from which the factfinder can infer that lying-in-wait was part of the defendant\u2019s plan to take the victim by surprise. [Citation.] It is sufficient that a defendant\u2019s true intent and purpose were concealed by his actions or conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 527, 554-555 [257 Cal.Rptr. 64, 770 P.2d 244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The evidence demonstrated Arellano was watching and waiting for Angelica to return home, that he was lurking close to her house and, after she drove up, that he approached and started shooting while Angelica was still sitting in the car. Arellano\u2019s phone message at 9:30 p.m. the night of the murder contains apparent references to the birthday party being held for his sister\u2019s child at Angelica\u2019s house that day, and to the fact Angelica went out with Daisy, leaving the children with her mother.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">These comments raised the inference Arellano had been watching the house that day. Perez\u2019s testimony shows Arellano was lurking around Angelica\u2019s house 20 minutes before Angelica and Daisy returned from the movie, and that after the car pulled up he approached and shot Angelica before she got out. Daisy testified she did not see anyone in front of the house as the car drove up the street; nor did she see anyone walk up to the car as it sat in the driveway. Daisy was unaware there was any danger until she heard the gunshots. There was sufficient evidence of concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">3.-8.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The judgment is modified to reflect a sentence of life, rather than life without possibility of parole, for the premeditated attempted murder conviction (count 2). As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting this change and forward it to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Kitching, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 27, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-11\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1088.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\"> \u201c[I]n domestic violence cases, decisions to kill are often made quickly and often there are long-standing emotional issues involved. In such situations, murders are not always planned long in advance and executed pursuant to a preexisting plan. Nevertheless, where a defendant makes a decision to kill, conceals his purpose, watches and waits, and takes the victim by surprise, the murder was accomplished by means of lying in wait.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Lujan) (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1128 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 320]; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Downs </em>(8th Cir. 1995) 56 F.3d 973, 977 [rejecting defendant\u2019s argument his history of domestic violence toward murder victim precluded any inference of premeditation from fact he brought guns to the murder scene: \u201cEssentially, Downs argues that because he made violent threats against [the victim] with guns in the past, the district court can only infer from the evidence an intention to make further violent threats. We reject this contention as meritless. Among other things, such a rule would shield all habitual batterers and abusers from prosecution for first-degree murder. However common, repeated acts of domestic violence cannot inoculate a defendant against the inference that the careful preparation of firearms signaled an intent to commit murder.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\"> In his phone message Arellano said, \u201cSo you are over there getting our party on right.
