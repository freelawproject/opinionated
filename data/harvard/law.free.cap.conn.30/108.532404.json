The plaintiff objected to the admission of the evidence, on the ground that the defendant, being executor in his own wrong when the judgment was rendered, could not exonerate himself from liability to pay the judgment by such subsequent proceedings. The court sustained the objection, ruled out the evidence, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff, upon which the defendant moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-5\"><em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Orton, </em>in support of the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANp\">cited <em>2 </em>Greenl.

But in the form in which this suit is brought it appears to be a novelty, and there is obviously no necessity for such an action. The judgment must, in substance, be against the assets in the executor\u2019s hands, as was the case with the first judg\u00ed\u00fcent; and these of course could be reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>by the first as easily as by a subsequent judgment, and in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We need not however determine whether the action will lie, because we are satisfied that there is another good defense to the suit. The defendant, since the former judgment was rendered, has had administration ' granted to him on the estate, which he represented to be insolvent, and it has been regularly settled, and the assets have all been administered and exhausted. But it is said this is no defense, because he was rendered liable in the former suit as executor in his own wrong. We think this result does not follow. On the contrary, it seems to be well settled that an executor in his own wrong may always plead that he has fully administered. G-reenleaf so states the law, and refers to <em>Mountford </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>4 East, 441, and other cases in which it has so been held ; and Williams in his book on Executors, vol. 1, p. 144, says, speaking of such an executor, \u201c If he pleads properly he is not liable beyond the extent of the goods which he has administered.\u201d See also 1 Wms. Saund., 265, note 2, to the same effect. If this action can be sustained at all it must be upon the same principles which would have applied to the first suit. The plaintiff ought not to be suffered to gain any advantage by bringing a needless suit. But by omitting to proceed by <em>scire facias, </em>or in some other mode to obtain satisfaction out of the assets under his first judgment, he ought at least to be held to waive any advantage, if indeed he would be entitled to any under our practice, which perhaps he might have claimed, by the priority of his judgment to the defendant\u2019s taking out administration and settling the estate. On this ground therefore we think a new trial should be granted, and as this defense must necessarily end the case, it is unnecessary to consider any other point made in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
