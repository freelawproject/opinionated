The object of the testator, as expressed by the will, was \u201c the promotion of education and science among the Indian and African children and youth of the United States or elsewhere.\u201d He has provided three modes to secure the object he had in view, in either of which the trustees may expend the bequest as they may choose. 1st. They may \u201c use the principal, and educate a number of children and youth, and thus prepare them for immediate usefulness, &amp;c.,\u201d or 2d, <em>\u201c </em>use the annual interest and educate a smaller number, and thus continue,\u201d or 8d, \u201c use the whole amount and build an academy, &amp;c.\u201d The two first modes do not point out what children and youth or what number are to be educated, or what kind or amount of education is to be given them. To carry into effect the second would require the powers of a corporation. The third mode is still more objectionable. When the academy is finished what shall be done with it, and who shall receive the benefits of it, and who shall take care of it ? The duties of the trustees would be ended when they had expended the \u201c whole amount \u201d of money, and of course their powers would be ended. The will gives the trustees no discretion except to select which they think best of the three modes specified, and, if it did, how could they exercise it ? How could they tell when a child or youth'was \u201c prepared for usefulness ?\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>22 Conn., 31. But if only one of the three modes is void, all are void. Further, the power attempted to be given to the trustees to appoint their successors is void, because no testator can create a board of trustees with corporate powers. It being so, there would be a failure of trustees on the death or resignation of those named in the will, which could not be supplied by a court of chancery, since they are to have discretionary powers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Giddings, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANC\">cited <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>8 Conn., 50 ; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>2 Barb., 230 ; <em>Loscomb </em>v. <em>Wintringham, </em>7 Eng.

But in both these particulars we think the will is clear of objection. As to the objects of the charity, what can be more unambiguous and certain than the language of the will\u2014\u201c in trust for the promotion of education and science among the Indian and African children and youth of the United States of America;\u201d and as to the manner of doing it, what more clear than the provision that it shall be done \u201c as in their (the trustees\u2019) judgment they shall deem best.\u201d The class is certain and the individuals to be selected from it may be made as certain by the election of the trustees. Were no mode of selection pointed out in the will there might be force in the objection; but there is a mode. The beneficiaries are to be selected by the trustees, and when selected are to enjoy the charity in greater or less proportions from year to year, or in such form as the trustees may think best. The will has nothing of that indefiniteness as to its object or as to the mode of its execution which has defeated charitable bequests in the cases read to us on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The law on this subject is, we suppose, well settled in this state, (though somewhat different from what it is in England, under the doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>which prevails in their court of equity,) requiring certainty in the persons.to be benefited, and an ascertained mode of selecting them if they are to be taken from a definite class. Here they are to be selected by the trustees, who are, by the provisions of the will, invested with most ample powers for that purpose; a sacred regard to the wishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of tlie testator being the only restriction or limitation imposed. See the case of <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>8 Conn., 48, and the elaborate discussion of the question in the case of <em>The American Bible Society v. Wetmore, </em>17 Conn., 182, which last was the case of a devise to an unincorporated society. In <em>White </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>22 Conn., 53, the same general doctrine will be found. There a certain clause of the will of the late Judge Hitchcock was attacked, on the ground of its indefiniteness as to the mode of selecting the objects of his bounty. He had provided in his will no way of selecting the beneficiaries from a class, and the court held that they could not, even as a court of equity, do it for him. Had that power been given to his executors or trustees the clause in the will would have been sustained, and Judge Hitchcock would not have been disappointed in his benevolent purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">It was said on the argument, that as these trustees are not a body corporate, and have no legal successors except so far as they may be appointed from time to time by the. trustees, the trust may fail for the want of persons to uphold the title. But this is not so. This court held the contrary in the case of <em>American Bible Society </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>before referred to, and such is the doctrine of the books. A trust never fails for the want of a trustee. If need be equity will provide one ; and beyond that the legislature will grant its aid. This is especially so in the case of public charities, as to which the statute of 1702 has interposed and given-them perpetuity, as much so as the statute of 43 Elizabeth would be held to have done in the English court of chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">For these reasons we advise the superior court to affirm the judgment of the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
