He then brought a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-6\">Graves, with whom was <em>Giddings, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">The declaration does not contain or set forth any cause of action. The words uttered are not slanderous in law. No crime is imputed to the defendant in error as the words are laid in the declaration; the charge is merely that the plaintiff had set fire to and burnt his factory. If the words used can be fairly construed in an innocent sense they are to be so construed, and if they were spoken in any other sense, when upon their face they are not slanderous and actionable <em>per se, </em>the pleader must set forth that fact by an appropriate colloquium, and then the office of an inuendo will become operative. In this case no such colloquium appears in the declaration. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hungerford, </em>4 Gill <em>&amp; </em>Johns., 402. <em>Chaplin </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, </em>2 Harris &amp; Johns., 247. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>2 N. Hamp., 398. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>16 Pick., 1. <em>Bloss </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>2 id., 320. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>2 Gilm., 720. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Nichols </em>v. Packard, 16 Verm., 83. The authorities and precedents are all agreed in defining the office of an inuendo to be simply to explain what is ambiguous, but not to <em>extend the force of language. </em>Nothing laid by an inuendo is put in issue, because it is not traversable except as it is connected with a proper colloquium. See the cases cited above.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-5\"><em>Hubbard </em>and <em>S. W. </em>Kellogg, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">The declaration is sufficient. The charge of burning the building of another is a direct charge of a crime, made so by our statute, and it needs no colloquium to support it. Here the charge is still stronger ; the charge is that Bishop <em>set the building on fire. </em>This language applied to burning another\u2019s building can only mean a willful burning, in the natural and popular meaning of the words. 1 Hilliard on Torts, 265, 6, 402, 405. <em>Tindall </em>v. Moore, 2 Wils., 114. <em>Slowman </em>v. <em>Dut</em>ton, 10 Bing., 402. <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Root, </em>7 Foster, 69. The words are not as a matter of course to be taken <em>in mitiori sensu. Case </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>15 Wend., 327. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>19 id., 296. If there is any defect here for want of a colloquium, it is cured by verdict. The jury have found its meaning. 1 Hilliard on Torts, 405.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b91-7\">Sanford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK\">The offense which the plaintiff claims the defendant imputed to him by the words laid in the declaration, is the one made punishable by statute. Rev. Stat., title 6, sec. 35. That statute provides that \u201c every person who shall willfully burn any ship or other vessel, any office, store, shop, warehouse, mill, distillery, brewery or manufactory,\u201d Ac., \u201c the same being the property of another, shall suffer imprisonment,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">T\u00cdie defendant contends that the words laid in the declaration do not per <em>se </em>impute to the plaintiff any offense, and that there are in the declaration no sufficient allegations or averments of fact to show that they were intended or understood to charge such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The words laid do not indeed charge the offense in the very language of the statute, but the plain and natural import of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>them, the idea they were calculated to convey to those who heard them, is, we think, that the plaintiff had willfully and maliciously burnt the factory alluded to, and the court is bound to understand the worlds as the rest of mankind understand them. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>9 State Trials, 710. <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Brittlebank, 4 B. &amp; </em>Ad.630. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>Cowp., 672. <em>Peake </em>v. <em>Oldham, </em>Cowp., 278. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Woolcott, </em>3 Cow., 239. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>9 East, 95. <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>8 Wend., 577. <em>Bloss </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>2 Pick., 328. Tested by this rule, the words which the jury have found were uttered by the defendant do, in our judgment, upon their face impute to the plaintiff the offense claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In the second count it is averred that the defendant uttered and published, of and concerning the plaintiff, these words:\u2014 \u201c We know that our building was set on fire, there is no doubt in our minds, we are satisfied Bishop did it. We are as well satisfied that Bishop burnt our factory as we are of any thing we did not see with our own eyes. I am as well satisfied that Bishop burnt our factory as I am of any thing I did not see with my own eyes. I am well satisfied that he burnt our fac tory. He set fire to David Shelton\u2019s barn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">From this recital of the defendant\u2019s language is it possible to entertain a doubt as to the defendant\u2019s intention to Charge the plaintiff with j;he willful burning of the defendant\u2019s factory ? or that that was the idea which his words were calculated to convey to the minds of those who heard them ? Is this the language of one whose building has been burnt by accident or in consequence of another\u2019s negligence, of one who is lamenting his misfortune, rather than giving utterance to his indignation ? Why was the charge of setting on fire and of burning so many times repeated ? And why those emphatic expressions of the convictions of the defendant and of his partners in relation to it ? And why the direct charge that the plaintiff set fire to David Shelton\u2019s barn ? If the defendant intended to impute negligence or inadvertence rather than crime, why did he not accompany his charges with some intimation tending to that conclusion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">To set on fire or burn a building, according to the natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>meaning and popular acceptation of the terms, implies an active agency in the party setting on fire or burning, as well as the concurrence of his will in the act performed. A fire originating in accident or negligence can with no propriety be, and seldom or never is, said to be set by any one. A building burnt by accident seldom or never is said to be set on fire, nor is it said to be burnt by human agency or action.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We think it clear that the plain and natural import of the words was, that the plaintiff had willfully set on fire and burnt the defendant\u2019s factory ; that that was the idea they were calculated to convey to the minds of those who heard them, and that the hearers must have so understood them.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">But that this is the sense in which the words were uttered, and intended to be understood, is settled by the verdict of the jury. In the introductory part of the count it is averred that the defendant intended to subject the plaintiff to the penalties of the law for burning buildings, and, after the recital of the words uttered, it is also averred by way of inuendo that the defendant meant that the plaintiff had <em>maliciously </em>set on fire and burnt said factory, and these averments the jury have found true. Now the law affixes no penalty to the accidental or even the careless burning of a building; but to set on fire and burn a building <em>maliciously </em>is the very crime which the statute describes and punishes. It is the <em>willful </em>burning of such building. Malice is a wicked <em>intention </em>to do an injury. Bouvier Law Diet. \u201c Malice.\u201d 2 Chit. Crim. Law, 727. Maliciously is with deliberate intent to injure. <em>Webster\u2019s Diet. </em>\u201c Maliciously.\" See also <em>Case </em>v. <em>Bulkley, </em>15 Wend., 327; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>13 Verm., 42; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>16 Verm., 83; <em>McClaughry </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>6 Johns., 82. After verdict then, at any rate, this count must be holden good. Whether the first count is good or not we need not inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">There is no error in the record complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
