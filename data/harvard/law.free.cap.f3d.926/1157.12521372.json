BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In September 1983, William Kirkpatrick was arrested and subsequently tried and\n   convicted for robbing a Taco Bell restaurant in Burbank, California and for murdering two Taco Bell employees in the course of his robbery. He was 23 years old. The two victims, one of whom was 16 years old, were later found stuffed in a closet; both had been shot in the head, \"execution style.\" Because the California Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Kirkpatrick's Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   More relevant to Kirkpatrick's appeal is the procedural history of his case. After the guilt phase of Kirkpatrick's trial, the jury deliberated for five days. The jury found Kirkpatrick guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery. The jury also found that because Kirkpatrick was convicted of two murders and the murders were committed during the commission of a robbery and burglary, special circumstances existed under California Penal Code \u00a7 190.2 that rendered Kirkpatrick eligible for the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the penalty phase of Kirkpatrick's trial, the jury was tasked with deciding whether Kirkpatrick should receive the death penalty or a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20190.3\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 190.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The prosecution and defense had the opportunity to present aggravating and mitigating evidence to the jury to support their arguments regarding which sentence Kirkpatrick should receive. The prosecution presented aggravating evidence of Kirkpatrick's character and his other troubling actions. First, Stephen Thomas told the jury that when he was 16, Kirkpatrick became angry with him while they were drinking at a park after he refused to assist Kirkpatrick in a violent robbery. Thomas stated that Kirkpatrick dragged him to the park restroom, choked him, and tried to stick his head in a toilet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Another witness, Jacob De Binion, testified that when he was 17, he met Kirkpatrick in a Der Wienerschnitzel restaurant parking lot and accepted Kirkpatrick's invitation to drink beer in the back of a van. After having a few drinks together, De Binion testified that Kirkpatrick physically forced him to perform oral sex and kiss him and threatened to kill him if he refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, Shirley Johnson testified that Kirkpatrick left his calculator, bicycle, and projector at her house in late May 1983. Kirkpatrick attempted to retrieve his belongings from her house, but his calculator was nowhere to be found. Kirkpatrick subsequently made numerous phone calls to Johnson and threatened to \"do damage\" to her dogs, daughter, house, and herself if his calculator was not returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late June 1983, Johnson came home and found that her two dogs had been poisoned and temporarily paralyzed. Later, Kirkpatrick called Johnson to tell her that he had \"taken care\" of the dogs. Kirkpatrick's defense counsel objected to Johnson's testimony about Kirkpatrick's dog poisoning and property threats, and argued that making threats to property and poisoning dogs were not facts that may be considered as aggravating evidence under California Penal Code \u00a7 190.3, which permits the jury to consider only violent acts and threats of violence to people. The court overruled defense counsel's objection without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defense's mitigation presentation consisted solely of Kirkpatrick's testimony, in which he reasserted his innocence and said he aspired to be a writer. Kirkpatrick's lawyers spoke to his mother in preparation for the mitigation presentation and told the court that she would be \"very,\n   very helpful to the defense,\" but Kirkpatrick ordered his lawyers not to contact or present any family members as witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After both sides rested, the court instructed the jury. Relevant here, the court told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Evidence has been introduced for the purpose of showing that Defendant Kirkpatrick has committed the following acts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Oral copulation by means of force upon Jacob De Binion, age 17;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. An assault upon Stephen Eugene Thomas;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Making threatening telephone calls to Ms. Shirley Johnson;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Administering poison to animals;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Which involved the express or implied use of force or violence or the threat of force or violence. Before you may consider any such criminal acts as an aggravating circumstance in this case, you must first be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant Kirkpatrick did commit such criminal acts. You may not consider any evidence of any other criminal acts as an aggravating circumstance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In closing argument, the prosecutor noted the absence of mitigating factors from Kirkpatrick's presentation. He urged the jury to impose the death penalty because the aggravating evidence outweighed the mitigating evidence. He also relied heavily on the dog poisoning incident to highlight Kirkpatrick's character:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We brought in Shirley Johnson. Shirley Johnson committed the crime of having the defendant's calculator and he wanted the calculator back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   So what did the defendant do? The defendant made a series of threatening phone calls. \"I will get you; I'll get your dogs and I'll get your children. Your daughter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The next day or a few days later, Mrs. Johnson came home and her dogs were paralyzed. A few days later she gets a phone call from Mr. Kirkpatrick.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"I have taken care of your dogs. You and your daughter are next. Give me back my calculator.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   What does it show you about Mr. Kirkpatrick? It shows you he is a man who has callousness, a callous disregard for the feelings of other people. This person who is absolutely amoral and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He will go so far as to poison Mrs. Johnson's dogs to get his calculator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The prosecutor continued: \"With the Johnsons, he had a choice. He had a choice to leave [them] alone and get his calculator back some other way: but he chose to poison the dogs and to make threats. ... Mr. Kirkpatrick is here right now because of choices he made. ... I would ask you to think about that when you think about pity, when you think about sympathy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At closing argument, Kirkpatrick told the jury that he had not received a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argued that his attorneys failed to call certain witnesses and ask specific questions. He said he was \"frightened\" and \"mad\" that prosecutors were sending an innocent person to jail. He also told jurors that he did not blame them for finding him\n   guilty and that he would have done the same thing if he had been in their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Prosecutors rebutted Kirkpatrick's closing argument by suggesting that Kirkpatrick was \"an anarchist\" and that his only contribution to society was \"to inflict havoc, pain and suffering on innocent people.\" The prosecution reminded the jury that Kirkpatrick made deliberate choices to kill two Taco Bell employees; to force Jacob De Binion to perform oral sex and kiss him; to assault Stephen Thomas after he refused to help him with a violent burglary; and to threaten Shirley Johnson, her daughter, and her dogs to retrieve his calculator. The prosecution concluded by stating that because the aggravating factors \"so far outweigh anything in mitigation,\" the jury \"shall impose the penalty of death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The jury began its penalty deliberations on June 19, 1984. Several hours into deliberating on June 20, 1984, the jury sent a note to the court asking: \"[W]hat [are] the legal definitions for aggravating and mitigating circumstances as they apply to the instructions in making the determination of this sentence?\" The court responded that the jury members \"have been given all the legal definitions [they] need [and that] [a]ll other words have their common definitions.\" On June 21, 1984, the jury returned a death verdict for both murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At Kirkpatrick's sentencing hearing on August 14, 1984, Kirkpatrick moved to modify the verdict imposing the death penalty. The court reviewed the aggravating circumstances and stated that the only mitigating factors were Kirkpatrick's lack of prior felony convictions and his young age of 23. Because the court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed those in mitigation, it denied Kirkpatrick's motion to modify the verdict and imposed a sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Kirkpatrick's Direct Appeal and State Habeas Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 1988, Kirkpatrick filed an automatic direct appeal with the California Supreme Court as provided by the California Constitution. Cal. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 11, subsec. a. Kirkpatrick argued, in relevant part, that the trial court violated state law and his Eighth Amendment rights when it instructed the jury that it may consider evidence of Kirkpatrick's dog poisoning and property threats as aggravating circumstances in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. Specifically as to his Eighth Amendment argument, Kirkpatrick argued that allowing the jury to consider those facts violated the Supreme Court's \"narrowing\" requirement that a capital sentencing scheme must provide a \"meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\" He further argued that these statements \"were highly prejudicial\" and had \"minimal, if any, legal relevance to the important issue of whether the death penalty should be imposed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The California Supreme Court affirmed Kirkpatrick's conviction and sentence in a lengthy published opinion.\n   <em>\n    Kirkpatrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20818\">\n    30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n    874 P.2d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that evidence of Kirkpatrick's dog poisoning and property threats was admissible as a matter of state law because it showed the surrounding circumstances of Kirkpatrick's threats to harm Johnson's daughter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20818\">\n    30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n    874 P.2d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did, however, hold that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could consider evidence that Kirkpatrick threatened Johnson's property and poisoned her dogs as aggravating circumstances in determining whether to impose the death penalty because California Penal Code \u00a7 190.3 allows the jury to consider \"only those threats of violent injury that\n   are directed against a person or persons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20818\">\n    30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n    874 P.2d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It nevertheless found that the error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20818\">\n    30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n    874 P.2d at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to Kirkpatrick's Eighth Amendment argument, the court explained that California law performs its required narrowing at the eligibility phase, not the penalty selection phase of the trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20818\">\n    30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n    874 P.2d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, it held that the aggravating factors considered at the penalty selection phase are not relevant to whether the State's scheme adequately narrows the class of persons who receive the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the court found that Kirkpatrick's Eighth Amendment argument was \"founded upon a mistaken understanding of the purpose of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in [California's] death penalty scheme,\" it denied him relief on his Eighth Amendment claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20P.2d%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Kirkpatrick's Federal Habeas and State Habeas Exhaustion Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On January 18, 1996, nine days before his scheduled execution, Kirkpatrick initiated habeas proceedings in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On June 24, 1998, Kirkpatrick filed his federal habeas petition. The district court dismissed more than 20 of Kirkpatrick's claims as unexhausted but found good cause to stay his petition pending exhaustion of his claims in state court. Kirkpatrick subsequently filed a habeas petition to exhaust his claims in the California Supreme Court on December 30, 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While his state habeas exhaustion petition was pending, on July 23, 2000, Kirkpatrick sent a handwritten letter to the California Supreme Court, with an attached handwritten form titled, \"Waiver Form.\" His handwritten \"Waiver Form\" stated: \"I\n   <em>\n    do not\n   </em>\n   wish to proceed with my petition for writ of habeas corpus review in this matter. I wish the sentence and the judgement [sic] of execution in\n   <em>\n    People v. William Kirkpatrick Jr.\n   </em>\n   , 14-590144 to be carried out at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response, the California Supreme Court appointed Marin County Superior Court Judge Stephen Graham as a referee to determine whether Kirkpatrick was competent to waive his petition and whether his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. At first, Kirkpatrick cooperated. He appeared before the referee with his lawyers from the Federal Public Defender's (FPD) office for status conferences on four occasions in late 2000. Kirkpatrick was also evaluated by a court-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. McEwen, for two and a half hours. Following Dr. McEwen's examination, however, Kirkpatrick declined to take part in the process any further. He refused to be interviewed by three experts retained by the FPD, doctors Robert Weinstock, Xavier Amador, and Roderick Pettis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   He also refused to attend the referee's evidentiary hearing in March 2001. There, Dr. McEwen testified that Kirkpatrick was competent to waive his habeas petition and he had no \"mental disease, disorder or defect.\" She also opined that if Kirkpatrick decided to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition, his decision to proceed on his own and represent himself would be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Although the FPD-supplied experts did not have the opportunity to meet with Kirkpatrick in person, they reviewed Dr. McEwen's report and each testified that her conclusions were not adequately supported. However, each FPD expert also testified that he was not in a position to express a diagnostic conclusion as to Kirkpatrick's competence because he did not interview Kirkpatrick personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Referee Judge Graham credited Dr. McEwen's opinions over the FPD experts' opinions because he thought they were \"based upon extraordinary qualifications of training and experience, careful review of the available history, and perhaps the only substantial mental health interview Mr. Kirkpatrick has ever allowed.\" Based on Dr. McEwen's opinions and his interactions with Kirkpatrick, the referee concluded that Kirkpatrick had voluntarily requested to withdraw his state habeas exhaustion petition and was competent to do so. But because Kirkpatrick \"refused to engage in sufficient discussion\" with the referee to permit him to make a more specific determination, the referee fell short of concluding that Kirkpatrick's waiver was \"knowing\" or \"intelligent.\" The referee submitted his findings in a report to the California Supreme Court, along with the hearing transcripts, Dr. McEwen's written report, and copies of relevant exhibits, letters, and briefs. The California Supreme Court adopted the referee's conclusion that Kirkpatrick was competent to withdraw his state habeas exhaustion petition, but-differing from the referee's conclusion-also found that he \"made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed.\" As a result, the California Supreme Court summarily granted Kirkpatrick's request and dismissed his state habeas exhaustion petition as waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Back in federal court in December 2001, Kirkpatrick's lawyers filed an amended federal habeas petition, including the claims from his state habeas exhaustion petition that the California Supreme Court had deemed waived. Kirkpatrick then filed a pro se request to waive his amended federal petition. The district court, however, denied the request after Kirkpatrick again refused to participate in a competency evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After the state moved to dismiss the claims Kirkpatrick had waived in state court on grounds that such claims were unexhausted, Kirkpatrick argued that his waiver in the California Supreme Court was invalid because it was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The district court upheld the California Supreme Court's conclusion that the waiver in state court was valid, and it dismissed as unexhausted all the state claims in Kirkpatrick's amended federal habeas petition that had been part of his waived state habeas exhaustion petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In making this determination, the district court applied\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) deference to the California Supreme Court's finding that Kirkpatrick's waiver had been voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. It stated, \"Under [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) ], the decision of the California Supreme Court must be given deference, and cannot ... be reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   by this court.\" Rather, the district court noted that its \"power to review the decision of the California Supreme Court is extremely limited.\" Applying this highly deferential standard, the district court concluded that because \"there is evidence to support the conclusory findings of the California Supreme Court,\" its conclusion must be upheld. To be sure of its decision, the district court also conducted its own analysis and concluded there was evidence to support the California Supreme Court's finding of waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix 1. The court then concluded that \"[t]here has been no unreasonable determination of the facts or a decision contrary to, or involving an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\" As a result, the district court dismissed as unexhausted all the claims Kirkpatrick had presented in his state habeas exhaustion petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On June 9, 2011, Kirkpatrick filed a revised amended federal habeas petition\n   asserting the exhausted claims that had been presented to the California Supreme Court on direct appeal. In Claim 17(C) of his revised amended federal habeas petition, Kirkpatrick argued that allowing the jury to consider the facts that he poisoned Shirley Johnson's dogs and threatened her property during the penalty phase of his trial violated his Eighth Amendment right against arbitrary and capricious sentencing. Following the logic of the California Supreme Court, the district court interpreted Kirkpatrick's claim as directed to the narrowing requirement under California Penal Code \u00a7 190.2, and not to the choice of punishment under California Penal Code \u00a7 190.3. Like the California Supreme Court, the district court denied Kirkpatrick's Eighth Amendment claim on the theory that the special circumstances of California Penal Code \u00a7 190.2 -not the factors for penalty selection set out in \u00a7 190.3-perform the constitutionally required narrowing function. The district court further agreed with the California Supreme Court that any error of state law was \"harmless because the magnitude and circumstances of the underlying crimes were such that the result would not have been any different even if the objectionable evidence had not been admitted.\" The district court granted Kirkpatrick a certificate of appealability on Claim 17(C), and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Kirkpatrick's Eighth Amendment Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The district court certified only one issue for appellate review: Claim 17(C) of Kirkpatrick's revised amended federal habeas petition, regarding whether the jury's consideration of the facts that he threatened Shirley Johnson's property and poisoned her dogs at the penalty selection phase of his trial violated Kirkpatrick's Eighth Amendment right against arbitrary and capricious sentencing.

Under this factor, the jury could consider Stephen Thomas's testimony that when he was sixteen, Kirkpatrick dragged him to a park bathroom, choked him, and tried to stick his head in a toilet. Another witness, Jacob De Binion, testified that he once accepted Kirkpatrick's invitation to drink beer in the back of a van, and Kirkpatrick physically forced him to perform oral sex and kiss him and threatened to kill De Binion if he refused. Further,\n   even if the jury improperly considered the portions of Shirley Johnson's testimony referring to property threats and dog poisoning, Kirkpatrick does not challenge that the jury could consider that Kirkpatrick threatened to \"do damage\" to Johnson and her daughter if she did not find and return Kirkpatrick's calculator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   By contrast, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   mitigating evidence presented to the jury comprised Kirkpatrick's testimony explaining that he did not want to involve his family in his trial, reasserting his innocence, and noting that he aspired to be a writer and would write in prison if given the chance. In light of the substantial aggravating evidence presented in comparison to the minimal mitigation evidence, absent the improperly-considered facts, the jury still would have found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and therefore would have been\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to impose the death penalty.

We are tasked only with deciding whether Kirkpatrick has presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the California Supreme Court's finding that Kirkpatrick validly waived his state habeas exhaustion petition. Kirkpatrick offers several arguments why his waiver of his state habeas exhaustion petition was invalid, but none of his arguments provide clear and convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court's waiver determination was wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Kirkpatrick first argues that his handwritten letter to the California Supreme Court stating that he wished to withdraw his state habeas exhaustion petition is insufficient to constitute waiver because it does not demonstrate that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Along that same line, Kirkpatrick argues that his waiver was invalid because he was never questioned on the record about his decision, and without such a colloquy a factfinder could not determine whether his waiver was knowing and intelligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While Kirkpatrick's handwritten \"Waiver Form\" on its own is likely not enough to establish that he was competent to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition and that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, the California Supreme Court had other evidence before it when it determined Kirkpatrick's waiver was valid. After the referee concluded the evidentiary hearings, he submitted a written report to the California Supreme Court (along with the hearing transcripts, Dr. McEwen's report, and copies of other relevant records) containing substantial evidence that Kirkpatrick desired to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition. For example, in a colloquy with the referee when Kirkpatrick first participated in the proceedings, he was asked what he \"would like to accomplish at the bottom line in this process,\" to which Kirkpatrick responded, \"Competency and vacating of the appeal.\" During the same hearing, Kirkpatrick demonstrated that he understood the potential consequences of waiving his petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [Warden]: If he is raising an issue in the State Court that's not previously been exhausted, and you go to Federal Court and try to raise it, we can make a claim and the Federal Court buys that and says, \"You can't litigate that issue as good as you may think it is.\" It might limit your possibilities of what you can raise in Federal Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [Kirkpatrick]: I understand that my writ for exhaustion is already filed by the PD's office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   [Warden]: If you withdraw that, then it won't have the impact of doing the exhaustion because it will be withdrawn. There is a potential that when we go back to Judge Keller's courtroom and you withdraw it, you can't raise it there again. There is a possibility he might do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [Kirkpatrick]: I can appreciate that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [Warden]: So that means if you say, \"Gee, I changed my mind,\" he may say, \"Mr. Kirkpatrick, sorry, you can't raise it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [Kirkpatrick]: You are looking out there, Robert. Thanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At the end of the first hearing, Referee Judge Graham told Kirkpatrick that although it was \"only a preliminary observation ... I can tell you right now based upon what I have seen here today, I don't see that you have any mental or emotional limitations that would get in the way of your being a perfectly rational and intelligent participant in the litigation process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, Dr. McEwen, the only psychologist to interview Kirkpatrick personally, testified that she \"believe[d] he ha[d] the capacity\" to \"appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation.\" And she did not think Kirkpatrick was suffering \"from a mental disease, disorder or defect which may substantially affect his capacity\" to forgo rationally further litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Rather, Dr. McEwen thought Kirkpatrick's actions were part of a \"conscious, deliberate set of responses that provide him with a certain degree of pleasure. The reward being attention, slowing down of the process.\" She observed that Kirkpatrick's hope was to gain \"more and more control over his case\" through hiring different lawyers or representing himself. The referee asked Dr. McEwen, \"[A]ssuming that he has made the decision to proceed on his own and represent himself, was that a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decision of his?\" Dr. McEwen opined, \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Dr. McEwen's written report reiterated her \"medical opinion that [Kirkpatrick] shows no evidence of mental impairment which would diminish his capacity to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision\n   pertaining to his legal choices.\" Rather, \"[t]he clinical evidence suggests that he indeed made his decision to withdraw his petition in a conscious, goal-directed manner, free of any intervening mental illness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Kirkpatrick also argues that some of his statements to the referee and Dr. McEwen show that he did not want to withdraw his petition to expedite his execution. Rather, he argues that he wanted to exercise more control over his case, which he planned to do through firing his current counsel and then representing himself or hiring black lawyers, with the hope of obtaining a new trial to establish his innocence. On\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, that argument could provide a basis for considering whether Kirkpatrick's waiver was really knowing or intelligent. But under \u00a7 2254(e)(1), it does not amount to the clear and convincing evidence necessary to set aside the California Supreme Court's well supported factual findings. Kirkpatrick clearly desired more control over the proceedings, but that is not evidence that he did not understand or appreciate the consequences of his decision. We are bound by the California Supreme Court's factual conclusion, especially in light of the specific evidence from Dr. McEwen and Kirkpatrick himself that supports it. As to Kirkpatrick's claim that a colloquy on the record is required to validate a waiver, Kirkpatrick cites to no binding authority that a colloquy is required, particularly where the defendant refused to participate in court proceedings where a colloquy would have occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   we noted that courts \"have a measure of discretion in affording a hearing that is suitable in the circumstances\" when determining the validity of a petitioner's waiver. 378 F.3d at 894.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Kirkpatrick urges us to follow the Third Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Fahy v.

Second, Fahy expressly stated in his colloquy with the judge that he had not discussed all the issues pertaining to his waiver with his lawyers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court stated that this \"inadequate colloquy\" did not \"reveal that he had any knowledge whatsoever of the purpose of federal habeas corpus or its procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court emphasized that Fahy's equivocation-that he first filed a handwritten waiver form, then filed a signed affidavit stating he did not want to waive his appellate rights, and then changed his mind again and decided to waive further appellate and collateral proceedings-compelled its conclusion that Fahy's waiver was not knowing and voluntary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that this \"record of equivocation ... does not support an enforceable waiver,\" and thus proceeded to review the merits of Fahy's appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Fahy\n   </em>\n   differs from this case in several significant respects. First, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Fahy\n   </em>\n   where the court refused to consider evidence of coercion and was unbothered by Fahy's express statement that he had not discussed his case with his attorneys, Kirkpatrick makes no claim that the referee did not allow him or his counsel the opportunity to discuss whether his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. In fact, the opposite occurred: the referee engaged with Kirkpatrick to the extent he could, noting that it was a \"pleasure to talk to [him]\" at the first hearing. The court ordered a professional evaluation of Kirkpatrick's competency, and Dr. McEwen interviewed Kirkpatrick for two and a half hours. It was Kirkpatrick who refused to engage with the court and his lawyers after Dr. McEwen assessed his competency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, any \"procedural infirmity\" that occurred in Kirkpatrick's case was of his own making. Second, and most importantly, unlike the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Fahy\n   </em>\n   , Kirkpatrick never made any affirmative indication that he no longer wanted to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, he submitted a nearly identical waiver during his federal district court habeas proceedings. Even if Kirkpatrick's conduct of refusing to participate in the referee's evidentiary hearings\n   supports a counter-finding that he did not want to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition, it does not amount to clear and convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court's waiver determination was wrong. His refusal to participate after requesting the opportunity to withdraw his petition-a process he repeated in federal district court-is entirely consistent with Dr. McEwen's testimony that \"he has an agenda\" and is simply trying to manipulate the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, Kirkpatrick argues that his waiver was involuntary because evidence exists to suggest he wrote his \"Waiver Form\" under duress. Kirkpatrick notes that he wrote multiple letters to the state court asserting that he believed prison guards were trying to kill him, retaliate against him by withholding showers and food, and that the prison denied him medical attention, medication, legal documents, access to the library, and access to the prison yards. Kirkpatrick does not explain how these events influenced his decision to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition. Nonetheless, even if Kirkpatrick's letters to the state court exhibited evidence of duress, both Dr. McEwen and the referee, who talked to Kirkpatrick personally, determined that his waiver was voluntary. Kirkpatrick's assertions do not amount to clear and convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court's finding that Kirkpatrick's waiver was voluntary was wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   While we agree that the California Supreme Court's waiver finding was unconventional, ultimately the California Supreme Court was not bound to accept the referee's findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772313\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/37/1249/\">\n    37 Cal.4th 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20845\">\n    39 Cal.Rptr.3d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20P.3d%2049\">\n    129 P.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (2006). Kirkpatrick has not presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the California Supreme Court's finding that he validly waived his state habeas exhaustion petition. Thus, we presume its findings were correct, and affirm the district court's dismissal of Kirkpatrick's waived claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Because Kirkpatrick cannot show the jury's consideration of the facts that he poisoned Shirley Johnson's dogs and threatened her property had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury's decision to impose the death penalty, Kirkpatrick is not entitled to relief on his Eighth Amendment claim. Additionally, Kirkpatrick has not presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the California Supreme Court's finding that Kirkpatrick validly waived his state habeas exhaustion petition.

In contrast to the requirement during the narrowing phase that states must limit judges' and juries' discretion in determining who is eligible for the death penalty, the Court has stated that the selection stage requires only \"an\n    <em>\n     individualized\n    </em>\n    determination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.\"\n    <em>\n     Zant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195530\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/862/#p878\">\n     462 U.S. at 879\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195530\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/862/#p878\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2733\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    To the California Supreme Court and the federal district court, Kirkpatrick appears to have raised his Eighth Amendment argument only in context of the narrowing phase and not the penalty selection phase. Accordingly, the California Supreme Court and federal district court addressed Kirkpatrick's Eighth Amendment argument as one that alleged his rights were violated at the narrowing phase of his trial, not the penalty selection phase of his trial. But on appeal to this court, Kirkpatrick argues that independent of any narrowing that took place during the guilt phase of his trial to determine whether he was eligible for the death penalty, the jury's consideration of the facts that he threatened Johnson's property and poisoned her dogs at the penalty selection phase resulted in the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

Kirkpatrick argues that Dr. McEwen's testimony alone \"provided no reliable or reasonable basis for the state court to conclude that Kirkpatrick was competent to waive his [state habeas] exhaustion petition,\" particularly because the FPD's experts reviewed Dr. McEwen's testimony and found it to be flawed. Kirkpatrick admits, however, that the FPD's experts could not give definitive opinions because they did not interview Kirkpatrick in person.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    This argument is flawed. First, the referee could not force Kirkpatrick to attend the evidentiary hearings to determine his competency after Kirkpatrick refused to attend and answer questions. It follows logically that it would have been futile for the referee to order Kirkpatrick to submit to further examinations. And Kirkpatrick cites no authority to support the proposition that the referee was required to take any of these measures. Second, the referee acted reasonably in basing his competency determination on Dr. McEwen's testimony because he found that her opinions were \"based upon extraordinary qualifications of training and experience, careful review of the available history, and perhaps the only substantial mental health interview Mr. Kirkpatrick has ever allowed.\" Finally, even if the district court prematurely determined that Kirkpatrick was competent to waive his state habeas exhaustion petition, that certainly does not amount to clear and convincing evidence that the California Supreme Court's competency finding was wrong.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    We note, however, that where courts have previously found such waivers to be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, they have done so after the court questions the petitioner on the record regarding his intentions and whether he understands the consequences of the waiver.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Demosthenes v.
