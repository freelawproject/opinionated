BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   NEI Contracting and Engineering, Inc. (\"NEI\") was a longtime customer of concrete supplier Hanson Aggregates, Inc. (\"Hanson\"). Like Hanson's other customers, NEI placed orders for Hanson's products by calling into a dedicated telephone order line. The order line connected callers to a call directory system that allowed customers to route their call. Two of the potential routes were Hanson's \"Ready Mix Dispatch\" line and its \"Aggregate Dispatch\" line. Hanson recorded all customer calls that were directed to these two dispatch lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 15, 2009, Hanson began using an \"Oaisys Talkument\" phone system. When this system was in place, callers to the two dispatch lines heard a pre-recorded verbal admonition stating that calls \"may be monitored for quality assurance.\" It did not inform the caller that the call was being recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011 and 2012, NEI and Hanson litigated a billing dispute arising from orders NEI had placed using the dispatch lines. During that litigation, Hanson produced recordings of calls that NEI had placed to the dispatch lines. The litigation settled in May 2012 in Hanson's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 6, 2012, NEI initiated this suit against Hanson under California's Invasion of Privacy Act (\"CIPA\"). NEI's initial complaint alleged that Hanson had violated California Penal Code \u00a7 632, which prohibits the unauthorized connection to or recording of confidential communications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 29, 2013, NEI filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). The SAC abandoned the \u00a7 632 claim and instead brought a claim for relief under \u00a7 632.7, alleging that Hanson had recorded NEI's cell phone calls without its consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SAC alleged that Hansen had recorded at least 45 cell phone calls that NEI had placed to the dispatch lines. NEI sought $ 5,000 in statutory damages for each violation of the statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   injunctive relief, and class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 23, 2013, Hanson changed the recorded admonition on its dispatch lines. The updated recording stated that calls \"may be monitored\n   <em>\n    or recorded\n   </em>\n   for quality assurance purposes.\" Following\n   that change, NEI defined its proposed class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   All persons who called Defendant with a cellular telephone and selected the Aggregate or Ready Mix Dispatch lines through Defendant's telephone system, whose calls were recorded by Defendant, during the time period beginning July 15, 2009, and continuing through December 23, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hanson opposed certification, asserting that the proposed class would not meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) 's predominance requirement because there would need to be individualized determinations made as to whether each class member had consented to being recorded. The district court initially concluded that the predominance requirement was not satisfied, and denied class certification. NEI moved for reconsideration and provided new evidence regarding the timing of certain recorded conversations. Based on this information, the court certified the class. Following certification, however, Hanson identified nine customers who had actual knowledge of Hanson's recording practice during the class period and continued to place orders with Hanson. Hanson moved to decertify the class, citing these nine customers as evidence that Rule 23's \"commonality\" and \"predominance\" requirements were not satisfied. Concluding that the predominance requirement had not been satisfied, the district court decertified the class on May 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following decertification, NEI proceeded towards a bench trial on its individual claim with respect to 44 cell phone calls. Shortly before trial, the district court granted Hanson's motion in limine to preclude NEI's corporate representative from testifying about employees' knowledge of call recording as inadmissible hearsay. On the morning of trial, NEI informed the court that it would only be pursuing claims based on a single call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 15, 2016, the district court ruled against NEI on its statutory damages claim. The court also concluded that NEI lacked standing to seek damages on its individual claim or injunctive relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [I]n order to establish Article III standing, although it need not show actual damages, NEI must show that it \"suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inc. v.

Subsequently, the district court held that NEI lacked standing to bring its CIPA claim against Hanson.

As noted above, however, a class must be decertified when the class representatives are found to lack standing as to their individual claims.

NEI cites to two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that may permit a class representative to appeal a decertification decision even if the representative's individual claims have been mooted. First, it is well settled that a class representative whose individual claim has been mooted but who retains a \"personal stake\" in class certification may appeal a certification decision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Deposit Guar.

But because Lierboe \"had no stacking claim from the outset of her litigation,\" we held that the district court's certification of the class \"must be vacated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055518\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/1018/#p1022\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055518\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/1018/#p1022\">\n    at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1023 n.6. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court discussed the relationship between the second mootness exception and the doctrine of standing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [I]f mootness were simply \"standing set in a time frame,\" the exception to mootness for acts that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" could not exist. Standing admits of no similar exception; if a plaintiff lacks standing at the time the action commences, the fact that the dispute is capable of repetition yet evading review will not entitle the complainant to a federal judicial forum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p170\">\n    528 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p170\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p170\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (citations omitted). Accordingly, neither mootness exception stands for the proposition that a class can be certified if the class representative lacked standing as to its individual claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court concluded that NEI lacked standing and NEI has waived any argument to the contrary. Given the class representative's lack of standing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in decertifying the class. We affirm the district court's decertification order on this basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In relevant part, \u00a7 632 states: \"A person who, intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential communication, uses ...
