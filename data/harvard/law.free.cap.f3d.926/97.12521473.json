Pertinent here, the Department has asserted that the Eleventh Amendment renders it immune from suit in federal court with respect to two state claims, each pursued under Maryland's Fair Employment Practices Act (the \"FEPA\"). Consistent with previous District of Maryland rulings, however, the district court rejected the Department's assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity on the premise that the State waived such immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pense v. Md. Dep't of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:17-cv-01791 (D. Md. Apr. 30, 2018), ECF No. 19 (the \"Immunity Decision\"). The Department brought this appeal, seeking interlocutory review of the Immunity Decision. As explained below, in an exercise of our jurisdiction pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, we conclude that the State has not waived the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, and we therefore reverse and remand for the dismissal without prejudice of Pense's FEPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the operative Amended Complaint of November 3, 2017, Pense was an employee of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services for seventeen years. The Amended Complaint explains that, in April 2015, a female Department employee falsely accused Pense of sexual harassment. During an investigatory interview in June 2015, Pense disclosed to the Department that he is gay and HIV positive. Two hours later, the Department placed Pense on administrative leave. Within two weeks, and despite having determined that the female employee's sexual harassment allegation could not be sustained, the Department fired Pense. The state claims relevant to this appeal - the FEPA claims - relate Pense's discharge to sexual orientation discrimination (Count 2 of the Amended Complaint) and disability discrimination (Count 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 20, 2017, the Department moved to dismiss the FEPA claims on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds. By its Immunity Decision of April 30, 2018, the district court denied the Department's dismissal motion, relying on a line of prior District of Maryland decisions concluding that the State, through a statutory consent to suit provision, has waived sovereign immunity as to FEPA claims in the state and federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 11, 2018, the Department noted its appeal from the Immunity Decision, invoking this Court's jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. Three days later, on May 14, 2018, the Department filed a motion in the district court to stay that court's proceedings pending our decision and mandate. Pense opposed the stay request, contending that the district court could and should continue to actively entertain his claims because the Department's appeal is frivolous for lack of appellate jurisdiction. The district court rejected Pense's jurisdictional contention and entered a stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pense v. Md. Dep't of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:17-cv-01791 (D. Md. July 26, 2018), ECF No. 27 (the \"Stay Order\"). Notably, the Stay Order divulged that, since issuing the Immunity Decision, the district court had \"uncovered authority not previously cited\" by the Department suggesting that the State \"has a strong argument in support of not having waived [Eleventh Amendment] immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is firmly established that we possess jurisdiction for this interlocutory review of the Immunity Decision pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.R.

As\n   <em>\n    Royster\n   </em>\n   explained, \"[t]he Maryland legislature knows how to limit its waiver of sovereign immunity [to suit in state court]; it has simply chosen not to do so in the context of [FEPA] cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20State%20Gov%27t%20%C2%A7%2012-104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20State%20Gov%27t%20%C2%A7%2012-104\">\n    at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Of course, the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Royster\n   </em>\n   and similar District of Maryland rulings is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Atascadero\n   </em>\n   and other longstanding precedent of the Supreme Court. Again, that precedent imposes a \"stringent\" test for finding a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity that requires \"a clear declaration that [the State] intends to submit itself to [federal court] jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coll.

The failure of section 20-903 to satisfy the Supreme Court's stringent test has become apparent even to the district court, which, after issuing its Immunity Decision, conceded in its Stay Order that the State \"has a strong argument in support of not having waived [Eleventh Amendment] immunity, given that [ section 20-903 ] does not expressly waive immunity to suit\n   <em>\n    in federal court\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stay Order 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For his part, plaintiff Pense contends that section 20-903 waives Eleventh\n   Amendment immunity under this Court's 2012 decision in\n   <em>\n    Lee-Thomas\n   </em>\n   . There, we assessed whether a different Maryland statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Cts.%20%26%20Jud.%20Proc.%20%C2%A7%205-518\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), effectuated a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity. At the time of our decision, section 5-518(c) simply provided that \"[a] county board of education may not raise the defense of sovereign immunity to any claim of $ 100,000 or less.\" Nevertheless, we concluded that section 5-518(c) constituted a consent to suit in the state and federal courts, based on a decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland so holding upon its own application of the Supreme Court's stringent test. We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [W]here a state's highest court has applied the\n   <em>\n    Atascadero\n   </em>\n   stringent test and carefully scrutinized state law to determine whether a state statute effects a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, a federal court is obliged ... to defer to that state court decision. Indeed, we should defer to the decision of the state's highest court even when the statute, on its face, does not appear to pass the stringent test, because the whole point of that test, requiring a clear declaration\n   <em>\n    by the State\n   </em>\n   of its waiver, is to be certain that the State in fact consents to suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee-Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051534\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/244/#p247\">\n    666 F.3d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Significantly, Pense seeks to rely on\n   <em>\n    Lee-Thomas\n   </em>\n   without a controlling Maryland decision specific to section 20-903. In the circumstances, Pense is left to argue that we should defer to the Court of Appeals of Maryland's analysis of section 5-518(c) and rule that section 20-903 similarly waives Eleventh Amendment immunity. As we emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Lee-Thomas\n   </em>\n   , however, \"in the absence of a construction of the relevant state statute by the state's highest court,\" we must \"examine and decide the state law issue independently\" by applying the\n   <em>\n    Atascadero\n   </em>\n   stringent test ourselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee-Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051534\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/244/#p247\">\n    666 F.3d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And having fulfilled our duty to apply that test, we are constrained to conclude that section 20-903 does not constitute a consent to suit in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, we reverse the district court's denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity and remand for the dismissal without prejudice of Pense's FEPA claims, as well as such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In addition to the FEPA claims, the Amended Complaint alleges a federal disability discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Count 4) that remains pending in the district court.
