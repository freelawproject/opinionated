Although the case appears complex, the dispute between the Department of the Treasury and the taxpayer is relatively straightforward. The parties agree that, under the governing tax statute, the \"arm's length\" standard applies; but they disagree about how the standard may be met. The taxpayer argues that Treasury must employ a specific method to meet the arm's length standard: a comparability analysis using comparable transactions between unrelated business entities. Treasury disagrees that the arm's length standard requires the specific comparability\n   <em>\n    method\n   </em>\n   in all cases. Instead, the standard generally requires that Treasury reach an arm's length\n   <em>\n    result\n   </em>\n   of tax parity between controlled and uncontrolled business entities. With respect to the transactions at issue here, the governing statute allows Treasury to apply a purely internal method of allocation, distributing the costs of employee stock options in proportion to the income enjoyed by each related taxpayer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Our task, of course, is not to assess the better tax policy, nor the wisdom of either approach, but rather to examine whether Treasury's regulations are permitted under the statute. Applying the familiar tools used to examine administrative agency regulations, we conclude that the regulations withstand scrutiny. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Tax Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For many years, Congress and the Treasury have been concerned with American businesses avoiding taxes through the creation and use of related business entities. In the last several decades, Congress has directed particular attention to the potential for tax abuse by multinational corporations with foreign subsidiaries. If, for example, the parent business entity is in a high-tax jurisdiction, and the foreign subsidiary is in a low-tax jurisdiction, the business enterprise can shift costs and revenue between the related entities so that more taxable income is allocated to the lower tax jurisdiction. Similarly, a parent and foreign subsidiary can enter into significant tax-avoiding cost sharing arrangements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This potential for tax abuse is generally not present when similar transactions occur between unrelated business entities. In those instances, each separate unrelated entity has the incentive to maximize profit, and thus to allocate costs and income consistent with economic realities. However, among related parties, those incentives do not exist. Rather, among related parties, after-tax maximization of profit may depend on how costs and income are allocated between the parent and the subsidiary regardless of economic reality, given that after-tax profits are commonly shared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The concern about tax avoidance through the use of related business entities is not new. In the Revenue Act of 1928, Congress granted the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to reallocate the reported income and costs of related businesses \"in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any such trades or businesses.\" Revenue Act of 1928, ch. 852, \u00a7 45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Stat.%20791\">\n    45 Stat. 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806.

Reg. 86, art. 45-1(b) (1935). In the context of a controlled transaction, the arm's length standard is satisfied \"if the results of the transaction are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances (arm's length result).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.482-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.482-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Altera granted to Altera International a license to use and exploit Altera's preexisting intangible property everywhere in the world except the United States and Canada. In exchange, Altera International paid royalties to Altera. The parties agreed to pool their resources to share research and development (\"R&amp;D\") costs in proportion to the benefits anticipated from new technologies. The question in this appeal is whether Treasury was permitted, for tax liability purposes, to re-allocate the cost of employee stock-based compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Altera and the IRS agreed to an Advance Pricing Agreement covering the 1997-2003 tax years. Pursuant to this agreement, Altera shared with Altera International stock-based compensation costs as part of the shared R&amp;D costs.

Section 482 does not speak directly to whether the Commissioner may require parties to a QCSA to share employee stock compensation costs in order to receive the tax benefits associated with entering into a QCSA. Thus, there is no question that the statute remains ambiguous regarding the method by which Treasury is to make allocations based on stock-based compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Altera argues that the statute, by its terms, cannot apply to stock-based compensation. According to Altera, stock-based compensation is not \"transferred\" between parties because only preexisting intangibles can be transferred. Thus, for Altera, Treasury has exceeded the delegation of authority apparent from the plain text of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We are not persuaded. When parties enter into a QCSA, they are\n   <em>\n    transferring\n   </em>\n   future distribution rights to intangibles, albeit intangibles that have yet to be developed. Indeed, the present-day transfer of those rights provides the main incentive for entering into a QCSA. The right to distribute intangibles to be developed later is, itself, one right in the bundle of property rights that exists at the time that parties enter into a QCSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, even assuming that the crucial transfer does not occur contemporaneously, \u00a7 482 applies \"[i]n the case of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   transfer ... of intangible property\" that produces income. (Emphasis added.)

REP. NO. 99-841, at II-638 (1986) (Conf. Rep.). Put another way, Congress's objective in amending \u00a7 482 was to ensure that income follows economic activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722625\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/394/#p400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at II-637. Although the 1986 amendment delegates to Treasury the choice of a specific methodology to achieve that end, it suggested: \"In the case of any transfer (or license) of intangible property ..., the income with respect to such transfer or license shall be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.\" This standard is a purely internal one, that is, internal to the entity being taxed, and evidence supports Treasury's belief that Congress intended it to be. H.R. REP. NO . 99-426, at 423-35; H.R. REP. NO . 99-841, at II-637 (Conf. Rep.). In the QCSA context, Congress did not want to interfere with controlled cost-sharing arrangements, but only to the degree that the allocation of costs and income \"reasonably reflect[s] the actual economic activity undertaken by each.\" H.R. REP. NO. 99-841, at II-638 (Conf. Rep.). In light of this history, Treasury's decision to adopt a methodology that followed actual economic activity was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   So was Treasury's determination that uncontrolled cost-sharing arrangements do not provide helpful guidance regarding allocations of employee stock compensation. When it amended \u00a7 482 in 1986, Congress bemoaned the difficulties associated with finding and using data involving high-profit intangibles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. REP.

Indeed, Treasury echoed Congress's rationale for amending \u00a7 482 in the first place when it published the final rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    at 51,173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The uncontrolled\n   transactions cited by commentators do not share enough characteristics of QCSAs involving the development of high-profit intangibles to establish that parties at arm's length would not take stock options into account in the context of an arrangement similar to a QCSA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   What is more, although Altera suggests there can be only one understanding of the methodology required by the arm's length standard, historically the definition of the arm's length standard has been a more fluid one. Indeed, as we have discussed, for most of the twentieth century the arm's length standard explicitly permitted the use of flexible methodology in order to achieve an arm's length\n   <em>\n    result\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   H.R. REP. NO. 87-2508, at 18-19 (1962) (Conf. Rep.) (noting that, in 1962, Congress stated that Treasury should \"provide additional guidelines and formulas\" to achieve arm's length results). It is true that, more recently, an understanding that the primary means of reaching an arm's length result suggested the analysis of comparable transactions. But, in the lead-up to the 1986 amendments, Congress voiced numerous concerns regarding reliance on this methodology. Further, as we have discussed, courts for more than half a century have held that a comparable transaction analysis was not the exclusive methodology to be employed under the statute. In light of the historic versatility of methodology, it is reasonable that Treasury would understand that Congress intended for it to depart from analysis of comparable transactions as the exclusive means of achieving an arm's length result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In addition, Treasury reasonably concluded that doing away with analysis of comparable transactions was an efficient means of ensuring that \u00a7 482 would \"operat[e] to assure adequate allocations to the U.S. taxable entity of income attributable to intangibles in [QCSAs].\" H.R. REP. NO . 99-426, at 423. Congress expressed numerous concerns that pre-1986 allocation methods permitted entities to undervalue their tax liability by placing undue emphasis on \"the concept of comparables\" and basing allocations on industry norms, rather than on actual economic activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Doing away with analysis of comparable transactions, and instead requiring an internal method of allocation, proves a reasonable method of alleviating these concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In sum, Treasury reasonably understood \u00a7 482 as an authorization to require internal allocation methods in the QCSA context, provided that the costs and income allocated are proportionate to the economic activity of the related parties. These internal allocation methods are reasonable methods for reaching the arm's length results required by statute. While interpreting the statute to do away with reliance on comparables may not have been \"the only possible interpretation\" of Congress's intent, it proves a reasonable one.\n   <em>\n    Entergy Corp. v.

To support their position, they primarily discussed arm's length agreements in which unrelated parties did not mention employee stock options.

The legislative history of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 expressed Congress's intent to respect cost sharing arrangements as consistent with the commensurate with income standard, and therefore consistent with the arm's length standard, if and to the extent that the participants' shares of income \"reasonably reflect the actual economic activity undertaken by each.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R.

This assumption, however, overlooks Treasury's decision to do away with analysis of comparable transactions in the first place-a decision that was made clear enough by citations to legislative history in the notice of proposed rulemaking and in the preamble to the final rule. As discussed in our\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis, Treasury's conclusion that it could require parties to a QCSA to share all costs was a reasonable one. Thus, \"significant\" comments that required a response would have spoken to why this interpretation was not, in fact, reasonable, so that adopting the comments would require Treasury to change the regulation.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Specifically, as Treasury remarked, the submitted transactions did not \"share enough characteristics of QCSAs involving the development of high-profit intangibles\" to provide grounds for accurate comparison. Because of this lack of similar transactions, Treasury justifiably chose to employ methodology that did not depend on non-existent comparables to satisfy the commensurate with income test and achieve tax parity. In this way, the comments reinforced Treasury's premise for adopting the purely internal methodology, but were irrelevant to the underlying choice of methodology. Treasury did not err in refusing to examine them more rigorously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, we cannot find a failure in Treasury's refusal to consider comments that proved irrelevant to its decisionmaking process. Here, Treasury gave sufficient notice of what it intended to do and why, and the submitted comments were irrelevant to the issues Treasury was considering.

Because\n   <em>\n    Chenery\n   </em>\n   does not require agencies to provide \"exhaustive, contemporaneous legal arguments to preemptively defend its action,\" its references to the 1986 amendments provide an adequate ground for its determination.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Elec.

This argument misinterprets Treasury's position. Treasury asserted then, and still asserts in this litigation, that using an internal method of reallocation is consistent with the arm's length standard because it attempts to bring parity to the tax treatment of controlled and uncontrolled taxpayers, as does comparison of comparable transactions when they exist. Treasury's position was also consistent with its White Paper,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Treasury's interpretation in the 1994 regulation of the arm's length standard as result-oriented, rather than method-oriented, with the goal of achieving tax parity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.482-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.482-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Altera's argument is founded on its belief that an arm's length analysis always must be method-oriented, and rooted in actual transactional analysis. But the question before us is not which view is superior; it is whether Treasury's position in 2003 was incompatible with its prior position in promulgating the 1994 and 1995 regulations. As we have discussed, it was clear in 1994 and 1995 that, in implementing the commensurate with income amendment, Treasury was moving away from a purely method-based, comparable-transaction view of the arm's length standard in attempting to achieve tax parity.

As an accounting matter in the past, this issue may have been disputed. Indeed, at one point, \"[t]he debate on accounting for stock-based compensation ... became so divisive that it threatened the [Financial Accounting Standards] Board's future working relationship with some of its constituents.\" FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING FOUNDATION, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO . 123, at 25 (1995). However, as we will discuss, it is uncontroversial today. Since 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has supported treating stock options as costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.482-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Treasury's rulemaking process was sufficient. Treasury articulated why treating stock-based compensation as a cost led to arm's length results. It first noted that stock-based compensation is a \"critical element\" of R&amp;D costs for parties to a QCSA and noted that such compensation is \"clearly related to the intangible development area.\" Compensatory Stock Options Under Section 482 (Preamble to Final Rule),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. at 51,173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Logic supports these conclusions. Parties dealing at arm's length, as Treasury explained, would not \"ignore\" stock-based compensation if such compensation were a \"significant element\" of the compensation costs one party incurs and another party agrees to reimburse when developing high-profit intangibles.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Rather, \"through bargaining,\" each party would ensure that the cost-sharing agreement is in its best interest, meaning that the parties will consider the internal costs of stock compensation without requiring the other party to recognize those costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Though commentators presented evidence of some transactions in which stock-based compensation was not a cost, this evidence provided little guidance because it did not concern parties to a QCSA developing high-profit intangibles. This out-of-context data did not require a different decision. In the absence of applicable evidence, Treasury's analysis provides a logical explanation of how treating stock-based compensation as a cost leads to arm's length results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In addition, as we have noted, generally accepted accounting principles supported Treasury's conclusion, and Treasury cited generally to \"tax and other accounting principles\" for its determination that there is a \"cost associated with stock-based compensation.\" Compensatory Stock Options Under Section 482 (Proposed),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C997\">\n    67 Fed. Reg. at 48,999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One such principle is that a distinction exists between the economic costs of stock compensation-which are debatable-versus the accounting costs-which are not. Because entities account for the cost of providing employee stock options, it is reasonable for Treasury to allocate that cost. In light of these fundamental understandings, Treasury's reference to \"tax and other accounting principles\" provides a solid foundation for the Commissioner's interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Most notably, the Tax Code classifies stock-based compensation as a trade or business \"expense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20162\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

If the arm's length standard allows the Commissioner to allocate costs between related parties without a comparability analysis, there is no policy change, merely a clarification of the same policy. Further, as we have discussed, the policy change was occasioned by the congressional addition of the \"commensurate with income\" sentence in the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and the 1994 and 1995 implementing regulations. Those changes occurred well before 2003. The 2003 regulations\n   clarified, rather than altered, prior policy. And the enactment of a statutory amendment obviously makes a concomitant regulatory amendment appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   5\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Thus, the 2003 regulations are not arbitrary and capricious under the standard of review imposed by the APA. Treasury's regulatory path may be reasonably discerned. Treasury understood \u00a7 482 to authorize it to employ a purely internal, commensurate with income approach in dealing with related companies. It provided adequate notice of its intent and adequately considered the objections. Its conclusion that stock based compensation should be treated as a cost was adequately supported in the record, and its position did not represent a policy change under\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Altera also argues that the outcome of this case is controlled by our court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Xilinx.\n   </em>\n   We disagree.

Second, and more significantly, the\n   <em>\n    Xilinx\n   </em>\n   panel was faced with a conflict between two rules. If the rules were conceptually distinguishable, they were also in direct conflict. The arm's length rule, \u00a7 1.482-1(b)(1) (1994), listed specific methods for calculating an arm's length result.

Indeed, Congress left the first sentence of \u00a7 482 -the sentence that undisputedly incorporates the arm's length standard-intact. It merely added a second sentence providing that, \"[i]n the case of any transfer (or license) of intangible property ..., the income\n   with respect to such transfer or license shall be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.\" Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L.

The plain text of the statute limits the application of the commensurate with income standard to only\n   <em>\n    transfers\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    licenses\n   </em>\n   of intangible property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   This is consistent with the underlying purpose of the 1986 amendment. Congress explained in the committee report that it was introducing the commensurate with income standard to address a \"recurrent problem\" with transfers of highly valuable intangible property: \"the absence of comparable arm's length transactions between unrelated parties, and the inconsistent results of attempting to impose an arm's length concept in the absence of comparables.\" H.R. REP. NO . 99-426, at 423-24 (1985). Congress noted that \"[i]ndustry norms for transfers to unrelated parties of less profitable intangibles frequently are not realistic comparables in these cases,\" and that \"[t]here are extreme difficulties in determining whether the arm's length transfers between unrelated parties are comparable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20482\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20482\">\n    at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To address this\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   gap, Congress found it \"appropriate to require that the payment made on a transfer of intangibles to a related foreign corporation ... be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20482\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20482\">\n    at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress did not make any other findings regarding the use of the commensurate with income standard for any transactions other than transfers or licenses of intangible property. Thus, the statute-read in light of this legislative history-did not grant Treasury the flexibility to depart from a comparability analysis whenever it sees fit; rather, it permitted a departure in the limited context of \"any transfer (or license) of intangible property\" because it had found that comparable transactions in such cases are frequently unrealistic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Treasury reiterated the limited circumstances in which the commensurate with income standard applies in its 1988 \"White Paper.\" It stated there that, even in the context of transfers or licenses of intangible property, the \"intangible income must be allocated on the basis of comparable transactions if comparables exist.\"\n   <em>\n    A Study of Intercompany Pricing under Section 482 of the Code\n   </em>\n   (\"White Paper\"), I.R.S.

Treasury noted, in particular, the White Paper's observation \"that Congress intended that Treasury and the IRS apply and interpret the commensurate with income standard consistently with the arm's length standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing White Paper, 1988-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20C.B.%20458\">\n    1 C.B. at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Treasury then detailed how the proposed rules would function, including that the new rules required stock-based compensation costs to be included among the costs shared in a QCSA to produce \"results consistent with an arm's length result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49,000-01. It acknowledged that \"[t]he Tax Reform Act of 1986 ... amended section 482 to require that consideration for intangible property\n   <em>\n    transferred\n   </em>\n   in a controlled transaction be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible\" property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48,998 (emphasis added). But it then conclusively stated, based on a vague reference to the \"legislative history of the Act,\" that parties may continue to enter into bona fide\n   <em>\n    research and development\n   </em>\n   cost sharing arrangements so long as \"the income allocated among the parties reasonably reflect actual economic activity undertaken by each\"-i.e., so long as these agreements to develop intangible property survive the commensurate with income standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Not once did Treasury justify its application of the commensurate with income standard by stating that QCSAs of this kind constitute \"transfers\" of intangible property under the Tax Reform Act. And, while it generally cited to the legislative history of the 1986 amendments to \u00a7 482-a fact on which the majority places great weight-it did not explain what portions of the legislative history it found pertinent or how any of that history factored into its thinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Treasury expanded on its reasoning in the preamble to the final rule. It explained that the tax treatment of stock-based compensation in QCSAs would have to be consistent \"with the arm's length standard (and therefore with the obligations of the United States under its income tax treaties and with the OECD transfer pricing guidelines).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    68 Fed.

Treasury observed, however, that the legislative history of the 1986 amendment to \u00a7 482 \"expressed Congress's intent to respect cost\n   sharing arrangements as consistent with the commensurate with income standard, and therefore consistent with the arm's length standard, if and to the extent that participants' shares of income 'reasonably reflect the actual economic activity undertaken by each.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting H.R. REP. NO . 99-481, at II-638 (1986) (Conf. Rep.)). Again, Treasury never explained why QCSAs in which controlled parties share costs to develop intangibles would constitute \"transfers\" of intangibles sufficient to trigger the commensurate with income standard in the first place. Instead, it simply declared that, \"in order for a QCSA to reach an arm's length result consistent with legislative intent,\" the QCSA must include stock-based compensation among the costs shared.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Throughout the preamble, Treasury repeatedly emphasized that it was continuing to apply the arm's length standard. Treasury explained, for example, that \"[t]he regulations relating to QCSAs\n   <em>\n    have as their focus\n   </em>\n   reaching results consistent with what parties at arm's length generally would do if they entered into cost sharing arrangements for the development of high-profit intangibles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Treasury determined that \"[p]arties\n   <em>\n    dealing at arm's length\n   </em>\n   in [a cost-sharing] arrangement based on the sharing of costs and benefits generally would not distinguish between stock-based compensation and other forms of compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). And Treasury concluded that \"[t]he final regulations provide that stock-based compensation must be taken into account in the context of QCSAs\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   such a result is consistent with the arm's length standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Yet, Treasury failed to consider comparable transactions submitted by commentators demonstrating that unrelated companies would never share the cost of stock-based compensation.

Treasury acknowledged that these comparable arm's-length transactions are typically relevant, but it determined that there were no comparable transactions available for QCSAs for the development of high-profit intangibles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   While the results actually realized in similar transactions under similar circumstances ordinarily provide significant evidence in determining whether a controlled transaction meets the arm's length standard, in the case of QCSAs such data may not be available. As recognized in the legislative history of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, there is little, if any, public data regarding transactions involving high-profit intangibles.

In its opening brief, it contends, instead, \"that, in the context of a QCSA, the arm's-length standard does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require an analysis of what unrelated entities do under comparable circumstances.\" Appellant's Br. 57 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Commissioner's view, Treasury's detailed explanations regarding its comparability analysis were merely \"extraneous observations\"-\"since Treasury reasonably determined that it was statutorily authorized to dispense with comparability analysis in this narrow context, there was no need for it to establish that the uncontrolled transactions cited by commentators were insufficiently comparable.\" Appellant's Br. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In its supplemental brief, the Commissioner reiterates that-despite its own earlier machinations to the contrary-one should not conflate comparability analysis with the arm's length standard. Appellant's Suppl. Br. 29-31. It also argues for the first time that Treasury's passing reference to the legislative history of \u00a7 482 not only justified its departure from a comparability analysis, but also explained that QCSAs to\n   <em>\n    develop\n   </em>\n   intangibles constitute\n   <em>\n    transfers\n   </em>\n   of intangibles under the second sentence of \u00a7 482.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The majority accepts the latest of the Commissioner's ever-evolving post-hoc rationalizations and then, amazingly, goes even further to justify what Treasury did here. First, it accepts the Commissioner's new explanation that the taxpayer's agreement to \"divide beneficial ownership of any Developed Technology\" constitutes a transfer of intangibles. E.R. 145. Second, it holds that Treasury's reference to the legislative history communicated its understanding that, when Congress enacted the 1986 amendment, it \"delegate[d] to Treasury the choice of a specific methodology to\" \"ensure that income follows economic activity.\" Op. 1077. The majority finds that Treasury implicitly communicated its understanding that Congress called upon it to move away from a comparability analysis and \"to develop methods that [d]o not rely on analysis of\" what it deems \"problematic comparable transactions\" when it sees fit. Op. 1077-78. The majority finds that Treasury was therefore entitled to ignore the comparable transactions submitted by commentators because they purportedly did not \"bear[ ] on 'relevant factors' to the rulemaking.\" Op. 1082-83\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am.

As to Altera's rejoinder that Treasury never suggested that it had the authority to \"dispense with\" the comparability analysis entirely, Appellee's Br. 43, the majority dismisses this argument, stating that, \"historically[,] the definition of the arm's length standard has been a more fluid one.\" Op. 1077. Finally, the majority concludes that the second sentence of \u00a7 482 not only allowed Treasury to dispense with a comparability analysis\n   <em>\n    but also allowed it to ignore the arm's length test altogether\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   I do not share the majority's views. Treasury may well have thought-incorrectly, I believe-that QCSAs involving the development of high-profit intangibles constitute transfers of intellectual property under the second sentence of \u00a7 482. It may also have believed that, given the fundamental characteristics of stock-based compensation in QCSAs and what the majority here calls the \"fluid\" definition of the arm's length standard, it could dispense with a comparability analysis entirely, regardless of whether QCSAs constitute transfers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xilinx II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222288\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1191/#p1193\">\n    598 F.3d at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fisher, J., concurring) (hypothesizing why unrelated companies may not share stock-based compensation costs).

Asking Treasury to show its work in the preamble to its final rule-that is, to set forth when and why the agency believed that a comparability analysis is not required or even why an arm's length analysis can be eschewed-does not, as the majority states, \"require agencies to provide 'exhaustive, contemporaneous legal arguments to preemptively defend its action.' \" Op. 1083 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Elec.

Treasury offers no response to these findings; it simply invites this court to recreate the record and interpret \u00a7 482 in a way it never asked the Tax Court to do in order to supply a post-hoc justification for its decisionmaking.

The Commissioner does not argue that its interpretation of \u00a7 482 is compelled by the unambiguous text of the statute at step one of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   . Rather, he contends that \u00a7 482 does not directly resolve the question of whether Treasury may allocate the cost of stock-based compensation between related parties. The majority similarly reasons that \"[\u00a7] 482 does not speak directly to whether the Commissioner may require parties to a QCSA to share employee stock compensation costs in order to receive the tax benefits associated with entering into a QSCA.\" Op. 1073. It thus concludes that \"there is no question that the statute remains ambiguous regarding the method by which Treasury is to make allocations based on stock-based compensation.\" Op. 1076.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   While I agree with the majority and the Commissioner that the statute is silent as to the precise question of whether the Commissioner may require parties to a QCSA to share the cost of stock-based compensation, I believe that the statute unambiguously communicates the types of cases in which each methodology applies. Specifically, \u00a7 482 dictates that the status quo-i.e, the arm's length standard-controls in \"any case of two or more organizations, trades, or businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests.\" It also allows Treasury to employ the commensurate with income standard, but only \"[i]n the case of any transfer (or license) of intangible property.\" Accordingly, the precise gap left by Congress in this case is the question of whether QCSAs constitute a \"transfer\" of \"intangible property\" under the second sentence of the statute. If yes, then Treasury may employ the commensurate with income standard to determine if related parties to a QCSAs would share the cost of stock-based compensation. If no, then Treasury must make that determination by employing a comparability analysis to reach an arm's length result. Because the statute does not expressly state that QCSAs for the development intangibles constitute \"transfers\" of intangibles, I would proceed to step two of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   At step two, we consider whether Treasury's interpretation is \"arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayo Found. for Med.

Accordingly, I begin with the text of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The statutory text provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   In any case of two or more organizations, trades, or businesses ... owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the Secretary may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among such organizations ...\n   <em>\n    if he determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such organizations, trades, or businesses\n   </em>\n   . In the case of any\n   <em>\n    transfer (or license) of intangible property\n   </em>\n   (within the meaning of section 367(d)(4)), the income with respect to such transfer or license shall be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Section 482 (emphases added). It is undisputed that the first sentence of the statute requires an arm's length analysis; even the majority agrees with that longstanding principle. As previously explained, moreover, at the time Congress amended \u00a7 482, the arm's length standard was understood to require a comparability analysis. But, because transfers of intangible property oftentimes lacked comparable transactions, Congress added a second sentence to the statute. This sentence allows the Secretary to apply the commensurate with income standard to reach an arm's length result in the case of any\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   of intangible property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The Commissioner contends, based on Treasury's purported belief that QCSAs are transfers of intangible property, that Treasury correctly interpreted \u00a7 482 to require that controlled companies share the cost of stock-based compensation. But, as noted above, Treasury never made, much less supported, a finding that QCSAs constitute transfers of intangible property. We cannot and should not conclude that the Commissioner's post-hoc interpretation would be permissible when Treasury never articulated such an interpretation. Even if it had, Treasury's own characterization of QCSAs as arrangements \"for the\n   <em>\n    development\n   </em>\n   of high-profit intangibles\" contradicts any conclusion that QCSAs constitute\n   <em>\n    transfers\n   </em>\n   of already existing intangible property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. at 51,173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). No rights are transferred when parties enter into an agreement to\n   <em>\n    develop\n   </em>\n   intangibles; this is because the rights to later-developed intangible property would spring\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   to the parties who shared the development costs without any need to transfer the property. And, there is no guarantee when the cost-sharing arrangements are entered into that any intangible will, in fact, be developed. In such circumstances, Treasury should not have employed the commensurate with income standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The majority attempts to justify Treasury's departure from the comparability analysis in these circumstances by stating it was reasonable for Treasury to \"determin[e] that uncontrolled cost-sharing arrangements,\" such as those submitted by the commentators, \"do not provide helpful guidance regarding allocations of employee stock compensation.\" Op. 1077. According to the majority, the legislative history \"makes clear\" that Congress \"intended the commensurate with income standard to displace a comparability analysis where comparable transactions cannot be found.\" Op. 1070. This reasoning fails for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As noted, the text of the statute provides that Treasury may employ the commensurate with income standard only in the case of a transfer or license of intangible property-not whenever Treasury finds that uncontrolled transactions fail to provide helpful guidance. Congress did not leave a gap in the statute allowing Treasury to choose when one methodology displaces the other. Rather, it made its own\n   findings regarding the relative helpfulness of comparable uncontrolled transactions in the case of a transfer or license of intangible property. It then amended \u00a7 482 to allow for the use of the commensurate with income methodology in those specific cases, but not in others. Congress's findings in the legislative history do not invite Treasury to make its own determinations regarding the helpfulness of other uncontrolled transactions. Nor do they allow Treasury to expand the category of cases in which the commensurate with income standard would apply when the statutory text states otherwise. Here, Treasury's only justification for eschewing the comparability analysis was its insistence that the legislative history allows it to disregard comparable transactions that it deems imperfect. This rationale is inconsistent with the plain text of the statute and thus, is impermissible under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Even if Treasury could dispense with a comparability analysis whenever it believed no comparables exist, that interpretation would still fail step two of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   because uncontrolled comparable transactions do exist here. Even the majority acknowledges Treasury's view that a different methodology may only be applied \"\n   <em>\n    when comparable transactions do not exist\n   </em>\n   .\" Op. 1083 n.9 (emphasis added). Treasury itself explained, in effect, that a precondition for the applicability of the commensurate with income standard is the lack of real-world comparable transactions with which to make an arm's length comparison. Such transactions, as Treasury admitted, would \"ordinarily provide significant evidence in determining whether a controlled transaction meets the arm's length standard.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. at 51,173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the majority, however, imperfect comparables are tantamount to the absence of comparables.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   But the arm's length standard of \u00a7 482 does not require perfectly identical transactions-only comparable ones. As Altera notes, the Commissioner cannot \"avoid the statutory limits on his ability to reallocate income by asserting that a related-party transaction is fundamentally different from all similar transactions between unrelated parties by virtue of the very fact that the parties are related.\" Appellee's Suppl. Br. 33. Such an interpretation would allow Treasury to dispense with the comparability analysis altogether because related parties, by virtue of common ownership, are always positioned differently than unrelated parties. Legislative history can only do so much-if any-work, and it certainly cannot set out an exception that swallows a rule codified by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Even if Treasury were correct that no comparable transactions exist, Treasury's reasoning would still fail. Treasury concluded that it could allocate costs because there were no transactions in which parties at arm's length would even consider taking stock options into account in the context of an arrangement similar to a QCSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C171\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. at 51,173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Indeed, the absence of any comparable transactions could itself mean that uncontrolled taxpayers would not share the costs of stock-based compensation. Treasury believes, however, that uncontrolled taxpayers would not enter into such transactions, and, rather than find the absence of such transactions meaningful to a comparison, believes it is justified in using different methodologies to assess income. But the fact that evidence of the absence of comparable transactions might support more favorable tax treatment does not mean that no comparison can be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Finally, while Treasury's interpretation of \u00a7 482 is \"entitled to no less deference ... simply because it has changed over time, ... the agency must nevertheless engage in reasoned analysis sufficient to\n   command our deference.\"\n   <em>\n    Good Fortune Shipping SA v.

Indeed, \u00a7 482 expressly defines the term \"intangible property\" by referencing the definition provided in \u00a7 367(d)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 482 (\"... any transfer (or license) of intangible property (\n   <em>\n    within the meaning of section 367(d)(4)\n   </em>\n   ).\" (emphasis added)). We need not guess at whether Congress intended a broad reading of the term because \u00a7 367(d)(4) enumerates specific categories of intangible property covered under the statute, and none of those categories contemplates the mere possibility that intangible property may someday exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   While \"any\" may modify \"transfer,\" moreover, QCSAs do not provide for future transfers; rather, as noted above, rights to later-developed intangible property-if ever developed-would spring\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   to the parties who shared the development costs and would thereby dispense\n   with any need to transfer those rights at some time in the future. I would conclude, absent additional evidence to conclude otherwise, that QCSAs are not transfers subject to the commensurate with income standard under \u00a7 482.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Rather, I would find that QCSAs are governed under the first sentence of \u00a7 482 and that Treasury may only allocate the cost of stock-based compensation among related companies if unrelated companies dealing at arm's length would do so under comparable circumstances. The evidence of comparable transactions submitted by commentators demonstrates that unrelated companies do not and would not share such costs. Thus, I would hold that an arm's length result is one in which related parties in QCSAs do not share costs associated with stock-based compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Commissioner contends that the backdrop against which Congress enacted the 1986 amendment demonstrates that Congress intended \u00a7 482 to require related companies to share stock-based compensation. But, as the majority admits, \"[n]either the Tax Reform Act nor the implementing regulations specifically addressed allocation of employee stock compensation.\" Op. 1072. This is because the practice of providing stock-based compensation did not develop on a major scale until the 1990s-after Congress passed the 1986 amendment. Therefore, Congress could not have been legislating against the backdrop of this particular type of tax avoidance. While it may choose to address this practice now, it cannot be deemed to have done so then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Not all forms of tax avoidance amount to illegal tax evasion. The very definition of a loophole is a gap in the law or a set of rules. While Treasury may promulgate regulations to close such gaps, it must do so in a manner consistent with its statutory authority under the Tax Reform Act and with the procedures outlined in the APA. When it fails to comply with those requirements, its actions cannot be justified by the mere existence of the loophole. In other words, an arm's length result is not simply any result that maximizes one's tax obligations.
