The panel majority held that Kristen Biel, a fifth-grade teacher who taught religion and other classes at a Catholic school, was not a \"minister\" because the circumstances of her employment were not a carbon copy of the plaintiff's circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; School v. E.E.O.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biel v. St. James Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519578\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/603/\">\n    911 F.3d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2018). The panel majority's approach conflicts with\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   , decisions from our court and sister courts, decisions from state supreme courts, and First Amendment principles. And it poses grave consequences for religious minorities (collectively,\n   a substantial plurality of religious adherents in this circuit) whose practices don't perfectly resemble the Lutheran tradition at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is precisely the case warranting en banc review. We adopted the ministerial exception en banc prior to\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alcazar v. Corp. of the Catholic Archbishop of Seattle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072526\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1288/\">\n    627 F.3d 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc). The ministerial exception \"is undeniably an issue of exceptional importance\" because its denial \"portends serious consequences for one of the bedrock principles of our country's formation-religious freedom.\"\n   <em>\n    Bollard v. Cal. Province of the Soc'y of Jesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743576\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/1331/#p1333\">\n    211 F.3d 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1333 (9th Cir. 2000) (Wardlaw, J., joined by Kozinski, O'Scannlain, and Kleinfeld, JJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since then, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the ministerial exception in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   , suggesting its application in a case like this. Three Justices-Thomas, Alito, and Kagan-filed or joined two separate concurrences specifically proposing legal tests under which the ministerial exception plainly applies here (and no Justice has proposed a test undermining its application here). And virtually all our sister courts-and state supreme courts-adopted the ministerial exception in similar cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, five different amici-coalitions of religiously diverse organizations and law professors-urge this court to correct its legal error. As amici explain, the panel majority's approach trivializes the significant religious function performed by Catholic school teachers. This court's narrow construction of the exception threatens the autonomy of minority religious groups, like amici, \"for whom religious education is a critical means of propagating the faith, instructing the rising generation, and instilling a sense of religious identity.\" Brief of Gen.

Despite a unanimous Supreme Court opinion upholding the exception, we are weaker, not stronger, in applying it. Not once, not twice, but three times now in the last two years, we have departed from the plain direction of the Supreme Court and reversed our district courts' faithful application of Supreme Court precedent.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puri v.
