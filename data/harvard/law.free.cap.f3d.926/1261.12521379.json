For eight years, Taxpayers' return preparer included bogus claims on their returns. Taxpayers apparently were oblivious to this. The return preparer was indicted for his fraudulent behavior and pled guilty. Eventually, the IRS came calling: to recover the money it was due all along, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency to Taxpayers for those eight years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Taxpayers challenged the notice of deficiency in the Tax Court. They argued that the IRS waited too long to collect. Generally, the IRS must make assessments within three years after a tax return is filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But there's an exception, and the three-year window is suspended, \"[i]n the case of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (We call this the fraud exception.) Taxpayers argued that the fraud exception did not apply because the IRS could not meet its evidentiary burden and show that their returns were in fact fraudulent. Taxpayers admitted that their return preparer created fraudulent returns for his other clients, but, Taxpayers said, the IRS could not prove that the return preparer falsely or fraudulently prepared\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   returns. Crucially, Taxpayers conceded-time and time again-that if the Tax Court did find that their returns were fraudulent, the exception to the three-year window would be triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The case proceeded to trial before the Tax Court. At trial, the IRS presented prior testimony that the return preparer gave when he testified against one of his former business associates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this testimony, the return preparer said every tax\n   return he prepared during the relevant time period included some fraudulent entries. Additionally, the IRS presented affidavit testimony from the return preparer. In the affidavit, he swore that he knowingly prepared false tax returns for Taxpayers during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Tax Court ruled in favor of the IRS-it found that the return preparer had prepared Taxpayers' returns falsely or fraudulently with the intent to evade tax. Thus, the Court found, the fraud exception was triggered, and the IRS's notice of deficiency was timely. Taxpayers filed a motion for reconsideration. Having lost on the merits of their defense, they pivoted-or did a 180, really. In the motion, Taxpayers argued-for the first time-that the fraud exception was not triggered because they, the Taxpayers, had not falsely or fraudulently prepared their returns with intent to evade tax. That is, they claimed that fraud by a tax preparer (and not a taxpayer) did not trigger the fraud exception. The Tax Court held that Taxpayers waited too long to raise this legal argument and rejected it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Taxpayers raise the same eleventh-hour argument and say that fraud by the tax preparer does not trigger the fraud exception. They also argue that the Tax Court erred by admitting the return preparer's former testimony and affidavit. We reject these arguments and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We divide our discussion into three parts. First, we set out the facts and procedural history. Next, we consider the arguments on appeal. Finally, we conclude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   An informant tipped off the IRS about Taxpayers' return preparer. In turn, the IRS launched an investigation, and here's what the investigation turned up: the return preparer and his associates prepared around 750 to 800 fraudulent returns every year for 11 years. These fraudulent returns had several common features. For example, the returns showed large refunds and partnership losses. The large partnership losses flowed through to the individual returns, and there were deductions for contributions to retirement plans. The bogus returns also noted payments between partnerships and their partners. The addresses for the partnerships changed; as a result, the partnership returns were filed with different IRS Centers, which lowered the chances of detection. Finally, many of the same dollar amounts repeated themselves and appeared on several of the fraudulent returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Taxpayers' returns fit the mold. Taxpayers owned a rental property, and their return preparer advised them to run their rental income through a partnership. Taxpayers formed a partnership but never transferred ownership of the rental property to the partnership. In fact, they didn't even enter into a partnership agreement. The Taxpayers never wrote checks to the partnership; nor did the partnership write checks to them. Yet their partnership returns showed a capital contribution from one Taxpayer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The partnership returns also showed large losses. One year, the loss was caused in part by a guaranteed payment to the partners. Expenses also played a role in the loss, and at least two of the claimed expenses used the repeating dollar amounts that were common across many of the bogus returns. In turn, Taxpayers' individual returns claimed these losses. Eventually, they began claiming losses\n   from a second partnership: one they had never heard of until the IRS got involved. The addresses of both partnerships changed over the years. And-unsurprisingly-Taxpayers' refunds increased over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The return preparer was indicted and pled guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and to interfering with the administration of the internal revenue laws. The return preparer then testified against one of his former business associates. During the testimony, the return preparer said that \"[e]ach and every one\" of the returns he prepared during the relevant time \"contain[ed] some fraudulent entries.\" Taxpayers were not part of the grand jury investigation into the return preparer and his associates. Nor were Taxpayers' returns used to support the indictments against the return preparer and his associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Roughly five years after the dust settled in the criminal proceedings, the IRS came calling: it issued a notice of deficiency to Taxpayers for the eight years that Taxpayers submitted fraudulent returns. The IRS also tacked on a 20% accuracy-related penalty for each year based on Taxpayers' negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Taxpayers challenged the notice of deficiency and filed a petition in the Tax Court. In the petition, Taxpayers claimed the IRS had missed the three-year collection window and thus was too late. The IRS answered and alleged that the fraud exception to the three-year window applied because the return preparer had fraudulently prepared Taxpayers' returns with intent to evade tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The IRS relied on the Tax Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698656\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/128/37/\">\n    128 T.C. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), to support its reading of the fraud exception. In\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , the Tax Court held that the fraud exception is triggered, and the three-year window suspended, by the return preparer's fraudulent intent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698656\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/128/37/\">\n    128 T.C. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner argued that the fraud exception was triggered only by the taxpayer's fraudulent intent, and the Court expressly rejected that argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698656\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/128/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698656\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/128/37/\">\n    at 39-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It explained, \"The statute keys the extension to the fraudulent nature of the return, not to the identity of the perpetrator of the fraud,\" and the Court declined to read \"of the taxpayers\" into the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698656\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/128/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5698656\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/128/37/\">\n    at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The IRS didn't hide the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ball, either; it cited\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   again and again. During informal discovery, the IRS responded to a discovery request and explained that it was not barred by the statute of limitations, and it cited\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   as authority for that statement. During pretrial motion practice, the IRS cited\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   five more times. It cited\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   again in its pretrial memorandum and in both briefs that it filed after the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Taxpayers' defense, at least before the Tax Court handed down its decision, was this: the IRS didn't have enough evidence to show that Taxpayers' fraudster return preparer had falsely or fraudulently prepared their returns. Thus, according to Taxpayers, because there was no showing of fraud, the fraud exception was not triggered. Indeed, this is the argument they made in their opening brief, under the heading \"because Respondent failed to prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence, the period of limitations within which to assess additional taxes is time barred.\" And to support their argument, Taxpayers relied on\n   <em>\n    Eriksen v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20T.C.M.%2046\">\n    104 T.C.M. (CCH) 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202865875\">\n    2012 WL 2865875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). As here, the IRS in\n   <em>\n    Eriksen\n   </em>\n   argued that the fraud exception was triggered based on the fraudulent intent of the petitioners' return preparers.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202865875\">\n    2012 WL 2865875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. And as here, the issue\n   before the Tax Court in\n   <em>\n    Eriksen\n   </em>\n   was \"whether [the IRS] ha[d] clearly and convincingly proven that any of petitioners' returns w[ere] false or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202865875\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Eriksen\n   </em>\n   found that the IRS met its burden for some petitioners but not for others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202865875\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, Taxpayers relied on\n   <em>\n    Eriksen\n   </em>\n   and argued that the case against them was most like the case against the petitioners for which the IRS came up short in proving fraud. Doing so, Taxpayers never challenged\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   as an appropriate hook for triggering the fraud exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before the Tax Court issued its decision, Taxpayers never challenged\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   or its logic at all. They stipulated before trial that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [t]he only issue in dispute is whether [Taxpayers'] individual income tax returns and partnership tax returns for the years at issue were false and fraudulent and prepared with the intent to defeat or evade tax.... If the answer is [yes], then the asserted deficiencies and accuracy-related penalties will not be challenged by [Taxpayers].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   And during their opening statement at trial, Taxpayers said this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   So any fraud that may be proved by [the return preparer] ... it's attributed to the [Taxpayers] personally, and they're [the IRS] alleging that it's a fraudulent return. And under\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   , therefore, it would be proper for this Court to find fraud because ... of the preparer's activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   But we don't have any evidence that was related by [the IRS] to the effect that [the] [fraudulent] activity also concerned [Taxpayers], as well as [the return preparer's] other numerous clients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, resolving any doubt about Taxpayers' position on the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   case, the Tax Court asked Taxpayers-point blank-whether they contested it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: There is no objection as to the statute of limitations in this case; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: Yes, there is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: There is. And what's the basis for the objection?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: The tax years are 1994 through 2001. So under [\u00a7] 6501(a), that's beyond the three-year statute of limitations. [The IRS] alleges that under 6501(c), if there's clear and convincing evidence of fraudulent intent or filing with intent to evade, therefore the statute of limitations will not be an issue....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Has not the Court decided that issue as to the statute of limitation if there's fraud on behalf of the preparer of the return?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: Yes. We admit to the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   case. Right. The Court has decided that. But we're not saying that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: So you're still objecting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: We're objecting-we're not conceding that [the return preparer's] fraud for his dozens of other clients was also perpetrated in the case of the [Taxpayers].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: So you do not admit that there was fraud on this return?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: Even by [the return preparer].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: And as I understand that the Court has decided that the fraud of a preparer is sufficient-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: That's the law, unfortunately, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Do you contest that law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [TAXPAYERS]: No, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties tried the case before the Tax Court. The IRS called four witnesses: the special agent who investigated the Taxpayers' return preparer, the return preparer's former business associate (the one who pled guilty), and the Taxpayers themselves. The IRS did not call the return preparer as a witness, but it wasn't for lack of trying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The IRS began trying to contact the return preparer eight months before the trial. It tried to serve the return preparer with a subpoena 10 times; each time was unsuccessful. Unable to call the return preparer as a witness, the IRS introduced two of his prior statements. First, the IRS presented prior testimony that the return preparer gave during the criminal trial of his former employee. There, he said that every tax return he prepared during the relevant time period included some fraudulent entries. Second, the IRS admitted affidavit testimony from the return preparer. In the affidavit, he swore that he knowingly prepared false tax returns for Taxpayers during the relevant time period. Taxpayers objected and argued that both statements were inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After the trial, both sides filed simultaneous opening and answering briefs. After the briefing was finished, the case remained submitted for almost two years before the Tax Court issued its decision. About halfway into the two-year period, the IRS sent a letter to the Court and copied Taxpayers. In the letter, the IRS brought to the Court's (and Taxpayers') attention the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    BASR Partnership v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289726\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/1338/\">\n    795 F.3d 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2015). In\n   <em>\n    BASR\n   </em>\n   , a fractured Federal Circuit panel declined to follow\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and held that the fraud exception is triggered only when the taxpayer acts with intent to evade tax.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289726\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/1338/\">\n    795 F.3d at 1346-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even after this decision, and after the IRS sent the letter, Taxpayers never asked the Tax Court to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and made no\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   -related arguments whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Tax Court found in favor of the IRS. It took up the evidentiary issue first and held that the return preparer's prior witness testimony and affidavit testimony fell within an exception to the ban on hearsay.\n   <em>\n    Finnegan v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=T.C.M.%20%28RIA%29%202016-118\">\n    T.C.M.

Of course, this just parroted the way the parties had framed the issue before, during, and after trial. Before turning to the meat of the issue-whether the returns were fraudulent or not-the Court explained in a single brief paragraph that the fraud exception applied because\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   held that the return preparer's fraud was enough to trigger the exception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On the topic of whose fraud triggers the exception, the Court also flagged (using a \"but see\" introductory citation signal) a Court of Federal Claims decision that declined to follow\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    BASR P'ship ex rel. Pettinati v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4135761\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/113/181/\">\n    113 Fed. Cl. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ). While Taxpayers' case was submitted, but before the Court issued its decision, a fractured Federal Circuit panel affirmed the Court of Federal Claims decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BASR P'ship v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289726\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/1338/\">\n    795 F.3d 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2015). (Remember, the IRS sent a letter to the Court and Taxpayers that notified everyone of the Federal Circuit's decision.) Although the Tax Court flagged these two cases that rejected\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained in a footnote that those cases provided \"no reason to revisit\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Finnegan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203360447\">\n    2016 WL 3360447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 n.6.

Armed with new lawyers and fresh ideas, Taxpayers filed a motion for reconsideration under Rule 161 of the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure. When deciding a motion to reconsider under Rule 161, Tax Courts look to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and case law applying the Federal Rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers claimed that Rule 161 's \"closest corollary\" in the Federal Rules is Rule 60(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And\n   they relied on Rule 60(b)'s catchall provision-\"any other reason that justifies relief,\" Fed. Rule Civ. P. 60(b)(6) -in asking for relief from the Tax Court's final decision. In the motion, they argued (1) that the Tax Court erred in deciding not to revisit\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and (2) that the Tax Court should overrule\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Taxpayers rightly anticipated that their\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   argument might run into a waiver problem based on their former lawyer's admission that they \"admit to the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   case\" and do not contest it. So, they tried arguing that it would have been unethical to ask the Tax Court to overrule\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   before the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    BASR\n   </em>\n   . Relying on Rule 3.1 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers claimed there was no \"basis in law\" to argue that\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   should be overruled. There was no basis in law, they said, because the Federal Circuit hadn't filed its opinion and because no party had filed a brief in that case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, Taxpayers claimed they didn't make the argument because their ethical duties didn't allow them to. They also said-without any support in the record-that the Court \"steered\" them away from contesting\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Next, Taxpayers claimed that although they didn't argue that\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   should be overruled, the Court considered the question anyway. Remember, the Court explicitly said that it did not \"revisit\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Finnegan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203360447\">\n    2016 WL 3360447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 n.6. Thus, the Court's only decision on whether it should overrule\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   was that it would not, in fact, decide at all. So, where did Taxpayers come up with the argument that the Court actually did decide whether to overrule\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ? They plucked a word from the Court's footnote that we explained above: Taxpayers said that the Court decided whether to overrule\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   because the Court called the dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    BASR\n   </em>\n   \"persuasive.\" They even took one step further and faulted the Court for not asking the parties to file supplemental briefs to address the Federal Circuit's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Taxpayers tried to sidestep the waiver issue altogether and argued that the Federal Circuit's opinion qualified as a decision from a U.S. Court of Appeals that changed the law and thus affected the issues decided in this case. And under Eleventh Circuit precedent, a \"clear-cut change in the law\" will sometimes-but not always-justify granting relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Ritter v.

In other words, they say that\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided. The Tax Court held that it would be inappropriate to grant relief based on this argument because Taxpayers raised it for the first time in their motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Taxpayers waived this argument. They knew that the IRS was relying on\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and its holding, and they chose not to challenge it. They didn't challenge it before, during, or after trial. In fact, they explicitly told the Tax Court they admitted to\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and were not challenging it. We cannot imagine a more obvious waiver. Rather than challenge\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , Taxpayers relied on a different defense: it put the IRS to its burden and claimed it couldn't prove fraud-by the return preparer-with clear and convincing evidence. As we said above, the Tax Court looks to the Federal Rules and case law applying the Federal Rules when ruling on a motion for reconsideration.

First, Taxpayers argue they did not waive the issue because it's not waivable. When an issue is before a court, Taxpayers say, the court has an independent duty to apply the correct law to the facts, even if neither party argues for the correct application of the law. Here, Taxpayers argued that the IRS waited too long to collect, which, according to Taxpayers, means the statute-of-limitations issue was properly before the Tax Court. Thus, Taxpayers claim the Court had an independent duty to apply the correct interpretation of the law-the fraud exception-to the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We disagree. The statute-of-limitations issue wasn't properly before the Court. At least the part that Taxpayers now care about wasn't, anyway. Before the Tax Court, Taxpayers claimed the fraud exception wasn't triggered-meaning the limitations period had run-because the IRS couldn't prove fraud. Period. The statutory-interpretation question of whose fraud triggers the exception was not before the Court until Taxpayers filed their motion for reconsideration. But this last-ditch effort was too little too late, and the Court denied the motion on waiver grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Taxpayers' argument assumes that, before a court can apply a statute, it has an independent duty to interpret the statute exhaustively. In turn, courts would find new answers to questions the parties have already agreed on, or courts would find answers to questions that no party even raised. If we accepted this argument, we would require courts to decide issues outside the adversarial process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reject Taxpayers' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, Taxpayers argue that they did not waive the issue because the Tax Court did in fact stamp its own approval on\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   . Taxpayers can tell that the Court did so because it called the dissenting opinion in the Federal Circuit's decision \"persuasive.\" But as we explained above, this was nothing more than a passing comment, as the Court explicitly said that it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   revisiting\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   . This argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Taxpayers' best argument is that we should exercise our discretion and not enforce the waiver doctrine.

Taxpayers argue that first and fifth circumstances apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We begin with the first. The fraud-exception issue is a pure question of law, but our refusal to consider it will not result in a miscarriage of justice.

The IRS litigated this case for more than three years while relying on a fundamental assumption: under\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , the fraud exception is triggered so long as the IRS can prove that the return preparer intended to evade tax, even if the taxpayer had no idea his return preparer was a fraudster. Relying on this assumption-this state of the law-the IRS focused a lot of attention on the return preparer and his method for creating bogus returns. It built its case around the return preparer's method, and it showed that Taxpayers' returns were the product of this method. The IRS focused less on Taxpayers themselves. The most important admission the IRS got from Taxpayers' testimony likely was that their returns had entries they didn't recognize. And the IRS didn't need much more from Taxpayers. After all, it wasn't concerned with Taxpayers' intent. And why would it have been?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If we consider this issue, the IRS would have to retry the case, and that case would look very different from this one. It would have to focus much more on mounting circumstantial evidence showing Taxpayers' intent. Of course, this means a lot of the time and resources that went into litigating this case would be wasted. And we have said that our reluctance to consider new issues on appeal \"derives primarily from 'the needs of judicial economy and the desirability of having all parties present their claims in the court of first instance.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Servs., Inc. v.
