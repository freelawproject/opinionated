The plan turned on obtaining and executing a search warrant for employment records at the factory. The record before us establishes that the search warrant for documents was executed \"in order to\" arrest undocumented workers present at the factory. Our central question is whether the ICE agents were permitted to carry out preplanned mass detentions, interrogations, and arrests at the factory, without individualized reasonable suspicion. We hold that they were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2006, ICE received an anonymous tip that Micro Solutions Enterprises (MSE), a Los Angeles-area manufacturer of printer cartridges, employed 200 to 300 undocumented immigrants. Nearly two years later, in February 2008, ICE agents sought and received a search warrant for employment-related documents located at the MSE factory in Van Nuys, California, and criminal complaints and arrest warrants for eight MSE employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Documents later obtained\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   revealed that ICE intended from the outset to turn the execution of these warrants into quite a different operation than a search for employment records. An internal memorandum issued before the operation stated that ICE \"[would] be conducting a search warrant and expects to make 150-200 arrests.\" The memorandum also noted that ICE would have \"2 buses and 5 vans\" ready to transport potential detainees\n   from the factory and \"200 detention beds available to support the operation.\" Another planning document noted that ICE \"anticipate[d] executing a federal criminal search warrant at MSE\n   <em>\n    in order to\n   </em>\n   administratively arrest as many as 100 unauthorized workers\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The operation took place as planned. Two days after the warrants were issued, approximately 100 armed and uniformed ICE agents streamed into the MSE factory. Blocking all visible exits, the agents ordered all workers to stop working and announced that no one was permitted to leave. The agents prohibited the workers from contacting anyone using their cellphones and allowed them to use the restroom only with an ICE escort. Among the workers detained was Gregorio Perez Cruz, a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States without inspection in 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ICE agents then separated the men and women into different areas. The women were taken to the factory cafeteria, and the men were instructed to wait in a large hallway outside the cafeteria. After the men, including Perez Cruz, had gathered in the hallway, the agents ordered them to form two lines, one for individuals who possessed work authorization documents and another for those who lacked work authorization. Those who joined the line for men who had work authorization were escorted out of the hallway. Perez Cruz remained in the hallway but did not join either line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ICE agents next ordered Perez Cruz and the other remaining men to stand against the wall. While Perez Cruz and the others were standing the agents conducted a pat down of each of them. The agent who frisked Perez Cruz took his wallet. The detainees were then handcuffed and questioned. While Perez Cruz was handcuffed, the agents asked him his name, his nationality, his date of birth, and the length of time he had worked at the factory. The agents then escorted Perez Cruz and the other detained male workers into another hallway, where they were questioned again. At some point during his detention, Perez Cruz provided statements to the agents indicating that he lacked lawful immigration status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sometime later, the ICE agents began taking groups of workers to buses parked outside the factory. When it came time for Perez Cruz to board the bus, an agent photographed him and asked again for his name and country of origin. Perez Cruz, still handcuffed, was kept on the bus for over an hour before he was taken to a detention facility in downtown Los Angeles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When the bus arrived at the detention facility, ICE agents ordered Perez Cruz off the bus, searched him again, and removed his handcuffs. Perez Cruz was then held at the detention facility overnight. During the night, he was interrogated again. The next day, still detained, Perez Cruz was interrogated once more. At around 1:00 a.m. he was released. According to a later ICE press release, Perez Cruz was one of 130 workers at the MSE factory arrested for immigration violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   About a month later, Perez Cruz received a notice to appear for a removal hearing. The notice charged him as removable for entry without inspection. Based on the statements Perez Cruz provided during his detention, ICE agents prepared a Form I-213 alleging that Perez Cruz had admitted that he was brought illegally into the United States as a child. In addition to the Form I-213, the government produced Perez Cruz's birth certificate, obtained by an ICE agent in Mexico based on the\n   statements Perez Cruz had provided in connection with the factory raid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Perez Cruz moved to terminate the proceedings or, in the alternative, suppress the evidence gathered, arguing that his arrest and interrogation violated binding federal regulations as well as the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. There was a brief hearing on Perez Cruz's motions, during which the government did not contest any of Perez Cruz's factual assertions. The immigration judge (IJ) granted Perez Cruz's motion to terminate, concluding that ICE's initial detention of Perez Cruz and failure to advise Perez Cruz of his rights \"violated [ICE's] own regulation.\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    Matter of Garcia-Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20325\">\n    17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B.I.A. 1980), the IJ held that, because Perez Cruz was prejudiced by this regulatory violation, termination of his removal proceedings was warranted. Accordingly, the IJ did not reach Perez Cruz's constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government appealed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) reversed. The BIA relied on\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. Summers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313927\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/692/\">\n    452 U.S. 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313927\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/692/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313927\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/692/\">\n    69 L.Ed.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), which held valid the detention of residents of a home where a search warrant was being executed. Under\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   , the BIA concluded, Perez Cruz's detention and arrest violated neither the agency's regulations nor the Fourth Amendment. Because law enforcement officers are permitted to \"secure the premises both for purposes of their own safety and in order to prevent the destruction of evidence\" during the execution of a warrant, the BIA reasoned, the ICE agents did not violate the Fourth Amendment by \"ordering employees to stop working, blocking exits, and asking employees to self-identify their immigration or citizenship status.\" The BIA also concluded that, even if the detention was improper, the evidence introduced by the government was offered to prove only Perez Cruz's \"identity\" and therefore could not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On remand from the BIA, the IJ entered a removal order against Perez Cruz. When Perez Cruz again appealed, the BIA affirmed the IJ's order and dismissed the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Perez Cruz timely petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decisions. He argues, among other things, that his detention violated both the Fourth Amendment and controlling regulations, and that the evidence against him should therefore have been suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We first briefly address the government's contention that even if Perez Cruz were otherwise entitled to suppression of the evidence obtained as a result of the MSE mass detention and arrest, the critical evidence in question-Perez Cruz's statements as represented in the Form I-213, and his birth certificate-constitutes evidence only of \"identity\" and so is not subject to suppression.

It also offered his birth certificate, obtained as a result of Perez Cruz's statements at the factory about his birthplace. According to the government, the statements and birth certificate are proof only of \"identity\" and therefore not subject to suppression. That evidence, the government maintains, is sufficient to establish Perez Cruz's removability.

As the ICE planning documents unmistakably show, the agents' plans here were centered on detaining and interrogating any and all workers located at the MSE factory to determine whether they were undocumented. One document, for example, stated that ICE was \"\n   <em>\n    targeting\n   </em>\n   150-200 undocumented workers\" (emphasis added) during the operation, evidencing that arresting those workers, and not obtaining the documents mentioned in the warrant, was the focus of the operation. In fact, under \"significant details\" of the operation listed in that document, the search itself not mentioned at all-only the \"targeted\" workers, the \"ratio of apprehensions\" of men and women, and the office that ICE would be using \"to detain and process all arrested individuals.\" Another memorandum issued before the raid explained: \"ICE anticipates executing a federal criminal search warrant at MSE\n   <em>\n    in order to\n   </em>\n   administratively arrest as many as 100 unauthorized workers believed to be from Mexico and Central America\" (emphasis added). Those statements alone establish that the central purpose of the raid was not to find documents but to arrest undocumented workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Documents prepared after the raid reinforce the conclusion that the agents were\n   focused on the detentions, not the search. Those post-raid memoranda don't mention the search at all; instead they discuss-in great detail-the workers' detention. And another of those documents confirmed that the operation \"\n   <em>\n    targeted\n   </em>\n   approximately 150 undocumented workers believed to be employed at [MSE].\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The ICE agents' conduct at the MSE factory and afterward also confirms that they understood the search for records to be of much less significance-if any-as compared to the detentions, interrogations, and arrests of workers. The record suggests that many more agents were dedicated to seizing the MSE workers than to searching for documents. Instead of participating in the document search, those agents present spent time corralling the workers, separating them by gender, handcuffing them, interrogating them, and searching them. Transportation and detention facilities for a large number of anticipated detainees were readied in advance, confirming that the agents had made careful plans to arrest these workers and take them offsite, rather than merely to detain them during the records search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The agents' repeated interrogations of Perez Cruz and his coworkers during their detention also demonstrate that the agents' reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   exception was misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Mena\n   </em>\n   authorizes officers to ask questions of\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   detainees as long as the detention is not \"prolonged by the questioning.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902037\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/93/\">\n    544 U.S. at 100-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902037\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/93/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The agents then repeatedly questioned the workers who did not join the work authorization line until responses were provided. Perez Cruz, in particular, declined to answer the initial question, as he joined neither line. He was nonetheless detained and subjected to repeated questioning while detained. The nature of the agents' questioning here indicates that they conducted the detentions\n   <em>\n    for the purpose\n   </em>\n   of engaging in mandatory interrogations.\n   <em>\n    Mena\n   </em>\n   does not authorize purposely targeted, mandatory interrogations after an individual declines to respond, as opposed to questioning incidental to the warrant execution purpose on which valid\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   detentions may be based.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Notably, in contrast to the details regarding detentions, there is no information in the record about the search itself.
