The jury proceeded to deliberate and reached a verdict. Before the verdict was announced, however, jurors expressed concern for their safety because of the scary-looking man. All the jurors stated that their verdict was unaffected by the man's presence. Nonetheless, the trial court, at the prosecution's request and against Gouveia's opposition, granted a mistrial. On federal habeas review, the district court held that there was no manifest necessity for the mistrial, so retrying Gouveia would violate his right not to be subjected to double jeopardy. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gouveia was tried for manslaughter in Hawaii state court for the death of Albert Meyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20707-702\">\n    Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 707-702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a). The testimony was that Gouveia struck Meyer during an altercation, and Meyer died after hitting his head on the pavement. The presentation of evidence concluded, both sides gave closing arguments, and the jury was sent off to deliberate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case turns on two notes the jury sent to the trial court in close succession. The first informed the court that the jury had \"reached a verdict.\" A second, drafted a few minutes after the verdict message, stated: \"Concern. This morning on prosecutor's side of courtroom there was a man, shaved head, glaring and whistling at defendant. We have concern for our safety as jurors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After receiving the messages, the trial court gathered the attorneys and informed them about the notes. Explaining that it was inclined \"to take no action on this,\" the trial court asked the parties what approach they suggested. The prosecution requested that the jurors be questioned, and Gouveia's attorney agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court then conducted individual voir dire of each juror. Before beginning, the court asked the attorneys whether they \"ha[d] any idea what this is based on.\" The prosecution noted that Meyer's brother had been in the courtroom that morning \"with [a] shaved head\" and appeared \"pretty upset.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court proceeded to question each juror. Although a few testified that the man seemed angry and that they were afraid for their safety, all twelve jurors stated that the menacing-looking man's presence had not affected their votes. The jurors gave conflicting testimony as to when the safety concern about the shaved-headed man first came up in deliberations, some saying at the outset, others toward the end, and others only after the verdict was reached. One juror stated, \"Yes,\" when asked whether the fear of the man \"impact[ed] other people's decision,\" but did not elaborate as to how she knew that or what the impact was. But she, like all the others, said her own decision was unaffected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After questioning the jury, the trial court asked Gouveia's attorney whether he wanted the court to take any additional steps; the attorney declined. The prosecution, however, moved for a mistrial, arguing that there was manifest necessity for a mistrial because some jurors had expressed safety concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the\n   prosecution, the fact that Meyer's brother was \"associate[d] with the prosecution and the decedent side\" might have \"lended more credibility to Mr. Gouveia's testimony as he testified.\" Gouveia's attorney opposed the motion, stressing that all the jurors had stated that their own votes had been unaffected by the incident, and that no jurors had expressed to the court any concern about the individual until it was announced that a verdict had been reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a bit more discussion, the trial court granted the mistrial motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I find it difficult to really believe when I ... apply my reason and common sense to this that at least some of these jurors have ... what strikes me as a really serious concern for their personal safety and it came up according to, at least as I count, four or five of them, it ... was ... one of the first topics of discussion when they got back in the room and started deliberating the case. Somebody brought it up and they started talking about it. It frankly beggars my reason and common sense that it would have no bearing on the deliberations in this case and therefore the verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I'm going to grant the State's motion for mistrial. I'm going to find there's manifest necessity for such based on what I said ... and everything else that's been put on the record, including my questions to counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The verdict's going to be sealed for future purposes, if any, but obviously we're not going to take the verdict. I'm declaring a mistrial and I'm finding manifest necessity for that, because I don't think there's anything short of a mistrial ... that can cure it. The verdict's tainted, in my view, based on my findings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A few weeks later, the trial court issued findings of facts and conclusions of law to further explain its decision. The court reasoned that \"[a]lthough there [was] no specific juror misconduct\" in this case, it would adopt \"the well-established 'harmless beyond a reasonable doubt' standard\" for juror-misconduct claims. Relying on that standard, the trial court found that \"the jurors' statements that the incident did not affect their decision-making process and/or deliberations [were] not credible,\" and reiterated its prior conclusion that \"the jury was not impartial\" and that \"there [was] manifest necessity for a mistrial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gouveia moved to dismiss the prosecution, contending that there was no manifest necessity for the mistrial. The constitutional double jeopardy protection, Gouveia maintained, would be violated were he retried. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Gouveia appealed the trial court's manifest-necessity finding, the appellate court unsealed the verdict form for purposes of the appeal. The form revealed that the jury had unanimously found Gouveia not guilty.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although one juror suggested that other jurors may have been affected by the presence of Meyer's brother, each individual juror testified that that his presence did not affect his or her own decision. There is no indication that Meyer's brother spoke with, or threatened, any juror in or out of the courtroom. The jury's note pointed only to his \"shaved head\" and the fact that he was \"glaring and whistling at [Gouveia]\" as the basis for their concern. And nothing in the record indicates that the jurors knew his connection to the trial-that is, that he was Meyer's brother. Nor did the presence of Meyer's brother provide any extrinsic information to the jury. In short, the circumstances here appear to fall short of the cases in which we have reversed a conviction for alleged juror bias or taint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   So we have here none of the paradigmatic situations in which we accord great deference to the trial judge as to the manifest necessity for a mistrial. Still, the Supreme Court has also indicated that a case involving\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   juror bias \"falls in an area where the trial judge's determination is entitled to special respect.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    434 U.S. at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    98 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The use of the reasonable doubt standard in this context is questionable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even if use of the standard were permissible, the trial court's strong reliance on the standard suggests that its belief that \"the verdict was ... tainted\" was not particularly strong. Indeed, immediately before declaring a mistrial, the trial court itself recognized that it was \"a really, really close ruling\" on whether a mistrial was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Further, the record does not indicate that the jurors knew of the scary man's connection to the trial. At most, some jurors surmised from the man's location on the prosecution side of the courtroom and his actions that he was angry at Gouveia. But the leap from any such surmise to\n   <em>\n    antiprosecution\n   </em>\n   bias because of those actions is farfetched. If anything, one would think that if the jurors thought the unknown man was dangerous and might hurt them if they sided with Gouveia, they would be biased against Gouveia, so as to avoid the danger an acquittal might create. That obviously did not occur, as we know both from the jurors' attestations that they were not affected and from the unanimous vote to acquit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Similarly, the trial court's agreement with the prosecution that the jurors' deliberations were likely affected by the scary man's presence was wholly unsupported by any objective fact in the record. All twelve jurors testified that that the presence of Meyer's brother did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   affect their own decisions. The trial court based its determination on a finding that all twelve jurors' testimony was not \"credible.\" But as the district court noted, \"nothing in the record identifies facts supporting [the] finding that the jurors were not believable.\"\n   <em>\n    Gouveia III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203687309\">\n    2017 WL 3687309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14.

Instead, with regard to consideration of an alternative to subjecting Gouveia to an entire second trial even though the jury had reached a verdict (and one probably in his favor), the trial court simply asserted, \"There's no other remedy short of a mistrial that's going to cure this or allow us to take the verdict, correct? It's not like we can continue the trial ... or I can give them a further instruction.\" The trial court's conclusion that it could not ask the jury to deliberate further after cautionary instructions appeared to be based on its belief that the jury \"reached a verdict already,\" which could not be changed or reconsidered. The Hawaii appellate courts agreed with this assumption, concluding that there were no reasonable alternatives to a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gouveia II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313757\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/139/70/\">\n    384 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   856-57 ;\n   <em>\n    Gouveia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202066780\">\n    2015 WL 2066780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   If, in fact, the verdict\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   final, as the Hawaii courts suggested, it would constitute an acquittal for purposes of the double jeopardy protection, and a new trial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause for that reason. \"Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that '[a] verdict of acquittal ... could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
