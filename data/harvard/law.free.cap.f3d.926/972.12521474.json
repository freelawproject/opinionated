Genevieve County Deputies Austin Clark (\"Deputy Clark\") and Matthew Ballew responded to a 9-1-1 report of gunshots from the vicinity of a rest area. When they arrived at the rest stop to investigate, the officers encountered Gregory Clark (\"Gregory\") seated at a table adjacent to the building. After calling in Gregory's identification, a brief, somewhat adversarial discussion about Gregory's race ensued. Gregory drove away in his vehicle after the officers went inside the building to continue their investigation. The officers then followed Gregory for approximately 19 miles on the highway, at which point Gregory stopped his vehicle on an exit ramp. After further discussion and investigation, Gregory was allowed to leave. Gregory filed this action against Deputy Clark, alleging constitutional violations under the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted summary judgment in favor of Deputy Clark on all claims on the basis of qualified immunity. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the afternoon of January 25, 2016, the principal of Bloomsdale Elementary School called 9-1-1 and reported gunshots coming from the direction of the nearby woods. Approximately 12-15 minutes later, Ste. Genevieve County Deputies Clark and Ballew arrived at a rest area located about 150 yards from the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant Gregory Clark was the only person at the rest area at the time. Gregory was talking on his phone at a table when Deputy Clark and another officer approached him (not in uniform, but with badges and sidearms). Assuming they were police officers, Gregory voluntarily handed the officers his driver's license, his\n   retired military identification, and his concealed carry permit. Gregory informed the officers that he was armed. The officers asked Gregory whether he had heard \"anything\" or any \"gunfire.\" Gregory said that he had not. The officers then asked Gregory where he was going. He responded that he was on his way to Chicago. Deputy Clark ran Gregory's identification, which came back clean. When Gregory inquired as to the reason his information had been run, Deputy Clark replied that his \"boss likes to know who he is talking to.\" Gregory followed up by asking if \"[Deputy Clark would] have done that to anyone else.\" Gregory admits that his question was directed at whether he was being subjected to racial profiling. Deputy Clark responded angrily by saying \"don't play the race card with me.\" Without any further discussion, Deputy Clark handed the three cards back to Gregory and ended the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The police officers searched for a suspect inside the building, but found no one. When they came back out of the building, they saw Gregory driving away. The officers followed him onto the highway heading northbound toward Chicago. Gregory noticed the officers following him. He made a U-turn about two miles later, trying to avoid them because he \"didn't know what could happen\" and \"was in fear of [his] life.\" The officers continued to follow Gregory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the officers were following Gregory, Deputy Clark observed Gregory making \"exaggerated movements,\" leaning toward the passenger seat and center console. Because Gregory's vehicle had heavily tinted rear windows, it was difficult to see exactly what Gregory was doing inside the car. After driving approximately three to five more miles, Gregory spotted several more police cars in the area so he turned on his hazard lights and pulled off the highway onto an exit ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After stopping his vehicle, Gregory put both hands outside the driver's side window. Deputy Clark and two other officers approached the vehicle with guns drawn in the \"low ready\" position. Deputy Clark then raised his gun and ordered Gregory out of the vehicle. Gregory complied. Deputy Clark patted Gregory down and another officer moved him away from the vehicle. Deputy Clark began searching inside the vehicle. Gregory told Deputy Clark that the gun he had told them about at the rest area was in the center console. When Deputy Clark retrieved the gun, he noticed it was cold and missing two bullets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Deputy Clark questioned Gregory about why the gun was missing two bullets. Gregory indicated that he had not fired the weapon in years and could not explain the two missing rounds. During this conversation, another officer examined the gun and verified that it had not been fired recently. The gun's serial number was run by dispatch. When it came back as stolen, Gregory was handcuffed. Further inquiry revealed that Gregory was the person who had mistakenly reported the gun as stolen when he had merely misplaced it, at which point the officers remaining at the scene removed the handcuffs, returned Gregory's gun and told Gregory he was free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gregory sued Deputy Clark, alleging: (1) he was unlawfully seized when Deputy Clark detained him at the rest area while running his identification; (2) a second unlawful seizure occurred when Deputy Clark detained him on the highway; (3) Deputy Clark used excessive force when he pointed his gun after he voluntarily pulled over; (4) the vehicle search was unconstitutional; (5) the theft of two bullets constituted a substantive due process violation; (6) the entire detention and inquiry at the rest area was based solely on race and violated the equal protection\n   clause; and (7) the entire course of events that took place after inquiring whether he was being singled out because of his race was in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights. Deputy Clark successfully moved for summary judgment on all counts. Gregory now appeals the district court's ruling on claims (1), (2), (3), (6) and (7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Here, a consensual encounter began with Gregory handing over his identification cards without being asked to do so. This inferred consent was never explicitly\n   revoked. Gregory never gave the officers reason to believe that he no longer wished to engage in the contact. Gregory never asked for the return of his identification cards or whether he could leave. Gregory has not pointed to any physical restraint, blocking action, or other show of authority that would indicate he was not free to leave. Instead, Gregory urges us to find he was detained based upon Deputy Clark's hostility and angry tone in stating \"don't play the race card with me.\" This alleged hostility occurred after Deputy Clark had handed back Gregory's identification cards. Given the timing of when the statement was made-it was the officer's parting words-it is of little weight when analyzing the totality of the circumstances surrounding the encounter. Because the entire interaction was consensual, there was no seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Even if we assume\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the encounter was not consensual, the officers had a sufficient reasonable and articulable suspicion that warranted the intrusion.

Here, the officers were aware that shots had been fired in the vicinity of the rest area. Gregory was the only person visible outside the rest area. Gregory volunteered that he had a permit to carry a gun and that he actually had one in his possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taken in aggregate, these facts would give an objectively reasonable officer articulable suspicion to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    B. Second Encounter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although a number of facts surrounding the second highway encounter are disputed, Gregory acknowledged that a \"detention did not occur when [he] first pulled over his car because he pulled over voluntarily.\" (Appellant's Br. 34). The parties have debated extensively whether there was anything unusual about the manner or speed in which Gregory left the rest area, or whether there was excessive movement inside Gregory's truck while he was driving, or whether Deputy Clark had the ability to observe Gregory's movement inside the truck. Because Deputy Clark did not conduct a traffic stop of Gregory's vehicle, these disputed issues are insignificant to the particular constitutional issue before us, and resolution of all of them in Gregory's favor would not establish a constitutional violation. The disputed seizure implicating the Fourth Amendment occurred when officers, with guns drawn, ordered Gregory out of his car after he stopped voluntarily on the exit ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To justify an investigative seizure under\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   , a \"police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\" the intrusion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p24\">\n    392 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p24\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Gregory stopped his vehicle, Deputy Clark knew Gregory had a firearm, but was unsure whether it had been fired recently. After searching the building and grounds of the rest area and failing to find anyone else present, Deputy Clark had reason to follow up with Gregory about inspecting the gun that Gregory told him he had in his possession. Gregory had informed the officers that he was traveling to Chicago, but inexplicably made a U-turn in the opposite direction while being\n   followed by police. Finally, Gregory pulled over and put his hands outside the driver's side window. While this is entirely consistent with Gregory's perspective that he was complying for his own safety, the act is also unusual and may be indicative of guilty conduct. At the time Gregory stopped his vehicle, police officers had reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the investigative seizure, Deputy Clark investigated the gun quickly and efficiently, and the period of detention lasted no longer than necessary to effectuate the investigation. While Gregory was handcuffed when the officers received information that the firearm had been reported stolen, they were removed as soon as the officers learned that Gregory was the person who had reported the firearm stolen. Handcuffing was a reasonable precaution and did not elevate the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop to an arrest.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A reasonable officer was justified in believing the situation was not fully under control until Gregory had been removed from the vehicle, patted down, and restrained.

While I agree that Deputy Clark likely had reasonable suspicion for a stop at the rest area, the question is close. Gregory was present near the crime scene, and, being armed, had had the ability to commit the crime. However, as the court notes, Gregory cooperated with police at the rest area, answering officers' questions and voluntarily providing them with his military identification and concealed carry permit. Furthermore, the caller from the school had not provided a description of the alleged shooter, and Gregory was not engaging in any suspicious activity when approached by Deputy Clark.\n   <em>\n    C.f.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Considering the closeness of the reasonable suspicion question at the rest stop, Deputy Clark's argument that Gregory's behavior on the highway augmented the suspicion he developed at the rest area is weak. Gregory's behavior on the highway was a natural reaction to being followed and surrounded by police, not behavior likely indicative of a guilty conscience or criminal activity. With no relevant additional information to suggest that Gregory had in fact been the shooter at the rest area, Deputy Clark's decision to stop Gregory at the exit after following him for 19 miles was not \"reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\" or \"strictly tied\" to those circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518392\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/981/\">\n    901 F.3d at 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Neither does Deputy Clark's desire \"to follow up with Gregory about inspecting the gun,\" justify the stop.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.
