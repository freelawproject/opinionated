At the time, the Air Line Pilots Association (\"ALPA\") was the certified bargaining representative for both the US Airways pilots (the \"East Pilots\") and the America West pilots (the \"West Pilots\"). The East\n   Pilots significantly outnumbered the West Pilots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ALPA entered into a \"Transition Agreement\" with the merging airlines that set forth the process for integrating the pilot seniority lists for the two pilot groups. The Transition Agreement required the pilots to negotiate among themselves a single integrated list and, if negotiations failed, to submit to binding arbitration. Once the two sides arrived at an integrated list, it would be presented to the airlines for acceptance. But the Transition Agreement also provided that, before a single seniority list could be implemented, the pilots and the airlines must ratify a new collective bargaining agreement-known as the \"Single Agreement\"-that would apply to all of the pilots. Ratification of the Single Agreement would require approval by a majority of both pilot groups. Until that condition was satisfied, the existing seniority lists and collective bargaining agreements for the respective pilot groups would remain in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the East and West Pilots tried but failed to negotiate a seniority list, ALPA arranged for arbitration before a panel led by George Nicolau. In May 2007, the arbitration panel issued a decision known as the \"Nicolau Award,\" which composed an integrated seniority list that was generally viewed as more favorable to the West Pilots. The East Pilots objected to the Nicolau Award so strenuously that they created a new union-the US Airline Pilots Association (\"USAPA\")-and then used their numerical majority to replace ALPA with USAPA as the certified bargaining representative for all of the pilots. In subsequent negotiations with US Airways, USAPA ignored the Nicolau Award and pushed for a different integrated seniority list that favored the East Pilots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2008, a group of West Pilots filed\n   <em>\n    Addington I\n   </em>\n   , an action against USAPA asserting that the union had breached its duty of fair representation by proposing a new seniority list instead of pursuing the implementation of the Nicolau Award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678238\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/1174/#p1176\">\n    606 F.3d at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court did, however, find that USAPA was bound by the Transition Agreement's requirement to pursue the arbitrated Nicolau Award and that USAPA's efforts to ignore it \"place[d] USAPA on dangerous ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In April 2012, US Airways began the process of a merger with American Airlines. At the time, US Airways was still operating with two pilot collective bargaining agreements and two pilot seniority lists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In anticipation of the merger, the two airlines, USAPA, and the union for American's pilots negotiated a multi-party agreement called the \"Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Contingent Collective Bargaining Agreement\" (\"MOU\"). The MOU set forth procedures for reaching a Joint Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"JCBA\") that would apply to all pilots employed by post-merger American. It also addressed seniority integration for the pilots. The MOU required the pilots to negotiate a single merged seniority list and, if negotiations failed, to submit to binding arbitration pursuant to the McCaskill-Bond Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The MOU also provided the following in Paragraph 10(h): \"US Airways agrees that neither this Memorandum nor the JCBA shall provide a basis for changing the seniority lists currently in effect at US Airways other than through the process set forth [under McCaskill-Bond].\" This provision was inserted into the MOU by USAPA, and it had the effect of maintaining the separate seniority lists for the East and West Pilots by ensuring that neither the MOU itself nor the JCBA would become the \"Single Agreement\" for purposes of triggering the Nicolau Award.

At the bargaining table, the employer and the union must approach each other as respectful adversaries. Although they must find common ground, each comes to the table with an obligation to its own constituents-the union to its employee members and the employer to its investors. Expecting an employer to bargain simultaneously in favor of its own interests and in favor of the interests of some employees would force the employer into a game of chess against itself, pursuing what are often competing and inconsistent positions. And in doing so, the employer would also likely end up stepping on the union's own representative efforts. An employer has no duty to tell the union how to fulfill its duty to represent its constituents. And without a duty, there can be no liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

Without a breach by American of the collective bargaining agreement, we no longer have a hybrid suit but instead a pure breach-of-duty suit that seeks to hold American secondarily liable for USAPA's breach.

The core proposition in\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   -that, apart from any breach of contract, an employer is liable for a union's breach of duty \"if it acts in collusion with the union,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"325062\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1274/#p1283\">\n    756 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1283 -is unmoored from the RLA. The only authority cited by the Seventh Circuit to support this statement was a hybrid case that included a direct claim against an employer for \"breach[ing] its collective bargaining agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    Alvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"479295\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/622/1279/#p1290\">\n    622 F.2d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That case was inapposite; like the plaintiffs in this case, the employees in\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   did \"not bring a direct claim against [their employer].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"325062\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1274/#p1283\">\n    756 F.2d at 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   court went out of its way to acknowledge that it did not have before it the \"usual hybrid case\" in which the breach-of-contract claim against the employer is \"distinct from the [breach-of-duty] claim against the union.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"325062\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1274/#p1283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That observation should have ended the discussion for the reasons we have explained-without a direct claim against the employer for breaching some contractual (or statutory) obligation, there is no basis for imposing liability on the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Any doubt on this score can be dispelled by the inability of courts following\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   to come up with a coherent standard for identifying conduct that amounts to actionable collusion. The\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   court stated that an employer's mere \"negotiation\" with a union is insufficient,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"325062\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1274/#p1283\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , but that is hardly a helpful benchmark, as employers are in fact\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to negotiate with unions under the RLA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , First, Second, Ninth. And although later courts have insisted on \"something more\" than negotiation,\n   <em>\n    Am.

One court, for example, has suggested relying on \"general principles\" about \"when it may be appropriate to hold one entity liable for another's breach of duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

But without a statutory hook, we-and more problematically, employers subject to the RLA and its penalties-would only be able to guess at what those \"general principles\" could be. Another court simply repurposed the standard used for identifying a breach of duty by a union, requiring a showing of \"bad faith or discriminat[ion]\" by the employer that reflects \"hostility or contempt\" toward the employees.\n   <em>\n    Rakestraw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7385356\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/765/474/#p493\">\n    765 F.

Although an employer's discrimination or hostility toward individual employees during collective bargaining might in some circumstances violate an existing bargaining agreement or some other statute, nothing in the RLA supports what plaintiffs are trying to do here-transform a theory of union liability into a theory of employer liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Under the RLA, employees can hold their union liable for breaching its duty of fair representation during collective bargaining.
