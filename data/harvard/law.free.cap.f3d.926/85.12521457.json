Plaintiffs L-3 Communications Corporation and L-3 Applied Technologies, Inc. (L-3 ATI) (collectively, the plaintiffs) appeal from the district court's award of summary judgment to Serco, Inc. in the plaintiffs' action alleging numerous claims arising out of a failed business relationship. The plaintiffs contend that Serco conspired with another company, Jaxon Engineering &amp; Maintenance, Inc. (Jaxon), to \"rig\" a bidding process related to work for the United States Air Force Space Command (the Air Force), thereby interfering with the plaintiffs' reasonable business expectancy in that work. The plaintiffs assert that Serco's conduct amounted to tortious interference with the plaintiffs' business expectancy, common law conspiracy and statutory business conspiracy under Virginia law, and violations of the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act (COCCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2018-17-104\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-17-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon our review, we conclude that the district court properly awarded summary judgment to Serco on the claims of tortious interference with business expectancy, because those claims fail as a matter of law. However, for the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to Serco with respect to the plaintiffs' conspiracy\n   claims and COCCA claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore affirm in part, and vacate in part, the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A detailed factual background of this case is included in our prior opinion.\n   <em>\n    L-3 Commc'ns Corp. v. Serco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390503\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/673/284/#p285\">\n    673 F. App'x 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285-87 (4th Cir. 2016). We restate those facts as necessary here. In 2004, the Air Force awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract to Serco (the prime contract). The prime contract required that Serco provide testing and upgrading services to certain Air Force facilities to protect those sites from high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the prime contract, the Air Force periodically would provide Serco with a statement of work that outlined the requirements for a specific HEMP-related project. If Serco could not complete the work itself, Serco would issue a request for proposal (RFP), which invited certain qualified companies to bid on the identified work as a subcontractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A few months after being awarded the prime contract, Serco entered into a subcontract for HEMP-related work (the subcontract) with the Titan Corporation, a predecessor to plaintiff L-3 ATI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subcontract provided, in relevant part, that \"[Serco] has no obligation to issue and there is no guaranty to [the plaintiffs] that [they] will receive any work under the terms of this Subcontract.\" Instead, the plaintiffs still were required to submit proposals to bid on HEMP-related work, which was issued in the form of individual task orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Between December 2004 and June 2009, Serco awarded every task order issued under the prime contract to the plaintiffs or their predecessors. And although Serco was required by the prime contract to select subcontractors on a competitive basis to the maximum extent practicable, the plaintiffs were the only subcontractors that Serco considered for HEMP-related work during this time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2009, Serco began to award HEMP-related task orders to another company, Jaxon, which was formed by a longtime L-3 employee. The plaintiffs allege that Jaxon was not qualified to perform this work, and that Serco's decision to award HEMP-related work to Jaxon was based on a \"fraudulent scheme\" between Serco and Jaxon in which Serco actively prevented the plaintiffs from fairly competing for work under the task orders. The plaintiffs allege that Serco facilitated this scheme (1) by encouraging and assisting former L-3 employees, now working for Jaxon, to use the plaintiffs' confidential information when bidding on HEMP-related projects for Jaxon, and (2) by providing\n   Jaxon with inside information about government costs and requirements for such projects. Based on this purported scheme, the plaintiffs claim that between July 2009 and November 2014, Serco awarded 32 HEMP-related task orders to Jaxon that otherwise would have been awarded to the plaintiffs. During that same period, Serco awarded 11 other HEMP-related task orders to the plaintiffs and 13 such task orders to other contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2015, the plaintiffs initiated the present action. The plaintiffs asserted claims of: (1) tortious interference with the plaintiffs' business expectancy in HEMP-related task orders from July 2009 to the time of filing (Counts 1-34) (the tortious interference claims); (2) aiding and abetting Jaxon to tortiously interfere with this business expectancy (Counts 35-68) (the aiding and abetting claims); (3) civil conspiracy in violation of Virginia common law, and statutory business conspiracy in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-499 and 18.2-500 (Counts 69-70) (the conspiracy claims); and (4) violations of the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2018-17-104\">\n    Colo.

Stat. \u00a7 18-17-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Counts 71-73) (the COCCA claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court initially dismissed the plaintiffs' action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not have a business expectancy in the losses alleged. We reversed, concluding that the plaintiffs had standing, and that the question whether the plaintiffs plausibly had alleged a business expectancy was one properly considered under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L-3 Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390503\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/673/284/#p285\">\n    673 F. App'x at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following extensive discovery on remand, Serco filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The court concluded that although the plaintiffs' tortious interference and aiding and abetting claims were timely, the plaintiffs could not establish a valid business expectancy in any task order because the subcontract expressly disclaimed any expectancy. The court also determined that the plaintiffs could not rely on their past course of dealing to establish a business expectancy, because such course of dealing did not arise independently of the subcontract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to the plaintiffs' conspiracy claims, the court held that those claims were time-barred under Virginia's five-year statute of limitations, based on the court's finding that the plaintiffs initially suffered an injury in 2008 resulting from the alleged conspiracy. Alternatively, the court held that the conspiracy claims failed as a matter of law because the plaintiffs could not establish a valid business expectancy in any task order. The court also concluded that the plaintiffs' COCCA claims were time-barred. The plaintiffs now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their (1) tortious interference and aiding and abetting claims; (2) conspiracy claims; and (3) COCCA claims.

Although those actions may have injured the plaintiffs with respect to agreements they had with their former employees, the plaintiffs' alleged expectancy in HEMP-related task orders was unaffected. Similarly, Serco's decision not to solicit a bid from the plaintiffs for a HEMP-related task order in March 2009 did not represent a completed act of interference with the plaintiffs' expectancy. Until the relevant task orders were awarded, Serco retained the discretion to solicit additional bids or even decline to award the task order to any company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that all the plaintiffs' conspiracy claims did not begin to accrue until July 2009, when the first HEMP-related task order was awarded to Jaxon.

Thus, the plaintiffs' expectancy was in the issuance of each new task order, separate and apart from the subcontract.

Here, the subcontract expressly stated that Serco had \"no obligation to issue and there is no guaranty to [the plaintiffs] that [they] will receive any work under this Subcontract.\" The RFP's for HEMP-related task orders similarly explained that Serco retained the sole discretion to \"make one award, multiple awards, or no award, depending on the best interest of Serco,\" and that \"Serco is not obligated ... to enter into [an agreement] or any other arrangement with any offerer.\" A fact finder could determine that these disclaimers weighed in some degree against the plaintiffs having a reasonable expectancy in future HEMP-related work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Also relevant on remand to the question of reasonable business expectancy is the fact that Serco was required by the prime contract to select subcontractors on a competitive basis to the maximum extent practicable. And even when Serco recommended that a certain subcontractor be awarded work under a particular task order, it appears that the Air Force retained the authority to reject that recommendation. Thus, the very nature of the federal government's contracting and subcontracting process at issue in this case may make it more difficult as a factual matter for subcontractors, who are bound by the terms of a prime contract with the government, to demonstrate an objective expectation regarding future task orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Accordingly, we hold that Virginia's two-year statute of limitations applies to the plaintiffs' COCCA claims. Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-243(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nonetheless, the plaintiffs should have been afforded an opportunity to prove whether they suffered any distinct injuries during the applicable two-year period. Under Virginia law, \"if the wrongful acts [at issue] are not continuous and occur only at intervals, each occurrence inflicts a new injury and gives rise to a new and separate cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Accordingly, although we affirm the district court's decision holding that a two-year statute of limitations applies to the plaintiffs' COCCA claims, we remand for the district court to determine as a factual matter the particular limitations period for each of the COCCA claims, and to determine whether the plaintiffs can recover for any independent injuries that may have occurred during those periods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist. v.
