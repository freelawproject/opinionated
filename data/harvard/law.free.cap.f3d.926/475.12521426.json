Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Faulkner was convicted in 2015 of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(e)(1). The district court imposed an enhanced sentence of 280 months of imprisonment after finding Faulkner had previously been convicted of four qualifying predicate offenses under the ACCA: a 1982 attempted burglary in Illinois, a 1984 burglary in Indiana, and two 1996 federal drug crimes. On direct appeal, Faulkner challenged the district court's reliance on three of his four predicate convictions in imposing the enhancement - all but his 1984 Indiana burglary conviction.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During the appeal, the government conceded the 1982 Illinois burglary conviction no longer qualified under Supreme Court precedent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1147 (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

But we agreed with the government that Faulkner's previous federal drug convictions were two separate offenses and, combined with his unchallenged 1984 Indiana burglary conviction, still justified the enhancement for having three qualifying offenses under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1149.

The district court denied the motion and concluded Faulkner's challenge was procedurally defaulted because he failed to raise it at trial or on direct appeal. The district court thus found the claim not cognizable unless it fit a miscarriage-of-justice exception. The district court then considered Faulkner's merits arguments and determined, in relevant part, Faulkner's Indiana burglary offense was not broader than the generic offense in light of a recent Seventh Circuit decision rejecting an identical argument in a different case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Faulkner points to no Indiana cases holding as much. And in order to find a state burglary statute broader than the generic offense, there must be \"a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of [the] crime.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
