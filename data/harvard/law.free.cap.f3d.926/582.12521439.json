Yong and a group of associates were originally charged with felonies related to an illegal sports betting operation based in Caesars Palace Hotel &amp; Casino (\"Caesars\") in Las Vegas during the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament. As part of a group plea deal, Yong and three co-defendants pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of acting as an accessory after the fact to co-defendant Hui Tang's violations of the Wire Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In exchange for this group plea, the Government dismissed felony charges pending against Yong's son, Wai Kin Yong (\"Wai Kin\"). On appeal, Yong argues that his guilty plea was involuntary because it was improperly conditioned on leniency for Wai Kin and was tainted by government misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As to the first issue, we consider, as a matter of first impression, the standard for determining the voluntariness of guilty\n   pleas obtained through offers of leniency for third parties. We hold that a guilty plea made in exchange for leniency to a third party is involuntarily made if the government lacked probable cause to prosecute the third party at the time of the guilty plea. Because the Government had probable cause to prosecute Wai Kin at the time of Yong's plea, we affirm. We likewise affirm on the government misconduct challenge, as Yong was aware of the Government's misconduct at the time of his plea but nonetheless pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June of 2014, a group of gamblers from Asia traveled to Las Vegas for the 2014 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament kickoff. The group stayed at Caesars in luxury villas ranging in size from 8,000 to 12,000 square feet. Yong, his son Wai Kin, and their guests stayed in Villa 8881. Wei Seng Phua (\"Phua\"), his son Wai Kit Phua (\"Wai Kit\"), and their guests stayed in Villa 8882. Hui Tang and his guests stayed in Villa 8888.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During this stay, a Caesars employee entered Villa 8888 to check on the condition of the suite. The employee noticed an array of computers and computer monitors that were not normally present in the room and were arranged in an unusual configuration. The employee reported the presence of the computers to his supervisors. Caesars technical support and security staff discovered that the guests of Villa 8888 had requested the installation of an unusual amount of technical equipment, including eight computers, multiple monitors, three televisions connected to three different cable/satellite television providers, desk telephones, and enhanced Digital Subscriber Line (\"DSL\") internet access. The Caesars management was concerned that the arrangement could be used to operate an illegal sports book. Caesars informed the Nevada Gaming Control Board (\"NGCB\"), which informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which opened an investigation. The FBI suspected that the individuals in the three villas were jointly participating in an illegal betting operation but lacked sufficient evidence to pursue a case against anyone except the individuals staying in Villa 8888.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After brainstorming about how to \"tighten up the [probable cause],\" and with assistance from a contractor responsible for internet services at Caesars, the FBI agents and the assistant United States Attorney assigned to the case devised a plan to search the villas without obtaining a warrant. FBI agents, together with NGCB agents and the cooperating IT contractor, attempted to disrupt the DSL internet service to villas 8882 and 8888, the Phua and Tang villas respectively. They did so in the hope of generating a call for service-and with such a call, the opportunity to enter the villas. No call for service came, but someone in Villa 8882 requested a laptop. Seizing on the opportunity, the contractor and an FBI agent posing as the contractor's employee went to deliver the laptop. When they entered Villa 8882, the contractor and the agent heard what sounded like a sporting event playing in the background, but a butler prevented them from going further into the suite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime later, the contractor received a service call from Villa 8881 reporting that the internet was not working. Realizing that he had accidentally disrupted the internet service for Villa 8881 instead of Villas 8882 and 8888, the contractor reconnected Villa 8881's internet and then entered Villa 8881 to look around, acting as though he was responding to the service call even though he had already fixed the disruption. The contractor carried on a fake telephone conversation \"to make it\n   look like [he was] there for a legitimate purpose,\" and recorded the visit on his cell phone. Yong was present in Villa 8881 while the contractor was there, looking at what appeared to the contractor to be a sports website of some kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, the contractor tried to disrupt the service to Villa 8882 again and this time succeeded. After Phua told the butler on duty that the internet was not working, the butler put in a call for service. Two agents masquerading as technicians and wearing body cameras responded to the call so they could look for incriminating evidence. When they entered Villa 8882, the agents found Phua sitting at a laptop computer, viewing a sports betting site. On Phua's computer, the agents also saw an open instant messaging window containing the words \"good luck on the hedge bet,\" or something similar. Another person was also viewing a sports-betting website, but he quickly switched to viewing the Google search page when he noticed an agent approaching. Yong was there as well, visiting from Villa 8881, but he was not using a laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The agents, with the help of an assistant United States Attorney, filed a warrant application to search Villas 8881, 8882, and 8888. The warrant application omitted the fact that the agents had only been able to enter the villas by surreptitiously disrupting the DSL. In fact, the agents created multiple documents designed to give the false impression that the internet outages had been fortuitous, rather than orchestrated by the FBI. In addition, the warrant application asserted that the contractor, on his visit to Villa 8881 after the accidental disruption of internet service to that suite, saw Yong monitoring \"odds for illegal sports gambling,\" even though, as the contractor later admitted, nothing about the website indicated that it was illegal, or even gambling-related at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The magistrate judge signed the warrant on July 9, 2014, and it was executed the same day. Yong was present when agents executed the warrant on Villa 8881, the villa where Yong and Wai Kin were staying. The search of that villa revealed gambling ledgers containing names, win/loss records, and percentages paid to various representatives and associates. Agents executing the Villa 8882 warrant found Phua, Phua's son, and Wai Kin, Yong's son, watching while a World Cup soccer match played on the television. All three were sitting in front of laptop computers viewing a sports betting website displaying real-time betting odds for the soccer game. The laptops also displayed instant messaging windows. Wai Kin's laptop, logged into the betting website showed an available balance of $ 1.6 million U.S. dollars. The agents found ledgers in Villa 8882 similar to those found in Villa 8881.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Five days later, the Government filed a criminal complaint charging eight defendants-including Yong and Wai Kin-with federal felonies, including the operation of an illegal gambling business in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201955\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and violations of the Wire Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201084\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants were arrested and subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the course of pre-trial discovery, the Government produced a tape recording that alerted Yong and the other defendants to the fact that the Government had intentionally disrupted the DSL to gain entry into the villas. On October 27, 2014, Phua, Phua's son, Yong, and Wai Kin filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the hotel rooms, both before and after the execution of the warrant, as well as all fruits thereof. The next day, they also filed a motion arguing that the Government's misrepresentations and omissions\n   to the magistrate judge tainted the search warrant under\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), arguing that the fruits of the search warrant must be suppressed on that basis as well. In the motions, the defendants argued that the Government invalidly obtained their consent to enter by intentionally disrupting the DSL in the defendants' villas, concealed that fact from the magistrate judge, and made numerous additional intentional or reckless misstatements in the warrant affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Government responded to the motions in November 2014, conceding that it intentionally disrupted the DSL service to the villas but arguing that its actions were nonetheless constitutional. The Government did not, however, fully admit the extent of its actions at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the briefing on the motions was complete, but before the evidentiary hearing on the motions, Yong and four of his co-defendants negotiated pleas. Yong agreed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor of acting as an accessory after the fact to co-defendant Hui Tang's violations of the Wire Act, as set forth in a superseding criminal information. His plea agreement explained that it was part of a \"group plea.\" It was conditioned upon each of five defendants pleading guilty and upon the court accepting those pleas. The agreement also stated that \"[i]n exchange for defendant SENG CHEN YONG and [four other defendants] entering their group pleas, the Government will move to dismiss the charges pending against Wai Kin Yong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Yong and the Government agreed to recommend a sentence of five years of unsupervised probation and a fine of $ 100,000. They further agreed that Yong would depart the country immediately and not return for five years. Yong also agreed to forfeit his interest in certain property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 10, 2014, the district court conducted a hearing to decide whether to accept Yong's plea. The court explained to Yong that the purpose of the hearing was \"to make sure that you understand the consequences of a guilty plea,\" and \"to make sure that you are entering into this plea and this agreement with the Government knowingly, voluntarily, and that you are not being forced or coerced into this agreement and into this plea.\" The court then asked several questions to assess whether Yong's plea was intelligent and voluntary. Near the beginning of the colloquy, the court asked Yong, \"[h]ave any threats or promises been made to you to get you to waive your right to an indictment?\" to which Yong responded \"No.\" The court also asked the Government to provide its understanding of the plea agreement, whereupon the Government clarified, among other things, that it was a group plea proposal, that Yong was the last defendant to satisfy the group condition, and that the Government would dismiss charges against Wai Kin if the plea were accepted. The court again asked Yong if \"anyone threatened [him] in order to get [him] to plead guilty,\" or if anyone was \"forcing [him] in any way to plead guilty,\" to which his answer was again \"No.\" The court entered a judgment of conviction and sentenced Yong to five years of unsupervised probation. At the end of the hearing and after it had accepted Yong's plea and imposed his sentence, the court was made aware that Wai Kin was Yong's son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Phua and his son did not plead guilty and pressed on with the motion to suppress. After a four-day evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge issued two reports recommending that the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   motion be granted because the warrant affidavit contained material omissions and misrepresentations that, once removed,\n   left the warrant lacking probable cause sufficient to support the search. At the same time, the magistrate judge concluded that the warrantless entry to drop off the laptop did not violate the Phuas' Fourth Amendment rights because the occupants had validly consented to the entry. The magistrate judge also held, however, that the agents' thwarted attempt to enter the interior of the villa exceeded the scope of that consent, so any evidence gathered from that attempted entry should be suppressed. The agents' entry while posing as technicians to repair the DSL disruption was also justified by the Phuas' consent, the magistrate judge opined, even though the agents had misleadingly obtained the consent by intentionally disrupting the DSL as part of their ruse to gain access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Several months later, the district court rejected the magistrate judge's recommendation in part and granted Phua's motions\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to suppress the Government's evidence in full. Specifically, the court held that the Government had repeatedly violated the Fourth Amendment by disrupting internet service to the villas in order to gain entry and by submitting a warrant affidavit containing multiple intentional and reckless falsehoods and omissions in violation of\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   . Shortly afterward, the court dismissed the charges against Phua.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Yong then moved to vacate his conviction in the district court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on three grounds. First, he argued that the Government committed misconduct in its investigation and prosecution of the case sufficient to render his plea involuntary. Second, he argued that it was unlawful to condition dismissal of charges against Wai Kin on Yong's plea because the Government lacked probable cause to prosecute Wai Kin. The district court denied Yong's motion without a hearing but granted a certificate of appealability as to all three issues raised in the motion. Yong moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review a district court's denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion de novo,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yong argues that his guilty plea was not voluntary for two reasons: (1) the Government impermissibly conditioned leniency for Wai Kin on Yong's guilty plea, and (2) the Government's misconduct was so pervasive as to have coerced Yong's plea. The Government does not deny using the charges against Wai Kin as a bargaining chip in its plea negotiations with Yong, nor does it deny engaging\n   in misconduct during the investigation. Nevertheless, the Government maintains that its actions did not render Yong's guilty plea involuntary, because (1) the Government had probable cause to prosecute Wai Kin at the time of Yong's plea and (2) Yong's plea was knowing and voluntary despite the earlier misconduct. Lastly, the Government mounts a procedural attack on the claims in Yong's \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, arguing that he has not shown cause for his failure to raise these issues on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Before considering Yong's challenges to the voluntariness of his plea, we first address the Government's procedural argument on the motion to vacate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yong asserts two bases for cause to excuse this default. First, Yong argues that \"he had every reason to expect that if he sought to appeal, the [G]overnment would act vindictively toward his son.\" According to Yong, this \"ongoing threat\" of reinstatement of charges against Wai Kin, or Wai Kin's indictment on new charges, effectively negated Yong's ability to challenge the voluntariness of his plea on direct appeal.

Further, he was logged into the laptop using the login name \"WaiKin.\" He was seated near Phua, who it was later discovered had exchanged hundreds of messages regarding a large-scale illegal sports book, and Phua's son Wai Kit. The World Cup tournament was the subject of the gambling operation and Wai Kin, Phua, and Wai Kit were seemingly engaged in parallel activity when the agents entered Villa 8882. Moreover, hand-written ledgers documenting bets were found in both Villas 8881 and 8882. Viewing these uncontested observations through a \"practical\" and \"common-sensical\" lens, there was a fair probability that criminal activity was afoot and that Wai Kin was involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    568 U.S. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We are mindful that \"[a]s a corollary ... of the rule that the police may rely on the totality of facts available to them in establishing probable cause, they also may not disregard facts tending to dissipate probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yong contends that this means probable cause regarding Wai Kin had dissipated by the time of the plea. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The results of the investigation did not alter the agents' observations of Wai Kin when they entered Villa 8882, or the reasonable\n   inferences drawn from those observations. The observations of Wai Kin in Villa 8882 were consistent with his involvement in the illegal gambling operation. Monitoring the live odds of the soccer match was a task that could advance the illegal gambling operation, and Wai Kin was seated with Phua and Wai Kit, who were engaged in similar activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, while the investigation produced no additional evidence implicating Wai Kin in the operation, it is not improbable that Wai Kin was assisting the gambling operation by monitoring the live odds of the match when the agents entered the villa. Nor does the absence of additional evidence render improbable that Wai Kin could have assisted the gambling operation in ways that would not leave an electronic trail. Because probable cause does not require demonstrating actual criminal activity, only a probability or substantial chance of such activity, we cannot say the Government was without probable cause as to Wai Kin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    568 U.S. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p244\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485624\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/919/#p924\">\n    264 F.3d at 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, the investigation's failure to uncover further evidence implicating Wai Kin in the gambling operation certainly undermined the likelihood of a conviction should the Government have proceeded against him.
