In\n   <em>\n    Pettis\n   </em>\n   , using the categorical approach to determine whether a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the force clause, we reviewed prior Minnesota decisions and\n   concluded that \"state caselaw supports a finding that Minnesota simple robbery requires violent force and qualifies as a predicate offense under the ACCA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516750\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/962/\">\n    888 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   966 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Stat. \u00a7 812.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (1995). The Florida Supreme Court interpreted the statute to require \"resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

By contrast, \"[t]he snatching or grabbing of property without such resistance by the victim\" is theft, not robbery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12024988\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/883/#p886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12024988\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/883/#p886\">\n    at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   held that \"the force necessary to overcome a victim's physical resistance is inherently 'violent' in the sense contemplated by\n   <em>\n    [Curtis] Johnson\n   </em>\n   \" because \"robbery that must overcome a victim's will ... necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle,\" even if the altercation does not cause pain or injury and is not prolonged. 139 S. Ct. at 553. \"Robbery under Florida law corresponds to that level of force,\" the Court concluded, \"and therefore qualifies as a 'violent felony' under ACCA's [force] clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 555.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As relevant here, Minnesota's simple robbery statute is virtually indistinguishable from the Florida statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   . In both States, a mere \"snatching\" of property, without more, is not the level of force required. Instead, to constitute robbery, the defendant must use, attempt to use, or threaten to use enough physical force to \"overcome\" a victim's \"resistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12024988\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/883/#p886\">\n    692 So. 2d at 886-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1993). But the force clause defines \"violent felony\" as including \"any crime\" that has the requisite use of force \"as an element.\" Thus, it is irrelevant whether the state law \"robbery\" crime at issue is broader than common law robbery. The question is whether, categorically, the crime involves \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i). Notably, the Florida robbery statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   prohibited use of force \"in the course of the taking,\" which the statute defined to include acts committed after the taking if those acts \"and the act of taking constitute a continuous series of acts or events.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n    Fla.

Thus, like the other state court decisions reviewed in\n   <em>\n    Libby\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pettis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   \"supports a finding that [the crime of] Minnesota simple robbery requires violent force.\" Like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Libby\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pettis\n   </em>\n   , Taylor cites no contrary state court decision. Therefore, after careful consideration, we conclude that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   reinforced -- and certainly did not cast doubt on -- our decision in\n   <em>\n    Pettis\n   </em>\n   that a prior Minnesota conviction for the crime of simple robbery is a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA's force clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516750\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/962/\">\n    888 F.3d at 964-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judgment of the district court denying Taylor's motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Honorable Joan N.
