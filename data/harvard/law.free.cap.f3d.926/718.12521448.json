The indictment alleged a scheme to use a government-sponsored program to lure young women students from Kazakhstan to Florida by promising them clerical work in an office. Instead, the students arrived to learn that they had to perform sexual acts for the defendant's paying customers. The government's challenge was that the students had returned to Kazakhstan and refused to testify, requiring the government to use other sources of proof. The defense challenge was that the evidence amply proved guilt. The major issues on appeal are the admissibility and sufficiency of that evidence, the accuracy of the jury instructions, and the application of a sentencing enhancement. We find that no issue presents reversible error, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Ishmetova sent Cooper pictures and resumes for four students, XM, DK, BA, and AA. Ishmetova worked with Cooper to fill out the \"Self-Arranged Job Offer\" forms needed for the students to receive J-1 visas. Ishmetova relayed Cooper's job offers to the Center for Cultural Interchange (CCI), a Program sponsor. Cooper described the jobs in his Facebook messages and on the written offers as \"answering phones, doing clerical work, organizing retreats, and making appointments for massage, private yoga, et cetera.\" The job offers listed \"Dr. Janardana Dasa\" as the employer and the Bayshore Yacht and Tennis Club apartment complex later linked to Cooper as the location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CCI called the phone number listed on Cooper's job offers. The man answering the phone identified himself as \"Janardana\" and confirmed that the students would be doing clerical work for $ 12 per hour and that each would receive housing for $ 70 per week. Cooper told Ishmetova via Facebook that CCI had approved his job offers and that he wanted more foreign students to do \"[c]lerical work, computer work, [and to] set[ ] up appointments.\" Ishmetova, at Cooper's direction, submitted identical job offers for AO and ZR. CCI sponsored J-1 visas for AO, ZR, DK, BA, and XM to work as receptionists at \"Janardana's Yoga &amp; Wellness\" studio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cooper's real business was not yoga. It was selling sexual services to paying clients. Cooper's former employees testified that they gave his male clients erotic massages and had sexual intercourse with them. Cooper ran the business from apartments he leased at the Bayshore Yacht and Tennis Club. The clients would pay Cooper, who would give a percentage to his employees. Cooper booked the clients and used text messages or calls to give instructions to his employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cooper posted advertisements on the website \"Backpage\" for the sexual services he offered. The IP address listed the subscriber as Jeffrey Cooper, with Dr. Janardana Dasa as an associated name. The advertisements used a phone number ending in 6115, the same number used on the Kazakhstani students' job offers and on Cooper's lease agreements with the Bayshore Yacht and Tennis Club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 12, 2011, a Backpage advertisement posted by Jeff Cooper advertised \"travel students\" who would give \"erotic full body massages\" in Miami Beach. An advertisement Cooper had posted a few weeks before AO and ZR arrived offered \"exotic full body rubs\" and \"tantric treatments\" from foreign women. Another Backpage advertisement from the same account promised \"attractive exchange students\" offering \"body rubs\" in California, for a limited time. Cooper also operated another prostitution business in California, occasionally flying employees from Miami to California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cooper used the \"Dasa\" Facebook account to send AO and ZR Facebook messages about their arrival in Miami. AO and\n   ZR arrived in June 2011. Government investigators and Cooper's former employees testified at Cooper's trial that the students were shocked when they learned that they were in fact hired to perform sexual massages with \"happy endings.\" The students sought replacement jobs and alternative housing that they could afford, without success. Cooper sent Ishmetova a Facebook message complaining that AO and ZR were not cooperating in his business to \"provide sensual massages to wealthy clients.\" Cooper suggested that if the students refused, they would lose their work, their pay, and their housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on a call from the relative of another exchange student working for \"Dasa,\" CCI became concerned that the students were performing sexual services. CCI contacted \"Dasa,\" using the phone number that was used on Cooper's job offers and on the Backpage advertisements, to ask about the relative's claims. The man answering the phone denied that the students were giving any massages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cooper purchased plane tickets for AO and ZR to travel to California in August 2011. Before AO and ZR could leave, a government sting operation removed them from Cooper's business. An undercover detective contacted the number on Cooper's Backpage advertisements. The person who answered told the detective to go to a Bayshore Yacht and Tennis Club apartment. The detective met AO and ZR at the apartment, was told the cost of having sex with them, and paid. Agents then raided Cooper's apartments, finding Cooper's phone, AO's and ZR's belongings, and a business card for \"Dr. Janardana Dasa.\" The phone contained client-contact information and texts directing clients to Cooper's apartments. The government found apartment visitor logs showing about 50 visitors to Cooper's apartments from June 1 to August 4, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2011, AO cooperated with the government in a monitored call placed to the phone number listed on the Backpage advertisements and on the CCI job offers. AO and ZR then returned to Kazakhstan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cooper continued operating his sex business. In October 2012, an undercover agent contacted the 6115 number and talked with Cooper about providing \"full service\" and \"sensually erotic massages.\" In November 2012, agents carried out another sting operation, with cooperation from one of Cooper's employees. The government detained that employee after she met and negotiated prices with an undercover agent who had made an appointment based on a Backpage advertisement. The employee handed over text messages discussing selling sexual services, sent to and received from the 6115 number. That number was listed in her phone as Janardana's. Cooper told an employee in 2015 that he was operating an erotic massage business in Miami using the 6115 number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2016, government agents went to Cooper's apartment complex to interview Cooper. Cooper admitted that he had represented himself as \"Janardana Dasa\" and that he had made the CCI job offers in 2011 listing himself as the host employer. Cooper told the agents that he owned and used the \"Dr. Janardana Dasa\" Facebook account that was used to communicate with Ishmetova. He claimed that AO and ZR \"didn't want to do\" clerical work for him when they arrived in Miami and were instead taught how to perform sensual massages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cooper was arrested in 2016. Electronic devices and a notebook seized during the arrest included information about his prostitution business. Cooper's 2011 bank records showed that he had deposited tens of thousands of dollars in cash and paid at\n   least $ 1,399.96 for Backpage advertisements that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A jury convicted Cooper on all counts. The district court sentenced him to 360 months in prison and 60 months on supervised release, and imposed $ 8,640 in restitution. Cooper appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Confrontation Clause and Hearsay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An appellant must adequately brief each issue by \"plainly and prominently\" raising it.\n   <em>\n    Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084174\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/678/#p681\">\n    739 F.3d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Cooper listed 26 separate hearsay errors, with record cites but no argument or explanation. Cooper did not provide an adequate basis to raise these issues; he failed to preserve his claims of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to the briefing deficiency, Cooper admitted on appeal that 14 of his evidentiary-error claims do not involve testimonial statements, meaning that these Confrontation Clause challenges fail as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275498\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/813/#p821\">\n    547 U.S. 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275498\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/813/#p821\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275498\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/813/#p821\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Only three hearsay and Confrontation Clause issues deserve any discussion. The first two involve Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Nguyen's testimony about the students' and Ishmetova's mental states and about statements made by men who went to Cooper's apartments to buy sexual services. The third concerns the authentication of Cooper's voice on two monitored phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, but we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   whether hearsay statements are testimonial under the Confrontation Clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Caraballo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216465\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1214/#p1226\">\n    595 F.3d 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1226 (11th Cir. 2010). Hearsay errors are harmless \"if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the verdict, or had but very slight effect.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Magluta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8941446\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/1166/#p1180\">\n    418 F.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"For violations of the Confrontation Clause, harmless error occurs where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Caraballo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216465\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1214/#p1226\">\n    595 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1229 n.1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Agent Nguyen's Testimony About AO's, ZR's, and Ishmetova's Mental States\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   AO, ZR, the other students, and Ishmetova all refused to leave Kazakhstan to testify in Cooper's trial or to give deposition testimony in their home country. Cooper challenges the district court's admission, over his objection, of Agent Nguyen's testimony that AO, ZR, and Ishmetova stayed in Kazakhstan and refused to testify because they feared humiliation, embarrassment, and further stress. Cooper argues that Agent Nguyen's testimony about AO's, ZR's, and Ishmetova's states of mind was hearsay and violated the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Even if Agent Nguyen's testimony included hearsay, otherwise \"inadmissible extrinsic evidence is admissible on redirect as rebuttal evidence, when defense counsel has opened the door to such evidence during cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541047\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1493/#p1500\">\n    898 F.2d 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1500 (11th Cir. 1990). Cooper's counsel asked Agent Nguyen during cross-examination why AO and ZR did not testify. He asked Agent Nguyen about the government's authority\n   to require the students to stay in the United States to testify at Cooper's trial by using material-witness warrants. Cooper's counsel also asked Agent Nguyen why the defense could not depose or question Ishmetova. Defense counsel opened the door to Agent Nguyen's testimony on cross-examination about Ishmetova's and the students' decisions to stay in Kazakhstan and not testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Elliott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031419\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/849/554/#p559\">\n    849 F.2d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (11th Cir. 1988). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Cooper also argues a Confrontation Clause violation because he could not confront AO, ZR, or Ishmetova at trial. But Agent Nguyen did not offer testimonial statements from these individuals. Testimonial statements are \"solemn declaration[s] or affirmation[s] made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p51\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p51\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p51\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (quoting 2 N. WEBSTER, AN AMERICAN DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1828)). While \"statements by a witness during police questioning\" are generally testimonial,\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Clark\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590213\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2173/#p2179\">\n    135 S.

Because Agent Nguyen had questioned AO, ZR, and Ishmetova to understand why they refused to testify, not to investigate or establish any fact that was part of an element of the charged offenses or necessary to prove Cooper's guilt, their statements were not testimonial and did not implicate the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Statements by the Men Listed on the Visitor Logs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Cooper argues that the district court erred by admitting Agent Nguyen's testimony on redirect examination about statements made to him by men whose names were listed in the visitor logs for apartments Cooper leased for his sex business. Defense counsel cross-examined Agent Nguyen about whether the logbooks could show that the visitors were merely Airbnb guests, not clients paying for sexual services. On redirect, Agent Nguyen testified that the men told him that they came \"in response to the Backpage ad to receive [sexual] services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defense's cross-examination questions opened the door to the government's questions on redirect about why the logs showed that the apartments were being used to sell sexual services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541047\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1493/#p1500\">\n    898 F.2d at 1500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Agent Nguyen questioned the visitors during his investigation, to gain facts probative of Cooper's guilt. Their statements were testimonial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Any error in admitting them was, however, harmless. The government introduced substantial evidence showing that Cooper used the apartments for his business, including testimony by Cooper's employees. Agent Nguyen testified that the logs showed that most of the visitors were local, making it highly unlikely that they were renting the apartments. Any error \"did not contribute to the verdict obtained,\n   \" beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Caraballo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216465\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1214/#p1226\">\n    595 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1229 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Authentication of Cooper's Voice on the AO and Agent Velez Calls\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Cooper argues that Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Wolynetz's testimony that AO had identified Cooper's voice during a monitored phone call she placed was inadmissible hearsay, and that because AO did not testify at trial, Agent Wolynetz's testimony and related exhibits violated the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[E]vidence that a call was made to the number assigned ... to a particular person, if circumstances ... show that the person answering the phone was the one called\" is sufficient to authenticate a phone call and the participants. FED. R. EVID. 901(b)(6). The trial court had ample basis besides AO's statement to Agent Wolynetz to find that the voice on the recorded call was Cooper's. The male voice on the phone call discussed the \"yoga studio,\" responded to the name \"Jeff,\" talked about his interactions with CCI, and mentioned a note to him identifying him as \"J.\" These recorded statements, coupled with the government's evidence tying the 6115 number AO used to place the monitored call to Cooper, showed that Cooper was the speaker. The district court did not err in finding the voice on the phone call to be Cooper's and admitting the related exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Cooper's statements on the phone call were admissible as those of a party-opponent.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Munoz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534537\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/16/1116/#p1120\">\n    16 F.3d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (11th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FED. R. EVID. 801(d)(2)(A). And AO's statements on the recording were not hearsay because they were not admitted to prove the truth of the matters asserted, but to give context to the admissible statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the Confrontation Clause \"does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted,\" and because these statements were not hearsay, the district court did not err or violate Cooper's Confrontation Clause rights in admitting them.\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p51\">\n    541 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   59 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p51\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Cooper also argues that the district court erred in admitting the monitored call Agent Velez placed to the 6115 number because the court did not authenticate that Cooper was the speaker on that call. Agent Velez testified that she called the 6115 phone number listed on the Backpage advertisement posted by \"Jeff Coop\" at the Miami Beach IP address, and that the speaker identified himself as \"Jay\" during the conversation. There was no error in admitting this exhibit or allowing the testimony about the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Agent Nguyen's Testimony About the Students' Statements to Kazakhstani Police\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Cooper argues that the district court erred in admitting Agent Nguyen's testimony explaining how DK, XM, and BA's answers to the Kazakhstani police showed a lack of candor and explaining why they might have lied. Cooper called Agent Nguyen as a witness after the prosecution rested, asking him to testify about statements the students had made to the Kazakhstani police. On cross-examination by the government, Agent Nguyen testified that it was suspicious that DK, XM, and BA gave identical answers to the same questions the police separately asked each of them, and he explained that witnesses may not be honest when they are embarrassed or ashamed of what they did. Cooper contends that \"Agent Nguyen invaded the province of the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At trial, it was Cooper who first sought to admit Agent Nguyen's testimony about DK, XM, and BA's statements to the Kazakhstani police, to rebut the CCI records showing that these students had decided not to go to Miami because they did not want to do sexual massages. Cooper's counsel acknowledged that the statements he sought to admit were hearsay, but he urged the trial court to admit the testimony about the statements \"in the interest of fairness.\" The district court explained that if Cooper's counsel elicited testimony from Agent Nguyen about what students told the Kazakhstani police, then the government would be able to ask Agent Nguyen \"to explain why\" the investigators \"didn't rely on it.\" The district court allowed Cooper to call Agent Nguyen and ask him about the students' statements to Kazakhstani police and then allowed Agent Nguyen to testify on cross-examination, over Cooper's objection, about why the government did not find those statements reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"It is 'a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government does not have to prove that the unlawful objective was accomplished or that the referenced State law was actually violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The unlawful activity alleged in Count Four is a business enterprise involving prostitution and related acts in violation of the laws of Florida. Section 796.07 of the Florida Statutes provides, in part, that it is unlawful to offer to commit, or to commit, or to engage in, prostitution or to aid, abet, or participate in prostitution. The statute defines \"prostitution\" as the giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire but excludes sexual activity between spouses. In turn, \"sexual activity\" means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another; anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; or the handling or fondling of the sexual organ of another for the purpose of masturbation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Cooper argues that the words \"prostitution and related acts\" allowed the jury to convict him for acts that did not violate the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Read in context, these words did not create a \"substantial and [in]eradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
