The state court overturned that conviction on direct appeal. So the State retried Langley and re-convicted him. Langley now seeks federal habeas relief. He argues his prior\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   should be construed as an implicit\n   <em>\n    acquittal\n   </em>\n   that bars the re-conviction and allows him to walk free. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While on parole for a prior child-molestation conviction, Ricky Langley choked a\n   six-year-old boy into unconsciousness and then, to ensure the child was dead, strangled him with a ligature and shoved a sock into the child's mouth. Langley stuffed the boy's corpse in a bedroom closet and lied to the child's mother when she came looking for her son. Langley then waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and repeatedly confessed on video to molesting and killing the boy. Police found the child's body, wearing a t-shirt soaked in Langley's semen, in the closet where Langley left him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State of Louisiana thrice tried and thrice convicted Langley for his heinous crime. The second and third trials lie at the heart of this case. But we explain all three for the sake of completeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Langley I.\n   </em>\n   A Louisiana jury unanimously convicted Langley of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. For reasons unrelated to this case, Langley's first conviction was remanded on direct appeal in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court based its holding on state law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321284\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/958/1160/#p1170\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing LA.

But its holding accords with longstanding double jeopardy law because, \"[h]istorically, courts have treated greater and lesser-included offenses as the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, so a conviction on one normally precludes a later trial on the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Currier v.

Having lost before two juries, Langley decided to try his luck with a bench trial the third time around. Given the facts and his repeated videotaped confessions, however, the trial judge convicted him of second-degree murder. The court found as a matter of fact that Langley had specific intent to kill because, after their \"sexual encounter,\" Langley thought death would \"do this little boy a favor.\" The court again sentenced Langley to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Langley again appealed. This time he argued the Double Jeopardy Clause should have prohibited the State from retrying him for second-degree specific-intent murder. That result is compelled, Langley said, by\n   <em>\n    Ashe v. Swenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/\">\n    397 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).\n   <em>\n    Ashe\n   </em>\n   identified a \"collateral estoppel\" \"ingredient\" in the Double Jeopardy Clause and held it precludes a retrial for any issue necessarily determined by a jury's general verdict of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/\">\n    at 442-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, Langley was not\n   <em>\n    acquitted\n   </em>\n   of second-degree murder in\n   <em>\n    Langley II\n   </em>\n   ; he was\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   . Langley nonetheless argued\n   <em>\n    Ashe\n   </em>\n   should be extended to his facts. Langley reasoned\n   the jury-which simply adjudged him \"GUILTY,\" without specifying why-logically must have based its verdict on second-degree\n   <em>\n    felony\n   </em>\n   murder. If so, Langley hypothesized, the\n   <em>\n    Langley II\n   </em>\n   jury could've determined he lacked specific intent. And if all these hypotheses and deductions are true, Langley concluded, the State should be barred from retrying him for any offense that has specific intent as an element-including second-degree specific-intent murder.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The state courts rejected Langley's effort to extend\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

The state appellate court first evaluated the record \"to discern which facts were 'necessarily determined' \" by the jury's guilty verdict in\n    <em>\n     Langley II\n    </em>\n    .\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The only way to determine what the jury actually and necessarily determined is to evaluate what the jury actually and necessarily did-namely, convict Langley of second-degree murder. Although the state court recognized it was \"possible that the jury verdict was based on a jury finding under the felony-murder rule,\" the court noted it was equally likely the jury based its verdict on second-degree specific-intent murder as an alternative to first-degree murder.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It was also possible the jury convicted Langley of second-degree murder as a \"compromise verdict\"-that is, a verdict that did not reflect the jury's actual findings, but instead represented a compromise punishment of life in prison that was palatable to all jurors.\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . Because the jury could have reached its second-degree murder conviction without\n    <em>\n     necessarily\n    </em>\n    finding Langley lacked specific intent to kill, the Louisiana court held Langley \"ha[d] not carried his burden of proving that the element of specific intent was actually decided [in his favor] in the previous trial\" to preclude the relitigation of that issue in the third trial.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     at 758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Langley filed a federal habeas petition.

As Sir Edward Coke described it, \"the maxim of the common law is, that the life of a man shall not be twice ... put in jeopardy for one and the same offence, and that is the reason and cause that\n    <em>\n     auterfoits\n    </em>\n    acquitted or convicted of the same offence is a good plea.\"\n    <em>\n     Vaux's Case\n    </em>\n    (1591), 76 Eng.

Representative Egbert Benson objected because the draft varied from \"the right heretofore established\" by the common law.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 781. To cure the defect, Benson suggested striking the phrase regarding \"one trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 782. Representative Roger Sherman agreed. He reasoned, \"if [the defendant] was convicted on the first [trial], and any thing should appear to set the judgment aside, he was entitled to a second, which was certainly favorable to him.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    The House revised it accordingly, and the Senate concurred in the revision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    S.

V. Madison's initial phrasing (\"more than one punishment or one trial\") was thus replaced with a prohibition on putting a person in \"jeopardy\" more than once.

It might be possible to identify that something and preclude the government from submitting it to a second jury.

The judge orally instructed the jury it\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    premise its second-degree murder conviction on a finding of specific intent. During its deliberations, the jury sent a note asking for \"the instruction sheet\" on \"specific intent\" (among other things). The judge provided the jury with written instructions that again told the jury it\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    convict Langley of second-degree murder based on specific intent. Langley never objected to any of this at trial. To the contrary, counsel for the State and the\n    defense had a colloquy with the trial judge over this exact instruction. And everyone agreed the jury should be instructed on second-degree specific-intent murder. Then at oral argument before our\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    Court, Langley's counsel conceded the jury was given the option of returning a legally valid conviction of second-degree specific-intent murder.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Oral Argument at 9:08-9:29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    We are aware of no case from any court that would allow us to infer a jury \"irrationally\" chose a concededly valid option offered in the instructions. It was therefore wrong to hold, as the panel did, that no \"rational jury could have convicted Langley of specific intent second degree murder.\"\n    <em>\n     Langley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516963\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/504/#p521\">\n     890 F.3d at 521\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation and alteration omitted). Under\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review, we hold the state court was objectively correct to find \"[i]t is possible that the jury convicted the defendant of specific intent second degree murder.\"\n    <em>\n     Langley IV\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Langley therefore cannot prove the jury \"actually determined\" the issue of specific intent in his favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Second, and for similar reasons, Langley cannot prove the issue of specific intent was \"necessary\" or \"essential to the judgment\" even under the (broader) civil preclusion rules.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS \u00a7 27 (one prerequisite of preclusion is the issue was \"essential to the judgment\"); SHAPIRO ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 177 (same). Under Louisiana law, a jury can find a defendant overwhelmingly guilty of first-degree murder and\n    <em>\n     still\n    </em>\n    choose to convict of second-degree murder.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Porter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339008\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/1137/#p1140\">\n     639 So. 2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1140 ; LA. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN . art. 814(A)(1) (responsive verdicts to \"First Degree Murder\" include \"Guilty of second degree murder\"). In accordance with this law, the jury was repeatedly instructed it could find every element of first-degree murder-including specific intent-and still choose to return a verdict of second-degree murder. The jury also was instructed it could convict of second-degree murder without finding specific intent. That means the jury could return its lawful second-degree murder conviction after (a) finding specific intent, (b) finding no specific intent, or (c) declining to consider the question of specific intent. To infer why the\n    <em>\n     Langley II\n    </em>\n    jury convicted him only on second-degree murder \"would require speculation into what transpired in the jury room,\" and would require us to \"scrutinize\" the jury's \"failures to decide\" rather than its actual decision.\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     557 U.S. at 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We cannot do that. The existence of three possibilities for the actual verdict means the issue of specific intent was not essential to the judgment. And since there could be no preclusion even under the broader civil preclusion rules, there certainly can be no issue preclusion under\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    . Again, the state court's judgment would survive\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Langley IV\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Moreover, the instructions gave the jury a rational reason not to decide the issue. If the jury wanted to reconvene for a punishment hearing to sentence Langley to death, it would have to confront the specific-intent issue, find it, and convict him of first-degree murder. But if the jury chose second-degree murder, it could convict without deciding the specific-intent issue, avoid a separate sentencing hearing, and ensure Langley would spend the rest of his life behind bars. The jury instructions were explicit to that effect: \"Whoever commits the crime of Second Degree Murder shall be punished by life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\" And Langley's lawyer used these instructions to plead for the jury's mercy. The record suggests the jury might've chosen\n    second-degree murder for precisely this reason.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Langley II\n    </em>\n    Sentencing Tr. at 15-16 (May 22, 2003). The state court therefore was objectively correct to conclude the jury could have avoided deciding the specific-intent issue by reaching a \"compromise verdict\" that sentenced Langley to life in prison.\n    <em>\n     Langley IV\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Third and finally, Langley cannot prove the issue of specific intent was decided in a \"valid and final\" judgment even under the (broader) civil preclusion rules.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS \u00a7 27 (one prerequisite of preclusion is the issue was decided in a \"valid and final\" civil judgment); SHAPIRO ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 176 (\"In addition to the requirement of 'validity,' a judgment must be 'final' to be entitled to recognition.\").

We previously discussed the former; here we're discussing the latter. The dissenters appear confused over which standard applies where.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Their second response is imaginary. The dissenters posit a hypothetical jury trial\n    with instructions that were never actually given. It's simply not true the judge instructed the jurors \"to begin with the single charge of first degree murder and ... work their way down through the list of responsive verdicts.\"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 182 (Higginson, J., dissenting).

The actual jury instructions said the exact opposite: The court instructed the jury it\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    find Langley guilty of \"SECOND DEGREE MURDER\" based on a finding \"THAT THE DEFENDANT ACTED WITH SPECIFIC INTENT TO KILL.\" The dissenters cannot find issue preclusion by ignoring the instructions given to the jury and imagining others that were not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Their third response is irrelevant. The dissenters make much of the jury instruction that said, \"[i]f you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [Langley] is guilty of first degree murder, your verdict should be 'guilty.' \"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 176 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (second alteration in original). The dissenters say this instruction prohibited the jury from returning a verdict for second-degree specific-intent murder. Of course, that ignores the other instructions that empowered the jury to return a \"SECOND DEGREE MURDER\" verdict based on a finding \"THAT THE DEFENDANT ACTED WITH SPECIFIC INTENT TO KILL.\" It ignores Langley's agreement-at trial and here-that the jury could return a verdict for second-degree specific-intent murder.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 165-66.

So, even an extension the Supreme Court itself has made is out of bounds if that extension came after the state court decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    As the majority opinion points out, the original panel opinion in this case did and would have to extend\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    , something we cannot do.

Thus, the AEDPA analysis ends there. The principal dissenting opinion's suggestion that the state court cited the right cases and perhaps reached a debatable result but applied the wrong reasoning is contrary to our limited AEDPA review particularly where, as here, the state court was examining state law and ruling on whether the jury's determinations in\n    <em>\n     Langley II\n    </em>\n    precluded Langley's conviction in\n    <em>\n     Langley III\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Majority Op. at 163.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Although the above is enough, another straightforward basis supports affirmance: Even if, as the dissenting opinions argue, we were to accept that applying\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    to an implied acquittal when there was an actual conviction is somehow not an extension of precedent, the Louisiana court's conclusion under\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    was objectively correct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

As the majority opinion observes, the trial court explicitly instructed the\n    <em>\n     Langley II\n    </em>\n    jury that it could convict Langley of second degree murder based on a finding of \"SPECIFIC INTENT TO KILL.\" Majority Op. at 169. The jury was further instructed, in line with Louisiana's responsive verdict rule, that second degree murder was a \"responsive lesser offense[ ]\" to first degree murder. Majority Op. at 161. Thus, under Louisiana law as explained in the jury instructions, even if the jury found that the evidence\n    <em>\n     supported\n    </em>\n    a conviction for first degree murder, it could nonetheless vote to convict Langley of second degree specific intent murder. This, then, is the logical flaw in the principal dissenting opinion: it assumes that, in returning a verdict of second degree murder, the jury\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    have determined that the evidence was insufficient for a first degree murder conviction.

But this ignores the\n    <em>\n     written\n    </em>\n    jury instructions stating that second degree murder was a proper responsive verdict as well.

In 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court, relying on both state and federal law, ruled that Langley's 2003 verdict acquitted him of first degree murder, barring retrial on that charge.\n    <em>\n     State v.

The majority does acknowledge that Langley was acquitted of first degree specific-intent murder in 2003. But the majority is unable to explain why that acquittal can bar retrial on the charge, yet not on the charge's elements. And so the majority attempts to rationalize the state court's decision in other ways.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    In Part III(A)(2), the majority suggests that the Louisiana Court of Appeal refused to extend\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    to implied acquittals on the theory that the law did not clearly establish that it was required to do so. But no extension was required, and the state court plainly believed that\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    applied. It explained that the \"Double Jeopardy Clause protects against successive prosecutions following acquittal or conviction\" and stated the correct\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    standard.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"370\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Next, in Part III(B)(1), the majority rationalizes the Louisiana Court of Appeal's decision with reference to\n    <em>\n     Schiro v.

The majority imports extended discussion, far more than of\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    itself, from the Second Restatement of Judgments, which the Supreme Court has never used to adjudicate an\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    claim. In place of the straightforward\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    inquiry explained above, the majority develops a novel set of \"essential prerequisites,\" analyzing Langley's claim under a framework that played no part in the Louisiana Court of Appeal's decision or in the State's arguments at any stage in this litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    In turn, the majority's wholesale substitution of principles, embraced without either district court or adversary treatment, broadly threatens double jeopardy doctrine. Rather than dealing squarely with Langley's argument that\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    preclusion flows from Langley's acquittal of first degree\n    murder in 2003, the majority's Restatement-based analysis sows doubt that any part of the 2003 verdict was a valid final judgment. In the process, the majority threatens a double jeopardy pillar: the \"unassailable\" finality of acquittals, even when \"based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\"\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     557 U.S. at 122-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fong Foo v.

Perhaps because its correct application yields an unthinkable result due to the horror of Langley's crime.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    The majority accurately describes the gruesome details, which shock and disgust. As it happens, Langley's 2003 jury had been instructed on predicate offenses for felony murder that were not enumerated in the felony murder statute at the time of Langley's offense. The State discovered this error on the eve of the 2009 trial, which appeared to close off the felony murder route to a new second degree murder conviction. That left the State in a bind: charge lesser offenses or retry the specific intent issue decided in Langley's favor in 2003. The State chose the latter, and here we are.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Though rejecting the State's choice may seem unthinkable, the monstrosity of Langley's crime does not put him beyond constitutional protection. The Constitution protects all, including the least and worst among us. Indeed, its safeguards against the profound deficiencies that marred Langley's first two trials are the reason that the majority is able to call Langley \"thrice-convicted.\" If commission of serious crime suffices to erase constitutional protections, many pages must be torn from the United States and Federal Reporters. But it is not in our power to abrogate constitutional law announced by the Supreme Court, nor should we do so indirectly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    The vacated panel opinion recounts this case's long history in detail,\n    <em>\n     Langley v.

The State charged Langley again with first degree murder, and Langley pleaded not guilty as well as not guilty by reason of insanity. His counsel conceded that Langley had killed the victim, a boy six years old. The defense focused instead on Langley's state of mind. Contrary to the majority's assertion that evidence of Langley's specific intent was overwhelming, defense counsel argued that Langley could not form the specific intent to kill because his mental illness, history of trauma, and exposure to a toxic prenatal environment had rendered him unable to\n    understand or intend the consequences of his actions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The trial judge--whose misconduct would cause this conviction to be set aside\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    --instructed the jury on first degree murder, which consisted of (1) killing a human being (2) with specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm (3) with one or more aggravating factors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    La.

The judge then instructed the jury on the lesser offenses that Louisiana has deemed responsive to a charge of murder.

Raising the\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    issue, Langley's counsel argued that specific-intent second degree murder should also be removed, because the 2003 verdict could be rationally explained only as an acquittal on the issue of Langley's specific intent. Second degree felony murder would be left as the most serious charge. But the trial judge rejected Langley's argument, so the indictment contained both varieties of second degree murder. The next day, however, the State orally withdrew the felony murder charge, having realized that its preferred predicate offenses, second degree kidnapping and cruelty to juveniles, were not enumerated in the felony murder statute at the time of Langley's offense. Specific-intent second degree murder, already under the cloud of\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    , became the State's only route to a murder conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    The judge ultimately found Langley guilty of second degree murder.

At trial in 2003, the jury was instructed on three offenses relevant here: first degree specific-intent murder; second degree specific-intent murder; and second degree felony murder. The two degrees of specific-intent murder shared two elements: the killing of a human being and the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. First degree differed from second only by specifying the age of the victim--under twelve--an element not in dispute. The fact of the killing was not disputed either. Specific intent was thus the single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury. If specific intent had been proven, a rational jury following the instructions given here would have been obligated to choose first degree murder.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    The jury did not, indicating that it had necessarily decided the issue of specific intent in Langley's favor. As such, the jury's choice of second degree murder can be rationally explained only as a felony murder verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    As noted at the outset, the\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    analysis forecloses the two other possibilities suggested by the Louisiana Court of Appeal: that the jury convicted Langley of specific-intent second degree murder, or that the jury reached a compromise verdict.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 757-58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The jury instructions, if rationally followed, rule out both. The jury was told to start with first degree murder, two elements of which were uncontested. If the State had proved specific intent, the remaining element, the jury would have been obligated to convict Langley of first degree murder, not second degree murder. Likewise, the jury instructions did not suggest or permit a compromise verdict on a lesser offense despite convincing evidence of a greater offense. The Louisiana Court of Appeal's speculation about a compromise cannot be squared with\n    <em>\n     Turner\n    </em>\n    's teaching to treat juries as \"obligated\" to follow their instructions. Consequently, the Louisiana Court of Appeal's alternative explanations were objectively unreasonable applications of\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    and its progeny.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    There is thus only one rational explanation of the jury verdict's acquittal of first degree murder and conviction of second degree murder: the jury acquitted on the issue of specific intent, hence convicted Langley of felony murder. Langley's retrial in 2009 should not have been allowed to proceed on the charge of second degree specific-intent murder. The resulting conviction therefore violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, entitling Langley to habeas relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    The majority's reasons for not disturbing the Louisiana Court of Appeal's decision depend either on new rationales not employed by the state court or on avoidance of what\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    requires. Each move the majority makes is therefore a wrong step on the landscape of Supreme Court precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The majority begins by framing the panel's ruling as requiring an extension of\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    : \"A fairminded jurist could conclude the rule clearly established in\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    does not apply to a conviction rather than a general acquittal.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    , Part III(A)(2). This statement is puzzling at first glance, because the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that Langley was\n    <em>\n     acquitted\n    </em>\n    of first degree specific-intent murder.\n    <em>\n     Langley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321284\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/958/1160/#p1170\">\n     958 So. 2d at 1170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The 2009 trial proceeded on that ruling, and any possible preclusion would attach to that acquittal. The majority means to say that Langley received an implied acquittal of first degree murder alongside his conviction of second degree murder, and the law is not clearly established that\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    preclusion may arise from such a verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The majority is quite right to hedge that \"[w]e may or may not find this distinction persuasive.\" But it is quite wrong to say that \"the last reasoned\n    <em>\n     state court\n    </em>\n    decision found it persuasive.\" On the contrary, the Louisiana Court of Appeal plainly believed that\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    applied.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036558\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/747/#p756\">\n     61 So. 3d at 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In\n    <em>\n     Schiro\n    </em>\n    , three counts of murder were charged, and the instructions did not clearly direct jurors to proceed from greater to lesser offenses as the instructions did here.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/\">\n     at 233-34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/\">\n     114 S.Ct. 783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The jury instructions in\n    <em>\n     Schiro\n    </em>\n    were ambiguous on that very point.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/\">\n     at 234\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/\">\n     114 S.Ct. 783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    <em>\n     Schiro\n    </em>\n    also creates trouble for the majority's other post hoc rationalization of the state court's decision.

It is here that the majority's refusal to explain the\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    analysis required by Supreme Court precedent is most glaring. Rather than look to\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    , or other Supreme Court law, the majority instead imports the Second Restatement of Judgments. From the Restatement, the majority derives new \"essential prerequisites\" for issue preclusion to obtain, which debut in the majority's opinion without any adversarial treatment at any stage in this litigation. While the Supreme Court has cited the Restatement's issue-preclusion principles in various contexts, it has\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    employed the novel framework advanced by the majority to adjudicate an\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    The majority's misbegotten doctrinal innovation cloaks the majority's departure from governing law, disrupts settled double jeopardy doctrine, and is likely to confuse the state and federal judges of this circuit as they adjudicate\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    claims in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    To start, the majority misstates the fundamental question as being what the jury \"actually determined,\" citing the Restatement, rather than as what it \"necessarily decided.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     557 U.S. at 119-20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This difference is subtle but significant, because the latter formulation trains the reviewing court's attention on a rational jury adhering to its instructions, and not on speculation about \"what transpired in the jury room.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     at 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"447\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The majority makes the very error condemned by the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    when it speculates that Langley's jury chose second degree murder because it heard defense counsel's plea for mercy and because it wanted to avoid a capital punishment hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    Similarly, choosing novel Restatement-based standards permits the majority to deploy a misrepresentation of Louisiana responsive verdict law without acknowledging the Supreme Court precedent that would rule it out. The majority describes the specific-intent second degree murder instruction as a \"concededly valid option.\" Indeed, like many states,\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    Louisiana recognizes \"that a defendant, when charged with a crime for which the Legislature has provided a responsive verdict, has the statutory right to have the jury characterize his conduct as the lesser crime.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Louisiana treats \"the jury's prerogative to return a responsive verdict similar to the jury's power of nullification,\" available to the jury \"even though the evidence clearly and overwhelmingly supported a conviction of the charged offense.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339008\" index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/1137/#p1140\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    But the existence of responsive verdicts does not affect the\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    analysis, which assumes a rational jury that follows its instructions. Given the secrecy of the jury room, the possibility of a nullification verdict is ever-present. Accounting for it in the\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    analysis would make it impossible to say what a jury \"necessarily determined,\" and so would effectively eliminate\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    , as our court has long recognized.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The majority's indulgence of that possibility runs counter to\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    's rational-jury assumption,\n    <em>\n     Turner\n    </em>\n    's assumption that juries adhere to instructions, and\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    's direction to avoid speculation about what transpired in the jury room.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The majority's use of the Restatement causes still more mischief. Avoiding Langley's argument that his first degree murder acquittal is the source of his relief under\n    <em>\n     Ashe\n    </em>\n    , the majority suggests that the reversal of Langley's 2003 second degree\n    murder conviction, due to trial judge misconduct, rendered the result of the 2003 trial not a \"valid and final\" judgment. It is of course true that a conviction vacated due to trial error does not preclude retrial on the same offense. But the majority dangerously disregards Supreme Court precedent, old and new, by suggesting that the 2003 verdict could have no preclusive effect on the 2009 trial. It is a pillar of double jeopardy doctrine that the finality of an acquittal is \"unassailable\" even if it is \"based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\"\n    <em>\n     Yeager\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     557 U.S. at 122-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657882\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/110/#p119\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fong Foo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165831\" index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/141/#p143\">\n     369 U.S. at 143\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165831\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/141/#p143\">\n     82 S.Ct. 671\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).
