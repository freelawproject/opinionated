An immigration judge (\"IJ\") denied relief from removal, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed Petitioner's appeal. As relevant here, the BIA held that section 164.395 categorically constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude (\"CIMT\") and that Petitioner had failed to prove membership in a \"particular social group\" for the purpose of establishing refugee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that section 164.395 is not categorically a CIMT, but we agree that Petitioner did not demonstrate membership in a \"particular social group.\" Accordingly, we grant the petition for review in part, deny it in part, and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sometime between 1997 and 1999, Petitioner entered the United States.

The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision. The BIA held, among other things, that section 164.395 constitutes a categorical CIMT and that Petitioner is therefore statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. Additionally, the BIA held that Petitioner failed to establish membership in a \"particular social group,\" so he was not entitled to withholding of removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A).

This case provides yet another example. Under longstanding Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) precedent, a theft statute does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude if the statute criminalizes temporary takings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Matter of H-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20864\">\n    2 I. &amp; N.

The primary opinion holds that, because third-degree robbery under section 164.395 of the Oregon Revised Statutes covers temporary takings, it does not constitute a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude. But an immigrant who faces deportation today may well face a different result; in 2016, the BIA departed from this decades-old interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20847\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.
