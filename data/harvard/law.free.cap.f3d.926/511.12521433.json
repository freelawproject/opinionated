We conclude that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Perez's first claim because it is not clearly established that a probationary officer's constitutional rights to privacy and intimate association are violated if a police department terminates her due to her participation in an ongoing extramarital relationship with a married officer with whom she worked, where an internal affairs investigation found that the probationary officer engaged in inappropriate personal cell phone use in connection with the relationship while she was on duty, resulting in a written reprimand for violating department policy. Our precedent also does not clearly establish that there was a legally sufficient temporal nexus between the individual defendants' allegedly stigmatizing statements and Perez's termination, and the individual defendants are therefore also entitled to qualified immunity on Perez's claim that the lack of a name-clearing hearing violated her due process rights. Finally, while Perez also appealed the district court's summary judgment on her claims against the individual defendants, the City of Roseville, and the Department for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the California\n   Fair Employment and Housing Act, she conceded that the alleged discrimination was not actually based on her gender. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, Perez applied for a position as a police officer with the City of Roseville Police Department. Perez had previously worked as a police officer for the City of South Francisco. Captain Stefan Moore interviewed Perez and recommended that she be hired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Department conducted the customary investigation into Perez's background. Based on that background check, Chief Daniel Hahn learned that Perez had experienced conflicts with some female officers in her past job. Nevertheless, Chief Hahn decided to hire Perez for the typical one-year probationary period for new hires and sent her a letter confirming her employment. The letter stated that \"[d]uring [her] probationary period [Perez] may be released from City services with or without cause at the sole discretion of the City.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Perez began her one-year probationary term on January 9, 2012. She spent the first ten weeks completing field training. Shortly after being released from the field training program, Perez separated from her husband. She began dating Shad Begley, another officer in the Department, who also separated from his spouse shortly after he began working the same shift as Perez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 6, 2012, Chief Hahn received a written citizen's complaint from Leah Begley, Shad Begley's wife. She alleged that Begley and Perez were having an extramarital relationship and suggested that they were engaging in romantic relations while on duty. Leah Begley also alleged that her husband and Perez were engaging in numerous phone and text contacts while on duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In accordance with Department policy on responding to citizen complaints, Chief Hahn instructed Lieutenant Troy Bergstrom to conduct an internal affairs investigation into the complaint. Lieutenant Bergstrom determined that two of the policy standards in section 340 of the Department policy manual were potentially relevant. First, the allegation that Perez and Begley spent excessive time phoning and texting each other while on duty could constitute \"[u]nsatisfactory work performance including, but not limited to, failure, incompetence, inefficiency or delay in performing and/or carrying out proper orders, work assignments or instructions of supervisors without a reasonable and bona fide excuse,\" in violation of section 340.3.5(c) of the manual. Second, the allegation that Perez and Begley engaged in personal relations while on duty could constitute \"[a]ny other on-duty or off-duty conduct which any employee knows or reasonably should know is unbecoming a member of the Department or which is contrary to good order, efficiency or morale, or which tends to reflect unfavorably upon the Department or its members,\" in violation of section 340.3.5(aa) of the manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After conducting his investigation, which included interviewing Begley and Perez, as well as their spouses, and reviewing phone and text logs, Bergstrom prepared a detailed report. He found no evidence that Perez and Begley engaged in sexual relations while they were on duty. However, Bergstrom found that Perez and Begley made personal phone calls to each other on six different days in May 2012 while one or\n   both were on duty. During each of these six days, Perez spent an average of 18 minutes per shift on personal phone calls with Begley. On May 20, 2012, Perez and Begley made seven personal phone calls to each other spanning 43 minutes of their 11-hour shifts. Three of those May 20 calls were made while Perez was responding to calls for help. Both officers admitted to sending personal text messages to each other while on duty. Perez stated that they typically sent personal texts to each other about five times per shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bergstrom provided his report to Captain Stefan Moore, who was responsible for determining whether disciplinary action should be taken. Captain Moore asked Lieutenant Cal Walstad (Perez's and Begley's supervisor) to review the report and make a recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a memo dated July 10, 2012, Walstad recommended that the charges against Perez be sustained. First, Walstad concluded that Perez violated the \"[u]nsatisfactory work performance\" standard set forth in section 340.3.5(c) of the manual because her personal calls impacted her ability to perform her duties. Walstad noted evidence that Perez talked on the phone to Begley while en route to dispatch calls, continued talking to him after she arrived on the scene of a disturbance, and also called Begley before reporting to headquarters to clear a call. Second, Walstad concluded that Perez had engaged in conduct \"which any employee knows or reasonably should know is unbecoming a member of the Department or which is contrary to good order, efficiency or morale, or which tends to reflect unfavorably upon the Department or its members,\" in violation of section 340.3.5(aa). Walstad concluded that \"[t]he mutual relationship between Officers Perez and Begley is unprofessional.\" Due to its \"secret\" nature it \"reflect[ed] unfavorably upon the Roseville Police Department and its members.\" Walstad stated that \"[b]oth officers are married and have young children,\" and their relationship did not meet the \"high standards of ethical conduct and behavior\" required to \"build and maintain morale, a sense of duty, effective standards of performance and community support.\" Walstad also recommended sustaining both disciplinary charges against Begley. Finally, he stated that he \"would have expected Officers Begley and Perez to notify their Sergeant and or Lieutenant to advise they are involved in a personal relationship so they could be assigned to different patrol shifts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Captain Moore agreed that Perez and Begley violated the two policy standards. On August 15, 2012, Captain Moore informed Perez and Begley that the internal investigation had resulted in sustaining the charges of \"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\" under section 340.3.5(c) and \"Conduct Unbecoming\" under section 340.3.5(aa). The following day, August 16, 2012, the Department sent a letter to Leah Begley stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Roseville Police Department has completed its inquiry into the personnel complaint you filed alleging your husband and a co-worker were engaged in a personal relationship while on-duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The following findings have been made as a result of the investigation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Unsatisfactory work performance - SUSTAINED\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Conduct unbecoming - SUSTAINED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because it was customary to terminate an employee who violates Department policies while on probation, Moore recommended that Perez be released from service (i.e., terminated). Chief Hahn disagreed with Moore's recommendation and decided that a written reprimand to both Perez and Begley was sufficient. Therefore,\n   on August 23, 2012, Moore issued separate written reprimands to Perez and Begley explaining the grounds for the two violations. In the reprimand to Perez, Moore first stated that it was Department policy that officers could not engage in conduct that interfered with their ability to perform their jobs efficiently, including making personal telephone calls while on duty. The following incidents stood out as \"clear policy violations\": (1) a nineteen-minute call while Perez was supposed to be responding to a noise complaint; (2) an eight-minute call after Perez had been dispatched to a suicide subject call; (3) an eight-minute call while Perez was supposed to be conducting an area check for a suspicious vehicle; (4) a thirteen-minute call while Perez was supposed to be on foot patrol; and (5) a three-minute call while Perez was supposed to be taking a vandalism report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, Moore stated that \"[p]ersonal relationships that are established or maintained while you are off-duty should not impact the Roseville Police Department in a way that is contrary to good order, efficiency or morale and should not tend to reflect unfavorably upon the Department or its members.\" The reprimand stated that Perez had \"failed to keep [her] relationship with Officer Shad Begley, a married co-worker, separate from [her] employment, as evidenced by the previously mentioned phone usage that you both admit was personal in nature.\" The personal phone usage \"was inefficient, contrary to good order and ultimately reflected negatively on the Department.\" The reprimand concluded by stating that further conduct would result in further discipline, \"which may be up to and including termination of your employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Perez and Begley both appealed their written reprimands, which entitled them to an administrative hearing before Chief Hahn. Perez's hearing was scheduled for September 4, 2012. While the appeal was pending, Perez and Begley continued their personal relationship but concealed it from the Department for fear of further discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Chief Hahn testified that sometime after Walstad's investigation but before the administrative hearing, he received negative comments about Perez's job performance from several different sources. First, Lieutenant Maria Richardson told him \"that some of the Department's female officers had raised concerns about Perez' attitude and poor communications with them.\" Chief Hahn \"recalled there being similar issues of concern from Perez' background investigation report regarding her relationship with female officers at her old department.\" Second, Chief Hahn learned from Lieutenant Bergstrom of a citizen complaint made against Perez that had been submitted via the Department's online \"complaint or concern\" system on August 13, 2012. According to the written complaint, the complainant had called the Department for assistance in response to a domestic violence incident. In the complainant's view, Officer Perez, who responded to the call, conducted the interview \"in a very hostile and un-sympathetic manner\" which left the complainant \"emotionally distraught and badgered.\" After the complaint was referred to the watch commander for followup, the complainant declined to pursue a formal investigation. Finally, Chief Hahn testified that he learned from Sgt. Kelby Newton that on August 30, 2012, Perez had shown a bad attitude on the phone when Newton called her to inquire about when she was going to work a shift she had informally traded with Begley. According to Newton, Perez had told him it was none of the Department's business. Chief Hahn asked Newton to document this conversation in a memo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Chief Hahn stated that although he had initially disagreed with Moore's recommendation to terminate Perez, he understood that it was best practice \"to release someone from probation rather than to impose lower level discipline where low-level misconduct has been determined to have occurred.\" According to Chief Hahn, he decided, shortly after his conversation with Newton, to release Perez from probation \"based on all the new issues of concern\" he had recently learned from Newton, Lieutenant Richardson, and Lieutenant Bergstrom. He later testified that one of the factors in his decision was that Perez had made personal telephone calls while on duty in a manner that impacted her ability to efficiently perform her job while responding to calls for service, as reflected in the findings of the internal affairs investigation, although that issue, standing alone, would not have caused him to terminate Perez. He explained that \"[m]aking personal calls during work time and during performance of various work duties was a concern, but not one warranting termination.\" Chief Hahn confirmed that \"the fact that [Perez] was involved in a relationship with Officer Begley and one or both of them were married at the time\" played no role in his decision to fire her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Chief Hahn's decision to terminate Perez did not affect her right to an administrative appeal regarding her written reprimand, and the hearing took place as scheduled on September 4, 2012. At the end of the hearing, Chief Hahn informed Perez that the Department was terminating her for failing to complete probation successfully, and gave her written notice of her release from service. The notice did not provide reasons for her termination; rather, it stated that, pursuant to Department policy, probationary officers could be released without cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the evidence and testimony presented at the administrative hearing, Chief Hahn concluded that only a reprimand for violating the Department's phone policies should be sustained. He therefore ordered that the previously issued reprimand memos be revised to eliminate the reprimands for \"unsatisfactory work performance\" and \"conduct unbecoming.\" The revised reprimands for Begley and Perez were issued on September 10, 2012, and the earlier memos were removed from their files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Perez filed this action for damages after her termination. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims, and Perez timely appealed.

The clear purpose of an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   rehearing is to provide a procedural mechanism to correct the application of the law by a three-judge panel of the Circuit.

The constitutional question is a close one, and substantial arguments can be made for either position. Under these circumstances, the more important consideration, in my view, is maintaining the stability and legitimacy of the court's decisions. We have a procedure for correcting decisions that a majority of the court believes warrant reconsideration. That process is known as a [sic] en banc rehearing. It can be invoked if any single judge on the court, including either member of the majority, elects to make a call.

The procedural facts in this case compel\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   consideration of whether Judge Reinhardt's majority opinion, an opinion I joined, should be allowed to stand or whether it should be reconsidered. As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Yovino\n   </em>\n   -the case involving Judge Reinhardt's death, \"Under \u00a7 46(c), a court of appeals case may be decided by a panel of three judges, and therefore on such a panel two judges constitute a quorum and are able to decide an appeal-provided, of course, that they agree.\"\n   <em>\n    Yovino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623916\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/706/\">\n    139 S.

While it is true that judge substitution is an acceptable practice\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and no rule or decision of this court makes a judge's votes and opinions immutable before their public release, once an opinion is published it should stand absent correction by the entire court acting through the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   process. Such a procedure also gives the parties an opportunity to be fully heard before an opinion is reversed or altered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The majority argues that the substitution process in this case complies with General Order 3.2(h) which provides for the substitution of a judge in the event of a panel member's death or unavailability when \"the case is under submission.\" The majority's interpretation of that rule is far too capacious considering\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Submission is the process by which the panel has received and reviewed the record, heard argument by the parties, and taken the matter under consideration for decision.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   9th Cir. R. 25-4 (distinguishing among cases that have been scheduled for oral argument, argued, submitted, and decided). Deciding the case takes place when a quorum of two on the panel agrees to an appropriate disposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yovino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623916\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/706/\">\n    139 S. Ct. at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority's emphasis on the absence of a mandate misses the mark. Once the case is decided by a quorum of the panel judges it is no longer under submission. Because this case was not under submission when Judge Reinhardt died, General Order 3.2(h) is not applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   While procedural concerns alone counsel taking this case\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   , the substantive issues here may also warrant such review. Specifically, this Circuit's treatment of the right articulated in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   would benefit from an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   panel's clarification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Erotic Serv. Provider v.

Indeed, in the fourteen months since the published opinion issued, this case has been cited 72 times, including at least twice for its substantive holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In this case Perez's appeal was decided by a quorum of the judges on the original panel, the decision was published, and there was an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   call by a member of this court. Consequently, the original opinion should stand. It was decided. Now with a different judge assigned, the new majority opinion completely reverses the original opinion without notice to the parties or regard to the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   call. Judge Reinhardt's death under the circumstances presented in this case should not be invoked to reverse the outcome of the case legitimately decided by the original majority\n   through a procedural mechanism of substituting a different judge. There is no need for a substitution when the majority decided and published the opinion questioned here. To do so, would be \"somehow unseemly ... when the reason for the change is the death of a member of the prior majority.\"\n   <em>\n    Carver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3359809\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/869/\">\n    558 F.3d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A published quorum opinion is not under submission; it is final, except if the entire court corrects it\n   <em>\n    en banc.\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent and believe this case should go to an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   panel if the previously published opinion is in error, which I do not believe it is.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    talks directly about intervening Supreme Court or state supreme court authority but the principle invoked is the same.
