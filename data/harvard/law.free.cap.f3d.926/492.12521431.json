They accused Weyker of exaggerating and inventing facts in reports, hiding evidence that would have exonerated them, and pressuring and manipulating the alleged victims into lying. She deceived prosecutors, the grand jury,\n   and other investigators, according to the complaints filed in each case, about the ages of the alleged victims, whether the victims were coerced into sex, and the relationships among the supposed conspirators. By doing so, the plaintiffs claimed, Weyker caused them to be charged and detained for periods ranging from four months to over three years, all in violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel v.

Rather, according to Yassin's complaint, she was arrested for witness intimidation based on false information from Weyker. The arrest arose out of a fight between a cooperating witness in the sex-trafficking investigation and one of Yassin's friends. After the fight started, Yassin called 911 and the witness called Weyker. Weyker then told the officer responding to the 911 call that, based on \"information and documentation,\" Yassin and her friends were trying to intimidate the witness and prevent her from cooperating in a federal investigation. Relying on Weyker's tip, the officer arrested Yassin, who was later charged with witness tampering and obstruction of justice. A jury acquitted her of both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The crux of Yassin's case against Weyker is that no \"information and documentation\" ever existed. Rather, Weyker caused Yassin's unlawful arrest and detention by lying about the reason for the altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   All six, including Yassin, sought damages. Recognizing that Weyker had been deputized as a U.S. Marshal toward the conclusion of the joint investigation, they pleaded causes of action under both\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which authorizes constitutional claims against state officials; and\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , which operates similarly against federal officials, notwithstanding the absence of a statutory cause of action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Weyker moved to dismiss, arguing that neither theory was viable. She reasoned that section 1983 did not apply to her because she was a deputized federal official. As for\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , she claimed that nothing she was accused of doing was actionable. And even assuming the plaintiffs could sue her, she added, she was entitled to qualified immunity because the facts they alleged did not show that she had violated their clearly established constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court disagreed. It concluded that even if Weyker was right that\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   was the plaintiffs' only remedy, the claims against her could still proceed.

The agents in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   handcuffed and strip-searched the plaintiff and\n   combed through his apartment, all without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Weyker did none of these things, nor anything similar. She spoke to witnesses, drafted reports, and shared information with prosecutors and other investigators. These information-gathering and case-building activities are a different part of police work than the apprehension, detention, and physical searches at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, the mechanism of injury is different. In\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's injuries-\"humiliation, embarrassment, and mental suffering\"-were directly caused by the officers' conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    at 389-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, Weyker's actions injured the plaintiffs through a series of intervening steps. And those intervening steps involved decisions by independent legal actors-the prosecutors who chose to pursue charges against the plaintiffs, the grand jury that voted to indict them, and the judges and magistrates who approved their continued detention. This indirect mechanism of injury bears little resemblance to the straightforward claims from\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, recognizing an implied cause of action here would pose a greater risk of interference with the other branches of government than it did in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , 137 S. Ct. at 1860. Probing the causal chain in cases like these would involve delving into the evidence before numerous decisionmakers, including federal investigators, prosecutors, and the grand jury. The initial step would be to discover what Weyker said, to whom she said it, and when. The information Weyker provided to investigators, prosecutors, and the grand jury would then need to undergo examination for its truth or falsity. For any false information she provided, the question would be whether the evidence was material. The determination would center on whether other evidence available to investigators and prosecutors would have independently led them to charge or detain the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

He assures us that there would be no need to look at \"the great bulk\" of the grand-jury evidence, because Weyker was his only point of contact with investigators, so any possible support for the charges must have come from her. But to verify this assertion, the factfinder still has to know what was in the grand-jury record. Only if there really is nothing implicating Farah-or at least nothing that could have supported probable cause-in the police reports, witness statements, transcripts, and other materials will the factfinder be able to determine that Weyker's alleged misdeeds caused his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To be sure, sometimes courts must undertake this sort of review. Indeed, if the plaintiffs' section 1983 claims turn out to be viable,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C, the district court may have to do so in these cases. But such after-the-fact inquiries still pose a risk of intrusion on executive-branch authority to enforce the law and prosecute crimes, not to mention encroach on the usual secrecy of charging decisions and grand-jury proceedings. That some section 1983 cases pose similar risks just reflects that\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   has balanced the costs and benefits and decided that the potential encroachment is worth it.

For this reason, and because the parties have not fully briefed this question on appeal, we remand for the district court to consider the applicability of section 1983 in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Yassin's case is different. Her primary theory is that she was unlawfully arrested because Weyker falsely told another police officer that she was trying to intimidate a federal witness. We need not decide whether this theory of liability would require us to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , because Weyker has not meaningfully briefed the point on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275766\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/1064/#p1075\">\n    865 F.3d 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (8th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Even if we assume that Yassin's unlawful-arrest claim is viable under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, Weyker still claims that she is entitled to qualified immunity for every action she took during the investigation. So we must address the two familiar qualified-immunity questions: assuming Yassin's allegations are true, did Weyker violate her constitutional rights? And if so, were those rights clearly established?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hager v. Ark. Dep't of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722811\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/1009/#p1013\">\n    735 F.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013 (8th Cir. 2013). On both points, our review is de novo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722811\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/1009/#p1013\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and our answer is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   First, Yassin alleged a constitutional violation. According to her complaint, the officer who arrested her had no reason to suspect her of a crime until Weyker lied to him. In fact, the complaint suggests that the facts known to the officer led him to treat her as a victim, at least until he heard from Weyker. These allegations, if true, would establish an unlawful-arrest claim under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315407\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1307/#p1311\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1310 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Small v.

It is true, as Weyker explains, that sexual-abuse and sex-trafficking cases often put investigators in difficult positions, particularly when there are minors involved.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1635226\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/810/1437/#p1459\">\n    810 F.2d 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1459 (8th Cir. 1987) (noting \"[t]he uncertainty surrounding acceptable investigative techniques for suspected child sexual abuse\"). But even so, a reasonable officer would know that deliberately misleading another officer into arresting an innocent individual to protect a sham investigation is unlawful, regardless of the difficulties presented by the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315407\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1307/#p1311\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1313 ;\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540419\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/997/#p1006\">\n    708 F.3d at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We accordingly vacate the denial of Weyker's motions to dismiss Ahmad's, Amalle's, Farah's, Osman's, and Mohamud's complaints. We instruct the district court on remand to dismiss their\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims and determine whether their cases may proceed under section 1983. We also affirm the denial of Weyker's motion to dismiss Yassin's unlawful-arrest claim and\n   remand her case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    We decline Weyker's invitation to skip over the under-color-of-state-law element to decide her claim to qualified immunity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    To the extent Yassin is also suing for damages arising out of her post-arrest indictment, the claim must proceed, if at all, under section 1983.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    Part II.C.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
