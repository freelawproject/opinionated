Fisher, Richard R. Clifton, and Consuelo M. Callahan, Circuit Judges.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-25\">\n   PER CURIAM:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In July 2017, President Trump announced on Twitter that transgender individuals would not be allowed to serve in the military. This was followed by an August 2017 Memorandum implementing his announcement. Plaintiffs, transgender individuals who serve in the military or seek to do so, subsequently joined by the State of Washington, brought this lawsuit alleging that the 2017 Memorandum unconstitutionally discriminated against transgender individuals. The district court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the 2017 Memorandum, essentially holding that it was not a considered military judgment that warranted deference. Defendants,\n   the President and certain federal agencies and officials, appealed the preliminary injunction but then voluntarily withdrew their appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the meantime, a panel appointed by then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis studied the issue of transgender individuals serving in the military. After the panel completed its work, the Defense Department produced a 44-page report. Based on this report, Secretary Mattis recommended to the President that he revoke the 2017 Memorandum so that he could adopt the report's recommendation. The President followed the recommendation and on March 23, 2018, revoked his 2017 Memorandum and authorized Secretary Mattis to implement the policies he proposed based on the 44-page report (these are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"2018 Policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants then requested that the district court dissolve its preliminary injunction on the basis that the 2018 Policy was a new policy that had to be evaluated on its own merit. Defendants asserted that the 2018 Policy addressed a medical condition, gender dysphoria, rather than transgender status. The district court struck the motion to dissolve the injunction. Defendants filed this appeal from that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Proceedings continued in the district court. On April 19, 2018, the district court struck Defendants' motion for a protective order precluding discovery pending the resolution of Defendants' appeal. On July 27, 2018, the district court issued an order denying Defendants' motion for a protective order of discovery directed at President Trump and granting Plaintiffs' motion to compel the production of documents withheld solely under the deliberative process privilege within ten days. Defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus with this Court challenging the discovery order. Subsequent orders have stayed further discovery until after we decide the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We vacate the district court's order striking the Defendants' motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and we remand to the district court to reconsider the motion. In light of the Supreme Court's January 22, 2019 stay of the district court's preliminary injunction, we stay the preliminary injunction through the district court's further consideration of Defendants' motion to dissolve the injunction. In addition, we issue a writ vacating the district court's discovery order and directing the district court to reconsider discovery by giving careful consideration to executive branch privileges as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Cheney v.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Historically, transgender individuals could not serve openly in the military.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   August 2014, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") eliminated its categorical ban on retention of transgender service members, enabling each branch of the military to reassess its own policies. In 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter created a working group to study the policy and readiness implications of allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military. Secretary Carter instructed the working group to \"start with the presumption that transgender persons can serve openly without adverse impact on military effectiveness and readiness, unless and except where objective, practical impediments are identified.\" As part of this review, the RAND National Defense Research Institute was commissioned to conduct a study and issue a report of its findings (the \"RAND Report\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The RAND Report concluded that health care for transgender service members would be a \"very small part of the total health care\" provided to service members and estimated the impact on the military's readiness from accepting transgender individuals would be \"negligible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following the issuance of the RAND Report, Secretary Carter in June 2016 ordered the armed forces to adopt a new policy on military service by transgender individuals (the \"Carter Policy\"). The policy provided that \"transgender individuals shall be allowed to serve [openly] in the military ... while being subject to the same standards and procedures as other members with regard to their medical fitness for duty, physical fitness, uniform and grooming, deployability, and retention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 30, 2017, Secretary Mattis deferred accessing transgender applicants into the military until January 1, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The announcement stated that the armed forces \"will review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The July 26, 2017 Twitter Announcement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 26, 2017, President Trump announced over Twitter that the United States would no longer accept or allow transgender people to serve in the military:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This is sometimes referred to as the \"Twitter Announcement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The August 25, 2017 Presidential Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Twitter Announcement was followed on August 25, 2017, by a Presidential Memorandum (the \"2017 Memorandum,\" and collectively with the Twitter Announcement,\n   sometimes referred to as \"the Ban\"). The 2017 Memorandum noted that until June 2016, the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") \"generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from accession into the United States military and authorized the discharge of such individuals.\" The 2017 Memorandum noted that Secretary Carter had revised those policies in 2016, but it expressed the view that Secretary Carter had \"failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments' longstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The 2017 Memorandum \"direct[ed] the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not .... hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Specifically, the 2017 Memorandum directed the Departments to \"maintain the [pre-2016] policy regarding accession of transgender individuals into military service,\" and to \"halt all use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It directed the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to submit \"a plan for implementing\" the general policy and the specific directives of the 2017 Memorandum by February 21, 2018. It provided that, \"[a]s part of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military,\" but stated that, \"[u]ntil the Secretary has made that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy [mandating a return to the pre-2016 policy].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Following the Twitter Announcement and the 2017 Memorandum, a complaint was filed in the District Court for the Western District of Washington. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which is the most recent statement of Plaintiffs' claims. The amended complaint alleges that the policy adopted through the Twitter Announcement and the 2017 Memorandum discriminates against transgender people regarding military service in violation of the equal protection and substantive due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment and the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs included nine individuals, three organizations, and, as intervenor, the State of Washington. Plaintiff Ryan Karnoski, for example, is a transgender man who holds a master's degree in social work, works as a mental health technician, comes from a family with a history of military service, and aspires to serve as an officer in the military. His desire to join the military came into sharper focus following the\n   death of his cousin, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2009. He would like to join the military but is prohibited from doing so because of his transgender status. Plaintiff Staff Sergeant Cathrine Schmid is a transgender woman who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2013. She joined the Army in 2005, has received numerous awards and decorations for her service, and currently serves as a Signals Intelligence Analyst. She serves openly as a woman, and she is recognized and treated as female in all aspects of military life. In June 2017, Staff Sergeant Schmid submitted an application to become an Army warrant officer, but her application was placed on hold in light of her transgender status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Secretary Mattis' September 2017 Interim Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On September 14, 2017, Secretary Mattis acknowledged receipt of the 2017 Memorandum and promised to \"present the President with a plan to implement the policy and directives in the Presidential Memorandum\" no later than February 21, 2018. Secretary Mattis also issued \"Interim Guidance\" to take effect immediately and remain in effect pending promulgation of a final policy. The Interim Guidance provided that the pre-2016 policies prohibiting the accession of transgender individuals into the military would remain in effect and that no new sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel would be permitted after March 22, 2018. It further provided that \"no action may be taken to involuntarily separate or discharge an otherwise qualified Service member solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender status\" during the interim period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Secretary Mattis' Creation of a Panel to Develop the Implementation Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On the same day that Secretary Mattis issued the Interim Guidance, he directed \"the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to lead the [DoD] in developing an Implementation Plan on military service by transgender individuals, to effect the policy and directives in [the] Presidential Memorandum.\" The Implementation Plan was to \"establish the policy, standards and procedures for service by transgender individuals in the military, consistent with military readiness, lethality, deployability, budgetary constraints, and applicable law.\" The Deputy Secretary of Defense and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were to be supported by \"a panel of experts drawn from [the] DoD and [DHS],\" consisting of \"senior uniformed and civilian Defense Department and U.S. Coast Guard leaders\" and \"combat veterans.\" Secretary Mattis directed this panel to \"bring a comprehensive, holistic, and objective approach to study military service by transgender individuals, focusing on military readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion, with due regard for budgetary constraints and consistent with applicable law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The December 11, 2017 Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On December 11, 2017, the district court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from \"taking any action relative to transgender people that is inconsistent with the status quo that existed prior to President Trump's July 26, 2017 announcement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants filed an\n   appeal from the preliminary injunction, but subsequently moved to voluntarily dismiss their appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    7. The February 2018 Defense Department Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The panel created by Secretary Mattis met 13 times over a period of 90 days. Secretary Mattis reported that the panel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   met with and received input from transgender Service members, commanders of transgender Service members, military medical professionals, and civilian medical professionals with experience in the care and treatment of individuals with gender dysphoria. The [p]anel also reviewed available information on gender dysphoria, the treatment of gender dysphoria, and the effects of currently serving individuals with gender dysphoria on military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and resources. Unlike previous reviews on military service by transgender individuals, the [p]anel's analysis was informed by the Department's own data obtained since the [Carter Policy] began to take effect last year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In February 2018, the Department of Defense produced a 44-page report based on the panel's work (\"the 2018 Report\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Secretary Mattis' February 22, 2018 Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Secretary Mattis forwarded the 2018 Report to the President accompanied by a memorandum dated February 22, 2018 (the \"Mattis Memorandum\"). Secretary Mattis, citing the panel's work and his professional judgment, recommended that the President adopt the following policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   * Transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under the following limited circumstances: (1) if they have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession; (2) Service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria after entering into service may be retained if they do not require a change of gender and remain deployable within applicable retention standards; and (3) currently serving Service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration's policy took effect and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * Transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * Transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other Service members, in their biological sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Secretary Mattis further recommended that the President revoke the 2017 Memorandum in order to allow the adoption of these proposed policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    9. The March 23, 2018 Presidential Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On March 23, 2018, the President accepted Secretary Mattis's recommendation, revoked the 2017 Memorandum, and authorized the implementation of \"any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The District Court's April 13, 2018 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the meantime, cross-motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment had been filed in the district court. The 2018 Policy issued days before the motions were to be heard, and the district court immediately requested supplemental briefs from the parties. In addition, Defendants moved to dissolve the December 11, 2017 preliminary injunction on the ground that the 2017 Memorandum had been supplanted by the 2018 Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On April 13, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court first determined that the 2018 Policy had not rendered Plaintiffs' challenges moot.

The district court concluded that on the present record, it \"cannot determine whether the DoD's deliberative process-including the timing and thoroughness of its study and the soundness of the medical and other evidence it relied upon-is of the type to which Courts typically should defer.\" Accordingly, the district court denied \"summary judgment as to the level of deference due.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The district court proceeded to hold that, for the same reasons it could not grant summary judgment as to the level of deference, it could not reach the merits of the constitutional violations alleged by Plaintiffs.

The district court stated that the case was not moot, discovery related to the Twitter Announcement was not irrelevant, and the 2018 Policy was not a new policy, \"but rather a plan to implement, with few exceptions, the directives of the 2017 Memorandum.\" The district court held that there was no reason for discovery to be confined to the administrative record because Plaintiffs were not challenging the 2018 Policy under the Administrative Procedure Act, but instead raised direct constitutional claims. The district court stated that \"Defendants have not demonstrated that precluding discovery will serve the interest of judicial economy in any way.\" The order concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   To the extent that Defendants intend to claim Executive privilege, they must \"expressly make the claim\" and provide a privilege log \"describ[ing] the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed-and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.\" Fed.

First, they argued that the deliberative process privilege was fashioned to prevent discovery into governmental deliberations when the governmental decisionmaking process is collateral to a lawsuit, but does not apply where, as here, \"plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of a government decision and allege animus or discriminatory intent,\" citing\n   <em>\n    In re Subpoena Duces Tecum Served on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713914,1356180,1344613\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/1422/\">\n    145 F.3d 1422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1424 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants' deliberations go to the heart of this lawsuit. Second, Plaintiffs contended that Defendants waived any privilege by putting their deliberative process at issue - i.e., \"by asserting that the Ban passes constitutional review because special deference is owed to their military judgment.\" Third, Plaintiffs argued that even if the privilege applied, their need for discovery prevailed under the applicable balancing test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs argued that Defendants withheld materials that fell outside the scope of the privilege. In particular, Plaintiffs asserted that the deliberative process privilege (a) only applies to documents that are \"predecisional\"-that is \"they have been generated prior to an agency's adoption of a policy or decision\"; (b) \"only applies to documents that are 'deliberative' in that they reflect the give-and-take of a deliberative decision-making process\"; and (c) \"does not extend to purely factual information or expert opinion and scientific conclusions regarding facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants opposed the motion to compel, arguing that Plaintiffs challenged only\n   the 2017 Memorandum and did not amend their complaint to challenge the 2018 Policy. Specifically, Defendants argued that the deliberative process privilege protects the government's decision-making process by shielding documents \"reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\"\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

On May 21, 2018, Defendants filed another motion for a protective order, arguing that: (1) discovery served on the President should be precluded on separation-of-powers grounds; (2) discovery related to the President's communications and deliberations must be strictly circumscribed; and (3) the President should not be required to formally invoke his privileges until the court rules that Plaintiffs have met an initial heavy burden. Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion for a protective order contending that Defendants were attempting \"to transform the qualified presidential communications privilege into an absolute bar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On July 27, 2018, the district court granted Plaintiffs' motion to compel and denied Defendants' motion for a protective order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Addressing the deliberative process privilege, the district court, citing\n   <em>\n    Warner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613334\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/1156/\">\n    742 F.2d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , stated that for the privilege to apply, a document must be (1) predecisional, meaning that it was generated before the adoption of an agency's policy or decision, and (2) deliberative, meaning that it contains opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies. The district court noted that the deliberative process privilege is not absolute, and that, applying the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Warner\n   </em>\n   , the question was whether Plaintiffs' \"need for the materials and the need for accurate fact-finding override the government's interest in nondisclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The district court found that the deliberative process privilege should be narrowly construed and that Defendants did not meet their burden of establishing its applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The district court concluded that the evidence sought was \"undoubtedly relevant.\" The district court held that Defendants could not maintain that deference was owed to the Ban because it was a considered decision, while at the same time\n   withhold all information concerning the alleged deliberations leading to that decision. The district court also found that because Defendants possessed all the evidence concerning their deliberations, the evidence was not otherwise available to Plaintiffs. The district court further held that Defendants could not avoid disclosure based on speculation that discovery would chill future policy decisions; rather, Defendants had to \"identify specific, credible risks which cannot be mitigated by the existing protective order in this case\" and that outweigh the court's \"need to perform the 'searching judicial inquiry' that strict scrutiny requires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Addressing Defendants' motion for a protective order, the district court recognized that\n   <em>\n    Cheney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527206\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/367/\">\n    542 U.S. at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527206\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/367/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , held that discovery directed at the President involves special considerations.

The district court indicated that the President could invoke the privilege when asked to produce documents, and that if he does so, the documents are presumed privileged.

While Defendants claim they need not do so until Plaintiffs \"exhaust other sources of non-privileged discovery, meet a heavy, initial burden of establishing a heightened, particularized need for the specific information or documents sought, and at a minimum substantially narrow any requests directed at presidential deliberations,\" the Court finds no support for this claim. To the extent the President intends to invoke the privilege, the Court already ordered that he \" 'expressly make the claim' and provide a privilege log 'describ[ing] the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed-and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.' \" Only then can the Court evaluate whether the privilege applies and if so, whether Plaintiffs have established a showing of need sufficient to overcome it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, the district court granted the motion to compel and denied the motion for a protective order.

Defendants have demonstrated a significant change in facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendants have made the requisite threshold showing of a significant change in facts. Plaintiffs assert that the 2018 Policy, like the 2017 Memorandum, broadly prohibits military service by transgender persons. Beyond the narrow reliance exception, transgender individuals who wish to serve openly in their gender identity are altogether barred from service. Even individuals who are willing to serve in the gender assigned to them at birth are barred from accession if they have a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, unless they can \"demonstrate 36 consecutive months of stability - i.e., absence of gender dysphoria - immediately preceding their application.\" For service members who do not qualify under the reliance exception, transition-related medical care is also prohibited. Those who have undergone transition are disqualified from service, and those who have not transitioned are disqualified unless they suppress their gender identity and serve in their birth-assigned sex. Plaintiffs conclude that the new policy continues to broadly exclude transgender persons from service in the military.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   But regardless of its overall effect, the 2018 Policy is significantly different from the 2017 Memorandum in both its creation and its specific provisions. Plaintiffs asserted that no deference was due to the 2017 Memorandum because that policy was not the product of military judgment - i.e. because \"President Trump did not rely upon the professional judgment of military authorities\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   announcing the [policy].\" The 2018 Policy, however, involved a study by a panel of military experts that met 13 times over a period of 90 days, a 44-page report issued by the Department of Defense, and a substantive memorandum issued by Secretary Mattis. Moreover, there are significant substantive differences between the 2017 Memorandum and the 2018 Policy. For example, the 2018 Policy includes a reliance exception for service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria after January 1, 2018 that the 2017 Policy lacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We hold that Defendants have made a sufficient showing of significant change to require the district court to address whether the change warrants dissolution of the preliminary injunction. We remand for the district court to perform this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Factors for the district court to consider in evaluating whether the significant change warrants dissolution of the preliminary injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Among the factors to be considered on remand are the level of constitutional scrutiny applicable to the equal protection or substantive due process rights of transgender persons and also the deference due to military decisionmaking. These two factors, although conceptually distinct, are here intertwined as we are asked to consider the propriety of a military decision concerning transgender persons. The district court concluded that the 2018 Policy had to satisfy \"strict scrutiny if it is to survive.\" Our view is that existing law does not support the application of a strict scrutiny standard of review in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This too is unpersuasive. On its face, the 2018 Policy regulates on the basis of transgender status. It states that \"\n   <em>\n    Transgender persons\n   </em>\n   with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under [certain] limited circumstances,\" that \"\n   <em>\n    Transgender persons\n   </em>\n   who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service,\" and that \"\n   <em>\n    Transgender persons\n   </em>\n   without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria ... may serve ... in their biological sex.\" We conclude that the 2018 Policy on its face treats transgender persons differently than other persons, and consequently something more than rational basis but less than strict scrutiny applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We also reject Plaintiffs' contention that no deference is owed here. Plaintiffs first argue that deference is not owed to the 2017 Memorandum because that policy was not the product of military judgment. Next, they argue that deference is not owed to the 2018 Policy because that policy simply implemented the 2017 Memorandum. According to Plaintiffs, the 2018 Policy \"is not a new policy at all, but rather the expected and mandated outcome of President Trump's directives.\" As such, it could not have constituted a meaningful exercise of military judgment, because \"whatever independent judgment the military brought to bear, it was limited to determining how to implement the [2017 Memorandum] - not whether to do so.\" Plaintiffs argue the deliberative process that led to the 2018 Policy was not an exercise of independent military judgment because the scope of this review was \"constrained by President Trump's directives,\" the officials who conducted the review were not \"free to disagree with President Trump,\" and the review's ultimate recommendations,\n   having been \"dictated\" by the President, were \"preordained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Although Plaintiffs on remand may present additional evidence to support this theory, the current record does not bear out the contention that the 2018 Policy was nothing more than an implementation of the 2017 Memorandum, or that the review that produced the 2018 Policy was limited to this purpose. It is true that the 2017 Memorandum directed the Secretary of Defense to develop \"a plan for implementing both the general policy ... and the specific directives set forth in [that] memorandum.\" It is also true that Secretary Mattis subsequently created a panel to develop such a plan. But the 2017 Memorandum also provided that the Secretary of Defense \"may advise [the President] at any time, in writing, that a change to this policy is warranted,\" and Secretary Mattis, accordingly, directed the panel not only to develop an implementation plan but also to \"bring a comprehensive, holistic, and objective approach to study military service by transgender individuals.\" The panel, in turn, appears to have construed its mandate broadly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policies ultimately recommended by Secretary Mattis were somewhat different from the President's earlier policy and directives, and the President adopted the Secretary's recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In short, the district court must apply appropriate military deference to its evaluation of the 2018 Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Witt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567088\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/806/\">\n    527 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Deliberative Process Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The deliberative process privilege, although not as robust as the presidential communications privilege, still commands judicial consideration. We have held that \"[a] litigant may obtain deliberative materials if his or her need for the materials and the need for accurate fact-finding override the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Warner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613334\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/1156/\">\n    742 F.2d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the district court here correctly recognized, we balance four factors in determining whether this exception to the deliberative process privilege is met: \"1) the relevance of the evidence; 2) the availability of other evidence; 3) the government's role in the litigation; and 4) the extent to which disclosure would hinder frank and independent discussion regarding contemplated policies and decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In balancing these factors, we note that the second and third criteria favor Plaintiffs. The evidence sought is primarily, if not exclusively, under Defendants' control, and the government-the Executive-is a party to and the focus of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   However, the existing record is not adequate to evaluate the relevance of all of the requested information, at least in terms of balancing production of materials against the military's countervailing confidentiality interest. For example, is information concerning the basis for the 2017 Memorandum still relevant now that the 2018 Policy has been adopted?\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we do not mandate any particular course of action, the district court may wish to authorize discovery in stages when the current record is insufficient to establish relevance. Also, the fourth factor deserves careful consideration, because the military's interest in full and frank communication about policymaking raises serious-although not insurmountable-national defense interests. These are among the concerns that the district court and the parties should consider in balancing the deliberative process privilege with Plaintiffs' need for certain information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Moreover, in balancing the\n   <em>\n    Warner\n   </em>\n   factors, the district court should consider classes of documents separately when appropriate. It is not clear the district court did so in this case. The district court appears to have conducted a single deliberative process privilege analysis covering all withheld documents, rather than considering whether the analysis should apply differently to certain categories. If Defendants persuasively argue that a more granular analysis would be proper, the district court should undertake it. Documents involving the most senior executive branch officials, for example, may require greater deference. (They may, of course, also be the most relevant.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Although we hold that the district court did not adequately consider the weighty issues implicated by Plaintiffs' discovery requests, we appreciate that Defendants' responses to those requests may not have helped the district court in performing its difficult task. We express no opinion as to whether Defendants may be compelled to disclose any particular evidence to Plaintiffs or even to the district court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.

Regardless of the merits of the 2017 Memorandum, the reasonableness of the 2018 Policy must be evaluated on the record supporting that decision and with the appropriate deference due to a proffered military decision.
