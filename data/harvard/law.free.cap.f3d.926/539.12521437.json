After extensive litigation, the lead plaintiffs' counsel (\"class counsel\") and the automakers (collectively, the \"settling parties\") negotiated a settlement that\n   the district court approved following eight months of confirmatory discovery. Objectors challenged the certification order and fee awards on various grounds. Finding none of them persuasive, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 6, 2012, class counsel McCuneWright, LLP filed the first of the putative nationwide class actions,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. Hyundai Motor America\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-800,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2030973\">\n    2012 WL 30973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. January 6, 2012). The\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs brought claims against Hyundai under California consumer protection statutes and theories of common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation. They alleged that Hyundai misled consumers throughout the United States by advertising inflated fuel economy standards for the Hyundai Elantra and Sonata vehicle model years 2011-12 based on inaccurate estimates that Hyundai provided to the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). After several motions to dismiss, amendments to the complaint, and class discovery, including document production, depositions, and expert reports, the\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs moved to certify a nationwide litigation class of purchasers of Hyundai Elantra and Sonata vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In November and December 2012, the district court held hearings on the contested class certification motion in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   . Although the court issued a tentative ruling declining to certify a nationwide litigation class in light of potentially \"material differences\" among state laws, it requested supplemental briefing and \"did not make a final ruling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 2, 2012, less than four weeks before the\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   class certification hearing, the automakers issued a press release announcing downward adjustments to the EPA fuel economy estimates for certain of their 2011 through 2013 model year vehicles. Partially in response to an EPA investigation, the automakers created a Lifetime Reimbursement Program (\"Reimbursement Program\") to compensate owners and lessees of these vehicles for the higher fuel costs associated with the revised fuel economy estimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The automakers' announcement sparked a surge of litigation. At the time,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   and one other putative class action were the only cases pending against the automakers regarding misrepresentations and omissions in their fuel-economy disclosures and advertisements. After the announcement, several similar lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts around the country, including two,\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. Hyundai Motor America\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-1909,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205377169\">\n    2012 WL 5377169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. filed Nov. 2, 2012), and\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Hyundai Motor America\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-1930 (C.D. Cal. filed Nov. 6, 2012), brought by class co-counsel Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, LLP, and three in Virginia brought by attorney James B. Feinman. The federal cases were consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") in the Central District of California before the Honorable George H. Wu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Meanwhile, Hyundai and the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   attended multiple mediation sessions with a mediator whom the district court found to be \"respected and experienced.\" On February 14, 2013, the parties announced a proposed nationwide settlement for Hyundai vehicles affected by the fuel economy restatement. Kia joined this settlement-in-principle shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court appointed liaison counsel to act on behalf of the plaintiffs not participating in the\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   cases (the \"non-settling plaintiffs\") and to participate in confirmatory discovery so that the non-settling plaintiffs could\n   objectively evaluate the terms of the settlement. Confirmatory discovery lasted eight months and produced 300,000 pages of documents and under-oath interviews of the automakers' employees, including Hyundai's CEO. Liaison counsel filed status reports with updates on the progress of confirmatory discovery and the non-settling plaintiffs' positions, and the court held several status conferences to discuss issues that arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 23, 2013, the settling parties sought preliminary approval of the nationwide class settlement and moved to certify a settlement class. The district court ordered multiple rounds of briefing concerning the fairness of the settlement, sufficiency of the class notice, the claims process, class certification, choice of law, and other issues. At four hearings held between December 2013 and August 2014, the parties addressed concerns raised by the court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   as well as by objectors and other non-settling plaintiffs. In response to these concerns, the settling parties twice revised the settlement agreement and notice provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After issuing several detailed written rulings, the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and certified the class for settlement purposes on August 29, 2014. The court appointed Hagens Berman and McCuneWright as settlement class counsel. In September and October 2014, the district court held four additional hearings, at which it requested that the parties make additional changes to the settlement notices and website, such as adding information about the Reimbursement Program, and rewording the notices to make them easier to understand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The amended settlement provided for class members to be notified of the settlement in four ways: (1) a short form notice by mail; (2) an email notification; (3) settlement websites with the long form notice; and (4) flyers provided by dealers. The settlement defined the class as all current and former owners and lessees who bought or leased certain defined vehicles on or before November 2, 2012-the date that Defendants announced they were revising the EPA fuel economy estimates of certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote                id=\"p-38\">\n   Class members could receive compensation for relinquishing any claims they might have by choosing one of four options:\n  </blockquote               >\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   1. a\n   <em>\n    lump sum payment\n   </em>\n   via a debit card, determined by vehicle type and model year, with the cash value approximating the additional fuel cost over a 4.75-year period associated with the revised fuel economy estimates;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-40\">\n   2. a\n   <em>\n    dealer service debit card\n   </em>\n   worth 150% of the value of their lump sum payment for use at Hyundai or Kia dealers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-41\">\n   3. a\n   <em>\n    new car purchase certificate\n   </em>\n   worth 200% of their lump sum payment for use in the purchase of a new Hyundai or Kia vehicle by a class member or their immediate family; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    enrollment in the Reimbursement Program\n   </em>\n   , which was extended as a result of the settlement from December 31, 2013, to July 6, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As it had before the settlement, the Reimbursement Program provided recurring payments over the entire period of ownership based on the updated fuel economy estimates, the number of miles driven, and the price of gas in each geographic region, plus a 15% bonus for the inconvenience. Class members already participating in the Reimbursement Program could continue to participate and, in addition, receive a $ 100 or $ 50 lump sum payment depending on whether their vehicles were owned or leased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The class notice websites, which the district court tested, offered an online calculator for class members to estimate the benefit that they would receive through the Reimbursement Program as compared with the lump sum payment options. Class members could submit their claims online where the form would pre-populate with the class members' information after they entered their vehicle identification number and the unique identification number contained in their class notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   By the end of March 2015, with more than three months to go before the July 6, 2015, claims deadline, the automakers reported to the district court that the total compensation they had paid or expected to pay to the class members, based on the claims submitted, was more than $ 140 million. The Reimbursement Program accounted for more than $ 97 million of this compensation. By May 31, 2015, more than a month before the claims deadline, the participation rate had grown to 23.0%, reflecting 200,013 claims. And when the court included class members' participation in the Reimbursement Program in the analysis, the participation rate jumped to 64.5%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In July 2014, one month before the settlement received preliminary approval, class counsel began negotiating with the automakers over a fee award, assisted by the same experienced mediator who had helped them reach the settlement agreement. In October 2014, they reached an agreement, pursuant to which class counsel moved for an award of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court expressed concern with the request by McCuneWright for a 3.0 lodestar multiplier. On June 1, 2015, after supplemental briefing and an additional hearing, the court awarded McCuneWright $ 2,850,000 in attorney's fees and $ 93,550.02 in costs based on a reduced multiplier of 1.5521. On August 5, 2015, the court awarded Hagens Berman, class counsel in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , $ 2,700,000 in attorney's fees based on a lodestar multiplier of 1.22, and $ 250,000 in costs. In addition, the court awarded fees and costs to 26 other firms that reflected lodestar reductions of 27 to 80 percent, including an award of $ 1,257,000 in fees and $ 66,000 in costs to liaison counsel Girard Gibbs LLP. The court declined to award fees to Feinman for his representation of the objecting plaintiffs in the three Virginia cases, finding that he \"did not meaningfully contribute to the class settlement\" and that his \"mostly meritless\" objections \"did not serve to increase the settlement amount or otherwise benefit the class members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On June 11, 2015, after more than three years of litigation, including eight months of confirmatory discovery, the court issued a 19-page order granting final approval of the class settlement. Various objectors appealed the district court's orders certifying the class, approving the settlement, and awarding attorney's fees. A divided three-judge panel of this court vacated the class certification decision and remanded, holding that by failing to analyze the variations in state law, the district court abused its discretion in certifying the settlement class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hyundai &amp; Kia Fuel Econ.

In fact, the very first page of the long form notice informed class members: \"If you previously received money under the [Reimbursement Program], you may still be able to receive a payment from the Settlement.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    As for the short form notice, it was designed to be, as the name suggests, short. Its primary purpose was to alert class members to the settlement, provide a high-level overview of the process, including critical dates, and explain where class members could obtain additional information, such as eligibility information and claim forms. In addition, after outlining some of the potential compensation, it informed class members that \"[o]ther settlement benefits exist\" and invited them to use an online calculator to estimate their individual benefit under each of the various compensation options based on a host of personalized factors. The short form notice \"highly recommended\" that class members \"use this reimbursement calculator to evaluate [their] options based on [their] own circumstances ... before submitting a claim.\" This notice was more than adequate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Nor was it misleading for the various notices to inform class members that \"[h]igh mileage drivers may receive greater amounts by participating in the ... Reimbursement Program.\" Since compensation under the Reimbursement Program was proportional to the number of miles driven and thus theoretically unlimited, that statement was true. Moreover, it served the valuable purpose of warning high-mileage drivers that choosing a lump sum payment might not have been in their best interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Finally, in arguing that the notices did not explain in a \"step-by-step\" formula how each class member's benefit is calculated, Fetsch and Roland seek to impose a higher standard than is required. A settlement notice need not \"provide an exact forecast\" of the award each class member would receive, let alone a detailed\n    mathematical breakdown; it merely must give class members \"enough information so that those with 'adverse viewpoints' could investigate and 'come forward and be heard.' \"\n    <em>\n     Online DVD-Rental\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/#p942\">\n     779 F.3d at 946-47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Lane v.

They cite no evidence that this was possible. The district court found that the automakers did \"not have complete records of resales of the class vehicles,\" and Ahearn and York fail to explain how the automakers could have identified subsequent purchasers who were also part of the class. They do not dispute that it was reasonable for the settlement to provide class members with different monetary recovery options based on miles driven and ownership status-information also not in the automakers' possession. Given that the automakers lacked complete information to determine the identities of all class members and the amounts of their claims, the district court properly exercised its discretion in finding that \"some sort of claims process is necessary in order to verify ... that the claimant is a current owner, former owner, or current or former lessee of a qualifying vehicle.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Ahearn, York, Fetsch, and Roland contend that the claim forms required too much documentation, such as proof of a class member's current address and proof of sale or ownership, and that this documentation burden is reflected in low claim participation rates. However, class members could easily avoid most documentation requirements by submitting an online claim form, which pre-populated information after class members entered their vehicle identification number and the unique class member identification number provided by their notices. Fetsch and Roland cite no evidence that any claims submitted on the paper claim form were, as they speculate, \"denied because one box was not checked or one piece of documentation was not turned in.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Ahearn and York contend that the 21% of class members who had filed claims for lump sum payments as of March 31, 2015 was an unreasonably low participation rate and that the \"daunting claim form\" was to blame. As of May 31, 2015-more than a month before the July 6, 2015 claims deadline-the participation rate of lump sum claimants had increased to 23%.

The record shows that the district court carefully made this assessment in determining the appropriate amount of attorney's fees and explained the basis of its ruling. The district court applied\n    <em>\n     downward\n    </em>\n    multipliers of 27 to 80 percent to the lodestars for the non-settling parties' counsel because they \"had a more minor role in the [MDL] and did not participate [in] negotiating the primary settlement.\" The court applied a multiplier of 1.22 to the fee award for class counsel Hagens Berman due to \"the complexity and volume of work that counsel engaged in in order to diligently\n    pursue this case and develop its primary theory of liability,\" finding the multiplier in line with others in comparable complex and multi-year multidistrict litigations. And the court applied a multiplier of 1.5521 to the fees for class counsel McCuneWright because they \"assumed more risk than other firms\" by being one of the first firms to take up this cause, having filed\n    <em>\n     Espinosa\n    </em>\n    nearly 10 months before the automakers announced the fuel efficiency revisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    These multipliers are modest or in-line with others we have affirmed.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Vizcaino v.

I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Defendants Hyundai and Kia overstated the fuel efficiency of certain vehicles that they manufactured and sold. After an EPA investigation confirmed this overstatement, Hyundai and Kia announced that they would lower the fuel efficiency estimates for the affected cars and simultaneously announced that they were each instituting a voluntary reimbursement program to compensate affected vehicle owners and lessees for the additional fuel costs that they had incurred and would incur in the future as a result of the overstated fuel efficiency statements. This announcement set off a flurry of litigation across the country. In\n    <em>\n     Espinosa v. Hyundai Motor America\n    </em>\n    , an action pending in district court in California, Hyundai filed an extensive \"Appendix of Variations in State Laws,\" which detailed the differences in the applicable state consumer protection laws and common law fraud actions. The district court initially found these state law differences so material that it tentatively ruled the class could not be certified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Meanwhile, the Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) judicial panel consolidated over fifty other actions before the district court in which\n    <em>\n     Espinosa\n    </em>\n    was pending. After MDL consolidation, Hyundai and Kia moved for certification of a nationwide class and preliminary approval of a class settlement they had negotiated with counsel for three of the MDL cases,\n    <em>\n     Espinosa\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Hunter et al. v Hyundai Motor et al.\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Brady et al. v. Hyundai Motor et al.\n    </em>\n    Objecting to class certification, plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Gentry et al. v. Hyundai Motor America\n    </em>\n    , an action that had been filed in a Virginia district court before being consolidated in the MDL, argued that variations in state law defeated the predominance of common questions. The Virginia plaintiffs argued that they had purchased their vehicles under sales contracts that contained valid choice of law provisions requiring Virginia law to be applied to any claims. The Virginia plaintiffs further claimed that Virginia law provided a materially different remedy to Virginia consumers for certain claims and such material differences between Virginia and California consumer protection law precluded certification of a nationwide class.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Despite those objections, the district court declined to decide what law was applicable to the plaintiffs' claims and certified the class without ruling on this threshold legal issue or conducting a choice of law analysis. The district court acknowledged that the court \"would need to engage in an extensive choice of law analysis\" if the case were going to trial, but the district court erroneously thought that such an analysis was not required to certify a settlement class. In response to the Virginia plaintiffs' objections, the district court concluded that any substantial differences in state law could be addressed as\n    part of the Rule 23(e) fairness hearing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The court certified the class and later approved the settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    In its tentative ruling granting final settlement approval, the court estimated that the settlement value was some $ 210 million, relying on a rough estimate that the settling parties had provided a year earlier. According to the objectors, however, claims attributable to the settlement added up to about $ 21 million at the time of final approval. Although another $ 23 million in class claims were filed by class members, the objectors contend that those class members were already participating in Hyundai and Kia's voluntary reimbursement program before the settlement, and therefore the value of their claims could not be attributable to the settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Relying on this estimate that some $ 210 million was provided by the settlement, the district court awarded nearly $ 9 million in total attorneys' fees to class counsel. It used a lodestar multiplier of 1.22 for the\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs' counsel on the ground that they undertook a large volume of complex work. It used a lodestar multiplier of 1.5521 for the\n    <em>\n     Espinosa\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs' counsel on the ground that they had assumed greater risk by filing a lawsuit before the EPA had announced the results of its investigation. A number of class members objected, arguing that the attorneys' fees award was excessive in proportion to the actual benefit obtained on behalf of the class. The district court summarily rejected these arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    A class action \"may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of [ Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ] have been satisfied.\"\n    <em>\n     Gen.

When relying on this unsupported figure, the district court noted that it expected \"an update from the Settling Plaintiffs and defendants as to the amount of settlement funds which class members have in fact claimed.\" But the\n    district court never got this update,\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    nor did it take any other steps to determine the benefits provided by the settlement. Because the district court failed to take a careful look at the claims data, it could not consider the evidence indicating that the amount of settlement funds claimed by class members who were not already part of the reimbursement program was an order of magnitude less than $ 210,000,000.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Because the district court failed to reasonably estimate the value of the settlement, despite the objectors' cogent arguments that this value was relatively small, the district court did not have the information necessary for determining whether the attorneys' fees awards were proportionate to the benefit obtained for the class. Accordingly, the district court failed to assure \"that the amount awarded was not unreasonably excessive in light of the results achieved.\"\n    <em>\n     Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab.

Rather, the majority's analysis is based on an assumption that the settlement provided a significant benefit to the class. For example, the majority argues that the class counsel did not \"receive a disproportionate distribution of the settlement.\" Maj. at 569 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p940\">\n     654 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    947 ). Because the value of the settlement is undetermined, this conclusion lacks any reasonable foundation. Similarly, the majority argues that \"the district court properly exercised its discretion in calculating the fee award using the lodestar method\" because it found that the attorneys' fees award was lower than 25 percent of the settlement amount. Maj. at 570-71. But lacking any considered estimate of the settlement's value, neither the district court\n    nor the majority can reliably compare the fee award to the settlement figure in this case. The difference between the parties' unsupported estimation of settlement value and the objectors' calculation is critical in this context. If the settlement had conferred $ 210,000,000 in value, as the parties originally speculated, a $ 9,000,000 total fee award might have been justified; but a court would be hard-pressed to justify such a fee award if the value conferred on the class were closer to $ 21,000,000, as the objectors contend. Even when it is \"difficult to estimate the settlement value's upper bound,\" Maj. at 570, there is no excuse for the district court's failure to calculate a reasonable estimate after reviewing the facts and the parties' arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The district court likewise provided insufficient reasoning for its application of multipliers to the lodestar amounts used to calculate various counsels' fee awards. The application of a multiplier is appropriate only in \"rare\" or \"exceptional\" cases.\n    <em>\n     Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel.

The settlement of the case was announced in February 2013, only three months after Hyundai and Kia announced their voluntary reimbursement program. This settlement was followed only by \"confirmatory discovery,\" a procedure the parties agreed to use in lieu of actual discovery under the federal rules. According to the objectors, Hyundai and Kia retained significant control of this confirmatory procedure, including by selecting the witnesses who would be interviewed (rather than deposed) by class counsel. There is no dispute that the confirmatory discovery process added little or no value to the settlement. Yet the district court offered no explanation for why fees incurred for confirmatory discovery warranted a multiplier.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    If the settlement and counsel's confirmatory review of the documents and witnesses produced by the defendants provided only minimal benefit to the class, the district court's rationale for awarding multiplied fees-the \"complexity and volume of work\" and the degree of risk assumed by\n    <em>\n     Espinosa\n    </em>\n    counsel-is baseless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The majority affirms the district court's use of the multipliers despite these failures, again based on the flawed assumption that the degree of benefit to the class was known and that we have affirmed\n    comparable multipliers in other cases.

But this is beside the point. The law requires a district court to provide an adequate explanation of the award. The majority's repetition of the district court's explanation does not improve it. Accordingly, I would remand the attorneys' fee award to the district court so that it could reevaluate the fee award after calculating the value of the settlement and provide adequate reasoning for the applied multipliers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    V\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    Our court, like many others, leans toward approving class certifications and class settlements, which benefit both defendants (who are relieved of significant liability in a single stroke) and class counsel (who are amply rewarded for their efforts). Nevertheless, despite any such judicial inclinations, we remain bound by\n    <em>\n     Amchem\n    </em>\n    's clear direction that courts must be rigorous in ensuring that a class meets the prerequisites of Rule 23(b). The prospect of settlement may mitigate management concerns, but it does not relieve a court of this responsibility. By failing to determine what law applied to the nationwide class of plaintiffs in this case, the district court could not fulfill this basic obligation. And by failing to make a reasonable determination of the value of the settlement, the court lacked the ability to make a proportional attorneys' fee award. The majority's failure to correct these errors may be beneficial for the class action bar, but it detracts from compliance with Supreme Court precedent.
