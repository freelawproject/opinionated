City of Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275887\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/866/\">\n    864 F.3d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2017), a panel of our court affirmed the district court's ruling that Dorian Johnson had alleged sufficient facts to state\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims of unlawful seizure and the use of excessive force against former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, as well as a claim of supervisory liability against former Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, and thus denied the defendants' motion for dismissal based upon qualified immunity. We granted their petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel's opinion. We now reverse the district court's order and remand with directions to dismiss the federal claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As alleged in Johnson's complaint, he and Michael Brown, Jr. were \"peacefully and lawfully\" walking down Canfield Drive in Ferguson, Missouri, at approximately 12:00 p.m. on August 9, 2014, when they were approached by Officer Darren Wilson in his marked police vehicle. As he approached the pair, Wilson slowed his vehicle and ordered them to \"Get the f*ck on the sidewalk.\" Wilson continued to drive his vehicle several more yards, then abruptly put the vehicle in reverse and parked it at an angle so as to block the pair's path. After stopping his vehicle just inches from Brown, Wilson forcefully opened his door, striking Brown. Wilson reached through his window, grabbed Brown, and threatened to shoot his weapon. As Brown struggled to break free, Wilson discharged his weapon twice, striking Brown in the arm. Both Brown and Johnson ran away from Wilson, who at no time ordered either of them to \"stop\" or \"freeze,\" but rather fired his weapon at the two men, with several of the shots striking and killing Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree with the panel opinion's identification of the governing issue in this case: \"The crux of the motion to dismiss and this resulting appeal centers on the issue of whether there was a seizure. Johnson concedes that if there was no seizure virtually all of his claims fall away.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275887\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/866/\">\n    864 F.3d at 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree with the panel's ruling that a seizure occurred, and\n   thus we hold that the district court erred in not granting the defendants' motion to dismiss based upon their claim of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Whatever one might say about Wilson's expletive-expressed directive that Brown and Johnson move from the street to the sidewalk, Johnson's complaint concedes that neither he nor Brown was ordered to stop and to remain in place. Johnson's decision to remain by Brown's side during Brown's altercation with Wilson rather than complying with Wilson's lawful command to return to the sidewalk was that of his own choosing. That he was able to leave the scene following the discharge of Wilson's weapon gives the lie to his argument that the placement of Wilson's vehicle prevented him from doing so. As was the case in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hayden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156641\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/842/#p847\">\n    759 F.3d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (8th Cir. 2014), Wilson's police vehicle constituted no barrier to Johnson's ability to cross to the sidewalk. Any physical or weapon-related contact by Wilson was directed towards Brown alone in the first instance. In a word, then, because Johnson himself was neither physically restrained nor prevented from proceeding to the sidewalk in compliance with Wilson's directive rather than fleeing as he did, the question before us is alike to that presented in\n   <em>\n    California v. Hodari D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320254\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/621/#p626\">\n    499 U.S. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320254\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/621/#p626\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320254\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/621/#p626\">\n    113 L.Ed.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The narrow question before us is whether, with respect to a show of authority as with respect to application of physical force, a seizure occurs even though the subject does not yield.

On appeal, Officer Wilson argues that, under the Fourth Amendment, his actions neither qualified as a show of authority to stop nor did Johnson actually stop.

Fourth Amendment Violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his \u00a7 1983 claim, Johnson asserts that Officer Wilson violated the Fourth Amendment by unreasonably seizing Johnson.

To recap, Johnson's complaint alleged the following facts relevant to this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 As Johnson and Brown walked peacefully and \"lawfully\" down the road, Officer Wilson, operating a marked police vehicle, approached Johnson and Brown, slowed his vehicle to a stop, and ordered them to \"Get the f*ck on the sidewalk.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Officer Wilson continued to drive his vehicle several yards, then abruptly put his vehicle into reverse and parked his vehicle at an angle so as to block the paths of Johnson and Brown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Officer Wilson stopped his vehicle just inches from Brown and forcefully opened his door, striking Brown. Officer Wilson then reached through his window and grabbed Brown, who was closer to Officer Wilson than Johnson. Officer Wilson thereafter threatened to shoot his weapon. As Brown struggled to break free, Officer Wilson discharged his weapon twice, striking Brown in the arm. Surprised by Officer Wilson's use of \"excessive\" force and fearing for his life, Plaintiff Johnson ran away from Officer Wilson simultaneously with Brown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By crudely ordering Johnson to move and then abruptly reversing his vehicle and stopping it inches away and directly in Johnson's path, Officer Wilson communicated an intent to use a roadblock to stop Johnson's movement. Despite Defendants' (and amicus curiae's) argument that the roadblock did not foreclose\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Johnson's avenues of travel, a reasonable person would understand the roadblock's purpose was to serve as a \"physical obstacle\" conveying an order to stop-not an order to go around the vehicle and continue on one's way.\n   <em>\n    Brower v.

This type of order is commonly referred to as a \"move on\" order and is meant to convey the message that a person is free to go anywhere else but cannot remain where he is. The parties have not cited, nor am I aware of, any Eighth Circuit precedent addressing whether move-on orders qualify as seizures under the Fourth Amendment. Other circuits have split on the issue, with the analysis frequently (but not always) turning on whether there was physical contact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Salmon v.

Were the facts as simple as the majority and amicus curiae present, then this would be a compelling argument as to why there was no Fourth Amendment seizure. Had Officer Wilson blocked Johnson's direction of travel but then permitted him to proceed to the sidewalk and continue on his way, a reasonable person likely would believe he was \"at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\"\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    501 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   But the facts are not as simple as amicus curiae contends. Officer Wilson's initial command to get on the sidewalk merely began the encounter that then continued. As alleged, Officer Wilson next escalated the encounter by abruptly putting his vehicle into reverse and parking his car at an angle blocking Johnson's path and within inches of Brown and Johnson. Officer Wilson then fought with Brown and threatened to fire his firearm. These events, viewed in a light most favorable to Johnson, would communicate to the reasonable person that Johnson \"was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\"\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    501 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Officer Wilson's abrupt stopping of his vehicle inches away from Johnson, thereby creating a roadblock, coupled with the threat of using his service weapon, was a show of force communicating to a reasonable person the necessity to stop and not continue on one's way. Officer Wilson's actions were a \"show of authority ... at least partly directed at [Johnson], and [conveying] that he was thus not free to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\"\n   <em>\n    Brendlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    551 U.S. at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.

Whereas fleeing or refusing to comply with a show of authority does not qualify as submission to authority,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320254\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/621/#p626\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320254\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/621/#p626\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   stopping one's movement often qualifies as submission,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brendlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    551 U.S. at 255-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). But temporarily stopping is not always sufficient to constitute a submission to authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704946\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/215/#p218\">\n    496 F.3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that, after a police vehicle with activated lights and sirens followed the defendant's vehicle, the defendant's \"momentary stop did not constitute submission to police authority\"). This analysis also depends, of course, on the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, I believe that Johnson submitted to Officer Wilson's show of authority. Johnson stopped walking when Officer Wilson placed his vehicle directly in Johnson's path. Based on the alleged facts, Johnson's stop was not a temporary, reactionary pause caused by the roadblock placed in his path. Johnson did not recommence walking and go around the vehicle. Instead, Johnson remained throughout the time that Officer Wilson reached through his window and grabbed Brown, threatened to shoot his weapon, wrestled with Brown who struggled to break free, and then twice fired his weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The majority seems to imply that Officer Wilson's use of a weapon was directed at Brown only and that, while Brown may have been seized, Johnson was not. I do not believe the complaint can be parsed that finely. Both Brown and Johnson were walking together, Officer Wilson pulled his vehicle in front of both, both eventually fled, and Officer Wilson fired his weapon in the direction of both, striking and killing Brown but missing Johnson. In short, I do not believe that from the perspective of a reasonable person encountering Officer Wilson, it can be reasonably said Officer Wilson intended to seize Brown but not Johnson. If one of the two were seized, both were seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   One difficulty surrounding this issue is whether Johnson's \"submission to [the] show of governmental authority takes the form of passive acquiescence\" that rises to the level of a submission to authority.\n   <em>\n    Brendlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    551 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Brendlin\n   </em>\n   held that \"what may amount to submission depends on what a person was doing before the show of authority: a fleeing man is not seized until he is physically overpowered, but one sitting in a chair may submit to authority by not getting up to run away.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573063\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/249/#p254\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
