DaVinci's problems arose out of its acquisition and the U.S. Air Force's subsequent confiscation of ten GPS antennas for the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (\"the Antennas\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies, Inc. manufactured the Antennas under a subcontract from Lockheed Martin, a U.S. Air Force prime contractor. Under the subcontract, the Antennas were considered unclassified hardware and therefore not subject to the security requirements of the Department of Defense or U.S. Air Force for classified data and hardware. They did not require demilitarization and were authorized by the U.S. Air Force for public sale, excluding export, around March 2013. Avatar Unlimited purchased the Antennas from Lockheed Martin as part of a bulk sale of surplus parts, and then resold them to BPB Surplus, who then sold them to DaVinci for $ 3,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2013, four agents from the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations visited DaVinci's office to inspect and discuss the Antennas. After the inspection, Special Agent Laura Voyatzis demanded that DaVinci surrender the equipment. DaVinci refused to surrender the Antennas without the agents providing authority for their demands. When asked for the selling price, DaVinci quoted $ 1.25 million for the Antennas, after which the Special Agents left without further action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between April and June 2014, DaVinci corresponded with agents at Eglin Air Force Base over the Antennas. Contracting Officer Rodney Lewis initially offered\n   $ 7,359 for the Antennas, but DaVinci declined and countered with a discounted price of $ 750,000 and later $ 600,000. DaVinci and the Air Force employees never agreed upon a price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2014, Special Agent Joel S. Russell and two Air Force Officers arrived at DaVinci's office and demanded that DaVinci surrender the Antennas under compulsion of law. Russell produced a letter dated a week earlier and signed by both Lewis and Michael Christmas, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of the Air Force, Office of Special Investigations. The letter stated that the \"delivery of the said items by [DaVinci's owner] and DaVinci Aircraft is made under compulsion of law pursuant to 18 USC 793(d) [, the Espionage Act,] and is made without prejudice to any claims by [DaVinci's owner] and/or DaVinci Aircraft for their fair market value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response to Russell's demands and the threat of criminal prosecution for failure to comply, DaVinci surrendered the Antennas. Russell provided a signed acknowledgment of \"Receipt For Items Taken Under Compulsion\" to DaVinci. That same day, DaVinci delivered to Eglin Air Force Base an invoice for the Antennas in the amount of $ 1.25 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After exhausting the FTCA administrative process,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DaVinci filed a complaint in the district court against the United States, Christmas, Lewis, and 10 unnamed individual defendants in their official capacities. The United States filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The United States argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction over DaVinci's tort claims because the confiscation fell into an exception of the FTCA's waiver of its sovereign immunity. In support of its assertion, the government submitted a declaration from Martin D. Hemmingsen, Program Element Monitor for Air Force Special Programs, attesting that in July 2014, the Antennas were classified as \"SECRET\" and \"SECRET/SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED\" level in accordance with Executive Order 13,526.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over DaVinci's tort claims against the United States and that DaVinci failed to state a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim against the individual defendants, and dismissed all claims without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DaVinci filed a First Amended Complaint against the United States, Christmas, Lewis, Russell, and 10 unnamed defendants. This time, all of the individual defendants were sued in their individual capacities. DaVinci asserted six causes of action against all defendants: (1) conversion, (2) seizure of property in violation of the Fourth Amendment, (3) deprivation of property without due process in violation\n   of the Fifth Amendment, (4) conspiracy related to abuse of process,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5) fraud, and (6) negligent misrepresentation. The United States responded with another motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court again granted the motion to dismiss all claims against the United States. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over DaVinci's FTCA claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy to commit fraud or misrepresentation because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) provides an absolute bar to such claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court also held that it lacked jurisdiction over DaVinci's abuse of process and conversion claims because of the FTCA's \"detention of goods\" exception under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Relying on the 2014 Christmas letter and 2016 Hemmingsen declaration, the district court noted that it could not review the Air Force's decision to classify the Antennas as relating to the national defense because such classification was a discretionary decision, triggering the \"discretionary function\" bar under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Lastly, the district court held that\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   did not provide a cause of action against the United States, and therefore dismissed DaVinci's two constitutional claims against the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DaVinci timely appealed. The only parties on appeal are DaVinci and the United States because after the district court dismissed all claims against the United States, DaVinci dismissed the action without prejudice against Christmas, Russell and Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review de novo a district court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276602\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1152/\">\n    859 F.3d at 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the government also moved to dismiss based on failure to state a claim, our focus is on the district court's determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over DaVinci's claims.

For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Thomas-Lazear\n   </em>\n   , we noted that \"the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is nothing more than a restatement of the [originally barred] slander claim\" because \"the Government's actions that constitute a claim for slander are essential to [the plaintiff]'s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362485\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/851/1202/#p1207\">\n    851 F.2d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
