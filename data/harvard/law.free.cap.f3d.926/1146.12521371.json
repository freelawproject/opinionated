In the decades since, the TCPA has weathered the digital revolution with few amendments. With important exceptions, the TCPA forbids calls placed using an automated telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\"), commonly referred to as an autodialer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Noah Duguid claims that Facebook used an ATDS to alert users, as a security precaution, when their account was accessed from an unrecognized device or browser. For unknown reasons, Duguid received the messages despite not being a Facebook customer or user and never consenting to such alerts. His repeated attempts to terminate the alerts were unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Facebook challenges the adequacy of Duguid's TCPA allegations and, alternatively, claims that the statute violates the First Amendment. We conclude that Duguid's allegations are sufficient to withstand Facebook's motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to the constitutional question, we join the Fourth Circuit and hold that a 2015 amendment to the TCPA, which excepts calls \"made solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States,\" is content-based and incompatible with the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Rep. No. 102-178, at 1 (1991). With certain exceptions, the TCPA bans calls (including text messages) placed using an ATDS.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v.

In contrast, the scope of the prohibition section has evolved. In 2014, when Duguid received messages from Facebook, the statute excepted two types of calls: those \"made for emergency purposes\" and those \"made with the prior express consent of the called party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A) (2010).

It is this \"debt-collection exception\" that Facebook contends is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two court rulings during this appeal have shifted the TCPA playing field. First, in\n   <em>\n    ACA International v. Federal Communications Commission\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit overturned aspects of several Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") rulings construing the ATDS definition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2018). Shortly thereafter, in\n   <em>\n    Marks v. Crunch San Diego, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   we construed\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   to wipe the definitional slate clean, so we \"beg[an] anew to consider the definition of ATDS under the TCPA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n    904 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049-50 (9th Cir. 2018). To clarify any ambiguity, we rearticulated the definition of an ATDS: \"equipment which has the capacity-(1) to store numbers to be called or (2) to produce numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator-and to dial such numbers automatically.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n    at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That definition governs this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Duguid's Allegations\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Duguid is not a Facebook customer and has never consented to Facebook contacting his cell phone. Nonetheless, beginning in approximately January 2014, Facebook began sending Duguid sporadic text messages. The messages alerted Duguid that an unrecognized browser was attempting to access his (nonexistent) Facebook account. Each message followed a common template: \"Your Facebook account was accessed [by/from] &lt; browser&gt; at &lt; time&gt;. Log in for more info.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Flummoxed, and unable to \"log in for more info,\" Duguid responded to the messages by typing \"Off\" and \"All off.\" Facebook immediately assured Duguid that \"Facebook texts are now off,\" but the messages kept coming. Duguid also requested via email that Facebook stop sending him messages, but he received similar, automated email responses that failed to resolve the issue. The text messages continued until at least October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Duguid sued Facebook for violating the TCPA, alleging that Facebook sent the text messages using an ATDS. Specifically, he alleges that Facebook established the automated login notification process as an extra security feature whenever a Facebook account is accessed from a new device. According to Duguid, Facebook maintained a database of phone numbers and-using a template and coding that automatically supplied the browser information and time of access-programmed its equipment to send automated messages to those numbers each time a new device accessed the associated account. Somehow, Facebook acquired Duguid's number and (as it did with the numbers provided by its users) stored and sent automated messages to that number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Duguid sued on behalf of two putative classes: people who received a message from Facebook without providing Facebook their cell phone number; and people who notified Facebook that they did not wish to receive messages but later received at least one message. Each putative class reaches back four years from April 22, 2016, when Duguid filed the amended complaint. Duguid seeks statutory damages for each message, plus declaratory relief and an injunction prohibiting similar TCPA violations in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court concluded that Duguid inadequately alleged that Facebook sent its messages using an ATDS-a prerequisite for TCPA liability. After providing leave to amend, the district court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Faithful to our unflagging duty to assess constitutional standing, we hold that Duguid adequately alleges a concrete injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Patten v.

According to Facebook, the equipment Duguid characterizes in the amended complaint is not an ATDS. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   forecloses that position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By definition, an ATDS must have the capacity \"to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). In\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , we clarified that the adverbial phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" modifies only the verb \"to produce,\" and not the preceding verb, \"to store.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n    904 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, an ATDS need not be able to use a random or sequential generator to store numbers-it suffices to merely have the capacity to \"store numbers to be called\" and \"to dial such numbers automatically.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n    at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Duguid's nonconclusory allegations plausibly suggest that Facebook's equipment falls within this definition. He alleges that Facebook maintains a database of phone numbers and explains how Facebook programs its equipment to automatically generate messages to those stored numbers. The amended complaint explains in detail how Facebook automates even the aspects of the messages that appear personalized. Those factual allegations, accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to Duguid, sufficiently plead that Facebook sent Duguid messages using \"equipment which has the capacity ... to store numbers to be called ... and to dial such numbers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Facebook responds that\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   cannot possibly mean what it says, lest the TCPA be understood to cover ubiquitous devices and commonplace consumer communications. In particular, Facebook cautions, such an expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   would capture smartphones because they can store numbers and, using built-in automated response technology, dial those numbers automatically. And if smartphones are ATDSs, then using them to place a call-even without using the automated dialing functionality-violates the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. 7961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7975 \u00b6 19 n.70 (July 10, 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"It cannot be the case,\" the D.C.

The ATDS at issue in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   was designed to send promotional text messages to a list of stored numbers-a proactive advertising campaign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1049\">\n    904 F.3d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Facebook differentiates its equipment because it stores numbers \"to be called\" only reflexively-as a preprogrammed response to external stimuli outside of Facebook's control. It\n   urges us to cabin\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   as inapplicable to such purely \"\n   <em>\n    responsive\n   </em>\n   messages,\" because numbers stored to send such messages were not stored \"to be called.\" So construed, Facebook argues,\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   avoids the outcome of deeming smartphones a type of ATDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We cannot square this construction with\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   or the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   's gloss on the statutory text provides no basis to exclude equipment that stores numbers \"to be called\" only reflexively. Indeed, the statute suggests otherwise: \"to be called\" need not be the only purpose for storing numbers-the equipment need only have the \"capacity\" to store numbers to be called.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The amended complaint does not so much as suggest that Facebook's equipment could (or did) store numbers for any other reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Importantly, rejecting the active-reflexive distinction does not render \"to be called\" superfluous. Phone numbers are frequently stored for purposes other than \"to be called\": shops and restaurants store numbers to identify customers in their loyalty programs; electronic phonebooks store numbers for public access; data mining companies store and sell numbers; and software for customer relations management stores numbers to help businesses manage their clientele. So \"to be called\" has meaning without inferring a silent distinction between active and reflexive calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Facebook's argument that any ATDS definition should avoid implicating smartphones provides no reason to adopt the proposed active-reflexive distinction. Even if Facebook's premise has merit, the quintessential purpose for which smartphone users store numbers is \"to be called\" proactively. In other words, excluding equipment that stores numbers \"to be called\" only reflexively would not avoid capturing smartphones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Our reading supports the TCPA's animating purpose-protecting privacy by restricting unsolicited, automated telephone calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. 102-178, at 1. The messages Duguid received were automated, unsolicited, and unwanted. We are unpersuaded by Facebook's strained reading of\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   and the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Facebook advances a separate argument that it was entitled to dismissal on the pleadings because the TCPA excepts \"call[s] made for emergency purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). The FCC has construed this exception broadly, to include \"calls made necessary in any situation affecting the health and safety of consumers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(4). But Duguid alleges that he is not a Facebook customer and has advised Facebook of that fact repeatedly and through various means of communication. Accepting these allegations as true, Duguid did not have a Facebook account, so his account could not have faced a security issue, and Facebook's messages fall outside even the broad construction the FCC has afforded the emergency exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   , 31 F.C.C.

These calls must be about a bona fide emergency that is relevant to the called party.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, it bears reiterating that we are considering the amended complaint at the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal stage. Thus, we review the sufficiency of the allegations, not their accuracy or the intricate workings of Facebook's equipment, algorithms, or notification system. Developing those factual details remains for the parties and the district court on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a threshold matter, we confirm that Facebook has standing to challenge\n   the constitutionality of the post-amendment TCPA. Although the TCPA violations Duguid alleges predate the debt-collection exception, which took effect in 2015, he also seeks damages on behalf of a putative class for violations that occurred in part in 2016, as well as forward-looking injunctive relief based on the post-amendment TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landgraf v.
