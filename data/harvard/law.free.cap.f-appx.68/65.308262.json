We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, see <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendant because state prisoners have no liberty interest in their classification status, <em>see Hernandez v. Johnston, </em>833 F.2d 1316, 1318 (9th Cir. 1987), or participation in rehabilitative programs, see <em>also Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976) (rejecting claim that \u201cprisoner classification and eligibility for rehabilitative programs\u201d invoked due process protections).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Snider\u2019s allegations that the classification placed him in danger of being assaulted were insufficient to show that the defendant acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind to constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">All pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b96-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
