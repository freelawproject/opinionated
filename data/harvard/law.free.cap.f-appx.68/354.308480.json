Our review of legal questions concerning the proper interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is plenary. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>70 F.3d 279, 280 (3d Cir.1995). For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties, we need not recite the factual background of this case. Gill argues that the district court erred by failing to retroactively apply United States Sentencing Guideline Amendments 500 and 518 in deciding his motion for a reduction of sentence. The applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(C)(2), provides in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(C)(2) (2003). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s most recent policy statement regarding the retroactivity of amended guidelines states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apo\">(a) Where a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (C) below, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(C)(2). If none of the amendments listed in subsection (C) is applicable, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(C)(2) is not consistent with this policy statement and thus is not authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">(C) Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in Appendix C as follows: 126, 130,156,176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, and 606.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsXK\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since Amendments 500 and 518 are not listed in subsection (C), neither may be applied retroactively pursuant to \u00a7 3582(C)(2). We addressed a similar issue in <em>Thompson. </em>There, we held that Amendment 459 does not apply retroactively on a \u00a7 3582(C)(2) motion. 70 F.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir.1995). We noted that the \u201clanguage of the applicable sections could not be clearer: the statute directs the Court to the policy statement, and the policy statement provides that an amendment not listed in subsection (C) may not be applied retroactively pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(C)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, as in <em>Thompson, </em>the plain language of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement precludes our applying these amendments retroactively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Inasmuch as Amendments 500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>and 518 are not listed in subsection (C), we must affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\">. In reaching our decision, we note that our analysis is the same whether we apply the 2003 policy statement or the 2002 policy statement. Gill\u2019s motion was hied in June 2002 and denied a month later. The last change to the policy statement was made in 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-14\">. Gill, in arguing for retroactivity, relies on <em>United States v. Marmolejos, </em>140 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir.1998) which noted that \"courts can give retroactive effect to a clarifying (as opposed to substantive) amendment regardless of whether it is listed in U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.10.\u201d However, unlike Gill, in <em>Marmolejos </em>the retroactivity question was raised by the defendant\u2019s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>But see United States v. Edwards, </em>309 F.3d 110, 112 (3d Cir.2002) (relying on <em>Marmolejos </em>and considering whether a Sentencing Guideline amendment was substantive or clarifying before deciding that the amendment was not retroactively applicable).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
