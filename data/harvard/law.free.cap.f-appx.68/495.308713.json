We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Worstell contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding any fact, other than prior conviction, that increases criminal penalty beyond prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt), the district court impermissibly subjected her to a higher sentencing guidelines range upon a finding that the assault caused serious bodily injury because that fact was not submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We have previously held sentencing factors are not required to be alleged in the indictment or submitted to the jury. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.2000). Worstell was sentenced within the statutory maximum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b) upon a jury finding of bodily injury, and <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm WorstelTs sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
