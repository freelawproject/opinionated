Doman has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, alleging that the district court has unduly delayed acting on his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000), and his motion to stay a state court proceeding. Doman seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny as moot Doman\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus because the district court has acted on Doman\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
