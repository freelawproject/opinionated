We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Doan contends that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to make discovery requests, presenting an unfavorable defense, and advising him not to testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The district court correctly determined that even if the trial counsel would have filed more discovery motions, and presented a different defense, Doan has not established that, but for his counsel\u2019s advice not to testify, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different since his proffered testimony would have resulted in the same second degree murder conviction. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (requiring that a petitioner demonstrate his counsel was ineffective by establishing that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Because trial counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance did not affect the outcome of the trial, the district court properly determined that Doan failed to demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (holding that petitioners are entitled to habeas relief only if a trial-type error, in light of the record as a whole, had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Doan\u2019s habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 123 S.Ct. 357, 361, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (stating that the federal habeas scheme \u201cauthorizes federal-court intervention only when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>537 U.S. 1149, 123 S.Ct. 957, 154 L.Ed.2d 855 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b859-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A2Tj\">.
