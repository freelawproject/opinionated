Thomas was convicted of receiving stolen property, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 496(a), and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole under California\u2019s three-strikes law, California Penal Code \u00a7 667(e)(2)(A). This court granted a Certificate of Appealability limited to the issue of whether Thomas\u2019 25 years to life sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Thomas\u2019 habeas petition, <em>Luna v. </em>Cambra, 306 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir.), <em>as amended by </em>311 F.3d 928 (9th Cir.2002), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Because Thomas filed his habeas petition in 1999, his appeal is governed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), which requires us to determine if the state court\u2019s denial of Thomas\u2019 habeas petition was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Ordinarily, we look to the state court\u2019s last reasoned decision to make this determination. <em>See Shackleford v. Hubbard, </em>234 F.3d 1072, 1079 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000). Here, however, two state courts summarily denied Thomas\u2019 habeas petition without explanation, and the court of appeals did not consider the constitutional challenge on direct appeal. We thus conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the state court\u2019s denial was objectively reasonable. <em>Luna, </em>306 F.3d at 960; <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir.2000). We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">As the Supreme Court recently made clear in <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>the \u201conly relevant clearly established law amenable to the \u2018contrary to\u2019 or \u2018unreasonable application of framework is the gross disproportionality principle, the precise contours of which are unclear, applicable only in the \u2018exceedingly rare\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 case.\u201d <em>Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (citing <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 290, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983); and <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 272, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980)). The Court concluded in <em>Andrade </em>that two consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences with the possibility of parole, imposed under California\u2019s three-strikes law on the basis of two petty theft convictions, did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 1175; see <em>also Ewing v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (holding that a sentence of 25 years to life imposed for felony grand theft under California\u2019s three-strikes law did not violate the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-18\">On the basis of <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Ewing, </em>we conclude that Thomas\u2019 case was not one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>those \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d sentences fitting within the contours of the \u201cgross disproportionality\u201d principle. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b45-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
