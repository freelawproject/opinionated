Cortez contends that the district court erred by failing to consider the applicable Sentencing Guidelines provision in denying him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility or, alternatively, erred by not finding this to be an extraordinary case justifying simultaneous adjustments for obstruction of justice and acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>We lack jurisdiction because Cortez waived the right to appeal in his plea agreement. Contrary to Cortez\u2019s suggestion, neither the plea agreement nor the waiver provision was conditioned upon the district court\u2019s granting an acceptance of responsibility reduction. The government\u2019s only obligation in connection with acceptance of responsibility was to <em>recommend </em>a reduction, which it did. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>143 F.3d 1266, 1271-72 (9th Cir.1998) (knowing and voluntary waiver, whose language encompasses the grounds claimed on appeal, is enforceable and extends to an appeal based on an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines). This appeal is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b81-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
