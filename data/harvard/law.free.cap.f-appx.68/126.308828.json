The authority of the magistrate judge for the underlying action was based upon designation for pretrial matters by a district judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), rather than upon the consent of the parties under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). The magistrate judge\u2019s summary criminal contempt authority was based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(e)(2). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(e)(7), the initial appeal of such a contempt order entered by a magistrate judge is properly made to the district court, rather than to the court of appeals. Although Ianuzi did file in the district court a \u201cmotion for relief from contempt order,\u201d the current appeal is explicitly from the magistrate judge\u2019s order and not from any determination by the district judge. Thus, this court lacks jurisdiction over the current appeal, and the appeal is ordered DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
