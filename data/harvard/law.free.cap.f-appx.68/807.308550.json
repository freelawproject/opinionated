NELSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b837-28\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-29\">Danita Hope Torres appeals from her conviction and sentence for various offenses associated with an illegal gambling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>operation. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. The parties are familiar with the facts, and we will not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We conclude that the court properly instructed the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regarding Count 1, this court has \u201crepeatedly held that language that describes elements beyond what is required under statute is surplus-age and need not be proved at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charge of knowledge and willfulness in Count 1 was just such surplusage; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 describes a general intent crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury may infer general intent \u201cfrom the commission of the act\u201d charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court correctly instructed the jury when it declined to include the requirement of knowledge or willfulness in the instructions regarding Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The court had no obligation to instruct the jury regarding Torres\u2019 claimed defense of duress, or involuntariness, as to Count 1 and Count 3 because it concluded that she presented evidence regarding her defense only as to some of the money laundering counts. Torres does not challenge this conclusion on appeal. As to the specific counts to which Torres\u2019 duress defense applied, the court offered an appropriate duress instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">The court also did not err when it instructed the jury regarding Count 1 using the disjunctive term \u201cor\u201d instead of the conjunctive term \u201cand.\u201d The statute uses the disjunctive,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the statute\u2019s use \u2014 not the indictment\u2019s \u2014 governs a court\u2019s jury instructions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">As to Count 3 and the money laundering counts, the court did not err when it declined to use the term \u201cvoluntarily\u201d as part of the definition of the term \u201cknowingly.\u201d Neither the term \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d nor its meaning, is part of the approved definition of \u201cknowingly.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the instruction was clear without adding that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">With respect to the money laundering counts, the court did not err when it referred to the indictment for the factual bases of the forty-seven money laundering counts. In contrast to the cases Torres cites,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the jury had all the requisite materials as well as clear instructions in this case. The jury had a copy of the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ment, and the court properly instructed the jury that each count charged a \u201cseparate crime or offense\u201d and that it must consider each count separately. The instructions as a whole were not misleading or inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We face a closer question with respect to the sentencing issue Torres raises. Ideally, the district court would have addressed \u201ceach element of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> before granting the upward adjustment for obstruction of justice. In particular, it would have found willfulness explicitly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, we conclude that the district court\u2019s statements regarding the \u201cincredibly unbelievable\u201d nature of Torres\u2019 statements, and the \u201cclear, plain, and quite blatant\u201d nature of her obstruction of justice necessarily encompass the finding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">.
