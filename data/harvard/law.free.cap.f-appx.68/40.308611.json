Harrison challenges a decision of the United States Parole Commission rescinding his parole date and establishing a new presumptive parole date outside the range established by parole rescission guidelines. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The Parole Commission\u2019s decision to depart from the rescission guidelines based on Harrison\u2019s \u201chistory of assaultive behavior\u201d was supported by good cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Walker v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 1313, 1316 (9th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (stating that, if the Commission issues a decision outside the guidelines, \u201ca court may consider whether the Commission failed to show \u2018good cause\u2019 for doing so, but may only inquire whether that showing was arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, irrelevant, or capricious\u201d) (quoting <em>Wallace v. Christensen, </em>802 F.2d 1539, 1551 (9th Cir. 1986) (en banc)). The Commission did not act arbitrarily, irrationally, unreasonably, irrelevantly, or capriciously in making its decision when it relied on Harrison\u2019s original second-degree murder offense and later conviction for conveying a weapon within a correctional institution. Nor did the Commission engage in impermissible double-counting, because it relied not on Harrison\u2019s escape to determine the parole date, but on his \u201chistory of assaultive behavior\u201d to justify going above the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Harrison argues that the Commission\u2019s \u201creal\u201d reason to depart from the guidelines was his escape. Given this court\u2019s limited review of the Parole Commission\u2019s substantive decisions, <em>Benny v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>295 F.3d 977, 981-82 (9th Cir. 2002), we will not question the Commission\u2019s possible motives, at least here, where there is no allegation that the Commission is acting in retaliation to the prisoner\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights. <em>Cf. Weinstein v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>902 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir.1990) (remanding to the district court \u201cto determine if the Parole Commission\u2019s decision to go outside the guidelines was based on a vindictive motive and was intended to punish Weinstein for\u201d his successful habeas petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">. We reject the government\u2019s contentions that Harrison failed to raise the issues in district court and failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Harrison\u2019s habeas petition raised the issues he raises on appeal, especially in light of the principle that pleadings filed by pro se prisoners are to be construed liberally. <em>Zichko v. Idaho, </em>247 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, the district court addressed both issues raised on appeal, and \"both parties have briefed the issue and it is unlikely that the Government will be prejudiced by our consideration of\u201d issues whose merits were addressed by the district court. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>157 F.3d 661, 667 (9th Cir. 1998). Harrison also raised the issues presented here in his appeal to the National Appeals Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-15\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here, except as necessary to aid in understanding this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b71-12\">WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"At3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">I join the majority decision, but I write separately to clarify the record. Harrison did not raise the issue of assaultive behavior in his habeas petition, but we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>nonetheless review it under <em>United States v. Allen, </em>157 F.3d 661, 667 (9th Cir.1998). Harrison did not raise the double-counting issue to the National Appeals Board. The Commission had an opportunity to object in the district court on exhaustion grounds, but failed to. The exhaustion argument is thus waived.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
