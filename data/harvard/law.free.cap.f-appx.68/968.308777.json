It appears that Shemonsky was sued to enjoin him from interfering with the receivership involving Atlantic Financial Savings, F.A., related to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act. Thus, his appeal does not fall within our limited jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295, and we transfer the case to the Third Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"AFNP\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">This appeal is transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
