(\u201cWhite Cloud\u201d). ProLease claims White breached his fiduciary duty by allowing an employee from another company to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim under ProLease\u2019s insurance policy. We find no error with the district court\u2019s decision. ProLease did not prove it suffered any damage from the errant filing. It failed to show that its insurance rates climbed or rating standards changed because of White\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny White Cloud and Pro-Lease attorneys\u2019 fees. Both parties claim victory in their dispute over the promissory note. Neither party, however, can be characterized as the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d The district court ruled in favor of White Cloud by upholding the validity of the promissory note and rejecting ProLease\u2019s counterclaims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. The district court ruled in favor of ProLease by offsetting the promissory note by $612,772. Since neither party can claim total victory, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Anderson v. Melwani, </em>179 F.3d 763, 766 (9th Cir.1999) (stating district court has discretion to refuse to enforce a contractual attorneys\u2019 fees provision when awarding fees would be inequitable and unreasonable); <em>cf. United States ex rel. A.V. De-Blasio Constr., Inc. v. Mountain States Constr. Co., </em>588 F.2d 259, 263 (9th Cir. 1978) (holding district court acted within its discretion by denying attorneys\u2019 fees when both parties acted improperly).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b879-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
