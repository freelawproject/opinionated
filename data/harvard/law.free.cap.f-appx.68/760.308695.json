For the reasons explained below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-24\">Widtfeldt entered into a settlement agreement with appellees. The terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>this agreement were read into the record before the magistrate judge; thereafter, however, Widtfeldt moved to add numerous provisions to the agreement. The district court denied his motion to add the additional terms and confirmed the settlement agreement. On appeal, Widtfeldt challenges the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction and the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The district court properly exercised diversity jurisdiction as the parties were citizens of different states, and nothing in the record casts doubt on the court\u2019s determination that the injunctive relief he sought could reasonably have been expected to exceed $75,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1) (district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where matter in controversy exceeds $75,000, and is between citizens of different states); <em>Missouri v. Western Sur. Co., </em>51 F.3d 170, 173 (8th Cir.1995) (when challenged, district court must determine by preponderance of evidence whether there is \u201clegal certainty\u201d that plaintiff cannot recover amount sufficient to satisfy jurisdictional requirement). Further, for the reasons explained by the district court, it properly confirmed the settlement agreement entered into by the parties, as read into the record. <em>See Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Soc\u2019y v. Eight, </em>246 Neb. 619, 522 N.W.2d 155, 157-59 (1994); <em>In re Estate of Mithofer, </em>243 Neb. 722, 502 N.W.2d 454, 458 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
