Ellis was sentenced to a term of 110 months imprisonment. He now appeals his conviction and sentence. We affirm Ellis\u2019 conviction and dismiss the challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Ellis alleges that the district court plainly erred in failing to dismiss the indictment on the ground that \u00a7 922 no longer has a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740,146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). His argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Jones </em>do not affect our decisions regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)), and <em>United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808, 810-11 (4th Cir.1996) (holding that the jurisdictional requirement of \u00a7 922(g) satisfied Commerce Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">Ellis next argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2002) for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense. In his plea agreement, Ellis waived his right to appeal \u201cwhatever sentence is imposed, including any issues that relate to the establishment of the Guideline range,\u201d reserving only the right to appeal from an upward departure. A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir.2000). Ellis does not contend that his waiver was unknowing or involuntary, and our review of the guilty plea hearing leads us to conclude that it was voluntary. Thus, the claim of sentencing error may not be raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">We therefore affirm the conviction. We dismiss that portion of the appeal which seeks to challenge the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
