Fernandez applied for disability insurance benefits in December 1997, alleging disability since 1992 due to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and an anger problem. After denial of his application, Fernandez requested an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>administrative hearing. Administrative Law Judge Charles S. Evans affirmed the decision that Fernandez was not disabled. The Appeals Council denied review and Fernandez sought judicial review in the United States District Court. The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge John L. Weinberg and affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision on March 4, 2002. Fernandez timely appeals, claiming that the ALJ improperly discounted portions of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We review a district court\u2019s order affirming denial of benefits <em>de novo </em>and may only disturb the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it was based on legal error or was not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see also Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir.2002). If the evidence can reasonably support either affirming or reversing the Commissioner, this court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>See Verduzco v. Apfel </em>188 F.3d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Fernandez first alleges that his mental health counselor, Patricia L. Chandler, M.A., should have been given treating physician status. As a therapist without a doctorate, Ms. Chandler does not meet the regulations\u2019 requirements for an \u201cacceptable medical source.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513 (2002). The regulation does allow, however, for the testimony of an \u201cother source\u201d as evidence of the severity of a claimant\u2019s impairment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d) (2002). The regulations\u2019 listing of those qualified as an \u201cother source\u201d includes, inter aha, therapists, social welfare personnel, clergy, and family members. Under this circuit\u2019s precedent, an ALJ must either consider the testimony of such a lay witness or provide germane reasons for not crediting the testimony. <em>See Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 511 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cLay testimony as to a claimant\u2019s symptoms is competent evidence that an ALJ must take into account, unless he or she expressly determines to disregard such testimony and gives reasons germane to each witness for doing so.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918-19 (9th Cir.1993). Ms. Chandler qualifies as an \u201cother source\u201d witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The ALJ\u2019s written decision does not expressly disregard or credit Ms. Chandler\u2019s opinion. The ALJ does note in his description of the evidence that Fernandez missed several of his appointments with Ms. Chandler, which made it difficult for her to evaluate his capacity for work. However, the ALJ never indicated that he used this as a reason for discounting her opinions. Even if the ALJ had decided to discredit Ms. Chandler\u2019s evidence, he never expressed this in his opinion. Our case law requires more. <em>See supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Ms. Chandler opined that Fernandez\u2019s maladies were enough to meet Social Security\u2019s Listing of Impairments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525 (2002); 20 C.F.R. Ch. III, Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found that Fernandez did not meet the Listings and was not disabled. If the ALJ had given credit to Ms. Chandler\u2019s opinions, this may have pushed the weight of the evidence on this question to favor disability. Likewise, if the ALJ had credited Ms. Chandler\u2019s testimony, it may have changed the result reached by the agency\u2019s Vocational Expert in evaluating whether Fernandez could successfully work in any job in the national economy. Accordingly, an ALJ must review this case again and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>either consider Ms. Chandler\u2019s testimony or give adequate reasons for discounting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">When considering the record as a whole, it would seem the ALJ should have factored in Ms. Chandler\u2019s opinions. If credited, Ms. Chandler\u2019s testimony as to the Social Security Listings may have given Fernandez enough to meet his burden in establishing disability. If so, the burden would shift to the Commissioner to show there were jobs available in the national economy which Fernandez could perform. The Vocational Expert testified on cross examination that when Ms. Chandler\u2019s observations are added into the vocational hypothetical, a person like Fernandez would have great difficulty holding any employment. It is the job of the Commissioner to determine disability. There may very well be substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the ALJ\u2019s findings even after crediting the opinions of Ms. Chandler. However, we leave this determination, along with the decision regarding Ms. Chandler\u2019s testimony, to the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b850-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">.
