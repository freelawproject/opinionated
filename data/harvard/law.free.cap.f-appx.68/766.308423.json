The district court sentenced Graves to 120 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. On appeal, Graves\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-21\">The district court\u2019s decision not to grant the downward departure was clearly discretionary; thus, the decision is unreview<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>able. <em>See United States v. VanHouten, </em>307 F.3d 693, 696 (8th Cir.2002) (discretionary decision not to depart from Guidelines is unreviewable on appeal absent unconstitutional motive, unless district court erroneously concluded it lacked authority to depart).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Following careful review of the record, we find no other nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-22\">.
