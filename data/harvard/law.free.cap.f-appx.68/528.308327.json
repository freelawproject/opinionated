On appeal, Meadows claims: (1) the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea; (2) the base offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5) (2001) was clearly erroneous; (3) it was plain error not to award a reduction to the offense level for acceptance of responsibility; and (4) counsel was ineffective. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Rather, a defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d supports his request to withdraw his plea. <em>Id. </em>Moore\u2019s claim fails because he withdrew the motion and he did not offer any evidence in support of his claim that the guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-23\">A district court\u2019s factual findings used to determine the sentence are accorded substantial deference. The factual findings need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence and will only be disturbed if clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>957 F.2d 1138, 1148 (4th Cir. 1992). We find the court\u2019s decision with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>regard to the base offense level not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(30) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Because Meadows did not object to the district court\u2019s decision not to award a three-level reduction to the offense level for acceptance of responsibility, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under this standard, we exercise our discretion only to correct errors that are plain, material, or affecting substantial rights, and that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We find no plain error because Meadows did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the reduction. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>882 F.2d 902, 905, 907 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We find Meadows\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
