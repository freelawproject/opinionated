Davis claims that the state trial court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by allowing him to represent himself without adequately warning him of the dangers of self representation. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Killian v. Poole, </em>282 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir.2002). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, however, we reverse a state court decision denying relief <em>only </em>if that decision is (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172,155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The California Court of Appeal examined Davis\u2019s written waiver and the hearing transcript and concluded that Davis \u201cwas sufficiently apprised of the dangers of self-representation to meet the requirement that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Davis\u2019s difference of opinion with the state trial court regarding the potential maximum sentence he faced is not enough to render his waiver defective or demonstrate that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b118-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
