Durrell appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment for defendants in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging he was assaulted by two corrections officers during transport to his cell in the disciplinary segregation unit. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Following a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Troutt v. Colorado W. Ins. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1150, 1156 (9th Cir.2001). We review the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-22\">Durrell contends the district court erred by dismissing his claim alleging that Officer Henning failed to investigate his complaint that he was assaulted. We disagree. The district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim because Durrell did not raise a triable issue as to Henning\u2019s personal involvement in, or causal connection to, the alleged use of excessive force. <em>See Hansen v. Black, </em>885 F.2d 642, 646 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-23\">Contrary to Durrell\u2019s arguments on appeal, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that defendants Torrey and Novotny used a minimal amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>force in good faith to maintain discipline and did not act maliciously or sadistically with the intent to cause harm. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). We will not disturb the district court\u2019s findings based solely on Durrell\u2019s belief that Torrey and Novotny were not credible. <em>See Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enters., Inc., </em>256 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that factual findings which rest on credibility determinations are given \u201ceven greater deference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Durrell further contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request to call inmates Bailey and Keller to testify as eyewitnesses to the alleged assault. While the record is not clear that such request was ever made or denied, Durrell was not prejudiced by any denial because Bailey and Keller\u2019s version of events was set forth in affidavits which were reviewed by the district court. <em>See Janes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>279 F.3d 883, 886 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining that reversal based on an erroneous evidentiary ruling requires showing that district court abused its discretion and that the error was prejudicial).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Durrell\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel because Durrell did not show exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Durrell\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b102-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
