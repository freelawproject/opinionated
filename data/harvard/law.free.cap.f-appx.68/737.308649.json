Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b767-19\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">Ronald Seawood, a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s decision to deny his motion to modify his sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on an amendment to the application notes to \u00a7 2K2.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-21\">In 1997 a jury found Seawood and two co-defendants guilty of carjacking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, conspiracy to commit carjacking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 317, and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). For the particularly brutal facts underlying these crimes, see our opinion, <em>United States v. Seawood, 172 </em>F.3d 986 (7th Cir.1999), in which we affirmed the convictions. Relevant to this appeal is an upward departure, the equivalent of six offense levels, imposed by the district court during Seawood\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-22\">The district court, applying the 1997 Guidelines, arrived at a guideline range by first applying \u00a7 2B3.1 to the carjacking and conspiracy convictions to arrive at an offense level of 31; along with Seawood\u2019s criminal history of category I, this placed him in a range of 108 to 135 months. In addition, Seawood\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) required a consecutive sentence of 60 months, thereby making the upper end of his punishment range 195 months. Had Seawood not been convicted under \u00a7 924(c), he would have received an additional six-point increase in offense level for using a firearm during the carjacking, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>would have had an offense level of 37 and a sentencing range of 210 to 262 months. The increase was not applicable, in order to prevent double counting, because the \u00a7 924(c) conviction already accounted for Seawood\u2019s use of a firearm during his underlying crime. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2). The application notes to \u00a7 2K2.4 further explain, however, that when a defendant\u2019s guideline range is lower than it would have been had the defendant not been convicted under \u00a7 924(c), as Sea-wood\u2019s was here, the court may depart upward to a range equivalent to what it would have been without the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See id. </em>(The rationale is to prevent a defendant from benefitting from the additional conviction.) The district court followed this procedure, departing upward to a range equivalent to what it would have been without the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. After departing upward further for sexual abuse, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2A3.1, 3D1.4(a), the court arrived at an offense level of 39 and a guideline range of 262 to 327 months. Accordingly, the court sentenced Seawood to concurrent imprisonment terms of 60 and 267 months for the conspiracy and carjacking convictions, and a consecutive term of 60 months for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. On direct appeal we affirmed a similar upward departure under \u00a7 2K2.4 for one of Sea-wood\u2019s co-defendants. <em>Seawood, </em>172 F.3d at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Seawood filed a motion in district court contending that the district court\u2019s upward departure under \u00a7 2K2.4 was impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d forbidden by amendment 599 (effective Nov. 1, 2000), which modified the application notes to \u00a7 2K2.4. He renews that argument on appeal. Amendment 599 clarified the situations in which weapons enhancements are appropriate when combined with \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>See United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2002). The amendment is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and therefore one for which retroactive application may be appropriate. <em>See Ebbole v. United States, 8 </em>F.3d 530, 539 (7th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The district court correctly observed, however, that amendment 599 did not materially alter the paragraph in the application notes discussing upward departures in situations, such as Seawood\u2019s, where the guideline range is lower because of a \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C (amendment 599). Rather than being an instance of double counting, the departure (now discussed at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.4)) ensures that defendants in situations such as Seawood\u2019s receive the same sentences they would have received had they not been convicted under \u00a7 924(c). <em>United States v. Banks-Giombetti </em>245 F.3d 949, 954-54 (7th Cir.2001). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Seawood\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Marshall, </em>83 F.3d 866, 869 n. 3 (7th Cir.1996) (district courts have discretion to reduce sentences based on retroactive amendments); <em>White, </em>305 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
