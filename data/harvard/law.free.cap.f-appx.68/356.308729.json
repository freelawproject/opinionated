Magistrini also challenges the District Court\u2019s decision to admit certain testimony for the sole purpose of the <em>Daubert </em>hearing and to employ Dr. Mark Weiss as a technical advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">When a party seeks to admit expert testimony, the District Court must make an initial determination, in a preliminary hearing under Fed.R.Evid. 104(a), that the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 702 have been met. <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Rule 702 imposes a special obligation on the District Judge to \u201censure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">In assessing whether proffered scientific expert testimony is reliable, we have explained that the District Court should admit expert testimony \u201cif there are \u2018good grounds\u2019 for the expert\u2019s conclusion\u201d notwithstanding the judge\u2019s belief that there are better grounds for some alternative conclusion. <em>Heller v. Shaw, </em>167 F.3d 146, 152-53 (3d Cir.1999) (citations omitted). The District Court must also \u201cexamine the expert\u2019s conclusions in order to determine whether they could reliably follow from the facts known to the expert and the methodology used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153. However, \u201cnothing in either <em>Daubert </em>or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 145-46, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>We review the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude or admit testimony under <em>Daubert, </em>as well as to employ a technical advis- or, for abuse of discretion. To demonstrate abuse, Appellant must show that the District Court\u2019s based \u201cits opinion on a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an erroneous legal conclusion, or an improper application of law to fact.\u201d <em>LaSalle Nat Bank v. First Conn. Holding Group, L.L.C. XXIII, </em>287 F.3d 279, 288 (3d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Inasmuch as the District Court has already set forth the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not repeat that history here. <em>See Magistrini v. One Hour Maximizing Dry Cleaning, et al., </em>180 F.Supp.2d 584 (D.N.J.2002). The District Court has carefully and completely explained its reasons for excluding the testimony of Appellant\u2019s causation expert and admitting other testimony in its thoughtful Memorandum Opinion and Order. The District Court did not abuse its discretion. It properly conducted the <em>Daubext </em>hearing, applied the correct legal standard, and made no clearly erroneous findings of fact. Given the District Court\u2019s careful analysis, no purpose will be served by this court undertaking a redundant discussion simply to reach the same result. The District Court\u2019s actions in selecting a technical ad-visor were also well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the District Court for substantially the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s thoughtful Memorandum Opinion without further elaboration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
