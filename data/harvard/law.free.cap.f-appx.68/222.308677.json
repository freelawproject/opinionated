Anderson appeals <em>pro se </em>from a judgment entered on January 18, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Arcara, /.), following the court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court construed Anderson\u2019s amended complaint as raising a claim under the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (\u201cNAGPRA\u201d), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3001-3013, arising out of the alleged desecration of burial sites located in Hampton Corners in Groveland, New York. The court granted summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ment to defendants, holding that (1) Anderson failed to show he had standing to bring a NAGPRA claim; (2) Anderson failed to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and (3) there had been insufficient service of process against several of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Anderson contends on appeal that the United States District Court for the Western District of New York lacked power to adjudicate this action because (1) it is not an Article III court, and (2) the \u201cUnited States of America\u201d that was granted Article III power in the Constitution is distinct from the \u201cUnited States\u201d that currently exercises that power. We hold that: (1) it is, <em>see </em>U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time establish.\u201d); Act of May 12, 1900, 31 Stat. 175, 175-77 (establishing the Western District of New York); and (2) it is not, <em>compare </em>U.S. Const, pmbl. (\u2018We The People of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\u201d), <em>with id. </em>art. Ill, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time establish.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">To the extent Anderson\u2019s appellate brief may be construed to raise other issues, we conclude that they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
