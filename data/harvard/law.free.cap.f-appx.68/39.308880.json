R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b69-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-24\">Plaintiff Bridgette R. Tade filed a complaint pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-25\">The complaint alleges that Tade suffered an injury on March 13, 1998, at the Marine Corps Air Station Commissary in Yuma, Arizona, as a result of the United States\u2019 negligence. A tort claim against the government is barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate agency within two years. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). A claim is deemed presented when the agency receives from the claimant a completed administrative claim form. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-26\">The government asserts that it did not receive Tade\u2019s claim form at the Law Center at the Air Station until March 16, 2000, three days after the expiration of the two-year period. Although Tade asserts that she mailed the form on March 8, 2000, simply mailing a claim within the statutory time period is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that the claim be \u201cpresented.\u201d <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 344, 346-47 (9th Cir.1981). Accordingly, the district court properly held that the claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Tade argues that she had an inadequate opportunity to pursue discovery to support her theory of timely presentation of the claim. We conclude, however, that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The court gave Tade three significant extensions of the discovery period. Despite these extensions, Tade failed to file a formal request for the documents that she now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Finally, Tade argues that she is entitled to equitable relief from the deadline. We find no grounds for such relief in this record. <em>Cf. Gervais v. United States, </em>865 F.2d 196 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that a request stamped \u201creceived\u201d three days late was timely when it had been received at the agency\u2019s former address within the statutory period and when the agency had failed to provide the claimant with the right address).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b69-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
