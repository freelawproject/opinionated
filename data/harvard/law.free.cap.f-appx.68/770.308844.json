At sentencing, the district court denied Mr. Holmes\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on claimed overstatement of his criminal history category. The court thereafter sentenced Mr. Holmes to 292 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. For reversal, Mr. Holmes argues that the district court should have departed downward to impose a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Given the district court\u2019s explicit recognition of its authority to depart, its decision not to depart is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Rodriguez, </em>220 F.3d 940, 942 (8th Cir.2000). To the extent that Mr. Holmes\u2019s reference in his appeal brief to the Tenth Amendment was intended to challenge his sentence on Tenth Amendment grounds, we will not consider this constitutional argument, which is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>51 F.3d 1376, 1382-83 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-36\">.
