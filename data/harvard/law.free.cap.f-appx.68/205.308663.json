It is</p>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the United Mine Workers of America\u2019s petition be denied. The UMWA asserts that the agency\u2019s high-voltage longwall mining rule, Electric Motor-Driven Mine Equipment and Accessories and High-Voltage Longwall Equipment Standards for Underground Coal Mines, 67 Fed.Reg. 10,972 (Mar. 11, 2002) (to be codified at 30 C.F.R. pts. 18 and 75), violates section 101(a)(9) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a)(9). We do not reach the merits of the UMWA\u2019s statutory argument, however, because section 101(d) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(d), requires that \u201c[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Secretary [of Labor] shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused for good cause shown.\u201d <em>See also Nat\u2019l Mining Ass\u2019n v. MSHA </em>116 F.3d 520, 532 (D.C.Cir.1997) (applying 101(a)(9) to decline to reach objection not urged before the MSHA).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-22\">Here, the UMWA\u2019s only answer to the charge that it failed to urge its statutory argument before the agency is a letter submitted by the UMWA and the Bitumi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>nous Coal Operators\u2019 Association (1) \u201cjoint[ly] recommending]\u201d that mine operators \u201ccontinue to comply\u201d with certain safety standards then in effect at certain mines and (2) requesting that the agency \u201cincorporate] ... into the preamble of the final rule\u201d the \u201crequirement\u201d that mine operators continue to comply with the indicated safety standards. The letter contains no citation to section 101(a)(9) or to any other statutory provision. In fact, no part of the letter purports to represent anything more than the commenters\u2019 views about proper mine safety policy and no part contains any hint of the entirely different argument that the UMWA now urges before this court, namely that section 101(a)(9) <em>obligates </em>the agency to preserve the indicated safety standards. The request that existing safety standards be protected by language in the preamble, rather than in the rule itself, further indicates that the UMWA\u2019s letter was more in the nature of a general policy comment than an argument about statutory necessity, since it is well-settled that preambles, though undoubtedly \u201ccontribut[ing] to a general understanding\u201d of statutes and regulations, are not \u201coperative part[s]\u201d of statutes and regulations. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. EPA, </em>286 F.3d 554, 569-70 (D.C.Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Because the UMWA failed to preserve its statutory arguments before the agency, and because it has not argued \u201cgood cause\u201d excuse before this court, we conclude that section 101(d) deprives this court of jurisdiction over the present petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C. Cm. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
