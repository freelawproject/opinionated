R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-21\">Defendant Willie Vincent Myers pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 78 months. Myers appeals his sentence. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-22\">Myers\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) (permitting counsel who considers an appeal to be wholly frivolous to advise the court of that fact, request permission to withdraw, and submit a brief referring to portions of the record that arguably support the appeal). Counsel has filed a motion to withdraw and, as required, has provided copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>of the <em>Anders </em>brief and the motion to withdraw to Myers. Myers has not filed a response. Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review of the record and find no basis for reversing Myers\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We find no merit to Myers\u2019 assertion that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for use of a firearm in connection with another felony. The court found that during an altercation in an automobile with his girlfriend on January 29, 2001, Myers fired a gun three or four times at his girlfriend\u2019s legs but she avoided injury by pushing away the gun. We have reviewed the sentencing transcript and conclude the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>314 F.3d 1216, 1222 (10th Cir.2003) (discussing standard of review for district court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions at sentencing). Further, because this conduct could have given rise to a felony conviction under Colorado state law, we conclude the court properly applied the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 7 (defining \u201c[flelony offense\u201d under subsection (b)(5) as \u201cany offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We also find no merit to Myers\u2019 assertion that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. It is uncontroverted that, following his arrest, Myers sent letters to two key witnesses. After reviewing the letters, the court found the intent of the letters was to ask the two witnesses \u201cnot to testify or to tell the truth.\u201d ROA, Vol. 4 at 78. The court also found that Myers broke one of the witness\u2019 car windows. We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court\u2019s factual findings are supported by the evidence and that the court properly applied the enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4 (listing threatening of witness as example of obstructive conduct); <em>see also United States v. Heckard, </em>238 F.3d 1222, 1232-33 (10th Cir.2001) (affirming application of \u00a7 3C1.1 where defendant unlawfully attempted to influence a witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">AFFIRMED. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b936-15\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
