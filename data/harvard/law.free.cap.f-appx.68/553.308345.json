Syed Ashraf Ali QUNDHARI, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"A4oq\">No. 02-6398.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"Aohh\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACvn\">June 9, 2003.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b583-21\">Before: KEITH, BATCHELDER, and CLAY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b583-22\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-23\">Syed Ashraf Ah Qundhari, proceeding through counsel, appeals the sentence imposed following his conviction on three counts of making false statements during proceedings relating to naturalization, citizenship, or registry of aliens, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1015. The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-24\">On February 13, 2002, Qundhari was indicted on five counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1015. The district court dismissed two counts, and a jury convicted Qundhari of the three remaining counts on July 11, 2002. At sentencing and over Qundhari\u2019s objection, the district court imposed a two level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l), because Qundhari had been deported prior to the commission of the instant offense. With a total base offense level of 10 and a criminal history category of 1, Qundhari\u2019s resulting guidelines range of imprisonment was 6 to 12 months. On October 24, 2002, the district court sentenced Qundhari near the middle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of the range to 10 months in prison, 2 years of supervised release, and a $300 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In his timely appeal, Qundhari contends that the district court erred by imposing the \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) enhancement because he lacked knowledge that he previously had been deported. He argues that the enhancement should not be applied without a finding of scienter because statutes imposing criminal liability without a mental culpability requirement are generally disfavored. Qundhari\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge\u201d of the deportation occurred because he left the United States after a previous arrest for using false immigration documents and release on bond, but before the conclusion of deportation proceedings. When he failed to appear at the deportation hearing on May 14, 1992, an immigration judge ordered Qundhari to be deported in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>225 F.3d 637, 641 (6th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Barton, </em>100 F.3d 43, 44 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The district court properly concluded that \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) does not require a finding of scienter. The interpretation of a guideline provision begins with the language of the guideline. <em>Barton, </em>100 F.3d at 45 (citing to <em>United States v. Wong, </em>3 F.3d 667, 670 (3d Cir.1993)). Section 2L2.2(b)(l) provides for a two level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant is an unlawful alien who has been deported (voluntarily or involuntarily) on one or more occasions prior to the instant offense.\u201d The unambiguous language of \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) does not contain a scienter requirement and this court declines \u201cto find ambiguity where none exists to defeat the plain meaning of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mobley, </em>956 F.2d 450, 453 (3d Cir.1992). Furthermore, comparison of \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) to guidelines which expressly contain a scienter requirement indicates that Congress knew how to include a scienter requirement, but chose not to do so. <em>See United States v. Thornton, </em>306 F.3d 1355, 1359 (3d Cir.2002); USSG \u00a7 2K1.3(b)(2) (applied where defendant \u201cknew or had reason to believe\u201d that explosive material was stolen); USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 (applied where defendant \u201cwilfully\u201d obstructed or attempted to obstruct justice). The Sentencing Guidelines are distinct from criminal statutes and \u201care not normally required to carry their own mens rea requirements.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>262 F.3d 867, 870 (9th Cir.2001). The failure to carry a mens rea requirement does not by itself make a guideline unconstitutional. <em>See generally United States v. Goodell, </em>990 F.2d 497 (9th Cir. 1993). Nor does the lack of any scienter requirement in \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) violate due process as it did not increase the maximum statutory penalty of 5 years, did not negate the government\u2019s burden of proving the underlying offense, and did not create a separate offense calling for a separate penalty. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571; <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 87-88, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Finally, we note that Qundhari\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) would reward him for absconding in 1992. An interpretation of the Guidelines which produces an absurd result such as this must be avoided. <em>See United States v. Hayter Oil Co., </em>51 F.3d 1265, 1274 (6th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>945 F.2d 129, 136 (6th Cir.1991), <em>modified, </em>966 F.2d 184 (6th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
