R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Petitioner Bal Bahadur Sunwar seeks review of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) decision that he is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board of Immigration Review (BIA) summarily denied review. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Mr. Sunwar is a native and citizen of Nepal. He entered the United States in 1999 on a valid B-l Visitor\u2019s Visa and filed a timely application for asylum, claiming he had been subject to persecution due to his conversion to the Christian faith. Mr. Sunwar stated that he and his brother, also a Christian, had been ostracized by their fellow villagers and accused of killing and eating cows. They were arrested, incarcerated, beaten, and intimidated in an attempt to force them to reaffirm their adherence to Hinduism. He related that his immediate family was also incarcerated and their house was destroyed and looted. They eventually left the village and moved to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Mr. Sunwar moved to Brunei after being advised he was not safe in the capital. After ten years in Brunei, Mr. Sunwar obtained a visa to the United States. His family remained in Nepal, but as the harassment continued, they eventually moved to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) \u201caltered the availability, scope, and nature of judicial review in INS cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Rivera-Jimenez v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1213, 1215 n. 1 (10th Cir.2000). Because Mr. Sunwar\u2019s deportation proceedings began in 2000, this case is governed by IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules. <em>See Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>318 F.3d 1226, 1229 n. 4 (10th Cir.2003). Under the permanent rules, the Attorney General\u2019s decision to grant or deny asylum \u201cshall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D). Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Panrit v. INS, </em>19 F.3d 544, 546 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">The IJ determined that Mr. Sunwar had shown he had been persecuted due to his religion. The IJ noted, however, that the government of Nepal has recognized many Christian schools, welfare organizations and missions and does not interfere with Christian observances unless Christians are marching without a permit. The gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ernment rarely prosecutes converts and holds no religious prisoners. The IJ denied Mr. Sunwar\u2019s application because he had not shown a country-wide fear of persecution, as he could live freely in Kathmandu.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Mr. Sunwar argues he did demonstrate a fear of persecution on a countrywide basis. However, the record does not establish that he would be subject to country-wide persecution. We cannot say the IJ\u2019s decision that Mr. Sunwar was not eligible for asylum and withholding of removal was \u201cmanifestly contrary to law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Mr. Sunwar also argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision by a single member of the Board without opinion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7). Mr. Sunwar contends the BIA abdicated its responsibility to review the IJ\u2019s decision when it summarily affirmed that decision without explanation pursuant to the new streamlining regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Section 1003.1(a)(7) (formerly found at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)) permits a single member of the Board to affirm the decision of the IJ without opinion if the Board member concludes the decision is correct and any errors in the decision are harmless. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(ii). The single member must also determine either that \u201cthe issue on appeal is squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and does not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation,\u201d or that \u201cthe factual and legal questions raised on appeal are so insubstantial that three-Member review is not warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B). Our review shows that Mr. Sunwar raised no substantial issues of law. Moreover, under existing precedent, there is no factual basis to support a grant of asylum. This case therefore does not present a situation in which the collective judgment of the Board, as opposed to the review of one member, might well have resulted in a different assessment. Thus, we cannot say the BIA erred in employing the streamlining regulation. We DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\">. Mr. Sunwar does not contest the IJ\u2019s determination that he is not eligible for relief under the Convention Against Torture. This issue is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-16\">. We have jurisdiction to review the denial of an asylum request pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (excepting asylum decision from provision divesting courts of jurisdiction to review denials of discretionary relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
