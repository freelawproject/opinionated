We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo, <em>Patterson v. Gomez, </em>223 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">First, Grayson contends that he was prevented from presenting a defense, in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment, when the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cintent to defraud cannot be disproved by subsequent payments.\u201d Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the trial court\u2019s instruction restricted Grayson\u2019s right to present a defense, his claim fails because the instruction, a correct statement of California law, was neither arbitrary nor disproportionate. <em>See Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 55-56, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987) (holding that restrictions on a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense are acceptable so long as they are not \u201carbitrary or disproportionate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">Grayson also contends that the instruction reallocated the burden of proof. This claim is unpersuasive, as the jury instructions as a whole clearly placed the burden of proof on the prosecution. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-18\">Next, Grayson contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the validity of his prior convictions. He also claims that his appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising all potentially meritorious issues on appeal. He fails, however, to show that either counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that but for either counsel\u2019s alleged unprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-19\">Grayson also contends that his sentence of 50 years to life under California\u2019s Three Strikes Law, Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 667 (West 1999), constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. This claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1166, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>1174, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that a state court\u2019s decision to affirm petitioner\u2019s two consecutive 25-years-to-life terms under the Three Strikes Law was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law), and <em>Ewing v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1179,1190,155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (holding that petitioner\u2019s 25-years-to-life sentence under the Three Strikes Law did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Grayson next contends that the trial court should not have used his prior federal conviction for bank robbery to enhance his sentence under the Three Strikes Law. This is an issue of state law generally not cognizable on federal habeas review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Finally, Grayson makes a claim under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466,120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). However, a claim of error under <em>Apprendi </em>cannot be raised on initial collateral review. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664, 671 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 48, 154 L.Ed.2d 243 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b825-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-11\">. Regardless, Grayson\u2019s claim fails. Although a conviction for federal bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) is not per se proof of a serious felony conviction, <em>see People v. Jones, </em>75 Cal.App.4th 616, 632, 89 Cal.Rptr.2d 485 (1999), in this case, the record reflects that Grayson pled guilty to bank robbery \u201cby force, violence, and intimidation.\u201d Accordingly, his conviction for federal bank robbery is a serious felony that may be charged as a strike under California law. <em>See People v. Guerrero, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 401, 403-07, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 803 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-26\">. We decline to consider Grayson\u2019s claims that were not raised before the district court. <em>See Cacoperdo v. Demosthenes, </em>37 F.3d 504, 507 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
