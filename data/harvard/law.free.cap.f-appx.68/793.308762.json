R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b824-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Isidro Cazares-Cazares appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and his previous conditions of supervised release. He alleges that the sentences violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because Cazares-Cazares did not lodge any objection at sentencing, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1028-29 (9th Cir.2000). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Cazares-Cazares\u2019 consecutive sentences for violating \u00a7 1326 and for violating the terms of his supervised release, although predicated on the same conduct, do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the sentences punish two separate crimes. The revocation of Cazares-Cazares\u2019 supervised release is punishment for his original crime, not for the conduct that resulted in the revocation of his supervised release. <em>United States v. Soto-Olivas, </em>44 F.3d 788, 790-91 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The fact that the government\u2019s willingness to accept Cazares-Cazares\u2019 plea on his \u00a7 1326 violation was \u201cconditioned upon the defendant being on supervised release\u201d at the time of the violation does not change the analysis. <em>Cf. Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 398-99, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (finding that a single act can be punished as a single crime and can also be used as the basis for a sentencing enhancement for a separate crime). The plea agreement was based upon the parties\u2019 understanding that Cazares-Cazares was on supervised release at the time of the violation, not upon the fact that he had violated his supervised release. Additionally, it was not error, let alone plain error, for the district court to impose consecutive sentences given that there is no suggestion in the plea agreement that the resulting sentence for the \u00a7 1326 offense also was intended to constitute punishment for Cazares-Cazares\u2019 supervised release violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
