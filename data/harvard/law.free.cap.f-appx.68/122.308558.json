We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 654, 659 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Black alleged that the defendants ran the Dispatch Hall in a racially discriminatory manner and that, in March 1994, he was discriminated against while working at the Globe Elevator work site. The district court properly concluded that Black did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination at the Dispatch Hall because Black did not present evidence that similarly-situated casual workers who were not in his protected class were treated more favorably than he was. <em>See id. </em>at 659-60 (stating elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case of employment discrimination). The district court properly concluded that Black did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants could be held liable for alleged discrimination at the Globe Elevator work site; defendants presented evidence that they were not Black\u2019s employer, and Black failed to respond with evidence showing that he had a reasonable basis to believe that the globe Elevator \u201cwalking boss\u201d was acting on behalf of defendants. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. District Council of Iron Workers, </em>124 F.3d 1094, 1099 (9th Cir.1997). Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">Black\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief is GRANTED. The Clerk shall file the reply brief received on May 7, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b153-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
