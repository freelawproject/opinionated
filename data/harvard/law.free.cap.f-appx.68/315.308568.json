For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-34\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties who are familiar with the background of this appeal, we need not discuss the factual or procedural background except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>insofar as maybe helpful to our brief discussion. Defendants raise only a single issue on appeal. They contend that the district court imposed sentences on each of them pursuant to a \u201cpractice\u201d that \u201camounted to a fixed personal sentencing policy rather than the case-by-case consideration required by <em>U.S. v. King, </em>53 F.3d 589, 591 (3d Cir.1995).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. Each of the defendants was sentenced to a period of three months incarceration with credit for time served. Prior to sentencing, the district court asked defense counsel if there was any objection to sentencing all of the defendants charged in this case at the same time, and counsel stated that he had no objection. Inasmuch as defendants did not object before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>U.S. v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734-5, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Appellants seek to establish that they were sentenced pursuant to some \u201cpractice\u201d in violation of <em>U.S. v. King. </em>Although remarks of the district court during the sentencing procedure lend some credence to this argument when taken out of context, it is clear to us that the sentences that were imposed were not imposed pursuant to the kind of practice that we criticized in <em>King. </em>There, the district court had a practice of determining a certain fixed number of levels to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5kl.l. We noted that such a standardized practice deprived defendants of the individualized examination that each was entitled to at sentencing. Here, the fact that each of the defendants received the same sentence results not from a \u201ccommon practice\u201d, but from the fact that each of the defendants was convicted of identical crimes under identical circumstances, each of the sentences imposed was within the Sentencing Guidelines range for the offense of conviction, and the district court\u2019s individualized scrutiny of each defendant\u2019s background and circumstances did not justify imposing a sentence of other than three months on any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">While, I listen very carefully. I read the presentence reports. And Mr. Beevers is aware, at least, that is my practice, for persons such as defendants here have the ability fortuitously to be able to, even though the charge with immigration offenses, to be able to be released and not spend the time in jail, that I find it difficult to treat them differently from persons that has spent their last dollar getting their document or paying the smuggler, and therefore have no contact, in the Virgin Islands or in the Continental United States, to be able to be released on bail pending their appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">App. at 64. The court\u2019s explanation of the rationale for imposing similar sentences differentiates these sentences from those we condemned in <em>King. </em>Moreover, the court\u2019s explanation also disposes with the defense argument that appellants were penalized for exercising their right to bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The district court must weigh several factors in order to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who are convicted of similar conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Here, inasmuch as each was convicted of identical immigration violations accomplished the same way, there was no basis of distinguishing among the defendants individual criminal conduct. In imposing sentence, the court merely explained that it did not believe it was fair to sentence defendants who had the resources to obtain bail in a manner which gave them an unfair and unwarranted advantage over defendants with inadequate resources to make bail. Rather than penalizing defendants for their right to bail as defendants contend, the court\u2019s explanation merely reflects an appropriate concern over imposing sentences which treat all of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fairly without penalizing those defendants who lack the resources to be released on bail pending sentencing. We find no error in these sentences, let alone any plain error. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
