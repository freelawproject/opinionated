The district court entered judgment for the Commissioner, but we reverse and remand with instructions to take into account Papenburg\u2019s headaches in evaluating whether her impairments equal the listings and in assessing her residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.1999). We review the Commissioner's decision for legal error and to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, weighing evidence which detracts from the finding, as well as that which supports it. <em>Id. </em>at 1097-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">At step three of the familiar five-step sequence for evaluating disability claims, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920 (2001), the ALJ must determine whether the claimant\u2019s impairments, in combination, meet or equal in severity the impairments fisted at 20 C.F.R., Pt. 404, Supbt. P, App. 1; <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 828-29 (9th Cir.l995)(as amended). The ALJ\u2019s discussion at step three includes <em>no </em>consideration of Papenburg\u2019s headaches, though the medical record is replete with references to such headaches and to the underlying chronic sinusitis. Papenburg testified about the headaches at the hearing before the first ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The Commissioner contended at oral argument that the ALJ failed to take the headaches into account in assessing the severity of Papenburg\u2019s impairments because he found Papenburg\u2019s complaints less than credible. The ALJ did not specifically address Papenburg\u2019s complaints about headaches, but discounted generally her \u201callegations of excess pain.\u201d His discussion appears to have focused on her complaints of back pain. Where, as here, there is no evidence of malingering, in order to reject the complainant\u2019s testimony about pain the Commissioner must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant\u2019s complaints. <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834. Because the ALJ failed to discuss the significant evidence of headaches, the Commissioner\u2019s decision does not meet this standard. Consequently, the case should be remanded to the Commissioner for reevaluation of the severity of Papenburg\u2019s impairments in fight of the evidence of severe headaches. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The ALJ also failed to take the headaches into account at steps four and five, in assessing Papenburg\u2019s residual functional capacity and in eliciting evidence from the vocational expert of Papenburg\u2019s ability to perform jobs. In order for the vocational expert\u2019s opinion to constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supporting a finding of the claimant\u2019s ability to perform work, a hypothetical question posed to the expert must include all the claimant\u2019s limitations and restrictions, unless the ALJ has validly rejected a restriction. <em>Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422-23 (9th Cir. 1988). Because the hypothetical question posed to the expert <em>in </em>this case did not mention Papenburg\u2019s headaches, it did not meet the standard and cannot be substantial evidence to support the conclusion that she could work.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">We have considered Papenburg\u2019s remaining claims of error and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Accordingly, we remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for evaluation of Papenburg\u2019s claims in fight of her complaints of severe headache pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b46-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
