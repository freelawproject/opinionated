He contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-19\">Suggs argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal (\u201cNOA\u201d) on his behalf despite his request to do so. In order to succeed on this claim, Suggs must show that his counsel's actions were objectively unreasonable. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). He must also show prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-20\">Suggs cannot show the required prejudice because counsel\u2019s decision not to file the NOA did not \u201cactually cause the forfeiture of the [his] appeal.\u201d <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Suggs, in fact, filed a notice of appeal on November 9, 1999. Although his notice appears to have been erroneously disregarded by the Superior Court as a duplicate, court personnel, not counsel, caused this error. Given that an intervening error, not attributable to counsel, interfered with Suggs\u2019 timely filed appeal, he cannot show that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s deficient performance,\u201d he would have appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-21\">More importantly, Suggs was not \u201cdeprive[d] ... of an appeal he otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>would have taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Suggs was given an opportunity to correct the error, but his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and/or Application for Relief from Default Re: Notice of Appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated that \u201cI would like to proceed with the w[r]it and forget about the appeal.\u201d He thus waived his appeal and cannot now contend that he was prejudiced by counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-22\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here except as necessary to aid in understanding this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-18\">. Suggs acted under a state law which provides that defense counsel's failure to file a NOA \"shall not foreclose any defendant from filing a notice of appeal on his or her own behalf or from raising any point or argument on appeal.\u201d Cal. Pen.Code \u00a7 1240.1(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-19\">. Suggs also requests in his brief that the panel expand his certificate of appealability to include a claim that his counsel was ineffecfive for failing to call additional witnesses. Suggs should have raised this issue in a separate motion after the completion of briefing. <em>See </em>Ninth Cir. R. 22-1 (d), and accompanying Advisory Committee Notes. In any event, Suggs has not made a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d on this issue. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
