R.App. P. 34(f). The case therefore is ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">A federal grand jury charged Mariano Velasco with two counts: (1) possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and (2) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1); (b)(1)(B), and 846. Mr. Velasco entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. The district court sentenced Mr. Velasco to concurrent terms of sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by four years\u2019 supervised release. Mr. Velasco appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-19\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">At 10:50 a.m. on September 24, 2001, Mr. Velasco, accompanied by Hector Rios-Gutierrez, entered the United States Border Patrol checkpoint on Highway 54 south of Alamogordo. The check point is approximately 65 miles from the United States \u2014 Mexico border. Mr. Velasco was driving a Ford Excursion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-21\">Mr. Velasco told Border Patrol Agent Dominic Bowcutt that he was a citizen of the United States. Agent Bowcutt inquired as to Mr. Rios\u2019s citizenship, and Mr. Rios handed Agent Bowcutt an 1-94 permit. Agent Bowcutt then asked for a passport or border crossing card from Mr. Rios, who explained, in Spanish, that he had been robbed and had lost everything.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">Agent Bowcutt reviewed the 1-94 permit and believed it to be fraudulent. He then inquired about the travelers\u2019 itinerary, and Mr. Rios replied that they were going to visit an ailing aunt in Alamogordo. After Agent Bowcutt asked about Mr. Rios\u2019s aunt\u2019s address, Mr. Rios responded that he did not know the address, adding that they were meeting her at a gas station. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Velasco explained that he was just giving Mr. Rios a ride to meet his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Agent Bowcutt was suspicious about the story and requested that the two wait in the \u201csecondary\u201d inspection area while he made some inquiries. Another agent checked the validity of Mr. Rios\u2019s 1-94 card, and learned that Mr. Rios had actually been issued an 1-586 border crossing card, and that Mr. Rios was beyond the 25 miles boundary authorized by that card.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Agent Bowcutt returned the 1-94 card to Mr. Rios and asked about the ownership of the vehicle. Mr. Velasco handed him a receipt for the purchase of the car. Agent Bowcutt testified that he noticed Mr. Velasco\u2019s hand trembling and explained that he thought it somewhat suspicious to have a receipt rather than an insurance card and registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">During this time, another agent checked the undercarriage of the car, and he noted that the gas tank appeared to have been altered. Agent Bowcutt asked Mr. Velasco if the agents could perform a canine inspection, and Mr. Velasco agreed, exiting the vehicle as requested by the agent. The canine sniff resulted in a positive alert to the undercarriage near the gas tank. The agents removed the gas tank and discovered marijuana inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">After the grand jury returned the indictment, Mr. Velasco moved to suppress the marijuana discovered by the border patrol agents. The district court concluded that there was ample evidence to support Mr. Velasco\u2019s detention and denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">On appeal, Mr. Velasco argues that the border patrol agents lacked reasonable suspicion to justify referring him to the secondary inspection area and detaining him there. He maintains that Agent Bowcutt\u2019s concerns about Mr. Rios\u2019s identity and citizenship established only reasonable suspicion of Mr. Rios.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">\u201cIn reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact must be accepted by this court unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Preciado, </em>966 F.2d 596, 597 (10th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and [to] the district court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>114 F.3d 1059, 1063 (10th Cir.1997). However, the district court\u2019s determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause are reviewed de novo on appeal. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">1. Initial Detention</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">\u201cDuring a routine fixed-checkpoint stop, border patrol agents may question individuals in the absence of individualized suspicion about their citizenship and immigration status and request documentation.\u201d <em>United States v. Massie, </em>65 F.3d 843, 847-48 (10th Cir.1995). Furthermore, \u201c[a]gents may briefly question individuals concerning such things as vehicle ownership, cargo, destination, and travel plans, as long as such questions are reasonably related to the agent\u2019s duty to prevent the unauthorized entry of individuals into this country and to prevent the smuggling of contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 848 (citation and quotations omitted). Thus, the first stage of the encounter must remain brief, unintrusive, and must \u201cnot exceed the scope of a permissible routine checkpoint stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">Applying these standards, we conclude that the \u201cbrief stop\u201d at the highway roadblock was a \u201creasonable intrusion into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>the lives of [Mr. Velasco and Mr. Rios].\u201d <em>United, States v. Galindo-Gonzales, </em>142 F.3d 1217, 1221 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Morales-Zamora, </em>914 F.2d 200, 202-03 (10th Cir.1990) (citing cases). Agent Bowcutt\u2019s initial questioning concerned citizenship, immigrations status, and travel plans. His follow-up question about Mr. Rios\u2019s aunt\u2019s address was a reasonable attempt to obtain information relevant to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">2. The referral to the secondary inspection area</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Mr. Velasco challenges his detention at the secondary inspection area, arguing that Agent Bowcutt\u2019s initial questions generated suspicion of only Mr. Rios. As to this issue, the district court determined that, under the totality of the circumstances, the border agent\u2019s observation of \u201csuspicious circumstances ... justified the continued detention of both of the defendants.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">There is no question that \u201cborder patrol agents may question individuals regarding suspicious circumstances, in addition to citizenship matters, when those individuals are stopped at permanent checkpoints.\u201d <em>Preciado, </em>966 F.2d at 598. \u201cA suspicious circumstance is not equivalent to the reasonable suspicion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Rascon-Ortiz, </em>994 F.2d 749, 753 n. 6 (10th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">[t]he presence of a suspicious circumstance allows a border patrol agent to ask a few additional questions concerning the suspicion during the course of a routine customs inspection. Since the additional questions do not add significantly to the length or intrusiveness of the detention, the more rigid Fourth Amendment requirements of probable cause or reasonable suspicion are not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Border patrol agents are entitled to assess the facts in the light of their experience, and, as a result, we have recognized that they \u201cmay perceive meaning in actions that appear innocuous to the untrained observer.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>87 F.3d 1118, 1121 (10th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 52 &amp; n. 2, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979)). Here, the district court properly concluded that Agent Bowcutt may have found Mr. Rios\u2019s answers to his questions unsatisfactory, warranting further inquiry regarding Mr. Rios\u2019s immigration status.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">3. The continued detention and search</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">Next, Mr. Velasco challenges his continued detention at the secondary inspection area. \u201cFurther detention of an individual beyond the scope of a routine checkpoint stop must be based upon reasonable suspicion, consent, or probable cause.\u201d <em>Massie, </em>65 F.3d at 848; <em>see also Preciado, </em>966 F.2d at 598 (stating that \u201ceven [w]hen the questions asked at the primary inspection area satisfy all concerns about a person\u2019s citizenship or immigration status, an agent may still direct a vehicle to a secondary inspection area and further question the occupants on the basis of reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">The Supreme Court has explained that this reasonable suspicion standard reflects a balancing of \u201cthe importance of the governmental interest at stake, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border.\u201d <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). Reasonable suspicion may be based on \u201ca series of acts, each of them perhaps innocent in itself, but which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>taken together warranted further investigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Martinez, </em>25 F.3d 1481, 1484 (10th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). Although \u201cthe necessary level of suspicion is considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence, the Fourth Amendment requires some minimal level of objective justification.\u201d <em>Cantu, </em>87 F.3d at 1121 (10th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ultimate assessment of reasonable suspicion must be made in light of the experience of the border agent and based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Gandara-Salinas, </em>327 F.3d 1127, 1130 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Here, the record establishes that the border patrol agents possessed reasonable suspicion that Mr. Velasco had committed an immigration violation and were therefore authorized to detain him at the secondary inspection area and further question him there. In particular, Mr. Velasco\u2019s passenger (Mr. Rios) had unquestionably violated the bounds of his border crossing permit and thus could have been taken into custody. This, combined with (1) the possibly fraudulent 1-94 permit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) the story about meeting the ailing aunt at a gas station, (3) Mr. Rios\u2019s contention that he had lost all identification because of a recent robbery; (3) Mr. Velasco\u2019s nervousness in handing over the receipt for the purchase of the vehicle, and (5) the presentation of a receipt for the sale of the vehicle (rather than the vehicle\u2019s insurance and registration) justified Agent Bowcutt\u2019s decision to continue the detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We are not persuaded by Mr. Velasco\u2019s contention that the border agent\u2019s observations supported only the detention of Mr. Rios. Unquestionably, the suspicious behavior of a passenger is a factor that an agent may consider in deciding whether to detain the driver. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kopp, </em>45 F.3d 1450, 1453-54 (10th Cir.1995) (considering the behavior of a passenger in the reasonable suspicion calculus). Moreover, we have noted above, some of Agent Bowcutt\u2019s observations concerned Mr. Velasco himself (e.g., Mr. Velasco\u2019s nervousness and Mr. Velasco\u2019s handing Agent Bowcutt a receipt rather than proof of insurance and registration).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">4. The canine inspection and subsequent search</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Finally, Mr. Velasco also challenges the canine inspection and subsequent search of his vehicle. He argues that \u201c[w]hatever \u2018consent\u2019 [he] may have given to these actions, it was incurably tainted by the illegal detention.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 8. In light of our conclusion that Mr. Velasco\u2019s detention was lawful, this argument fails. We further note that, aside from his unpersuasive challenges to his detention, Mr. Velasco identifies no evidence in the record undermining the validity of the consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Velasco\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-13\">. The district court noted that during the course of questioning, Mr. Rios admitted that the 1-94 permit was fake.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
