For the reasons discussed herein, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">DeRossi applied to the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) for survivor benefits under the Civil Service Retirement Act after the death of her husband. OPM denied her application for benefits because DeRossi\u2019s husband elected a retirement annuity payable only during his lifetime, rather than a reduced annuity payable during his lifetime coupled with a surviving spouse annuity. DeRossi requested that OPM reconsider its decision, which it did, again denying her claim for benefits based on documentation showing that she consented to her husband\u2019s election not to provide her with a survivor annuity. DeRossi then appealed OPM\u2019s decision to the Board. The assigned Administrative Judge affirmed OPM\u2019s decision on the administrative record, DeRossi having waived her right to a hearing. DeRossi then petitioned the full Board for review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision. <em>DeRossi v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. BN0831020177-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Dec.4, 2002) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). The Board denied DeRossi\u2019s petition, making the Initial Decision the Final Decision of the Board. DeRossi now petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">This court is vested with jurisdiction to review the final decision of the Board by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). When considering DeRossi\u2019s petition for review, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At0a\">shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be \u2014 (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-17\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-18\">The pertinent facts are stated in the Initial Decision and will not be repeated here. As stated in the Initial Decision, the Administrative Judge determined that DeRossi failed to present sufficient evidence that she did not sign form 2801-2, Spousal Consent to Survivor Election. The signature \u201cLee DeRossi\u201d appears on this document, which was signed by a notary public. Moreover, DeRossi does not dispute signing an Alternative Annuity Election form in front of a notary public, thereby consenting to her husband\u2019s election of a lump sum payment followed by monthly retirement payments until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-19\">We find no error with the Administrative Judge\u2019s consideration of DeRossi\u2019s appeal. Following the factors set forth in <em>Borninkhof v. Department of Justice, </em>5 MSPB 150, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 87 (1981), the Administrative Judge considered the probative value of DeRossi\u2019s unsworn statement that she did not sign form 2801-2. The Administrative Judge also determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>that the notaries\u2019 signatures, representing that DeRossi signed form 2801-2 and the Alternative Annuity Election form, were more credible than DeRossi\u2019s present claim that she never signed form 2801-2. <em>See Hillen v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987) (listing factors applied by the Administrative Judge). The Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility determination is virtually unreviewable by this court, <em>Rogers v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>87 F.3d 471, 472 (Fed.Cir.1996), and, in any event, we agree with that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Thus, having reviewed the record and each party\u2019s submissions to this court, we see no basis for concluding that the Board\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. The final decision of the Board is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
