In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Ross claims that the district court erred by failing to depart further than sixty-three months below the applicable sentencing range on the drug count. Ross was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but failed to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to depart from the sentencing guidelines for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pearce, </em>191 F.3d 488, 492 (4th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 96-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). However, \u201cwe do not have the authority to review the extent to which a district court departs downward unless \u2018the departure decision resulted in a sentence imposed in violation of law or resulted from an incorrect application of the Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>313 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995)). On appeal, Ross acknowledges that the exceptions in <em>Shaw </em>do not apply. We therefore do not have jurisdiction to review the extent of the district court\u2019s departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">We have reviewed the record as required by <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Ross\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
