Zilly, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The Estate of Rudy Torres (\u201cEstate\u201d) appeals the summary judgment dismissal of its claim against Monumental Life Insurance Company alleging breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by denying accidental death insurance benefits following Torres\u2019 death. Monumental Life claims Torres\u2019 death was caused by his taking a drug other than as prescribed by a physician, and benefits were therefore excluded by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the Estate\u2019s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The record shows that Monumental Life made a reasonable investigation into the claim for benefits, reviewing Torres\u2019 records, interviewing several doctors, and exploring the contention that Torres\u2019 liver was not able to metabolize his medication. Further, a genuine dispute exists as to the circumstances of Torres\u2019 death, in particular, whether the medication he ingested was taken \u201cas prescribed by a physician\u201d and his liver failed to metabolize it, or whether Torres ingested an overdose. California law provides that denial of coverage is not unreasonable and does not constitute bad faith if there is a genuine issue as to the insurer\u2019s liability. <em>Chateau Chamberay Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Associated Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>90 Cal.App.4th 335, 346-47, 108 Cal.Rptr.2d 776 (2001). As the district court noted, \u201cthere are unanswered factual questions regarding the exact nature of Torres\u2019 death.\u201d In such a situation, it was not error to determine that Monumental Life did not act in bad faith as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>at 347,108 Cal.Rptr.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">Although the Estate offered orally to amend the complaint to add a cause of action for breach of contract, no motion to amend was ever presented. Failing to grant a motion never presented cannot be the stuff of which an abuse of discretion can be made. The district court alerted counsel for the Estate that a formal motion would be necessary. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the policy favoring liberal allowance of amendments has been violated. <em>Cf. Price v. Kramer, </em>200 F.3d 1237, 1250 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b849-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
