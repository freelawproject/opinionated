Quist, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b728-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">Malcolm Earl Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A jury found Thomas guilty on a single count of distributing an unspecified amount of crack cocaine pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Using a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard to determine the drug quantity for which Thomas was accountable, the district court enhanced Thomas\u2019 sentence, under the terms of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and 851, to 264 months (22 years). We affirmed (Thomas did not raise sentencing issues), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari on May 14, 1996. Within one year of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which mandated that drug quantity be proven to a jury \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d for sentencing enhancements, Thomas filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the motion, and Thomas moved for issuance of a certificate of appealability. The district court certified two issues for appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-17\">(1) Does 15[sic] U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 116(3) renew the one-year period of limitations for bringing a \u00a7 2255 motion when the right asserted is made retroactively applicable by a lower court but not by the Supreme Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-18\">(2) Does the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), apply retroactively to cases pending on collateral review?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-19\">Subsequent to Thomas\u2019 Notice of Appeal, this Court held in <em>Goode v. United States, </em>305 F.3d 378 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1096, 123 S.Ct. 711, 154 L.Ed.2d 647 (2002), that \u201c[t]he rule of <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to initial [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 motions,.... \u201d <em>See also Evans v. United States, </em>56 Fed. Appx. 252 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Maliszewski v. United States, </em>53 Fed. Appx. 337 (6th Cir. 2002); <em>Montano v. United States, </em>53 Fed. Appx. 347 (6th Cir.2002). The holding in <em>Goode </em>is dispositive of both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
