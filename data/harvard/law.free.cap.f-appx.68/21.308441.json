On July 17, 2002, the district court adopted in full the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendation to grant the government\u2019s motion for entry of a restraining order with respect to Lot 10. Because the government\u2019s motion to restrain property provided sufficient details of the restraint sought and the recommendation to grant the motion was adopted in its entirety by the district court, we have appellate jurisdiction of the district court\u2019s order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-21\">For the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendation, which were adopted by the district court, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b51-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
