In 1992, Allstate hired Gujral as an employee at will. In Gujral\u2019s employment contract, Allstate reserved the right to unilaterally modify the terms and conditions of Gujral\u2019s employment, the terms of his compensation, and the company manual that would dictate compensation amounts and rules. In 1998, Allstate announced its intent to modify its bonus compensation structure. Before the new bonus structure was fully implemented, Gujral resigned and filed a complaint against Allstate alleging breach of contract and constructive discharge. The district court granted summary judgment for Allstate, and Gujral timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">On appeal. Gujral argues that the district court erred by (1) granting summary judgment to Allstate on Gujral\u2019s breach of contract claim because Allstate breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by modifying the structure of Gujral\u2019s compensation: (2) granting summary judgment to Allstate on Gujral\u2019s constructive discharge claim because Allstate\u2019s breach of the employment contract and corresponding reduction of Gujral\u2019s salary forced Gujral to resign: and (3) refusing to consider extrinsic evidence for the purpose of interpreting Gujral\u2019s employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-20\">After careful review of the record, all applicable law, the briefs of the parties, and oral argument by counsel, we conclude that the district court\u2019s Opinion and Order should be affirmed. As the judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>supported by the evidence and the Opinion and Order properly states the relevant principles of law and properly applies them to the facts of this case, no useful purpose would be served by issuing a full opinion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned Opinion and Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
