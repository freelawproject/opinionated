Alexander pled guilty to a charge of knowingly making false statements and representations in connection with her application for and receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. On October 11, 2002, she was sentenced to five years probation and required to pay restitution in the amount of $27,722.00 and a special assessment of $100. On October 21, 2002, a timely Notice of Appeal was filed on defendant\u2019s behalf. Counsel subsequently filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw from the case because, as she recites, there are no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and appellate jurisdiction is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-19\">For her part, defendant has filed a <em>pro se </em>Informal Brief, in which she alleges, among other things, that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, and maintains that the \u201cDistrict Court based its decision on [her] attorney\u2019s entering a guilty plea against [her] wishes,\u201d and that defense counsel \u201cignored all of [her] relevant medical history ... which is critical for understanding the events in this case.\u201d (Informal Brief at 1, 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>If, \u201cafter a full examination of all the proceedings,\u201d defense counsel \u201cdecide[s that] the case is wholly frivolous,\u201d counsel may explain this conclusion to the court upon requesting leave to withdraw. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744. \u201cIf [the court] so finds[,] it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal insofar as federal requirements are concerned, or proceed to a decision on the merits, if state law so requires. On the other hand, if it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous) it must, prior to decision, afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An appeal may be deemed frivolous if it \u201clacks any basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, </em>486 U.S. 429, 439 n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 100 L.Ed.2d 440 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Whether or not a plea hearing was properly conducted pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and whether or not a district court complied with the mandates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 32 in conducting a sentencing hearing are questions of law, and our review is plenary. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ebel, </em>299 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Bertoli, </em>40 F.3d 1384, 1397 (3d Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Bentz, </em>21 F.3d 37, 38 (3d Cir.1994). Having thoroughly reviewed the record in this case, we conclude that there exist no nonfrivolous issues and that the requirements set forth in Rules 11 and 32 were satisfied during the entry of defendant\u2019s plea and her sentencing, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Specifically, the record reflects that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, and that at all times she understood what was taking place. Defendant was sworn and advised of her rights, the possible ramifications of her plea, and the range of options available to her. She evinced no evasion or lack of comprehension when she admitted to willfully submitting a fraudulent form to the Office of Worker Compensation Programs, furnishing the factual basis for her plea. The District Court ascertained that the plea was not the product of any improper coercion. The Court ascertained as well that defendant had reviewed the Rule 11 form, that she understood it, and that she had filed it out accurately.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">At the sentencing hearing, there were similarly no infirmities that would afford a basis for a nonfrivolous appeal. Defendant and her counsel had the opportunity to go over and discuss the Presentence Report, and did so. They also had the opportunity to comment on and object to the Presentence Report, and declined to do so. The Court concluded that the applicable guideline range was zero to six months, and that a fine and the interest requirement on the amount of restitution would be waived. Defendant\u2019s sentence fell far below the statutory maximum term of imprisonment of five years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920, and well within the parameters of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3561(c)(1) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5B1.2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Defendant attempts to set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by stating, among other things, that she did \u201cnot do any self employment work,\u201d and that her counsel \u201chad medical information pertinent to this case that she did not present [which] would give clear evidence to show her innocence.\u201d (Informal Brief at 4-5). This Court will not generally consider a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cianci, </em>154 F.3d 106, 113 (3d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Gaydos, </em>108 F.3d 505, 512, n. 5 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Cocivera, </em>104 F.3d 566, 570 (3d Cir.1996) (noting that collateral, rather than direct, attack provides the opportunity to develop a factual basis for the claim; gives the attorney a chance to explain the challenged conduct; and averts a situation where the attorney represents the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dant on appeal and is placed in the unenviable position of arguing his or her own ineffectiveness). A narrow exception to this general rule exists however, where \u201calbeit rare[ly,] we may have a sufficient record on appeal to decide the issue and avoid the considerable effort of requiring the defendant to institute a collateral proceeding in order to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>Cocivera, </em>104 F.3d at 570-571. In light of the dearth of evidence pertinent to the ineffective assistance claim, however, this case clearly does not come within this narrow exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Having found that no nonfrivolous issues have been identified or presented for appeal, we will grant defense counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and will AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
