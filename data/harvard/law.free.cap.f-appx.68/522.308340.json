Teague asserts the submission to the jury of the factual predicate questions underlying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) enhancement for brandishing or discharging a firearm violated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 559-66, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). We review this claim de novo. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 406 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Teague\u2019s claim is meritless. While <em>Harris </em>holds that a district court judge is authorized to make factual findings that trigger the imposition of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s mandatory m\u00ednimums under a preponderance standard, it does not follow that a defendant\u2019s rights are violated where, as here, a jury determines the facts underlying the enhancement have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, as the court\u2019s sentencing power merely flows from the authorization granted by the jury. <em>Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 559-66, 122 S.Ct. 2406. Moreover, even if Teague could demonstrate error, the error would be harmless. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>Mackins, </em>315 F.3d at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Teague\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
