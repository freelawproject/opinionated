Green appeals the district court\u2019s order denying him leave to proceed on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint without the prepayment of fees. Because Green\u2019s appeal was untimely filed, we deny his motion to proceed under the PLRA. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on March 5, 2003. Green filed his notice of appeal, at the earliest, on April 15. Thus, because Green did not file a timely appeal or obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny his motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees and dismiss his appeal as untimely. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
