The Honorable Frederick J. Scullin, United States District Judge for the Northern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal, entered June 26, 2002, is hereby AFFIRMED, and all motions filed in connection with this appeal are hereby DENIED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Plaintiff-Appellant Diane Robinson, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s order entered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) dismissing her complaint without prejudice against Defendants-Appellees Front-Line Security, Inc., Daniel Mgr., Jama Cassaba, and Sgt. Nunez (\u201cFront-Line Security\u201d) for employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (\u201cADEA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint de novo. <em>See, e.g., Neal v. Goord, </em>267 F.3d 116, 119 (2d Cir.2001). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) states that \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action or appeal ... fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d Dismissal is appropriate, however, only if \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim which would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d <em>Harris v. City of New York, </em>186 F.3d 243, 250 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). This rule applies with particular force where a plaintiff alleges civil rights violations or where the complaint is submitted pro se. <em>See, e.g., Hernandez v. Coughlin, </em>18 F.3d 133, 136 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-20\">In her complaint, filed in June 2002 on a standard employment discrimination form, Ms. Robinson asserted that she is a forty-six year old African-American female who was hired by Front-Line Security in November 2001, and who, between December 2001 and January 2002, was the victim of \u201csome chain conspiracy\u201d and racial discrimination evidenced by a failure to promote, as well as unspecified unequal terms and conditions of employment, retaliation, and two suspensions in January 2002. <em>(See </em>Compl. at Till 4, 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-21\">Even if this pleading is liberally read to state a claim of discrimination, <em>see Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. </em>A, 534 U.S. 506, 513, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), the district court correctly recognized that Ms. Robinson\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l) and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(2) mandates dismissal of her complaint. <em>See Flaherty v. Metromail Corp., </em>235 F.3d 133, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>136 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cTo sustain a claim for unlawful discrimination under Title VII and/or the ADEA, a plaintiff must file administrative charges with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory acts.\u201d)- Because this defect could be cured, the district court ordered dismissal without prejudice to Ms. Robinson refiling her complaint upon exhaustion of procedural remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\">. Appellant\u2019s following motions are denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-17\">(1) motion seeking specific relief filed August 26, 2002; (2) motion seeking specific relief, money filed September 17, 2002; (3) motion seeking final decision filed April 18, 2003; (4) motion seeking court to take action \u201cin regard to a pending\u201d filed October 28, 2002; and (5) motion seeking to alter or amend the judgment filed September 19, 2002.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
