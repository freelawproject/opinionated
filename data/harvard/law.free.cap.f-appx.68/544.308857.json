The revocation relied, in part, on a series of violations to which Latson admitted at an earlier meeting with his probation officer. At that meeting Latson waived his right to counsel and a hearing and agreed to a modification of his probation. Latson appeals the revocation because he claims he did not receive fair notice that his admitted violations could be used, in part, at a subsequent revocation hearing, and that to rely on the admission is a violation of his constitutional rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment. Latson also appeals the use of the admission because the district court relied on some of the same violations to revoke his probation that were used by the probation officer to modify his probation. Finally, Latson claims that the admission of those violations was improper because he waived his right to counsel and a hearing without a judicial inquiry as to whether the waiver was \u201cknowing, intelligent and voluntary.\u201d For the reasons detailed below, the court affirms the district court\u2019s revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">Appellant Latson pleaded guilty on August 24, 1999 to one count of using the United States Mails \u201cto knowingly cause to be delivered\u201d claim checks to defraud an insurance company. As a result of that plea agreement, Latson received three years probation and was ordered to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>restitution of $11,350. Under the terms of the agreement Latson agreed to make payments of \u201cno less than 10% of [his] gross income within a 6 month period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AifX\">On June 27, 2002, Latson met with his probation officer. At that meeting Latson and the probation officer discussed his failure to complete an aftercare program for drug abuse and failure to pay restitution. At the conclusion of that meeting, Latson agreed to an extension of his probation for an additional two years or until restitution was paid. Latson signed a form entitled \u201cWaiver of Hearing to Modify Conditions of Probation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is this waiver which Latson is challenging on appeal. Latson claims that at that meeting he informed his probation officer that he had secured a new job, which would change his work schedule. At his previous job his hours were from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. His aftercare program was scheduled from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. At his new job the hours would be from 2:00 to 7:00 p.m., meaning he would have to change the time of his aftercare meeting. The new job also required a training period, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six weeks, but he did not know about this until after the June 27 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">On July 2, 2002, Latson\u2019s probation officer filed a violation report with the district court, which reflected the result of the June 27 meeting. The report noted that Latson had paid only $890.00 of the restitution. The report also stated that on September 17, 2001, Latson was involved in an auto accident, and the resulting injuries made him unable to work. However, the report noted that he had returned to work as of June 2002. The report stated that Latson had completed a drug aftercare program in October 2000, but had since tested positive for marijuana use. He attended additional counseling, but continued to test positive from January 31, 2001 through January 28, 2002. To address the continued drug use, Lat-son enrolled in an \u201cIntensive Outpatient Treatment\u201d program. That program was completed in April of 2002, and Latson has not tested positive since. However, Latson did fail to attend aftercare treatment which is part of the program, and the probation officer verbally reprimanded him. The probation officer advised him \u201cthat he is to start attending his weekly aftercare classes immediately or Court action would be requested.\u201d The district court modified Latson\u2019s probation consistent with the June 27 agreement on July 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">On July 3, 2002, Latson attended the aftercare meeting. Latson did not attend the next three of the four remaining sessions scheduled for July 10, 17, and 24. This is the same period of time Latson claims he was in the training program for his new job, which started on July 8, 2002. Latson claims he told his probation officer about the new schedule, which interfered with the aftercare program.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>On August 13, 2002, the probation officer filed another violation report with the district court. The two violations cited were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">1. Failure to Comply with Aftercare\u2014 Since completing Intensive Outpatient Treatment, Mr. Latson has failed to attend aftercare with the Oriana House as instructed by his probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">2. Failure to Complete Monthly Supervision Reports \u2014 The offender failed to submit monthly supervision forms for June 2002 and July 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The August report recounts the failure to comply with the drug treatment program which provided the basis for his modification of probation on July 2, 2002. It also reported that he missed the July aftercare meetings. The report explicitly states, with regard to Latson\u2019s new employment, that Latson had advised his probation officer in June that he was working for his previous employer, but \u201csince that time he has failed to notify the probation officer of any change in employment or if he is even still employed.\u201d The report recommends that the district court \u201cissue a summons.\u201d The court issued the summons on August 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">On August 27, 2002, Latson appeared before the district court, represented at this time by counsel, Dennis Terez. Lat-son again waived a hearing and admitted to the violations as described in the violations report. Before deciding to revoke probation the judge allowed counsel and defendant to speak. Counsel for Latson pointed out that the previous modification of his probation was done without counsel or a hearing, and that \u201cprobation should not have been extended.\u201d The court noted that the grounds for revoking probation were incidents that occurred within the original three year term, and therefore the revocation was not dependent on the validity of the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The court allowed Latson a chance to explain his non-compliance. Latson recounted his job history, and his recent successful efforts to avoid drug use. He also explained that he had not made more payments toward restitution because his first concern had been paying off his-monthly bills including utilities, but that he was now ready to address the outstanding balance on the restitution. The judge then announced his decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">So I\u2019m not real persuaded and I\u2019m going to find that you violated the terms of your probation. I\u2019m going to find it\u2019s a Grade C violation and I\u2019m going to sentence you to a period of incarceration of four months. And apart from the recommendation of the government, I\u2019m going to order that after you are released from that incarceration, you serve an additional year of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAa\">After this ruling, Latson again asked the court for understanding. It is at this point during the hearing the judge indicated that he relied, at least in part, on Latson\u2019s cumulative record of violations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">MR. TEREZ: I think my client\u2019s point, Your Honor, is the noncompliance is a meeting that he deemed by himself \u2014 I agree he shouldn\u2019t have that authority \u2014 was unnecessary. I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to express to Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">THE COURT: And I understand that, and I salute him for it looks like he stayed off drugs, but it\u2019s still not a thing where it\u2019s a voluntary program\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">MR. TEREZ: He understands that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">THE COURT: \u2014where we attend when we want to attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-15\">And if it was even a couple of violations, the argument would have more merit, but we are in a situation where we\u2019ve had time after time after time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>after time after time to the point where this is the ninth time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">MR. TEREZ: I agree, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">I think the point my client is trying to make, though, is he also not only has to attend those kind of meetings, but attend the various family obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">THE COURT: Well, he should have brought it to the Court, I mean, for a request to modify it, but let me just\u2014 you may have a right to take an appeal from this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Latson was then remanded into custody of the United States Marshall, Akron, Ohio. The district court denied Latson\u2019s motion for bond pending appeal. The Sixth Circuit denied Latson\u2019s motion for release pending appeal on September 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">This Court exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which provides for review of final decisions of the district courts. Specifically, the Court may review a \u201cfinal sentence\u201d to determine if it was \u201cimposed in violation of law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Latson challenges the constitutionality of his initial waiver of hearing and counsel on June 27, 2002, which modified his probation based on specific violations. Latson claims that he did not understand that his admission to those violations could, in part, be used a month later to revoke his probation. Latson\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated centers around three issues. The first two are specific to the facts of his case. First, Latson claims that the waiver was improper when its contents were used in the subsequent revocation hearing because he was not given \u201cfair notice\u201d that those violations could later be used as grounds for revoking probation. Second, he claims that because of the waiver and admission to previous violations, he was not given a \u201cclean slate\u201d to voice his challenge to his revocation. Lat-son\u2019s last contention is that waivers like the one in this case are deficient because the judge did not do a searching inquiry to verify that the waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent consistent with this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>814 F.2d 245 (6th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 980, 108 S.Ct. 478, 98 L.Ed.2d 492 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">The district court\u2019s decision to revoke probation is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Lowenstein, </em>108 F.3d 80, 85-86 (6th Cir. 1997). Whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent is a mixed question of law and fact and reviewed de novo. <em>Lott v. Coyle, </em>261 F.3d 594, 610 (6th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1147, 122 S.Ct. 1106, 151 L.Ed.2d 1001 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Latson faces several hurdles to establish error by the district court in this case. First, all of Latson\u2019s violations occurred within the time frame of his original three year probation. Therefore, Latson contests a modification which is irrelevant to his violations. Additionally, even if the court were to exclude from consideration any violations that occurred prior to the contested waiver, Latson committed additional violations after that waiver and modification which provide sufficient grounds for revocation. Even overlooking these factual problems in Latson\u2019s case, his claims of due process violations are without merit. From the record it appears Latson did receive fair notice that any new violations after his modification would result in \u201ccourt action.\u201d There also is no due process right, in these kinds of hearings, to a \u201cclean slate.\u201d Finally, the right to counsel and a hearing can be intelligently waived for purposes of probation modification without the searching questioning which Latson contends must be done in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>A. <em>Appellant was not deprived of fair notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">At Latsoris revocation hearing he stipulated that he \u201cviolated the terms of [his] probation by failing to comply with the after-care outpatient treatment program,\u201d and \u201cby failing to complete monthly supervision reports.\u201d It was these two specific violations that the judge relied on in revoking probation and imposing the four month incarceration. The violations were not incidents covered in the report from the June 27 meeting. Therefore, even if the judge ignored all violations stipulated to at the June 27 meeting where Latson had neither a hearing nor counsel, there is still sufficient grounds for revoking probation. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2) a single violation of a condition of probation is enough to revoke probation. <em>See also United States v. Lindo, </em>52 F.3d 106, 108 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The district court also confirmed that the violations occurred during the original term of probation. Therefore, not only did he have grounds to revoke based on new incidents after the June 27 meeting, those new incidents of probation violation did not rely on the extension of probation that resulted from that meeting and waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Latson claims that he was denied fair notice or warning of what conduct might result in a violation. Lack of fair notice can amount to a violation of due process. In <em>United States v. Twitty </em>this Court held that \u201c[d]ue process requires, among other things, notice or fair warning of what conduct might result in revocation.\u201d 44 F.3d 410, 412 (6th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). In <em>Twitty </em>the district court revoked probation for activity that occurred prior to the beginning of the probation period. Without the terms of probation in place, the Court found that the defendant could not violate a condition of probation before it exists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">It is clear from the record in Latsoris case, that he was given fair notice of the consequences of his actions. The violation report filed after the June 27 meeting indicates that the probation officer did warn Latson that he was at risk of additional penalties. The report states Latson \u201cwas advised that he is to start attending his weekly aftercare classes immediately or Court action would be requested.\u201d Lat-son did not dispute that he received this warning at his revocation hearing. This specific notice is in addition to the listed terms of his probation. After this warning, Latson missed three aftercare sessions and failed to file two reports. Lat-son was placed on notice that his previous violations had brought him close to a situation where any new violation would result in \u201ccourt action.\u201d Despite this warning, Latson continued to violate the terms of his probation. It does not violate due process to revoke probation consistent with the warning given to the probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">B. <em>Courts need not conduct a revocation hearing on a \u201cclean slate. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Latson also claims that he suffered an injury because he \u201cwas not given a clean slate upon which to voice his challenge.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Latsoris brief does not point to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>any caselaw to support this contention. It also does not appear to violate due process rights for a district court to look to past convictions, not just the most recent violation in sentencing proceedings, even if that record includes \u201cuncounseled\u201d convictions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Logan, </em>250 F.3d 350, 377 (6th Cir.2001). <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 895, 122 S.Ct. 216, 151 L.Ed.2d 154. In <em>Logan, </em>the Sixth Circuit affirmed a district court decision to assess \u201cone criminal history point\u201d for a prior conviction where that conviction was the result of a plea by the defendant without assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 377. The Court addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994), prohibited consideration of the \u201cuncounseled misdemeanor conviction\u201d because it resulted in a term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Logan, </em>250 F.3d at 377. The Court held that <em>Nichols </em>does not apply where a defendant \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel\u201d in connection with a misdemeanor, even if the conviction resulted in a term of imprisonment. <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>Nichols </em>was even more explicit about using prior convictions and the lack of necessity for warning at the time of conviction about repercussions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANy\">Petitioner contends that, at a minimum, due process requires a misdemeanor defendant to be warned that his conviction might be used <em>for </em>enhaneement purposes should the defendant later be convicted of another crime. No such requirement was suggested in <em>Scott, </em>and we believe with good reason. In the first place, a large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record. Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way to memorialize any such warning. Nor is it at all clear exactly how expansive the warning would have to be.... And a warning at the completely general level \u2014 that if he is brought back into court on another criminal charge, a defendant such as Nichols will be treated more harshly \u2014 \u25a0 would merely tell him what he must surely already know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">511 U.S. at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">From the record it appears that Latson did receive a \u201cfair notice\u201d about possible \u201ccourt action.\u201d and, therefore, his waiver of June 27 did not violate the intelligent, knowing and voluntary standard. There is no constitutional right to a \u201cclean slate\u201d in sentencing proceedings, and, therefore, Latson\u2019s due process rights were not violated in that regard. Finally, even if the admissions made at the June 27 meeting were excluded from consideration, Lat-son\u2019s subsequent violations provide sufficient grounds to revoke probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>C. <em>Rule 32.1 waivers need not be subject to a searching judicial inquiry before allowing defendants to proceed pro se or waive a hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Latson makes a broader argument that this Court\u2019s mandate in <em>United States v. </em>McDowell<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that judges make a searching inquiry before allowing pro se defendants to proceed should be extended to waivers of counsel in Rule 32.1 proceedings. Lat-son claims that without this protection, \u201clay persons, such as the probation officer involved in this case, will be the sole judges of the validity of such waivers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Latson does not support his argument with any applicable statutory or judicial citations, and a review of relevant caselaw and the federal rules offers no support for his position. It should also be noted that the waiver in this case was not without judicial oversight. Latson\u2019s waiver of June 27 was reviewed by the district court before it was accepted.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Latson also had a right to challenge the waiver and any other facts relating to his revocation at his August 2002 hearing. <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (holding that a probationer is entitled to a preliminary and final revocation hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which guides revocation or modification of probation or supervised release, explicitly provides that the right to counsel and a hearing can be waived. This rule was amended on December 1, 2002. The pre-amendment version was not explicit about the possibility of waiver in the circumstances of a modification under R. 32.1(b). It stated, \u201c[a] hearing and assistance of counsel are required before the terms or conditions of probation supervised release can be modified .... \u201d The amended version R. 32.1(c)(1) states that before modifying probation \u201cthe court must hold a hearing at which the person has a right to counsel.\u201d However, R. 32.1(c)(2) provides exceptions and states \u201c[a] hearing is not required if: (A) the person waives the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The Advisory Committee Notes to the 2002 amendments explains the change:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">Rule 32.1(c)(2)(A) permits the person to waive a hearing to modify the conditions of probation or supervised release. Although that language is new to the rule, the Committee believes that it reflects current practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Although this issue has not been addressed by the Sixth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Stocks </em>rejected an appeal nearly identical to Latson\u2019s, under the pre-amendment R.32.1(b). 104 F.3d 308 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied. </em>522 U.S. 904, 118 S.Ct. 259, 139 L.Ed.2d 186 (1997). <em>Stocks </em>examined the policy and due process concerns underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s caselaw:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">In sum, the Supreme Court developed in <em>Mempa [v. Rhay, </em>389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967) ]. <em>Morrissey [v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) ], and <em>Gag-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>non </em>a core of constitutionally-protected rights tailored to the probation and parole contexts. These rights arose out of a recognition of two related interests: a probationer\u2019s interest in receiving assistance of counsel when probation-related proceedings are intertwined with (re)sentencing (Mempa), and, more generally, a probationer\u2019s and parolee\u2019s due process interest in remaining free from the restrictions on liberty that are characteristically imposed as part of a probationary or parole term <em>(Morrissey </em>and Gagnon).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">104 F.3d at 311. The court in <em>Stocks </em>did re-affirm the requirement that any waiver be subject to \u201cthe knowing, intelligent and voluntary standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They concluded by addressing the argument raised by Latson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">On this appeal, Stocks argues that the waiver was defective because of its definition of \u201cassistance of counsel.\u201d The argument is, in effect, that before waiving counsel at a hearing Stocks must have counsel to advise him whether such a waiver is in his interest. Nothing in the Constitution or any statute or rule requires such a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 312. Every probationer retains a right to a hearing and counsel at every step in the process, but that right can be waived. <em>See United States v. Mezzanatto, </em>513 U.S. 196, 201, 115 S.Ct. 797, 130 L.Ed.2d 697 (1995) (\u201cThe provisions of [the Rules of Criminal Procedure] are presumptively waivable.... \u201d). Like the defendant in <em>Stocks, </em>Latson contends a waiver of counsel without the assistance of counsel (or a hearing before a judge) is not valid, and waiver of a hearing, without a hearing (or assistance of counsel) on that waiver is not valid. Nothing in case law, statutes or rules supports such a proposition. The only case cited by Lat-son is <em>McDowell, </em>which involved a pro se defendant representing himself at trial. However this Court has previously recognized the distinction between probation revocation hearings and a formal trial. Due process rights do apply in a \u201crevocation of probation\u201d setting because the loss of freedom \u201cconstitutes a deprivation of a defendant\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dodson, </em>25 F.3d 385, 388 (6th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). However, it \u201cis not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of due process protections accorded the defendant in such a proceeding do not apply to a revocation proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Latson essentially argues that the distinction between formal criminal prosecutions and revocation hearings should not exist, and seeks to extend the \u201cfull panoply\u201d of due process rights to probation revocations and to probation modifications. However, the facts of this case and the relevant caselaw do not demand such an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Finally, as the facts in <em>Stocks </em>and Lat-son indicate, even if a modification is made through an improper waiver, the district court still retains the responsibility to review any modification agreement even if a hearing is waived, and consider the propriety of that waiver if it plays any role in a subsequent revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">For the foregoing reasons the district court revocation of Appellant\u2019s probation is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-5\">. The waiver is dated June 10, 2002. It is signed by Latson and the probation officer (as a witness). The text of the waiver reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJG\">I have been advised and understand that I am entitled by law to a hearing and assistance of counsel before any unfavorable change may be made in my Conditions of Probation or Extend Term of Supervision. By \"assistance of counsel,\u201d I understand that I have a right to be represented at the hearing by counsel of my own choosing if I am able to retain counsel.

Twitty committed her first crime of credit card theft in July 1992 and pleaded guilty to that crime on October 13, 1992. Sentencing was delayed until January 7, 1993. In the meantime, in December 1992, she stole three checks and cashed them. At her January sentencing hearing she received five years probation. In October 1993, she pleaded guilty to the check stealing and was sentenced on state charges to 5 years probation. Based on that conviction the federal district court revoked her probation for the initial credit card crime. <em>See Twitty, </em>44 F.3d at 411-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-15\">. The transcript from the revocation hearing, excerpted above, indicates that the district judge was at least aware of Latsoris past lapses, and may have relied on those previous violations to shape his decision to revoke.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Nichols, </em>affirming a Sixth Circuit decision, held: \u201cconsistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <em>Scott [v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979)] because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\u201d 511 U.S. at 748-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">. The reasoning of <em>Logan </em>and <em>Nichols </em>was also relied on by a recent unpublished Sixth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 131 (2002). There the Court upheld consideration of a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction (resulting in a term of imprisonment) at a sentencing hearing for a subsequent crime. <em>Id </em>at 132. In <em>Tucker, </em>the Court affirmed that the waiver at the misdemeanor conviction had been valid relying on a presumption of regularity in state court proceedings, and the fact that Tucker had signed a written waiver, but admitted that he had not read it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">. In <em>McDowell </em>the Court made a specific finding that the defendant did knowingly waive his right to counsel and was competent to represent himself. 814 F.2d at 251. However, the Court using its \"supervisory powers\u201d in order \"to avoid future appeals of a similar nature,\u201d directed courts to follow the model inquiry found in 1 Bench Book for United States District Judges 1.02.-2 (3d ed.1986) before allowing a defendant to proceed pro se.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b581-16\">. This is in contrast to the facts of <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>142 F.3d 437 (Table), 1998 WL 58145 (6th Cir.1998) (unpublished), cited by Latson. In <em>Lewis, </em>the Court held that it was not a violation of probation when a probationer violates only the term as modified by the probation officer, when that modification was not approved by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">. The waiver and modification in <em>Stocks </em>was done under similar circumstances as Lat-son's, at a meeting with a probation officer, and later approved, without a separate hearing or assistance of counsel by the district court. <em>See Stocks, </em>104 F.3d at 309. Unlike in this case, the district court in <em>Stocks </em>did make a separate finding at the revocation hearing that the uncounseled waiver \"had been knowing, voluntary and intelligent.\u201d Id. at 310. It appears the judge did not make a separate finding in Latson\u2019s case because the revocation did not rest on violations of the modified terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
