We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Partington v. Gedan, </em>961 F.2d 852, 864 (9th Cir.1992). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">The district court properly dismissed Gilchrist\u2019s action under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because all of his claims were inextricably intertwined with the SBA\u2019s decision that he committed ethics violations. <em>See id. </em>at 864-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gilchrist\u2019s motion to recuse Judge Rosenblatt because adverse rulings alone generally do not support a finding of judicial bias. <em>See Leslie v. Grupo ICA, </em>198 F.3d 1152, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-23\">Contrary to Gilchrist\u2019s contention, the district court did not violate Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 36 \u2014 3(b)(ii); <em>see also Sorchini v. City of Covina, </em>250 F.3d 706, 708 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (rule \u201cpermits the citation to an unpublished disposition where the very existence of the prior case is relevant as a <em>factual </em>matter to the case being briefed\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-24\">Gilchrist\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b89-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
