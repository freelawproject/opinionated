King, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Abbie Willis appeals the judgment of the district court affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s denial of Willis\u2019 application for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401 et seq., and Supplemental Security Income under Title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In reaching her decision, the ALJ erroneously rejected the opinion of Willis\u2019 examining physician and instead relied on the non-examining physicians\u2019 opinions. Generally, an examining physician\u2019s opinion carries more weight than a reviewing physician\u2019s. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d). The examining physician\u2019s findings can constitute substantial evidence, and the ALJ may reject those findings only for \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 725 (9th Cir.1998). The ALJ faded to meet this standard and her reliance on the reviewing physicians\u2019 opinions was erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore credit the opinion of Willis\u2019 examining physician \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834, citing <em>Hammock v. Bowen, </em>879 F.2d 498, 502 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We also disagree with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Willis\u2019 testimony was not credible. In explaining her adverse credibility finding, the ALJ failed to consider or address all of Willis\u2019 testimony regarding her inability to function in daily activities. The symptoms which Willis described were consistent with her medical records. There was no evidence that she was malingering, and therefore the ALJ\u2019s findings were required to be \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834. The reasons given by the ALJ for disregarding Willis\u2019 testimony were not supported by substantial evidence. We therefore credit Willis\u2019 testimony regarding her limitations. <em>Varney v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>859 F.2d 1396, 1401 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Finally, the ALJ presented a legally inadequate hypothetical question because it failed to include all of Willis\u2019 limitations and restrictions. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 756 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">Remanding for further proceedings is unnecessary because it is clear that Willis is entitled to benefits. We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to the ALJ for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-10\">. An issue that was raised but we do not reach in this case is whether Willis was denied her due process right to cross-examine the reviewing physicians on whose opinions the ALJ relied. The question is whether the social security hearing was \u201cfull and fair,\u201d as required by due process. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401-402, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (holding that if the claimant fails to exercise his right to subpoena the physician for cross-examination, there is no violation of his due process rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
