Salvadore DAVILA-MARIN, also known as Ricardo Diaz, also known as Ricardo Diaz-Martinez, also known as Salvador Julian Davila-Marin, also known as Salvador Davila, also known as Julian Salvador, also known as Julian Davila-Salvador, also known as Salvador Davila Marin, also known as Julian Davila Salvador, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"Ad3f\">No. 02-4079.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"AAp9\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A-LS\">Submitted July <em>2, </em>2003.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Al5\">Decided July 18, 2003.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b798-16\">Before WOLLMAN, BYE, and MELLOY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b798-18\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b798-19\">In this direct criminal appeal, Salvadore Davila-Marin challenges the sentence the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed after he pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after deportation, following a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Finding that the Guidelines calculations overrepresented his criminal history, the district court granted Davila-Marin\u2019s motion for a downward departure, reducing his criminal history from Category IV to Category III. The court overruled DavilaMarin\u2019s motion to reduce his offense level, however, and sentenced him to 30 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release. On appeal, Davila-Marin\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history, by departing only one criminal history category, and by not departing to a lower offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-22\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s discretionary decisions not to further reduce Davila-Marin\u2019s criminal history category and not to grant a downward departure from his offense level are both unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Darden, </em>70 F.3d 1507, 1549 (8th Cir.1995) (court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart is unreviewable if court is aware of its authority to depart), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1149, 116 S.Ct. 1449, 134 L.Ed.2d 569, <em>and cert. denied, </em>518 U.S. 1026, 116 S.Ct. 2567, 135 L.Ed.2d 1084 (1996); <em>United States v. Dutcher, </em>8 F.3d 11, 12 (8th Cir.1993) (extent of downward departure is unreviewable, regardless of reasons for refraining from departing further). As to counsel\u2019s argument concerning the criminal history points, assuming that the matter is reviewable, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in assigning 2 criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>history points for Davila-Marin\u2019s 70-day sentence for driving while intoxicated, even if he actually served less than 30 days on that sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(b) (2 criminal history points are assigned for each prior sentence of at least 60 days), 4A1.2, comment, (n.2) (criminal history points are based on sentence imposed, not length of time actually served); <em>United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 782-83 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Following careful review of the record, we find no other nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-20\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
