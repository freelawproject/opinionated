On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s rulings. Relying heavily upon <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), we concluded \u201cthat the government has failed to show special justifications for the mandatory detention provision contained in \u00a7 236(c) which are sufficient to outweigh a lawful permanent resident alien\u2019s constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding physical restraint without an individualized determination of flight risk or danger to the public.\u201d <em>Hoang v. Comfort, </em>282 F.3d 1247, 1260 (10th Cir.2002). The United States Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari, vacated our judgments, and remanded the matters to us for further consideration in light of <em>Demon v. Kim, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">In <em>Demon, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed <em>Kim v. Ziglar, </em>276 F.3d 523 (9th Cir.2002) (which held \u00a7 236(c) violated substantive due process as applied to Kim because INS \u201chas not provided a \u2018special justification\u2019 for no-bail civil detention sufficient to overcome a lawful permanent resident alien\u2019s liberty interest on an individualized determination of flight risk and dangerousness\u201d (276 F.3d at 535)). The <em>Demon </em>Court, distinguishing its opinion in <em>Zadvydas, </em>held \u201cthat Congress, justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers, may require that persons such as [Kim] be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.\u201d 123 S.Ct. at 1712. The Court concluded that \u201c[detention [of criminal aliens] during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of that process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1721-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Nothing in the facts of the cases before us on remand warrants our departure from the <em>Demon </em>holding. We REVERSE the district court\u2019s rulings that \u00a7 236(c) of the INA is unconstitutional as violative of both substantive and procedural due process, and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b931-29\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
