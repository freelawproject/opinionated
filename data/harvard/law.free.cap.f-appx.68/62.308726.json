We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and summary judgment, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">The district court properly dismissed Holestine\u2019s due process and living conditions claims for failure to exhaust because Holestine did not pursue the claims through the final level of administrative review. <em>See Booth v. Chumer, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (holding that prisoner must exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing suit in federal court, even where complaint seeks only money damages). We construe the district court\u2019s order dismissing these claims to be without prejudice. <em>See Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1120 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Holestine\u2019s deliberate indifference claim because, at most Holes-tine demonstrated that he disagreed with the defendants\u2019 assessments and recommendations regarding his mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>needs. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.Sd 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996) (concluding that difference of opinion between inmate and physician regarding treatment does not amount to deliberate indifference). Further, the district court correctly dismissed Holestine\u2019s excessive force claim because Holestine failed to allege that he suffered even a <em>de minimis </em>physical injury when defendants extracted him from his cell. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>Oliver v. Keller, </em>289 F.3d 623, 627 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because Holestine\u2019s allegations regarding the cell extraction did not show that the officers acted maliciously with the intent to cause harm. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Holestine contends that the district court erred by failing to address his claims of retaliation, inadequate medical care and violations of state law. We have reviewed these claims and conclude that they lack merit. <em>See Beezley v. Fremont Indem. Co., </em>804 F.2d 530, 530 n. 1 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (noting that this court may affirm on \u201cany basis fairly supported by the record\u201d). We construe the dismissal of the state law claims to be without prejudice. <em>See Gini v. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dep\u2019t, </em>40 F.3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b92-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
