The District Court declined to grant the government\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) motion for departure below the mandatory minimum after the government argued against its own motion during the sentencing hearing. Bancroft asserts on appeal that the government violated the terms of his plea agreement by this conduct. We have plenary review over questions of law pertaining to the interpretation of plea agreements. <em>United States v. Moscahlaidis, </em>868 F.2d 1357, 1360 (3d Cir. 1989). We will affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">Bancroft argues that the government violated the terms of the plea agreement by making, but then arguing against, the \u00a7 3553(e) motion. When determining if the government violated the plea agreement, we use three steps: \u201cFirst, what are the facts of the case, i.e., what are the terms of the agreement and the conduct of the government; second, whether the conduct of the government violated the terms of the plea agreement; and third, what is the appropriate remedy if the court concludes that a violation occurred.\u201d <em>Moscahlaidis, </em>868 F.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">Our inquiry regarding the \u00a7 3553(e) motion begins with a look at the language of the agreement and the subsequent actions by the government. The plea agreement required the government to \u201c[m]ake a motion to allow the Court to depart below any statutory mandatory minimums pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)\u201d if the government determined that Bancroft had provided \u201ccomplete and substantial assistance\u201d with the investigation. The government, prior to sentencing, filed the \u00a7 3553(e) motion requesting the appropriate departure. At the sentencing hearing, the government acknowledged the motion and its affect of allowing the sentencing judge to depart, but then argued against granting the \u00a7 3553(e) motion by detailing Bancroft\u2019s criminal history and likelihood of recidivism. With this factual scenario in place, we move to the second question under <em>Moscahlaidis: </em>did the conduct of the government violate the plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">The government was permitted to make any argument it wished once it fulfilled its obligation to file the bargained-for motions. <em>United States v. Medford, </em>194 F.3d 419, 423 (3d Cir.1999). In <em>Medford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>we addressed the near identical situation where the \u201c[defendants contended] that the government violated the plea agreement by filing a downward departure motion and then stating at the sentencing hearing that it did not recommend a downward departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422. The language of the plea agreement in <em>Medford </em>was almost identical to that found in Bancroft\u2019s agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 423 (\u201c[T]he plea agreement required the government \u2018to make a motion to allow the Court to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1, if the government, in its sole discretion, determines that the defendant has provided substantial assistance.\u2019 \u201d). In <em>Medford, </em>we focused on the language merely requiring the government to file the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">We interpret the plain terms of the plea agreement to require only that the government file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion in order to give the District Court the power (\u201cto allow the Court\u201d) to depart downward under that provision. Contrary to defendants\u2019 suggestions, the plea agreement did not require the government to recommend a downward departure at the sentencing hearing; nor did it prohibit the government from stating at the sentencing hearing that it did not recommend departure. Therefore, when the government filed the 5K1.1 motion, it complied with the terms of the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><em>Id. </em>Although <em>Medford </em>dealt with a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the principle announced is indistinguishable from our case and controls our outcome. Once the government files the motion for departure, it has fulfilled its obligation under the plea agreement and is free to argue for or against the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Bancroft\u2019s second argument, that he did not \u201creceive from the government that which was reasonably due to him under the circumstances,\u201d is also resolved by <em>Medford. </em>Allegations of bad faith were addressed in <em>Medford, </em>where we confronted the \u201ccontention that the government acted in bad faith by failing to make a more concerted 5K1.1 downward departure motion at the time of sentencing,\u201d and found that because the government fulfilled its obligation to file the motion, there was no bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 423. Here, because the government complied with the terms of the plea agreement by filing the \u00a7 3553(e) motion, its actions were not unreasonable or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Bancroft makes two other arguments regarding the conduct of the government in this case. First, he contends that the government did not make the nature and extent of his cooperation known, in violation of the plea agreement. This argument has no merit. At the sentencing hearing, the government attorney throughly explained Bancroft\u2019s cooperation. <em>See </em>App. at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Bancroft\u2019s final argument is that the government breached the plea agreement by altering its sentencing recommendation at the time of sentencing. This argument is equally unpersuasive. In the sentencing memorandum, the government recommended \u201cthat a substantial sentence of imprisonment be imposed based upon the seriousness of the offense committed, the fact that the defendant had a prior felony drug offense conviction, and the fact that the defendant is a career offender.\u201d <em>See </em>App. at 39. No definition of \u201csubstantial sentence\u201d was given in the memorandum. At the sentencing hearing, the government asked for a sentence of 20 years following an explanation of Bancroft\u2019s criminal history and the nature of the current offense. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the government did not contradict itself by simply defining a \u201csubstantial sentence\u201d to be 20 years at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">For the foregoing reasons will we affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
