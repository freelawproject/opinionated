At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Martinez-Rodriguez\u2019s motion for downward departure and sentenced him to 71 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erroneously sentenced Martinez-Rodriguez at the top of the Guidelines range, and that the court should have granted a downward departure. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-22\">We do not review a sentence that has been imposed at the top of a properly determined Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam). Nor do we review a sentencing court\u2019s denial of a downward departure, where, as here, there is no indication the court believed it lacked the authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 783-84 (8th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-23\">We have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-24\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-18\">. The HONORABLE JAMES M.
