Moss argues his conviction is tainted by the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for substitute counsel.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for substitution of counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Corporan-Cuevas, </em>35 F.3d 953, 956 (4th Cir.1994). However, a defendant does not have an absolute right to substitution of counsel, <em>United States v. Mullen, </em>32 F.3d 891, 895 (4th Cir.1994), and an indigent defendant may request another appointed attorney only for good cause, <em>United States v. Gallop, </em>838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988). In evaluating whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Moss\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel, this court must consider: (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into Moss\u2019s complaint; and (3) \u201cwhether the attorney/client conflict was so great that it had resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\u201d <em>Gallop, </em>838 F.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Our review of the district court\u2019s ruling indicates no error in the denial of Moss\u2019s motion. The district court noted the substantial delay between Moss\u2019s initial decision to plead guilty and the filing of his motion. Moreover, Moss\u2019s statements indicated he had adequate interaction with his attorney given his intent to plead guilty, an assertion that we find falls short of demonstrating good cause. <em>See Mullen, </em>32 F.3d at 895. In light of these findings, as well as Moss\u2019s subsequent statement while pleading guilty that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s efforts on his behalf, <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977), we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Gallop, </em>838 F.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">Accordingly, we affirm Moss\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-11\"> Moss\u2019s attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel shortly before Moss mailed a letter requesting substitute counsel be appointed. For ease of reference, this opinion refers to both collectively as Moss\u2019s motion for substitute counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
