Zilly, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b846-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe G\u00f3mez-Rend\u00f1 (\u201cGomez\u201d) appeals the sentence given him pursuant to a Plea Agreement in which he pled guilty to the offense of re-entry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), enhanced by \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The G\u00f3mez Plea Agreement contained a waiver of appeal. G\u00f3mez argues that his sentence enhancement should be limited to one count of possession of a controlled substance, an aggravated felony. G\u00f3mez contends that the sentence imposed by Judge Rosenblatt is inconsistent with his Plea Agreement and, therefore is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The Plea Agreement states: \u201cThe precise level of offense and number of months sentence imposed will be determined by the court based upon the defendant\u2019s criminal record.\u201d There is no statement in the Plea Agreement to the effect that defendant\u2019s entire criminal record involves nothing more than a single conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Indeed, the PSR explicitly states that he was sentenced on June 12, 1996, for convictions on two counts, transportation of cocaine base for sale and possession of cocaine base for sale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Abstract of Judgment records that the sentence he received for these convictions was 1 year and 4 months. The Plea Agreement defined Level 24 offenses, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-10\">Under the sentencing guidelines, as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) and (b)(1)(A), Unlawful Reentry After Deportation by an alien with a prior aggravated felony conviction for (i) a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months ... is classified as a crime with an offense level of twenty-four (24) and carries a sentence between 51 and 125 months incarceration, which will be precisely determined by the court, based upon the defendant\u2019s criminal record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">As the June 1996 sentence was greater than 13 months, Gomez\u2019s offense level was 24. After adjustment for acceptance of responsibility the total offense level was 21 and the judge departed downward 4 levels in accordance with the Plea Agreement. It follows that the sentence imposed \u2014 41 months, in accordance with the PSR\u2019s calculation \u2014 is also in accordance with the Plea Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Appellant also contends that the Court imposed an illegal sentence because his plea was based on simple possession instead of trafficking and constituted a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreement binding on the court. This argument is without merit. The written Plea Agreement does not limit the plea to simple possession as a basis for the prior aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-15\">. The PSR also states that G\u00f3mez \"disputes the convictions!)] and court documents show [that] he refused to sign the sentencing and probation orders in San Francisco.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
