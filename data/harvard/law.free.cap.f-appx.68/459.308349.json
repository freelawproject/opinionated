An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1)(B) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">As to Bailey\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the district court denied those claims because they were not raised in Bailey\u2019s direct appeal. At the time it issued its decision, the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (holding that failure to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal does not bar movant from raising such claims in a \u00a7 2255 motion). While we conclude that jurists of reason could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling, we have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Bailey has not demonstrated the denial of a constitutional right as to his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">The district court denied the remainder of Bailey\u2019s claims because he failed to raise them on direct appeal. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Bailey has not made the requisite showing to obtain a certificate of appealability as to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
