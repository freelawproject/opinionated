Hellerstein, Judge) dismissing her due process claims against the New York City Housing Authority (\u201cHousing Authority\u201d) and various officers of the Housing Authority. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-19\">Holiday alleges that defendants violated her rights to substantive and procedural due process in terminating her tenancy based on the misconduct of her adult, nonresident son. However, Holiday successfully appealed the termination through an Article 78 proceeding. On June 6, 2000, the Appellate Division, First Department, annulled the Housing Authority\u2019s action, finding the penalty disproportionate to the offense, and noting that Holiday\u2019s expulsion \u201cis shocking to the conscience of the Court in view of the duration of [plaintiffs] tenancy, her large household that includes a disabled daughter, her unblemished record as a tenant and the predicate for the alleged violation in the isolated actions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>an emancipated child who not only resides elsewhere but against whom petitioner has found it necessary to obtain multiple orders of protection.\u201d <em>Holiday v. Franco, </em>268 A.D.2d 138, 709 N.Y.S.2d 523, 526-27 (1st Dep\u2019t 2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Although we are similarly troubled by the facts in this case, it remains true that Holiday was never evicted from her apartment. Under these circumstances - where Holiday never lost legal occupancy of her home - the availability of judicial review through an Article 78 proceeding provided Holiday with sufficient due process. <em>Cf. Locurto v. Safir, </em>264 F.3d 154 (2d Cir.2001) (concluding that a post-deprivation Article 78 proceeding satisfied due process although plaintiffs alleged that their pre-termination hearing was flawed).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Escalera v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>425 F.2d 853, 865-66 (2d Cir. 1970), we noted that the availability of a later Article 78 proceeding will not cure fundamental defects in the termination process, such as the Housing Authority\u2019s failure to provide tenants with prior notice of the charges against them, the nature of the evidence supporting those charges, and an adequate opportunity to rebut the charges by confronting and cross-examining adverse witnesses. The terms of the <em>Escalera </em>consent decree are embodied in the Housing Authority\u2019s current Termination of Tenancy Procedures, and Holiday does not allege that she failed to receive the benefit of these basic safeguards. We therefore conclude that <em>Escalera </em>does not bar dismissal in this case, and that a later but pre-eviction Article 78 proceeding provides adequate protection against other administrative errors in the termination process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Holiday also alleges that many of the Housing Authority\u2019s current practices, in particular its use of form stipulations, violates the prior consent decrees entered in <em>Escalera </em>and <em>Tyson v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>369 F.Supp. 513 (S.D.N.Y.1974). As a preliminary matter, it is unclear whether Holiday has standing to seek such broad injunctive and declaratory relief with regard to the Housing Authority\u2019s alleged policies and practices. In any event, given the complex nature of these consent decrees, <em>see, e.g. Escalera v. New York Housing Authority, </em>924 F.Supp. 1323 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (modifying <em>Escalera </em>consent decree), potentially interested parties must seek enforcement through the issuing court, not through a separate action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Local Number 93, Int\u2019l Assoc. of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, </em>478 U.S. 501, 523-24 n. 13, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986) (explaining that a consent decree continues jurisdiction in a single court); <em>see also Tyson, </em>369 F.Supp. at 518 (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to bring a separate suit to enforce the <em>Escalera </em>consent decree and noting \u201c[t]o the extent that plaintiffs claim that the [Housing Authority] has violated the terms of the <em>[Escalera </em>] decree ... their remedy lies with the <em>Escalera </em>court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Finally, Holiday asserts a substantive due process claim, alleging that the form stipulation which she signed at the request of the Housing Authority, permanently excluding her son from her resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>dence, violated her right of familial association. The District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine as the Appellate Division found that Holiday was \u201cduly advised of her right to counsel and elected to proceed without representation\u201d and could not \u201cestablish collusion, fraud, accident, mistake or any other equitable ground ... to vacate [the] stipulated settlement [and is thus] ... bound by the agreement she signed.\u201d <em>Holiday, </em>709 N.Y.S.2d at 525. To prevail on her substantive due process claim, Holiday would have to call the validity of these findings into question, as she could not claim a substantive due process violation based a condition she consented to in a binding stipulation. <em>See Hachamovitch v. DeBuono, </em>159 F.3d 687, 694 (2d Cir.1998) (under <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>federal courts lack jurisdiction \u201cover any claims that are \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with a state court\u2019s determination in a judicial proceeding\u201d); <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir.1996) (the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is at least as broad as the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In any event, even if jurisdiction is arguable, the challenged stipulation provides that Holiday\u2019s son \u201cshall not reside in nor visit the subject apartment.\u201d As such, Holiday knew of the alleged harm to her associational rights when she signed the stipulation on May 6, 1997. Because more than three years elapsed between that date and the commencement of this action on May 29, 2001, the substantive due process claim is barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Pearl v. City of Long Beach, </em>296 F.3d 76, 79-80 (2d Cir.2002) (stating that New York\u2019s three year statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 1983 actions and that a claim accrues \u201cwhen the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of [her] action\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"> Other circuit courts have accordingly held that state eviction proceedings provide sufficient procedural protection to public housing tenants even in the absence of pre-eviction administrative proceedings. <em>See Colvin v. Housing Authority of the City of Sarasota, </em>71 F.3d 864, 866 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam); <em>Perry v. Royal Arms Apartments, </em>729 F.2d 1081, 1082 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>Swann v. Gastonia Housing Authority, </em>675 F.2d 1342, 1347 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
