We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review for plain error, <em>see United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number><em>States v. Minore, </em>292 F.3d 1109, 1118 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Colman contends the district court erred by imposing a sentence upon revocation of supervised release that was greater than the sentence the court warned Colman at his original change of plea hearing he would receive if he violated the terms of his supervised release. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">At his change of plea hearing, Colman was advised that if he violated the terms of supervised release, \u201cit\u2019s entirely likely that you may have to serve the remainder of that term in prison.\u201d When Colmaris term of supervised release was revoked, there were only 4 months, 22 days remaining, yet the court imposed a new sentence of 23 months incarceration and 13 months supervised release. Any error in explaining the consequences of violating the terms of supervised release was harmless, because the district court expressly informed Col-man that he faced a maximum of up to 20 years in prison and 3 years supervised release, and his original sentence combined with his sentence upon revocation of supervised release is still substantially below the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Fuentes-Mendoza, </em>56 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b833-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
