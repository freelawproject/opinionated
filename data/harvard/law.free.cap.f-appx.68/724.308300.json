Robinson challenges the sentence imposed for his Continuing Criminal Enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d) conviction, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. Specifically, he contends that the district court erroneously included in the calculation of his criminal history category a prior drug conviction that also served as a basis of the CCE offense. We reject the argument and affirm Robinson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-22\">In July 1992, Robinson was charged in a thirty-six count superceding indictment, based on allegations that he had been involved in drug trafficking from 1982 to 1992, during which time, with the help of his brothers, Robinson distributed between fifteen and fifty kilograms of cocaine. He pleaded guilty to most counts in the indictment, including the CCE charge. The district court sentenced Robinson, and a series of appeals followed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which eventually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>led to a resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">At the resentencing, the district court accepted the presentence report\u2019s recommendation to group all counts (including the CCE charge) and assign a total offense level of 38. The court also determined that Robinson was in criminal history category III. Central to the criminal history calculation was a 1986 conviction for two counts of cocaine distribution for which Robinson received a sentence of 42 months imprisonment. Based on this prior sentence, three criminal history points were assigned pursuant to federal sentencing guideline \u00a7 4Al.l(a), which states: \u201cAdd 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a) (2003). With the addition of these three points, Robinson\u2019s criminal history score fell within Criminal History Category III.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Robinson objects to the court\u2019s treatment of the 1986 conviction as a \u201cprior sentence,\u201d claiming that the guideline definition for \u201cprior sentence\u201d prohibits the use of the 1986 conviction to establish both the CCE offense and enhance his criminal history score because it restricts the term to mean \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt ... <em>for conduct not part of the instant offense. </em>\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Robinson\u2019s argument fails, however, because the sentencing guideline for CCE offenses specifically precludes his position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO6v\">Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848, certain conduct for which the defendant has previously been sentenced may be charged as part of the instant offense to establish a \u201ccontinuing series of violations.\u201d A sentence resulting from a conviction sustained prior to the last overt act of the instant offense <em>is to be considered a prior sentence under \u00a7 4.Al.2(a)(1) </em>and not part of the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.5, cmt. n. 3 (2003). There is no dispute that the 1986 conviction was sustained prior to the last overt act of the CCE offense. Therefore, this commentary explicitly contemplated and endorsed what the district court did-include the 1986 conviction as part of the instant CCE offense and consider it as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1 for criminal history purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">In an effort to avoid this conclusion, Robinson contends that the commentary to \u00a7 2D1.5 is irreconcilably at odds with guideline section \u00a7 4A1.2, and therefore, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>when the guideline conflicts with the commentary, the guideline is to be Mowed. 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree with Robinson\u2019s assertion that there is an irreconcilable conflict here. Rather, the commentary to the CCE guideline simply provides that when CCE is the instant offense, the general rule-that \u201cprior sentence\u201d shall not include conduct that is part of the instant offense-does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">The rationale for such an exception is not difficult to determine. The gist of a CCE offense is the operation of a criminal business over a period of time involving a series of predicate offenses. If one of these predicate offenses results in a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>viction for that isolated act, but the offender continues to violate the law by engaging in further acts in a way that results in a CCE conviction, then he is not only guilty of CCE but he is also a repeat offender. If \u00a7 4A1.2 were strictly applied in CCE cases, the prior conviction could be used only as a basis for the CCE and not as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d for criminal history purposes, and the defendant\u2019s recidivism would go unaddressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Applying the rationale to this case, Robinson\u2019s 1986 conviction supports two separate grounds for punishment: one, it serves as a predicate for a CCE charge, and two, it indicates that Robinson is a repeat offender. The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.5 ensures that his punishment reflects both the CCE and his recidivism. Interpreting the guideline in this way not only avoids the alleged conflict, but it makes good sense. The Sixth Circuit agrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">A conviction for involvement in a continuing criminal enterprise differs from an isolated act because it necessarily involves the repeated commission of other crimes. The sentencing guidelines reflect the unique nature of a continuing criminal enterprise by including prior sentences in the defendant\u2019s criminal history, even if the prior sentences are for crimes committed in furtherance of the continuing criminal enterprise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ard\"><em>United States v.
