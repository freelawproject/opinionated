Hall argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that he attempted to obstruct justice during the investigation. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-23\">Hall, a convicted felon, asked his son, Troy Hall, to buy a Ruger rifle for him and gave him the money for the purchase. A short time later, the rifle and another firearm were seized by officers from the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) who came to Hall\u2019s residence investigating the illegal taking of deer. Hall denied owning the Ruger and, after the officers left, called Troy and told him that, if he were asked about the Ruger, he should say that the gun was his, and that he had left it at his father\u2019s house. The DNR officers later contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for assistance. When Troy Hall was interviewed by ATF agents in December 2001, he first told them the false story suggested by his father, but then told them the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-24\">Hall contends that the \u00a7 3C1.1 adjustment was error in that his obstructive conduct did not occur during the investigation of the \u201cinstant offense,\u201d as required under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, because the federal investigation had not begun when he told his son to lie about the Ruger rifle.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>However, \u00a7 3C1.1 makes no distinction between a federal and a state investigation of the instant offense. <em>United States v. Self, </em>132 F.3d 1039, 1042 (4th Cir.1997). Although the state investigation initially focused on game violations, Hall instructed his son to lie in an attempt to evade firearms charges. The federal investigation of his conduct simply continued the work begun by the DNR officers. Moreover, even though Hall\u2019s son recanted the lie, Hall\u2019s attempt to obstruct the investigation was enough to warrant the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-17\"> A state firearms charge remained pending against Hall when he was sentenced for the instant federal offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
