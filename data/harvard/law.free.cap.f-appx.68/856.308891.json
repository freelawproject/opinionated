Reed, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Given the parties\u2019 stipulation that the gun crossed state lines at some point before it came into Smith\u2019s possession, there was sufficient evidence for a fact-finder to conclude that Smith, a convicted felon, did unlawfully \u201cpossess <em>in or affecting commerce\u201d </em>a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Our precedents have repeatedly refused to read any \u201crecency\u201d requirement into the statute, even after the Supreme Court narrowed the reach of the Commerce Clause in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hanna, </em>55 F.3d 1456, 1462 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cCongress sought to reach possessions broadly, with little concern for when the nexus with commerce occurred.... [A] past connection is enough____ We have read and considered <em>United States v. Lopez </em>..., but it does not alter our analysis.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Casterline, </em>103 F.3d 76, 77 (9th Cir. 1996) (refusing to construe section 922(g) as \u201crequiring a time of [interstate] transportation reasonably close to the charged time of possession\u201d and reaffirming our holding, \u201cafter <em>Lopez </em>came down, that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) requires only that the firearm was \u2018at some time\u2019 in interstate commerce\u201d); <em>United States v. Rousseau, </em>257 F.3d 925, 932-33 (9th Cir.2001) (acknowledging <em>Morrison </em>and holding that defendant\u2019s \u201carguments that ... the district court should have instructed the jury regarding the effect on and recency of transportation in interstate commerce are ... without merit\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gonzales, </em>307 F.3d 906, 914 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that \u201ca prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause, where the only link to commerce is the fact that the firearm once crossed a state line\u201d); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>242 F.3d 1162, 1162-63 (9th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (holding that our precedents remained unaffected by \u201crecent Supreme Court opinions\u201d and that \u201cCongress did not exceed its authority under the Commerce Clause when it enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Because the statute contains no \u201crecency\u201d requirement and because Smith admitted to all the elements of the crime in the stipulations, the district court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
