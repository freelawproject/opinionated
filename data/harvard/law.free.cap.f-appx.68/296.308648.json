Reddinger appeals from an order of the District Court granting summary judgment for the Commissioner of Social Security and affirming the denial of his application for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying Reddinger\u2019s claim for benefits \u201cis identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">In determining whether a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner must follow the sequential analysis set forth in the regulations promulgated by the Social Security Administration. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. Under the first step of the analysis, a claimant is not disabled if he was doing substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a). \u201cSubstantial gainful activity\u201d is defined as \u201cwork activity\u201d that is both \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cgainful.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1572. Substantial work \u201cinvolves doing significant physical or mental activities\u201d and \u201cgainful work\u201d is done \u201cfor pay or profit.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1572. Under \u00a7 404.1572, work may be \u201csubstantial\u201d even if it is done on a \u201cpart-time basis.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1572(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">In this case, the Commissioner determined that Reddinger had performed substantial gainful activity when he worked as a dispatcher from July 1997 to July 1998 two and one half days a week and as a cashier from April 1995 to April 1996 for two to six days a week for eight hours a day. The nature of Reddinger\u2019s past work as a dispatcher and a cashier was set forth in a Work Activity Report Reddinger completed in February 1999. During a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, Reddinger confirmed that he worked in these positions and that he had earned an average of $702.72 per month while he was a cashier. With respect to his position as a cashier, he affirmed that he was \u201chired to be a cashier and nothing else[,]\u201d but that he was terminated almost a year later because his employer wanted him to perform additional work, such as stocking shelves, mopping restrooms and shoveling snow, which was too physically demanding. In light of Reddinger\u2019s past employment and earnings, which exceeded the limits in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1574, the Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>denied Reddinger\u2019s application for benefits consistent with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Reddinger contends that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence because he relied upon Reddinger\u2019s Work Activity Report and failed to credit his testimony that his position as a cashier differed from that of the other cashiers who performed physically demanding tasks. Reddinger\u2019s argument is not persuasive. The Commissioner appropriately accorded great weight to Reddinger\u2019s employment history and past earnings as detailed in the Work Activity Report, thereby rejecting his testimony to the contrary. In light of Reddinger\u2019s testimony that the nature of his job duties as a cashier changed after a year of employment, there was no error in concluding that his employment as a cashier constituted substantial gainful activity. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Commissioner will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
