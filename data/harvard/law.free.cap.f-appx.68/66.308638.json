We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Frost v. Agnos, </em>152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">The district court concluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on Johnson\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because the right at issue was not clearly established. This was error in light of our precedent holding that \u201cslippery floors without protective measures could create a sufficient danger [to a disabled detainee] to warrant relief.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1129-30 (reversing summary judgment where prison officials were aware that pretrial detainee who used crutches had fallen and injured himself on slippery shower floor yet declined to \u201ctake reasonable measures to assist [plaintiff] in showering safely\u201d). We therefore vacate and remand for the district court to reconsider its summary judgment under <em>Frost.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">Given the district court\u2019s determination that Johnson had exhausted his administrative remedies, Johnson\u2019s retaliation claim fails because he cannot show any First or Fourteenth Amendment injury resulting from Sgt. Martinez\u2019s alleged interference with Johnson\u2019s ability to exhaust. <em>See Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 449 (9th Cir.2000). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s implicit grant of summary judgment on the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">In light of our disposition, we do not reach Johnson\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b97-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
