At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Dudley\u2019s motion for downward departure and sentenced him to 57 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. The court also ordered Dudley to pay $3,450 in restitution. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court abused its discretion in denying a downward departure. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">Specifically, we do not review a sentencing court\u2019s denial of a downward-departure motion where, as here, there is no indication the court believed it lacked the authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 783-84 (8th Cir. 2001). Further, we have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-21\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-18\">.
