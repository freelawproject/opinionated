The court sentenced Lopez-Galdamez to, among other things, 77 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Lopez-Galdamez argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">\u201cIt is well established in this Circuit that a court\u2019s decision not to depart from the Guidelines is ... not appealable ... [unless] the defendant shows that a violation of law occurred, that the Guidelines were misapplied, or that the refusal to depart was based on the sentencing court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Lainez-Leiva, </em>129 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir.1997) (per curiam) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Lopez-Galdamez argues that the last of these exceptions applies because, prior to sentencing, the district court gave notice to the parties that it was considering imposing an upward departure based on Lopez-Galdamez\u2019s numerous pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>or arrests. Despite the fact that the district court did not ultimately impose an upward departure, Lopez-Galdamez asserts that it would have been impermissible to upwardly depart on the basis of his prior arrests and that the district judge\u2019s view of this issue improperly affected his decision to deny Lopez-Galdamez\u2019s motion for a downward departure. We reject this argument because Lopez-Galdamez has offered no support for the proposition that it is improper for a district court to consider a defendant\u2019s prior arrest record when deciding a motion seeking a downward departure on the ground that the defendant\u2019s criminal history is over-represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Because this case presents none of the exceptions to the rule that decisions not to depart from the Guidelines are not reviewable, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
