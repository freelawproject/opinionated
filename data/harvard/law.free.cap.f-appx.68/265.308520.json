Elvin, <em>Judge), </em>following his conditional plea of guilty to one count of possessing a firearm after being previously convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Appellant\u2019s plea preserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress a firearm recovered by the police officers on the basis that they lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. The motion was referred to Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott, who conducted an evidentiary hearing and recommended that the motion be denied. The District Court adopted the recommendation and denied the motion, and appellant pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">On appeal, appellant contends, as he did below, that police officers lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of him as he walked down a residential street in Buffalo, New York on the day of his arrest. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \u201cAlthough we review de novo the legal issues presented by a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous, and we view those fact in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Casado, </em>303 F.3d 440, 443 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny, law enforcement officers possess the limited authority \u201cin appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner\u201d to approach a person they believe might be engaged in criminal activity for the purpose of conducting an brief investigatory stop even though they lack probable cause to make an arrest. 392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Officers \u201cmust be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Furthermore, in connection with such a stop, officers may conduct a limited weapons search when they believe a suspect is armed \u201cwith a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against [them].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">At an evidentiary hearing before the magistrate judge, arresting officer Jerry Gulian of the Buffalo police department testified to the following. On the day of appellant\u2019s arrest, Gulian and his partner Pat Humiston were riding in a marked Buffalo police car in the vicinity of Wood-lawn and Dupont Avenues at approximately 7 o\u2019clock in the evening when Gulian observed appellant and another individual walking down Woodlawn towards the intersection of Dupont. From approximately sixty feet away, Gulian observed appellant \u201cmess around with his waistband\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>observed \u201cwhat appeared to be a revolver, handgun or something.\u201d (Transcript of Suppression Hearing Jan. 11, 2002, at 8.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gulian stated to Humiston, who was driving, \u201cI think this guy has got a gun, let\u2019s check him out.\u201d (Id. at 10.) Humiston pulled the car over and the two exited the car and directed appellant and the other individual to approach the car and put their hands on the car for the purpose of conducting a pat-down. At that point, appellant fled from officers, instigating a brief foot chase by Gulian during which Gulian saw appellant throw a gun from his waist area to the ground. Appellant was subsequently apprehended and the gun recovered a short distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The magistrate credited this testimony and, in light of the circumstances, found the investigatory stop to be proper, and the District Court, after reviewing the arresting officers\u2019 testimony, agreed and denied the motion. We affirm. The circumstances described by Officer Gulian are those in which a \u201cTerry stop\u201d is appropriate. The officer\u2019s personal observation of an object that appeared to be a gun created adequate \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to believe that appellant was unlawfully possessing a firearm, and justified conducting a limited weapons search to protect the safety of officers and others. That New York state permits certain licensed individuals to carry concealed weapons does not negate the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that unlawful activity was afoot, since the officers were entitled to draw on their experience that far more individuals who carry concealed handguns do not have licenses than do. <em>Cf. United States v. Forero-Rincon, </em>626 F.2d 218, 222 (2d Cir.1980) (holding that the fact that a suspect\u2019s conduct may be as consistent with innocent activity as with nefarious activity does not preclude that conduct from supporting reasonable suspicion).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">. On further questioning from the court, Gulian testified that he observed \"a dark object, it looked kind of like the handle of a pistol.\u201d (Id. at 9.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
