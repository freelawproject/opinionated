We review de novo the district court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>147 F.3d 912, 913 (9th Cir.1998). We vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Under certain circumstances, the district court may modify a fine pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(c). Here, the district court lacked jurisdiction to modify Jones\u2019 fine under Rule 35 because Jones filed his motion to vacate more than four years after sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35; <em>United States v. Penna, </em>319 F.3d 509, 512 (9th Cir.2003) (seven day period to file Rule 35 motion is jurisdictional). The district court also lacked jurisdiction to modify Jones\u2019 fine pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573 because the government did not file a petition to do so. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573 (court may modify fine only upon petition of the government); <em>United States v. Morales, </em>328 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
