We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Reese v. Jefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J, </em>208 F.3d 736, 738 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-19\">The district court properly dismissed Kalra\u2019s claim challenging the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (\u201cEEOC\u201d) finding that he was not entitled to an SF-50 personnel action form reflecting his retroactive hire. The record shows that Kalra\u2019s claim is time-barred because he did not file his complaint within 90 days after receipt of the EEOC\u2019s May 31, 1996 decision denying his request. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c); <em>Greenlaw v. Garrett, </em>59 F.3d 994, 997 n. 7 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-24\">Although Kalra timely appealed the EEOC\u2019s March 2000 decision denying his Petition For Enforcement, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants because Kalra did not identify any issues for review. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (holding that summary judgment is proper unless non-moving party can demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact for trier).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-25\">Kalra\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b95-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
