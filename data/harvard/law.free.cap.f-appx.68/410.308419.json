On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction and the sentencing court\u2019s failure to award him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">First, Norman asserts that there was insufficient evidence that he possessed a firearm. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence challenge on direct review, the relevant standard is whether the record contains \u201csubstantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support\u201d the jury\u2019s finding. <em>Glosser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and inquires whether there is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). The reviewing court must consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences. <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">Here, Virginia Beach Police Officer Gregory J.B. Harris testified that Norman, a back seat passenger in a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation, exited the vehicle after being told he was free to leave and walked toward the officer. Both Harris and Norman glanced at the ground at Norman\u2019s feet after hearing a metallic thud and spotted a gun. Norman looked scared and ran from the scene. Further, Harris described that no gun was in the vicinity of the stopped vehicle prior to Norman\u2019s exit. This testimony, when all reasonable inferences are drawn from the circumstantial evidence, is sufficient to prove possession. Norman\u2019s denial of possession on appeal and the Government\u2019s failure to detect Norman\u2019s fingerprints on the gun are not sufficient to overturn the jury\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Second, Norman asserts that the district court erred by denying him a downward adjustment for his acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of responsibility. The denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 74 (4th Cir.1996). The determination of the district court on review is accorded great deference. <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1005 (4th Cir.1996) (citing <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5) (1993)). The burden is on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The district court found that Norman was not eligible for an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he offered no factual basis for awarding the adjustment. At no time during his trial or sentencing did Norman take responsibility for his criminal actions; therefore, the district court did not clearly err in denying Norman a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Norman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
