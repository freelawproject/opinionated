Initially, there was some concern on the part of this Court as to whether the government had made a certification that the appeal was not being taken for purposes of delay and that the evidence suppressed was substantial proof of a fact which was material to the proceeding, as is required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. Accordingly, an order to show cause was issued by this Court, <em>sua sponte. </em>It now appears from the showing made in response to our show cause order, that there was proper certification. Accordingly, the parties, and this Court, now agree that there has been compliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 and that we have jurisdiction over this case. <em>United States v. Carrillo-Bernal, 58 </em>F.3d 1490, (10th Cir. 1995); <em>United States v. Hanks, </em>24 F.3d 1235 (10th Cir.1994). In this regard, we now grant the Appellant\u2019s motion to amend the docketing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">On March 31, 2002, Trooper David King (\u201cthe trooper\u201d), an Oklahoma State Highway Patrol Trooper, stopped the driver of a Chevrolet pickup truck because he was making lane changes without signaling at a turnpike toll plaza on an eastbound lane of Interstate 44. As the trooper approached the driver\u2019s window of the pickup truck, he told the driver, Ronald Glenn Garner (\u201cGarner\u201d), that he had been stopped for failure to use his turn signal. The trooper then asked Gamer to get out of his pickup truck and to produce his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. Garner produced a California driver\u2019s license but he had no vehicle registration. He did produce some title documents purporting to show that he had recently purchased the vehicle. The papers thus produced seemed \u201cunusual\u201d in several respects to the trooper, and he testified at the suppression hearing that Garner had a \u201chard time\u201d telling him where, or under \u00b0what circumstances, he had purchased the car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pickup was registered to a \u201cMartinez.\u201d Also, when Garner produced his driver\u2019s license \u201chis hand was shaking.\u201d When exiting his pickup, Gamer informed the trooper that his cousin, Kenneth Thompson (\u201cThompson\u201d), was asleep in the back of his vehicle under a camper shell. The trooper then asked Garner to sit beside him in the passenger seat of the patrol car. Once there, the trooper again told Garner why he had been stopped and that he was going to issue him a warning citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">While the trooper was filling in the information on the warning citation and was waiting for returns on his computer check, he asked Garner where he had come from and where he was going. The trooper testified that Garner \u201chad a hard time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>answering.\u201d However, in response to such inquiries, Garner said he was traveling from California to Indianapolis at his own expense because he was employed in both places. Garner stated that he was traveling with his cousin Thompson, so that the latter could help him drive and that, after reaching Indianapolis, they would stay there for a couple of weeks and return to California. The trooper testified that at about that point in time he began to have a \u201csuspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The trooper then decided to talk to Thompson (the passenger) and see if he had a valid driver\u2019s license. The trooper left the patrol car and made contact with Thompson, who was still in the rear of the pickup truck under a camper shell. Thompson informed the trooper that he did have a driver\u2019s license and came out of the rear window of the camper shell. The trooper thereafter questioned Thompson about the reason for the trip and Thompson said \u201che was headed to Cincinnati to play paint ball and visit family.\u201d The trooper then returned to his patrol car and \u201cran a driver\u2019s] license and status check on both individuals,\u201d and determined that both of them had valid licenses and that there were no outstanding warrants for either. At this point, the trooper finished writing the warning citation, a copy of which Garner signed, and the trooper then returned to Gamer his driver\u2019s license and gave him a copy of the warning citation. About 15 minutes elapsed between the /stop of Garner\u2019s pickup and the time that the trooper finished writing the warning citation and gave it to Garner. Then, just as Garner was about to exit the patrol car, the trooper asked if Garner had a moment to answer a few questions before he left, to which Garner said \u201cOkay.\u201d The trooper then asked Garner if he had any weapons or contraband in the truck, to which Garner replied \u201cno.\u201d The trooper next asked Garner if he could search the vehicle, and Garner consented thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The trooper then got out of his patrol car, proceeded to the passenger side of the patrol car and searched Garner and Thompson for possible weapons. None were found on either. The trooper had both Garner and Thompson sit in the patrol car while he searched the pickup. The trooper ran his narcotics-sniffing dog around the track and the dog \u201calerted to the tailgate area.\u201d By that time another trooper, a Mr. Cason, had arrived at the scene. The troopers then searched the vehicle and, while searching the under carriage, the trooper noticed two or three \u201cfresh welds\u201d in the bottom of the bed of the pickup. Continuing their search, the troopers found a blue sleeping bag that contained five cellophane packages that field tested for cocaine. Both Garner and Thompson were then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">On April 2, 2002, an indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, charging both Garner and Thompson with possession with an intent to distribute 15 kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). They each pled not guilty. Thereafter, the defendants, with separate counsel, filed separate motions to suppress, which the district court, after hearing, granted on July 8, 2002. The government now appeals the district court\u2019s suppression order under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">In its order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress, the district court first held that the trooper had \u201cprobable cause sufficient to stop the defendants ...,\u201d and that the initial \u201cstop\u201d of the defendants\u2019 vehicle was lawful. This particular issue is not raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">In granting the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress, the district court stated that \u201cwhen the trooper went to question Mr. Thompson regarding his travel plans, the stop had already exceeded the contours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>permissible under <em>Hunnicutt,\u201d </em>commenting that the detention was \u201cinvestigative\u201d in nature from the very start. <em>See United States v. Hunnicutt, </em>135 F.3d 1345, 1349 (10th Cir.1998). Based thereon, the district court concluded that the \u201cconsent\u201d later given by Garner to answer additional questions from the trooper was \u201cthe fruit of the unlawful detention,\u201d which, as indicated, the district court found had occurred <em>before </em>the trooper left the patrol car where he had been questioning Garner and proceeded to the pickup\u2019s camper and began questioning Thompson. Thus, the district court did not reach the question of whether Garner\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to answer a few more questions before he left was, itself, voluntary, nor that additional question of whether the consent to search was voluntary. We do not agree with this analysis of the facts. The facts, themselves, are not in dispute, since the trooper was the only witness. We do disagree with the district court\u2019s application of the law to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">An officer conducting a routine traffic stop may request a driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. <em>Hunnicutt, </em>at 1349. \u201c[Questions relating to a driver\u2019s travel plans ordinarily fall within the [legitimate] scope of a traffic stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>271 F.3d 1262, 1267 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. West, </em>219 F.3d 1171, 1176 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>93 F.3d 1493, 1499 (10th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">As indicated, the district court held that <em>before </em>the trooper left the patrol car to question Thompson, the passenger, he had improperly \u201cdetained\u201d Garner, i.e., the detention was \u201clonger than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983). That was the basis for the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress. We see nothing in the record before us to support that conclusion. The events occurring from the time the trooper approached the stopped car and asked Garner for his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration until the moment the trooper left his patrol car to talk to Thompson do not show unlawful detention, rather, they show a lawful detention. The trooper asked Gamer for his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, the latter of which Garner could not produce, questioned Garner as to how he had acquired the pickup and his travel plans, and ran a computer check on both occupants of the pickup, all of which is permissible under the authorities above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Further, the \u201cdetention\u201d occurring after the trooper left the patrol car to question Thompson and the time when the trooper returned to his patrol car and finished writing the warning ticket given Garner was, under the described circumstances, proper and not unlawful. When there are two persons in the stopped vehicle, the officer can legitimately ask questions relating to identity, travel plans and ownership of the vehicle of both the driver and passenger. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>867 F.2d 1261, 1263 (10th Cir.1989). Accordingly, the fact that the trooper detained Garner while he questioned Thompson, does not make Gamer\u2019s detention unlawful. Having determined that the \u201cdetention\u201d of the defendants was proper and not unlawful, we need not here decide whether the trooper had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to detain the defendants. The \u201cdetention\u201d of Garner and Thompson, from its inception till, according to the trooper, Garner consented to answer \u201ca few more questions,\u201d was prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>er, as being incidental to a lawful \u201ctraffic stop,\u201d under the authorities above cited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Judgment reversed and case remanded to the district court with instructions that the district court vacate its order granting defendants\u2019 motions to suppress, further proceedings to be consonant with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-11\">. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the trooper was the only witness. He was examined at length by counsel for the government and by counsel for Garner and Thompson, as well as by the district court. A video of this entire transaction, including conduct and conversation, was introduced in the district court, and is a part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. The fact that a defendant is sitting in the front passenger seat of a patrol car does not, without more, make a consent to answer additional questions involuntary. <em>United States v. Gigley, </em>213 F.3d 509, 514 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b964-23\">. In an unpublished opinion filed February - 18, 2003, we upheld a district court's denial of a defendant's motion to suppress in a case involving facts strikingly similar to those in the instant case. <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>57 Fed.Appx. 394 (10th Cir. Feb.18, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
