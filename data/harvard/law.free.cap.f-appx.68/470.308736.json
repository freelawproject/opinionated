She further contends that she demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution of similarly situated individuals in Ethiopia. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii) (2008). We have reviewed the administrative record and uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 176 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Matter of </em>Y-B-, 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998); <em>Matter of S-M-J- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 724-26 (BIA 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We further deny Ejigu\u2019s motion to remand and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
