The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>imposed concurrent sentences of 240 months of imprisonment on each count, to be followed by concurrent periods of 10 years of supervised release on the drug counts and 3 years on the illegal-reentry count. Gonzalez-Briso appeals, and his counsel has moved to withdraw. In a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel argues that the district court erred in denying Gonzalez-Briso\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on juror misconduct and in denying his motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. Gonzalez-Briso has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">We find that the denial of GonzalezBriso\u2019s mistrial motion, which was based on remarks made by a prospective juror to other members of the jury pool, was not an abuse of discretion. The district court questioned the prospective jurors immediately after learning of the incident, and nothing in the record indicates that any juror was prejudiced by the remarks. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>272 F.3d 1069, 1079 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1029, 122 S.Ct. 1638, 152 L.Ed.2d 642 (2002); <em>United States v. Rowley, </em>975 F.2d 1357, 1363 (8th Cir.1992). We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of a new trial, as the proffered new evidence was merely impeaching and not likely to lead to an acquittal. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>279 F.3d 600, 610 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Zuazo, </em>243 F.3d 428, 431 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Further, having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 88, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-23\">.
