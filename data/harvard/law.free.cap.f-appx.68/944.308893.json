Mr. Thompson moved to suppress evidence obtained when law enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>ment agents searched his home for a third party fugitive. After evidentiary hearings and oral argument, the district court granted the motion. On appeal, the government challenges this ruling. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8731 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Federal Bureau of Investigation agents received information from a county sheriff\u2019s deputy that Ronald Baldwin, a fugitive, was presently at a Salt Lake City home. The agents confirmed Mr. Baldwin had outstanding arrest warrants for violating parole supervision. Their review of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s criminal history revealed drug offenses, parole violations, and assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Two agents went to the house to gather more information. While surveilling the house, they observed Mr. Baldwin exit the garage, walk to the curb, and then re-enter the house. The agents also saw a man, later identified as Mr. Thompson, leave the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Having confirmed Mr. Baldwin\u2019s presence at the home, eight to ten agents set up a perimeter around the property to execute the arrest warrant and prevent Mr. Baldwin from escaping. Shortly after their arrival, they apprehended a man as he tried to flee the house. The man told the agents several people were still inside and provided a phone number to the house. The agents made a number of phone calls to the home requesting that everyone inside exit with their hands up. Several people came out of the house, but Mr. Baldwin remained inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">At some point during the stand-off, Mr. Thompson returned to the house. He angrily informed the agents the house was his and asked what was happening. Mr. Thompson indicated Mr. Baldwin was inside the home. He also said there was a loaded .357 handgun in the vest of a jacket in the closet and a single shot .22 caliber pistol in a large, unlocked gun safe. Mr. Thompson assisted the agents in diagraming the layout of the house, indicating the location of the weapons and potential hiding places large enough for a person. The agents did not obtain Mr. Thompson\u2019s permission to search the house, nor did they get a search warrant for the house. At this point, none of the agents knew Mr. Thompson was a felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">About two hours after setting up the perimeter, the agents called a special weapons and tactics team. The agents called the team because Mr. Baldwin had a dangerous criminal history, had access to firearms, and was barricaded inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Using the information Mr. Thompson provided, the special weapons and tactics team entered the house. In the basement, they observed the large gun safe Mr. Thompson described. The safe door was ajar. The agents opened it further and observed firearms in the safe. The team eventually found Mr. Baldwin in the basement, hiding in a pile of laundry.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">The agents took Mr. Baldwin into custody, then re-entered the house. They seized four firearms, including the guns in the safe and the gun Mr. Thompson described as being in a vest pocket. They also seized ammunition and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">Based on the firearms found in the house, a grand jury indicted Mr. Thompson on four counts of possessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Each count involved a separate firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">Mr. Thompson filed a motion to suppress the firearms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After briefing by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>parties and evidentiary hearings, the district court granted Mr. Thompson\u2019s motion. In pertinent part, the court held the plain view doctrine, allowing a limited warrantless seizure, did not apply because the incriminating character of the firearms was not immediately apparent to the agents. The court also held no exigent circumstances justified the agents\u2019 second entry into the house and seizure of the firearms after Mr. Baldwin was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The government appeals the district court\u2019s suppression of the firearms, arguing the search and seizure were permissible under the plain view doctrine because the criminal \u00f1atee of the firearms was readily apparent. Alternatively, the government claims the agents could seize the firearms during their protective sweep of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">\u201cOn appeal of a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, here [Mr. Thompson].\u201d <em>United States v. De la Cruz-Tapia, </em>162 F.3d 1275, 1277 (10th Cir.1998). \u201c \u2018A finding of fact is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d if it is without factual support in the record or if [we], after reviewing all the evidence, [are] left with a definite and firm conviction\u2019 \u201d the district court erred. <em>Manning v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 808, 812 (10th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Cowles v. Dow Keith Oil &amp; Gas, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 508, 511 (10th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 816, 107 S.Ct. 74, 93 L.Ed.2d 30 (1986)). We review legal questions, such as \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment[,] ... de novo, considering the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>195 F.3d 1183, 1186 (10th Cir.1999). <em>See also United States v. Holt, </em>264 F.3d 1215, 1228 (10th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Plain View Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">The government argues the agents did not violate the Fourth Amendment in seizing the firearms. It believes the agents properly seized the firearms under the plain view doctrine because the criminal nature of the firearms was readily apparent. It claims the record shows \u201c[o]fficers could reasonably infer that [Mr.] Baldwin knowingly had access to and joint and constructive possession of the firearms.\u201d Thus, the government believes the district court should not have suppressed the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">In ruling on the motion to suppress, the district court rejected the government\u2019s plain view theory of this case. The court found \u201cno evidence that [Mr.] Baldwin ever possessed any of the [firearms].\u201d Thus, the court concluded there \u201cwas no basis to find that the incriminating character of the guns ... was immediately apparent.\u201d After reviewing the record, we conclude it supports the district court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be [free from] unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. \u201cIt is a \u2018basic principle of Fourth Amendment law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (citing <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 474-75, 477-78, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971)). Agents may, however, seize evidence without a warrant if it is in \u201cplain view.\u201d <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 465, 91 S.Ct. 2022. An object is in plain view if: (1) \u201cthe officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>which the evidence could be plainly viewed\u201d; (2) the item\u2019s \u201cincriminating character [was] immediately apparent\u201d; and (3) the officer had \u201ca lawful right of access to the object itself.\u201d <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 136-37, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990). In this instance, we need not address all three factors of the plain view analysis because we conclude the criminal nature of the firearms was not immediately apparent. <em>See id. </em>(holding all three conditions must be present to justify a warrantless seizure under the plain view doctrine).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">\u201cAn item\u2019s incriminating nature is immediately apparent if the officer had probable cause to believe the object was contraband or evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Castorena-Jaime, </em>285 F.3d 916, 924 (10th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cA seizing officer need not know or have an unduly high degree of certainty as to the incriminatory character of the evidence under the plain view doctrine. All that is required is a practical, nontechnical probability that incriminating evidence is involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The government argues the agents had probable cause to believe Mr. Baldwin, as a known felon and fugitive, constructively possessed the firearms. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and (2) (prohibiting a felon or fugitive from possessing firearms). In this case, it is clear Mr. Baldwin was a known felon and fugitive. Thus, the question is whether the agents could reasonably believe Mr. Baldwin constructively possessed the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">A person has constructive possession of a firearm if he \u201cknowingly holds the power to exercise dominion or control over the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Heckard, </em>238 F.3d 1222, 1228 (10th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Mills, </em>29 F.3d 545, 549 (10th Cir.1994)). \u201c[W]here there is evidence of joint occupancy [of the area where agents found a weapon], the Government must offer \u2018evidence supporting at least a plausible inference that the [person] had knowledge of and access to the weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hien Van Tieu, </em>279 F.3d 917, 922 (10th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Heckard, </em>238 F.3d at 1228).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Here, the government argues the agents \u201ccould reasonably infer\u201d Mr. Baldwin had knowledge of and access to the firearms. With respect to Mr. Baldwin\u2019s access to the firearms, one agent testified Mr. Thompson said Mr. Baldwin had access to the firearms. Based, in part, on this testimony, the district court concluded Mr. Baldwin had access to the firearms in the house. On appeal, Mr. Thompson does not dispute this factual finding. Access alone, however, is not enough to establish constructive possession. <em>See Mills, </em>29 F.3d at 550. We must ask whether there is \u201cevidence to support an inference that [Mr. Baldwin] was aware of the firearms contained in the [house].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government directs us to several facts it claims support the inference Mr. Baldwin had knowledge of the firearms. We address each of these facts in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">First, the government points to one agent\u2019s testimony stating he \u201creceived information ... the fugitive knew that there was a firearm inside the house.\u201d However, this agent was positioned on the south and west sides of the house and did not directly speak with Mr. Thompson, who had informed the agents about the firearms in the house. Instead, he received the information about the firearms from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>another officer at the scene via radio or cellular telephone. In addition to this agent\u2019s testimony, the district court heard from the agent who interviewed Mr. Thompson. The interviewing agent testified Mr. Thompson told him Mr. Baldwin had access to the firearms, but he did not mention whether Mr. Thompson told him Mr. Baldwin knew about the firearms. Similarly, another agent who witnessed Mr. Thompson\u2019s interview did not include anything about Mr. Baldwin\u2019s supposed knowledge of weapons in his summary of the conversation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Presented with the testimony of these two other agents with more direct information, we cannot conclude the district court erred in discounting the testimony of the agent whose only source of information was another officer. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>18 F.3d 874, 876 (10th Cir.1994) (emphasizing \u201cthe credibility of the witnesses and the weight given to the evidence ... are matters for the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The government also claims the fact Mr. Baldwin was living in the house suggests he had knowledge of the firearms. However, the district court determined \u201cit was not reasonable for law enforcement officers to believe that [Mr.] Baldwin was a resident of the home.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government urges us to overturn the district court\u2019s corresponding finding that \u201c[n]o evidence was offered that demonstrates [Mr.] Baldwin was a resident of the home.\u201d In furtherance of its argument, the government points to testimony stating Mr. Thompson told one agent Mr. Baldwin \u201cwas living there.\u201d The government also argues the agents could infer Mr. Baldwin resided in the house from the fact \u201clocal authorities indicated that [Mr.] Baldwin [was] at the house,\u201d and from the fact Mr. Baldwin \u201cremained in the house for several hours [while Mr.] Thompson ... was absent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion it was not reasonable for agents to believe Mr. Baldwin lived at the house. For example, when asked if he had \u201cany real information beforehand as to who the owner [was] or who was living [at the house],\u201d an agent answered, \u201c[n]o, we didn\u2019t. We just had information that Ronald Baldwin was at that address.\u201d Similarly, when asked if he was \u201cable to verify who actually resided in the home,\u201d another agent testified he received information verifying Mr. Thompson was residing at the home, but notably did not mention having information about Mr. Baldwin residing there. Yet another agent testified the agents knew Mr. Baldwin was \u201cat the residence,\u201d making no reference to him residing there. In addition, the fact several other individuals exited the home in response to the agents\u2019 requests casts doubt on the government\u2019s contention it was reasonable to infer Mr. Baldwin lived at the residence from his presence there. In light of these facts, we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s conclusion it was not reasonable for the agents to believe Mr. Baldwin lived at the house. Thus, the district court did not err in rejecting Mr. Baldwin\u2019s alleged residency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>as evidence he had knowledge of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Finally, we are not persuaded by the government\u2019s argument Mr. Baldwin had knowledge of the firearms because he was found in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to them. When a felon is found in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to a firearm there is sufficient evidence to establish the felon knew about the weapon and constructively possessed it. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>932 F.2d at 868, 881 (10th Cir.) (upholding a felon in possession of a firearm conviction when agents found a rifle within eight feet of the defendant), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 962, 112 S.Ct. 428, 116 L.Ed.2d 448 and 502 U.S. 972, 112 S.Ct. 450, 116 L.Ed.2d 467 (1991). Here, however, the record does not show agents found Mr. Baldwin in close proximity to the weapons. Rather the testimony establishes the agents found Mr. Baldwin in a <em>room </em>\u201cin close proximity\u201d to the <em>room </em>containing the safe. Our search of the record did not reveal any evidence Mr. Baldwin ever occupied the room containing the safe. Further, an agent testified when they found the safe, it was \u201cclosed to the extent that you could not see what was inside of it.\u201d This makes it unlikely Mr. Baldwin would have known about the weapons simply from his presence in the laundry room. Lastly, we note the district court was in a far better position to judge Mr. Baldwin\u2019s proximity to the firearms than we are now. It reviewed evidence not before us, including a diagram of the house showing where agents found both Mr. Baldwin and the firearms. Presented with this evidence, the district court nevertheless concluded there was no evidence Mr. Baldwin possessed the firearms. On these facts, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the district court. <em>See Fernandez, </em>18 F.3d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">After carefully reviewing the record and considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson, we are not left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction,\u201d <em>Manning, </em>146 F.3d at 812 (citation omitted), the district court erred in finding there was no evidence Mr. Baldwin possessed the firearms. Consequently, the criminal nature of the firearms was not readily apparent. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision the plain view doctrine did not justify the agents\u2019 seizure of the firearms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Protective Sweep</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">The government next argues the agents could properly seize the firearms in the course of a protective sweep while executing Mr. Baldwin\u2019s arrest warrant because the firearms posed a security risk to the agents. It argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-11\">It is a logical, reasonable and even nec\u2022essary extension of the protective sweep doctrine that where firearms are discovered in a residence during the execution of an arrest warrant, and while a simultaneous protective sweep of the house for officer safety is also underway, officers can lawfully seize any weapons and remove them from the residence for officer safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">The government also contends \u201c[i]f ... the officers could have properly seized the weapons prior to locating [Mr.] Baldwin, or at the same time they arrested him and brought him out of the residence[,] ... there should be no constitutional barrier to the officers prudently performing the two operations in rapid succession.\u201d We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>\u201cA \u2018protective sweep\u2019 is a quick and limited search of premises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety of police officers or others.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 825, 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). To conduct a protective sweep, \u201cthere must be articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093. \u201cThe sweep lasts no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger and in any event no longer than it takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335-36, 110 S.Ct. 1093. We note \u201c[officers of the law are not given free reign to conduct sweep searches on the pretense that a dangerous situation might be imminent.\u201d <em>United States v. Tabor, </em>722 F.2d 596, 598 (10th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">After considering the record in light of the applicable law, we conclude the agents were not conducting a protective sweep when they seized the firearms. Assuming the agents could legitimately conduct a protective sweep of the house while apprehending Mr. Baldwin, that sweep should have ended once the agents had the opportunity to \u201ccomplete the arrest and depart the premises.\u201d <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. at 336, 110 S.Ct. 1093. Yet the record reflects the agents re-entered the house to seize the weapons after they arrested Mr. Baldwin, removed him from the home, and took him to an adult detention center. Consequently, it is clear the agents\u2019 seizure of the weapons was not part of the protective sweep conducted during the execution of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The government nevertheless claims agents may continue a protective sweep after the arrest if the agents reasonably believe the sweep will lessen the danger. In support of this argument, the government cites two Tenth Circuit cases: <em>United States v. Flores, </em>149 F.3d 1272 (10th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1092, 119 S.Ct. 849, 142 L.Ed.2d 703 (1999), and <em>United States v. Tisdale, </em>921 F.2d 1095 (10th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 986, 112 S.Ct. 596, 116 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991). We conclude <em>Flores </em>and <em>Tisdale </em>do not control the outcome of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Flores is not helpful because Mr. Flores \u201c[did] not contest the propriety of the protective sweep.\u201d <em>Flores, </em>149 F.3d at 1278. Consequently, the <em>Flores </em>court did not decide whether the sweep was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\"><em>Tisdale </em>is similarly unpersuasive. In <em>Tisdale, </em>officers executing an arrest warrant conducted a protective sweep in a house after they \u201csaw the defendant flee out the window and heard three gunshots.\u201d <em>Tisdale, </em>921 F.2d at 1097. On appeal, the defendant argued \u201cno reasonable person could perceive danger after watching him flee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held a protective sweep was not unreasonable because \u201c[g]iven defendant\u2019s actions and background it was not unreasonable for [the officers] to believe that other dangerous people might be present or that defendant would return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case before us, the agents had no reason to believe other dangerous people were in the house. People who exited the house prior to Mr. Baldwin\u2019s arrest told agents \u201ceverybody [was] out of the house but [Mr.] Baldwin.\u201d The special weapons and tactics team then entered the house to arrest Mr. Baldwin. In looking for Mr. Baldwin, they conducted an exhaustive search of the house, but did not find anyone other than Mr. Baldwin. They arrested Mr. Baldwin and removed him from the premises. At this time, there was no reason to believe any other dangerous people were inside the home. Hence, <em>Tisdale </em>does not support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>agents\u2019 seizure of the firearms in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">In sum, we conclude any protective sweep incident to Mr. Baldwin\u2019s arrest, on these facts, could not extend beyond the time the agents took Mr. Baldwin to the adult detention center. Because we conclude the agents were not justified in conducting a protective sweep at the time they seized the firearms, we need not reach the question of whether agents may properly seize firearms during a protective sweep absent application of the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s suppression of the firearms as evidence against Mr. Thompson.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b974-26\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-10\">. Although Mr. Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress sought to exclude \"the evidence obtained at [the home],\u201d the district court later clarified the motion only concerned the guns. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Likewise, this appeal and our decision only concern the admissibility of the firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\">. The government also argues the agents met the first factor necessary for a plain vew seizure because they properly entered the house. Since we are able to reject the plain view argument solely on the basis the criminal nature of the firearms was not readily apparent, we offer no opinion as to whether the initial entry was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b978-5\">. In its reply brief, the government urges us to find constructive possession based on \"[Mr.] Thompson's statement that [Mr.] Baldwin knew about the firearms and had access to them.\u201d As explained above, our own review of the record reveals no evidence Mr. Thompson ever told agents Mr. Baldwin knew about the firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b978-9\">. The government briefed, and the district court considered, the issue of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s residence in the context of whether the government\u2019s initial entry to the house was permissible. Although our disposition of this case does not require us to address whether the initial entry was permissible, the government referred to Mr. Baldwin\u2019s residence in its constructive possession argument, and we therefore consider it now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">. The government also argues \"the officers could immediately re-enter the residence to seize firearms which had just been observed in plain view without obtaining a search warrant.\u201d We need not address this argument because, as previously discussed, the firearms were not in plain view when the agents entered the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b981-16\">. The government also cites <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>941 F.2d 133 (2d Cir.1991), and <em>United States v. Caraza, </em>843 F.2d 432 (11th Cir. 1988). These cases are inapplicable because, like <em>Flores, </em>they involve factual situations where the officers had reason to believe other people in the house were a thr\u00e9at to officer safety. <em>See Hernandez, </em>941 F.2d at 135, 137 (upholding protective sweep search under a mattress when officer intended to place handcuffed woman on the bed); <em>Caraza, </em>843 F.2d at 436 (upholding protective sweep when officer \"could not be certain whether others were in the house who might ... pose a threat to the officers\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
