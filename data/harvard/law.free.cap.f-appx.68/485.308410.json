He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court dismissed his petition on March 10, 2003. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Hood\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
