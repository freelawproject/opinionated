We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258, and we deny Willis\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. Willis is entitled to neither statutory nor equitable tolling. By the time Willis filed his petition in state court, the statute of limitations had already expired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, although the district court delayed its dismissal, it did not make it impossible for Willis to file a timely petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Willis had over two weeks after he received notice of the dismissal before the statute of limitations expired. However, Willis chose to wait nearly three months before he petitioned the California Supreme Court. By then, the statute of limitations had run. Accordingly, Willis is not entitled to tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Willis\u2019s second petition does not \u201crelate back\u201d to his first petition either. Willis\u2019s initial petition was not a mixed petition: it raised only one unexhausted claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the district court correctly dismissed Willis\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b61-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\">. <em>Duncan v.
