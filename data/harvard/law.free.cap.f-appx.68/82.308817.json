Appellants do not argue with the district court\u2019s decision to abstain under <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman, </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), in light of pending related state litigation. But as appellants argue, and appellees concede, the district court erred by dismissing the complaint rather than staying appellants\u2019 federal claims pending resolution of the state litigation. <em>Almodovar v. Reiner, </em>832 F.2d 1138, 1141 (9th Cir.1987) <em>(Pullman </em>abstention requires retention of jurisdiction; dismissal of complaint is reversible error); <em>Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau v. City of Los Angeles, </em>997 F.2d 620, 622 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cA district court abstaining under <em>Pullman </em>must dismiss the state law claim and stay its proceedings on the constitutional question until a state court resolves the state issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction is VACATED. The case is REMANDED with instructions that the district court stay the federal claims pending resolution of the state litigation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b112-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
