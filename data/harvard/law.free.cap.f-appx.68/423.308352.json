For the reasons stated below, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to the Board to remand the case to an ALJ for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">Raymond Chambers (Chambers) worked for at least twenty years as a coal miner. For approximately forty years of his life, Chambers smoked one pack of unfiltered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>cigarettes per day. He died in August 1996 and, according to his death certificate, the cause of his death was cardiopulmonary arrest/failure due to massive myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmia.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On October 5, 1998, Chambers\u2019 widow, Beverly Chambers (Mrs. Chambers), filed a claim for black lung survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) denied the claim on March 10, 1999 because the evidence did not establish that Chambers\u2019 death was due to pneumoconiosis. Mrs. Chambers appealed the denial and the case was referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) on July 21,1999. The case was remanded to the District Director on September 30,1999 to determine the proper responsible operator and insurance carrier. The District Director named Old Hickory Coal Company (Old Hickory) and the West Virginia Coal Workers\u2019 Pneumoconiosis Fund as the responsible operator and insurance carrier, respectively. The case was then referred to the OALJ for a hearing, which was conducted by an ALJ on October 18, 2000. On June 13, 2001, the ALJ issued his decision denying Mrs. Chambers\u2019 claim for black lung survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On the issue of whether Chambers had pneumoconiosis, the ALJ first considered the autopsy and biopsy evidence. In the autopsy report prepared by Dr. Raul Gagueas (Dr. Gagueas), Dr. Gagueas diagnosed Chambers with bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia, moderate coal-workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, diffuse moderate emphysema, and pleural adhesions. Dr. Gagueas opined that coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis could have caused a mild pulmonary deficit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Dr. Bobby Caldwell (Dr. Caldwell), a board-certified pathologist, performed a biopsy on Chambers\u2019 lung on March 11, 1996 and diagnosed Chambers as having squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium and left lower lobe brushing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Dr. Echols Hansbarger (Dr. Hansbarger), a board-certified pathologist, and Dr. Francis Green (Dr. Green), another board-certified pathologist, reviewed both the autopsy and biopsy evidence contained in the record. In his July 31, 2000 report, Dr. Hansbarger diagnosed Chambers as having: (1) bilateral organizing pneumoniabronchiolitis obliterans; (2) bullous centrilobular emphysema of the lung; (3) mild focal anthracotic pigmentation of the lung; and (4) anthracitic pigmentation of the bronchial lymph nodes. Dr. Hansbarger opined that Chambers did not have coal-workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis or any other occupationally-acquired coal dust-related disease. He also opined that: (1) Chambers died from atherosclerotic coronary heart disease; and (2) pneumoconiosis could not have contributed to Chambers\u2019 death or hastened his death. In his August 24, 2000 report, Dr. Green opined that Chambers had mild, simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. Dr. Green also opined that: (1) Chambers\u2019 death was more likely to have resulted from a respiratory condition; and (2) Chambers\u2019 pneumoconiosis significantly contributed to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The conflicting reports of several physicians were also placed before the ALJ. Dr. Robert CrisaUi (Dr. Crisalli), a board-certified pulmonologist, examined Chambers on March 11, 1996 and issued a report in which he diagnosed Chambers as having diffuse hyperemia and edema. Dr. Scott Miller (Dr. Miller) wrote two letters in which he assessed Chambers\u2019 condition. In the first letter, dated March 15, 1996, Dr. Miller diagnosed Chambers as having atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with angina, valvular heart disease, lung lesions, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the second letter, dated June 26, 1996, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Miller diagnosed Chambers as suffering from severe arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease and severe COPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Dr. Robert Atkins (Dr. Atkins), Chambers\u2019 treating physician, submitted several treatment records at the request of the DOL. With respect to the period of July 2, 1992 through July 23, 1996, Dr. Atkins assessed Chambers as having pneumonia, congestive heart failure, bronchitis, ischemic heart disease, COPD, and pneumoconiosis. With respect to the period of June 30, 1988 through July 23, 1996, Dr. Atkins concluded that Chambers was suffering from COPD and mild pneumoconiosis. In a letter dated May 5, 1999, Dr. Atkins stated that Chambers died due to multiple causes including cardiac failure and that pneumoconiosis was a contributing cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Dr. Mohamed Ranavaya (Dr. Ranavaya), who is a B-reader and is board certified in internal medicine, completed a medical consultant case review on March 9, 1999 in which he concluded that Chambers suffered from pneumoconiosis. Dr. Ranavaya also concluded that: (1) Chambers was not totally disabled by pneumoconiosis prior to his death; (2) Chambers\u2019 death was not due to pneumoconiosis; (3) pneumoconiosis was not a substantial contributing cause leading to Chambers\u2019 death; (4) Chambers\u2019 death was not caused by complications of pneumoconiosis; and (5) Chambers did not have complicated pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In his decision, the ALJ found that the autopsy and biopsy evidence was in equipoise and therefore Mrs. Chambers failed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the autopsy and biopsy evidence. The ALJ further found that Mrs. Chambers established the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the medical opinion evidence. Opining that the autopsy and biopsy evidence considered together was more \u201creliable\u201d than the medical opinion evidence, the ALJ denied Mrs. Chambers\u2019 claim for black lung survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Chambers appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Board, which, in a 2-1 decision, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Mrs. Chambers filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">To receive black lung benefits as a surviving spouse of a miner, the surviving spouse must prove: (1) the miner had pneumoconiosis; (2) the miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment; and (3) the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The surviving spouse has the burden of establishing these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States Steel Mining Co., Inc. v. Director, OWCP, </em>187 F.3d 384, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">We review an order of the Board \u201cundertakfing] an independent review of the record\u201d to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1193 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla\u201d; it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>S.Ct. 206, 88 L.Ed. 126 (1938). We review the legal conclusions of the Board and the ALJ <em>de novo. Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Act\u2019s regulations provide four ways in which a miner or surviving spouse can establish that the miner had pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(l)-(4). In relevant part, the regulations provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATrI\">(a) A finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis may be made as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">(1) A chest X-ray conducted and classified in accordance with \u00a7 718.102 may form the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">(2) A biopsy or autopsy conducted and reported in compliance with \u00a7 718.106 may be the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">(3) If the presumptions described in \u00a7\u00a7 718.304, 718.305 or \u00a7 718.306 are applicable, it shall be presumed that the miner is or was suffering from pneumoconiosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">(4) A determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis may also be made if a physician, exercising sound medical judgment, notwithstanding a negative X-ray, finds that the miner suffers or suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(l)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">In <em>Island Creek Coal Company v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2000), we were presented with the issue of whether ALJs could consider evidence adduced under each of the four subsections of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a) in the disjunctive. We rejected the Board\u2019s argument that, if the evidence relevant to one subsection supported a finding of pneumoconiosis, other evidence bearing on a different subsection could be ignored. Instead, we decided that the proper method is to weigh the different types of evidence together to determine whether a preponderance of all of the evidence establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis. <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 208-09; <em>id. </em>at 208 (concluding that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b) requires the weighing of all relevant evidence together \u201crather than merely within discrete subsections of \u00a7 718.202(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">In this case, the ALJ arguably weighed the different types of evidence as required by <em>Compton. </em>The ALJ said that he weighed the autopsy and biopsy evidence against the medical opinion evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After weighing this evidence, the ALJ concluded that the autopsy and biopsy evidence considered together was more persuasive on the question of whether Chambers had pneumoconiosis. We find the manner in which the ALJ weighed the evidence under <em>Compton </em>flawed in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">First, in <em>Compton, </em>we recognized that evidence showing that a miner does not have medical pneumoconiosis is not dispositive of whether a miner has established a black lung claim; rather, evidence showing that a miner does not have medical pneumoconiosis must be weighed together with the evidence establishing legal pneumoconiosis in determining whether the miner has established a black lung claim. <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 210 (\u201cEvidence that does not establish medical pneumoconiosis ... should not necessarily be treated as evidence weighing <em>against </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>finding of legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 210-11 n. 8 &amp; 9. Such an approach makes eminent sense because there is a difference between the medical definition and the broader legal definition of pneumoconiosis. <em>Compare id. </em>at 210 (\u201cMedical pneumoconiosis is a particular disease generally characterized as certain opacities appearing on a chest x-ray.... Clinically, pneumoconiosis may be described in simple terms as a chronic lung disease marked by an overgrowth of connective tissue caused by the inhalation of certain dusts.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) <em>with id. </em>(\u201c[L]egal definition of pneumoconiosis [includes] any chronic pulmonary disease resulting in respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In this case, the ALJ did not specify whether the medical opinion evidence established medical or legal pneumoconiosis. The need for AL Js to make this distinction is critical to a proper weighing of the evidence under <em>Compton. Id. </em>at 210 &amp; n. 8. Indeed, at least two of the physicians (Drs. Atkins and Miller) found COPD, an ailment covered under the legal definition of pneumoconiosis but not under its medical definition. Considering that only one other physician (Dr. Ranavaya) supported the ALJ\u2019s 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) finding, it is likely that the ALJ found the existence of legal pneumoconiosis. In our view, a finding of legal pneumoconiosis under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) is supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the final analysis, however, the basis for the ALJ\u2019s 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) finding is simply beside the point. Because the ALJ never explained why the autopsy and biopsy evidence, which related to the existence of medical pneumoconiosis, was more persuasive than the medical opinion evidence establishing legal pneumoconiosis, it cannot be said that the ALJ weighed all of the evidence together as <em>Compton </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Second, as noted above, the ALJ found that Mrs. Chambers established the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the medical opinion evidence under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). In view of this finding, which obviously tipped the scales in favor of a finding that Chambers had pneumoconiosis, as a matter of simple logic, it was error for the ALJ to conclude that the autopsy and biopsy evidence, which was in equipoise, tipped the scales in favor of a finding that Chambers did not have pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Because the manner in which the ALJ weighed the evidence under <em>Compton </em>was flawed, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision and remand the case with instructions to the Board to remand the case to an ALJ for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. The ALJ also found that Chambers did not have pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment and that Chambers\u2019 death was not due to pneumoconiosis. These findings were premised on the finding that Chambers did not have pneumoconiosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-13\">. The parties agree that the Part 718 regulations apply to Mrs. Chambers' claim for black lung survivor's benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-12\">. The presumptions described in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(3) do not apply to Chambers, thus, they are not relevant to this appeal. In addition, there was chest x-ray evidence in the record, which the ALJ declined to consider. The Board found the ALJ\u2019s decision to decline to consider the chest x-ray to be error, but nevertheless harmless error because the chest x-ray evidence did not establish the existence of pneumoconiosis under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(1). Because the ALJ did not use the chest x-ray evidence when he conducted the requisite weighing under <em>Compton, </em>we cannot consider the chest x-ray evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\">. For this reason, we reject Old Hickory\u2019s argument that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ's 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
