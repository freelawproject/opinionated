Apfel, </em>147 F.3d 139, 141 (2d Cir.1998), the SSA, operating within a \u201ccomplex regulatory framework,\u201d provides SSI benefits to disabled individuals who meet statutory income and resource limitations. In Hecht\u2019s case, the SSA decided that funds in his irrevocable SNT account did not constitute a \u201cresource\u201d that rendered him ineligible for SSI benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1201(a) (1994) (noting that cash, liquid assets, or property qualifies as a \u201cresource\u201d for purposes of calculating benefits if the individual both owns the property and has the right to convert it to cash to be used for his support and maintenance); <em>see also </em>SSA Programs Operations Manual System (\u201cPOMS\u201d) SI 01120.200(D)(2) (noting that trust principal is not a resource if beneficiary lacks legal authority to revoke the trust or direct the use of its assets to his own support). Conversely, the SSA decided that disbursements from that same trust to reimburse Hecht\u2019s parents for his room and board did qualify as \u201cincome,\u201d thereby warranting a reduction in his benefits, <em>see </em>POMS SI 01120.200(E)(1) (noting that disbursements from a trust paid directly to the beneficiary or to a third-party in return for the beneficiary\u2019s receipt of food, clothing, or shelter qualify as income).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>In reviewing a district court decision upholding an SSI benefits determination, \u201cwe conduct a plenary review of the administrative record to determine if there is substantial evidence, considering the record as a whole, to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision and if the correct legal standards have been applied.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Schaal v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 500-01 (2d Cir.1998)). On this appeal, Hecht raises no evidentiary challenges; rather, he asserts that the district court failed to apply the correct legal standards to his case. Upon review of the district court\u2019s thoughtful memorandum and order, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">First, the district court did not err in declining to apply 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1130(b) (1998) or <em>Jackson v. Schweiker, </em>683 F.2d 1076 (7th Cir.1982), to Hecht\u2019s case. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1130(b) is a regulation concerned with income in the form of a rent subsidy, i.e., the difference between what an SSI applicant actually pays for rooming expenses and fair market value. In <em>Jackson, </em>where the SSI recipient was paying 77% of his income for rent, the Seventh Circuit questioned the propriety of treating any rent subsidy as \u201cincome\u201d absent evidence that it actually made \u201cadditional resources available to the recipient (increased purchasing power) to meet his or her basic needs.\u201d 683 F.2d at 1087. <em>See Ruppert v. Bowen, </em>871 F.2d 1172, 1180 (2d Cir.1989) (relying on <em>Jackson </em>in noting that rent subsidy might appropriately be disregarded as in-kind income where person paid disproportionate share of income for housing). In this case, however, as the district court correctly observed, Hecht does not himself pay any rent. Rather, it is the SNT trustee who, pursuant to court order, pays Hecht\u2019s parents for his room and board. When a third party pays a recipient\u2019s expenses, the applicable regulation is 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1103(g) (1994), which provides for \u201cthe value of anything the recipient receives as a result of such payment [to be] included in the recipient\u2019s income.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Apfel, </em>147 F.3d at 141. Thus, a third party\u2019s payment of some amount for room and board provides Hecht with in-kind income pursuant to \u00a7 416.1103(g). Because we conclude that both the district court and the SSA correctly rejected Hecht\u2019s argument that the SSA should rely exclusively on <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>rent subsidy analysis in determining his receipt of in-kind income, we further conclude that the district court properly declined to review alleged geographic disparities in the SSA\u2019s treatment of rent subsidies or to remand the case for further evidentiary exploration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Second, the district court did not err in relying on the POMS in upholding the SSA\u2019s benefits determination. Hecht is correct that such policy statements are not entitled to the same <em>Chevron </em>deference as implementing regulations. <em>See Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587-88, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (discussing <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). Nevertheless, policy statements are \u201centitled to respect\u201d to the extent that they have the \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655 (quoting <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)); <em>see also McMenemy v. City of Rochester, </em>241 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir.2001) (upholding statutory interpretation in agency manual that was consistent with language and purpose of the law, noting that \u201ceven when deference is not required, an agency has a \u2018body of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161)). The distinction POMS SI 01120.200 draws between trust principal and disbursements is persuasive both because it is consistent with the treatment of in-kind income in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1103(g) as well as with New York State trust law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law \u00a7 7-1.12(b)(3) (McKinney 2002) (\u201cactual distributions from the trust may be considered to be income or resources of the beneficiary to the extent provided by the terms of any [government benefits] program\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Third, to the extent Hecht complains that the SSA\u2019s failure to provide him with adequate notice of the regulations relied on in its benefits determination denied him due process, the claim merits little discussion given that the Appeals Council set forth the basis for the SSA\u2019s final determination. Further, for the reasons stated by the district court and in this order, Hecht\u2019s legal challenges to the SSA\u2019s application of relevant regulations is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Finally, Hecht submits that the state court order authorizing trust disbursements was specifically crafted to avoid any reduction in his SSI benefits and that the district court\u2019s contrary ruling runs afoul of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>abstention doctrine. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). Pursuant to <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>\u201ca party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing party\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. DeGrandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994). The doctrine is inapplicable. SSA did not lose in the state courts; it was not even a party to the state court proceedings. And the state court, whatever may have been its intentions, had no authority over the effect of its ruling on SSI benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">. The fund's principal consists of a $500,000 award that Hecht received in 1988 to settle a malpractice suit relating to his disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-16\">. An SSI recipient is awarded a flat monthly benefit, which can then be reduced if he receives non-excludable \"income.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(b). \"Income\u201d is defined \u201cas anything that a recipient receives in cash or in-kind that can be used to meet the recipient\u2019s needs for food, clothing and shelter. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1102.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Apfel, </em>147 F.3d at 141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. <em>Navarro v. Sullivan, </em>751 F.Supp. 349 (E.D.N.Y.1990), upon which Hecht relies, is not to the contrary. At issue in <em>Navarro </em>was whether trust funds constituted a \"resource\u201d under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1201, thereby rendering plaintiff ineligible for SSI benefits. The district court did not abstain from considering that issue; rather, it ruled that use restrictions imposed on the trust funds by the state court deprived plaintiff of the power to liquidate the assets for his support and maintenance, which power was critical to the federal definition of \"resource.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. In this case, where the issue is whether trust disbursements constitute \u201cincome,\u201d the state court may not have intended for room and board payments to reduce Hecht\u2019s SSI benefits, but such third-party payments fall squarely within the definition of in-kind income pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1003(g) and POMS SI 01120.200(E)(1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
