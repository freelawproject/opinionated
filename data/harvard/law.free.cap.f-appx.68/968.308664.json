Manchak opposes and moves for \u201crelief from order of May 16, 2003, and request for relief from page/word limitations.\u201d U.S. Ecology replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-33\">On May 16, 2003, we denied U.S. Ecology\u2019s motion to dismiss Manchak\u2019s appeal due to Manchak\u2019s failure to file an opening brief and directed Manchak to file his brief on May 23, 2003. Manchak stated that his brief was completed and timely served but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>for some reason was not received by U.S. Ecology or the court. However, following our May 16 order, no brief was filed. On May 29, 2003, U.S. Ecology renewed its motion to dismiss. In response, Manchak states that he attempted but was unable to rewrite his brief by May 23, even though the court\u2019s order did not require that the brief be rewritten, but merely refiled. In any event, Manchak does not adequately explain why he did not move for an extension of time before the court-imposed due date.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">(1) U.S. Ecology\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">(2) Manchak\u2019s motions are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
