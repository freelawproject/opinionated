Schering states that McNeil recently withdrew NDA 21-339 from consideration by the FDA, rendering Schering\u2019s action against McNeil moot. Schering states that it \u201cwas not involved in McNeil\u2019s withdrawal decision and had no input regarding its occurrence or timing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-22\">Because the case has become moot through no voluntary action by Schering, it is appropriate to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United States v. Munsingwear, </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950). <em>See also U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994). However, we note that the district court judgment in appeals 03-1026, -1029 remains and that the appeals of that judgment are going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b997-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b997-25\">(1) Schering\u2019s motion to dismiss 03-1028 is denied.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-26\">(2) Schering\u2019s motion to vacate the district court\u2019s September 19, 2002 judgment in district court docket no. 01-6175 is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-27\">(3) Schering\u2019s motion to remand in 03-1028 is granted. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey is directed to dismiss as moot Schering\u2019s claims and McNeil\u2019s defenses and counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-28\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs in 03-1028.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b997-20\"> The court cannot both dismiss and remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
