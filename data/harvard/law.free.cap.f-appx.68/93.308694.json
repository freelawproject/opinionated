We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Steckman v. Hart Brewing, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Inc., </em>143 F.3d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir.1998), and we review for abuse of discretion a dismissal for failure to comply with a court order, <em>Henry v. Gill Indus., Inc., </em>983 F.2d 943, 949 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Spittal\u2019s claims for -failure to comply with a court order because the district court warned Spittal of the consequence of failing to respond to defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion and gave Spittal two opportunities to respond. <em>See Brydges v. Lewis, </em>18 F.3d 651, 652 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (affirming grant of unopposed motion for summary judgment where plaintiff had previously been warned of consequence of failure to respond).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Contrary to Spittal\u2019s contentions, the magistrate judge has authority to make findings and recommendations pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 and local rules because the magistrate judge\u2019s findings are subject to the district court\u2019s de novo review and the district court\u2019s ultimate decision. <em>See Bhan v. NME Hosp., Inc., </em>929 F.2d 1404, 1414 (9th Cir.1991) (finding constitutional the referral practices of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 and Local Rule 304(a) for the Eastern District of California).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The magistrate judge properly denied Spittal\u2019s recusal motion because it was based on the magistrate judge\u2019s adverse decisions. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 549-51, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Spittal\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b123-30\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
