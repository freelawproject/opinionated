Appellants argue that there is a \u201cmaximum premium,\u201d above which they are not obligated to pay. We agree with appellees that, despite the presence of the phrase \u201cmaximum premium\u201d in the documents, appellants did not purchase the protection of a \u201cmaximum\u201d that cannot be exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-25\">The insurance policy at issue, and all renewals thereof, contained an Endorsement entitled \u201cRetrospective Premium Endorsement,\u201d which set forth the method which certain retrospective premiums payable by Sperry to National Union are to be calculated. It is this Endorsement about which United Insurance and Unisys disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Unisys argues that the phrase \u201cmaximum premium\u201d in the Endorsement fixes a cap on the calculation of the premiums on an aggregate basis. United Insurance contends that the Endorsement did not provide Unisys with such a protection, and asserts that under the terms of the Endorsement, \u201cmaximum premium\u201d increases as losses are incurred and paid under the policy. Although the plain language of the insurance policy is confusing as to precisely what \u201cmaximum premium\u201d means, we find that there is no cap on Unisys\u2019 liability for retrospective premiums because Unisys did not pay for this cap protection. At oral argument, we pressed counsel for Unisys to show where the protection was acquired, but counsel could not cite any record evidence of such a purchase. We also considered a 1979 written analysis by Sperry\u2019s insurance experts of the various insurance programs they were evaluating, which renders appellant\u2019s argument merit-less. This memorandum states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Another possibility which must be considered is a period of abnormally high loss frequency resulting in an accumulation of losses under $500,000 each which in the aggregate significantly exceed the estimated standard premium. Under the current Liberty Mutual rating plan, retrospective earned premium cannot exceed 150% of standard premium, regardless of loss experience. Under the basic ARM proposal, aggregate stop loss protection is not provided for and an abnormal run of losses would have to be funded by [Sperry].... We can purchase aggregate stop loss protection from [National Union] in the amount of $5,000,000 excess of $13,500,000 (150% of standard premium) for an additional premium of $285,000 but we recommend against this inasmuch as loss payments are stretched out over a 10 year period and, in any event, our past history does not indicate that the purchase of this coverage is necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">App. 415. Clearly, the Sperry insurance analysts were aware that, had Sperry wanted \u201cstop loss\u201d protection, they could have paid for it. The record shows that the protection that Unisys claims they have was in fact never purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In sum, and for the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s granting of summary judgment, which declared that the retrospective premium endorsements to the policy at issue do not cap Unisys\u2019 liability for retrospective premiums.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
