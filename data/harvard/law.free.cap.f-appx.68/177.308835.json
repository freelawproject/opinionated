R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">Petitioner seeks review of a final order of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA affirmed the decision of an immigration judge (IJ) holding that petitioner was removable from the United States based on her convictions of certain criminal offenses. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the agency\u2019s final determination. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(iii) (2002); <em>see also Panrit v. INS, </em>19 F.3d 544, 545-46 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">The removal proceedings considered three charges against petitioner, a native and citizen of Ghana, who became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. The charges were for (1) conviction of an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) (which the IJ found did not support grounds for removal); (2) conviction of a crime of moral turpitude committed within five years of admission and for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed in violation of \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (i) (I); and (3) conviction of two crimes involving moral turpitude in violation of \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (ii). The two moral turpitude convictions in question were a 1992 misdemeanor offense of obtaining merchandise through false pretenses and a 1998 conviction for caretaker abuse or neglect in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21 \u00a7 843.1(A)(1) (1999) (subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>amended). The parties are in agreement that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the removal orders if petitioner was convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude not arising from the same incident. The parties further do not dispute that the 1992 conviction was for an offense involving moral turpitude. Thus the issue is whether petitioner\u2019s 1998 conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We review de novo the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions and his factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>See Hadjimehdigholi v. INS, </em>49 F.3d 642, 647 (10th Cir.1995). We also review de novo questions concerning the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>See Tapia Garcia v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1216, 1220 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The IJ determined that the record was unclear as to whether petitioner\u2019s 1998 conviction was for caretaker abuse or caretaker neglect under Okla. Stat. tit. 21 \u00a7 843.1. He determined, however, that a conviction for either offense would constitute a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Oklahoma courts have defined moral turpitude broadly as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cany conduct contrary to justice, honesty and good morals. Moral turpitude implies something immoral in itself regardless of whether it is punishable by law. The doing of the act itself, and not its prohibition by statute, determines the moral turpitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\"><em>Andrews v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 57, </em>12 P.3d 491, 495 (Okla.Civ.Ct.App.2000) (quoting <em>Kelley v. City of Tulsa, </em>569 P.2d 455, 457 (Okla.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Similarly, we have defined moral turpitude as \u201c \u2018conduct which is inherently base, vile, or depraved, contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between man and man, either one\u2019s fellow man or society in general.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wittgenstein v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 1244, 1245 (10th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>In re Flores, </em>17 I &amp; N Dec. 225, 227, 1980 WL 121870 (1980)). Oklahoma\u2019s caretaker abuse/neglect statute \u201cclearly proscribes the infliction of abuse <em>or </em>neglect on vulnerable adults by their caretakers.\u201d <em>State v. Thomason, </em>33 P.3d 930, 933 (Okla.Crim.App.2001) (emphasis added). Thus even if the 1998 conviction was for the neglect of a vulnerable person within petitioner\u2019s care, her failure to protect her charge constitutes the breach of a moral duty owed the person being eared for.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the IJ noted, \u201c[t]he victim in this particular case is a retarded and blind 23-year old woman who [petitioner] had undertaken responsibility to provide for and protect,\u201d making her negligent abuse of that responsibility a turpitudinous offense. R. 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">We conclude that the determination that petitioner\u2019s 1998 conviction involved a crime of moral turpitude was reasonable. Moreover, we must \u201crespect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress has delegated the responsibility for administering the statutory program.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 448, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>see also Tapia Garcia, </em>237 F.3d at 1220-21 (where statute arguably subject to different interpretations, we defer to BIA\u2019s interpretation as long as it is reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction, and the petition for review is DISMISSED. Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-15\">. We further note that part of petitioner\u2019s sentence involved her referral to a \"moral recognition therapy program.\u201d R. at 133.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
