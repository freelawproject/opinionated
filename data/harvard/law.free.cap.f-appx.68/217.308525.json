We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of the petition. <em>Pratt v. Greiner, </em>306 F.3d 1190, 1196 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On September 5, 1985, following a jury trial, Townes was found guilty of Murder in the Second Degree and Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Third Degree, in violation of New York penal law. Townes was subsequently sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment from twenty years to life. Townes appealed his conviction, which was affirmed, <em>see People v. Townes, </em>151 A.D.2d 1055, 544 N.Y.S.2d 406 (1st Dep\u2019t 1989), and his motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals was denied on December 7, 1989, <em>see People v. Townes, </em>75 N.Y.2d 777, 551 N.Y.S.2d 919, 551 N.E.2d 120 (1989). Townes moved to vacate his sentence under N.Y.C.P.L. \u00a7 440.10 on September 10, 1993. The state court denied this motion on April 29, 1994; leave to appeal was denied by the Appellate Division on December 8, 1994. Townes filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus <em>pro se </em>in the Southern District of New York on April 8, 1996. Although Townes\u2019s federal habeas petition presented the same arguments raised in his \u00a7 440.10 motion, he subsequently requested that the petition be dismissed without prejudice to allow him to exhaust an additional claim in state court. The petition was dismissed without prejudice on June 16, 1998. The magistrate judge expressly advised Townes of the one year statute of limitations provided by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) and indicated that his \u201conly avenue for habeas corpus relief may be [as a second or successive petition under] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Townes never pursued the additional claims in state court. Instead, on June 6, 1999, he filed the petition giving rise to this appeal, raising the claim presented in the first petition and three additional grounds for relief. The district court dismissed the petition as untimely, reasoning that under <em>Ross v. Artuz, </em>150 F.3d 97 (2d Cir.1998), the AEDPA allowed Townes until April 24, 1997 to file a habeas petition. Because the first petition had been filed on April 8, 1997, Townes only had sixteen days remaining before the statute of limitations expired within which to refile his petition. The district court found that the time between the dismissal of the first petition on June 16, 1998, and the filing of the second petition on June 6, 1999, could not be tolled, and dismissed the petition as untimely. On appeal, Townes argues, citing <em>Zarvela v. Artuz, </em>254 F.3d 374 (2d Cir.2001), that the district court should have stayed the first petition instead of dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The State argues that <em>Zarvela </em>does not apply because Townes\u2019s first petition was not a mixed petition. Although the Certificate of Appealability was granted on the issue whether the dismissal of the first petition was proper in light of <em>Zarvela, </em>we do not reach the question of whether <em>Zarvela </em>applies to dismissals of petitions containing only exhausted claims because we find that petitioner\u2019s failure to use reasonable diligence in bringing his new unexhausted claim to state court or in promptly returning to federal court leaves him ineligible for Zarvela\u2019s rule even if it applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Unlike the petitioner in <em>Zarvela, </em>Townes never returned to state court to exhaust his claim. Instead, he waited 355 days to re-file his habeas petition in federal court. While he argues that the time following dismissal of the initial petition should be equitably tolled because he was held in keeplock during this period, we conclude that even if keeplock, a form of administrative segregation, constitutes an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that otherwise would permit equitable tolling, <em>cf. Hizbullahankhamon v. Walker, </em>255 F.3d 65, 75 (2d Cir.2001), Townes waited at least three months after he was released from keep-lock before re-filing the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Townes also argues that he lacked two affidavits he needed to pursue his claims in state court, he obtained one of the affidavits on September 10, 1998, and has not offered any explanation as to why he was unable to pursue his claims without the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Accordingly, because we find that Townes failed to act with reasonable diligence during the time he seeks to have tolled, we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the re-filed petition was untimely.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. The actual amount of time spent by Townes in keeplock is unclear from this record. For purposes of this appeal, we assume that petitioner\u2019s second keeplock sanction, imposed June 11, 1998, ended on March 10, 1999 because it was deferred for three months.
