We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We grant habeas relief only if the state court decision (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ...; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The state appellate court found that even if Zamaro\u2019s attorney erred in failing to object to all of Detective Aguirre\u2019s testimony, there was ample additional evidence of Zamaro\u2019s guilt. The court concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent counsel\u2019s alleged error. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 406, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Zamaro has not demonstrated that the decision, which applied clearly established federal law, was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts given the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b897-39\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
