Saye, III, appeals his fifteen month sentence pursuant to his guilty plea to counterfeiting money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000). On appeal, Saye asserts the district court erred by increasing his offense level by six points pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A), (b)(3) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-22\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, this Court reviews factual determinations for clear error and legal questions de novo; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under a standard that gives due deference to the district court. <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003 (4th Cir.1996). Applying these standards, we conclude Saye\u2019s claim is meritless. The district court considered proper factors in determining Saye\u2019s sentence should be enhanced under USSG \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A), (b)(3), and it therefore did not err by increasing his offense level by six points. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 76 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Saye\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
