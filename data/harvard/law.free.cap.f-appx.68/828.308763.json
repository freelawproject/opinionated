We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">Wallace first contends that his 25-years-to-life sentence violates the equal protection clause. The district court correctly determined that because Wallace does not demonstrate that others similarly situated were systematically treated better than he, Wallace fails to establish a prima facie case of uneven application of California\u2019s three-strikes law. <em>See McQueary v. Blodgett, </em>924 F.2d 829, 835 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-21\">Wallace\u2019s next contention that his sentence of 25-years-to-life is grossly disproportionate in violation of the Eighth Amendment is foreclosed by <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172-75, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that state court\u2019s affirmance of two consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences for petty theft was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law), and <em>Ewing v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1185-90, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (holding that a 25-years-to-life sentence under the California three-strikes law did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment). The district court therefore properly denied Wallace\u2019s petition. <em>Andrade, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b858-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
