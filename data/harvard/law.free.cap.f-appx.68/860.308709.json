We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny summary judgment <em>de novo. Zeltser v. City of Oakland, </em>325 F.3d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir.2003). Under California law, Creative Paperclay has the burden of establishing that the counterclaim in this case comes within the scope of the policy provided by Sentry Insurance. <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 16, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619 (1995). Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, they are not recited here except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Handcraft\u2019s counterclaim in the underlying suit does not allege an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d covered by the insurance policy. The counterclaim does not allege a claim for trademark infringement or common law misappropriation, which is covered by the insurance policy. Rather, the counterclaim merely seeks to have Creative Paperclay\u2019s trademark declared generic and the trademark registration declared invalid and unenforceable. Furthermore, the insurance policy states that coverage applies to advertising injuries \u201ccaused by an offense committed in the course of advertising [Creative Paperclay\u2019s] goods, products, or services.\u201d Handcraft\u2019s counterclaim relates to Creative Paperclay\u2019s <em>registration </em>of the trademark, not to Creative Paper-day\u2019s use of the mark in its advertising activities. As the district court correctly held, Handcraft\u2019s counterclaim does not state a misappropriation claim, nor has Creative Paperclay made a showing that Handcraft could state such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">In the alternative, as the district court held, coverage in this case is excluded by the \u201cfirst publication\u201d provision. The parties do not dispute that Creative Paperclay registered and used the \u201cPaperclay\u201d trademark before the inception of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b890-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
