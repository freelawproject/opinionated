We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\">Quintero contends that the district court failed to rule on one of his suggested grounds for downward departure: over-representation of criminal history. This contention is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-22\">The district court, after entertaining extensive argument about Quintero\u2019s two proposed grounds for departure, found the applicable guideline range to be appropriate and imposed a mid-range sentence. The record shows no confusion on anyone\u2019s part about whether Quintero\u2019s departure requests had been denied. <em>See United States v. Rigby, </em>876 F.2d 392, 394 (9th Cir.1989) (rejecting asserted need for more express findings at sentencing, where defendant had a \u201cfull opportunity to request a more definitive ruling and did not do so\u201d). We cannot review the merits of this unambiguous, discretionary denial of a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>108 F.3d 1156, 1158 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (9th Cir.1997) (concluding that district court had exercised its discretion when it denied a departure with the statement, \u201clooking at your record, you\u2019ve been kind of a problem all along, and it\u2019s time to put a halt to it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-23\">Quintero also seeks to preserve the claim that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). As he acknowledges, this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 415 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b82-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
