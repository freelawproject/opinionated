We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">A district court\u2019s order precluding testimony is an evidentiary ruling subject to review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ravel, </em>930 F.2d 721, 726 (9th Cir.1991). The district court did not abuse its discretion in restricting co-defendant Zadeh from testifying that Henry did not know about the drugs because Zadeh could not establish the requisite personal knowledge. Fed.R.Evid. 602. The district court also did not abuse its discretion in restricting Zadeh from testifying that the reason he turned himself in was his belief in Henry\u2019s innocence. Zadeh\u2019s belief in Henry\u2019s innocence is irrelevant except to the extent that it is based on Henry\u2019s lack of knowledge about the drugs. As we already noted, however, Zadeh could not testify as to Henry\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The limitations on Zadeh\u2019s testimony did not violate Henry\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. To determine whether the exclusion of evidence violates a defendant\u2019s rights, this court first considers five factors: <em>Whelchel v. Washington, </em>232 F.3d 1197, 1211 (9th Cir.2000). Zadeh\u2019s testimony was not reliable because of his lack of personal knowledge; thus, its probative value also was minimal. <em>Id. </em>While Zadeh\u2019s testimony would have constituted an important part of Henry\u2019s defense, it was not the \u201csole evidence on the issue.\u201d Henry was able to adequately present his defense of ignorance through Zadeh\u2019s permitted testimony that he did not tell Henry about the drugs, that he told the suppliers not to tell Henry about the drugs, and that he did not believe Henry could have detected the drugs. Henry also was allowed to argue in closing that Zadeh came forward because Zadeh believed Henry did not know about the drugs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">(1) the probative value of the excluded evidence on the central issue; (2) its reliability; (3) whether it is capable of evaluation by the trier of fact; (4) whether it is the sole evidence on the issue or merely cumulative; and (5) whether it constitutes a major part of the attempted defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">This Court reviews de novo alleged violations of a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights arising from a prosecutor\u2019s comments on the silence of an accused. <em>United States v. Beckman, </em>298 F.3d 788, 795 (9th Cir.2002). The prosecutor\u2019s statement in closing was not a comment on Henry\u2019s failure to testify; it was a comment on Henry\u2019s and Zadeh\u2019s changing and inconsistent stories. Even if it was a comment on Henry\u2019s silence, it was not \u201cextensive\u201d and no \u201cinference of guilt from silence [was] stressed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Nelson, </em>390 U.S. 523, 524, 88 S.Ct. 1133, 20 L.Ed.2d 81 (1968). Moreover, the single comment was followed by an immediate curative instruction, rendering any error harmless. <em>United States v. Samo, </em>73 F.3d 1470, 1498 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Tarazon, </em>989 F.2d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, there was no violation of Henry\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
