The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Barber to 120 months imprisonment, as mandated by statute and the Sentencing Guidelines, and 3 years supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(1) (whoever uses fire to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in federal court \u201cshall ... be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(a) (Guidelines sentence for defendant convicted under \u00a7 844(h)(1) \u201cis the term of imprisonment required by statute\u201d). On appeal, Barber\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issues whether there was a factual basis at the plea hearing to establish a section 844(h)(1) offense, and whether the statutorily mandated 10-year sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In his pro se supplemental brief, Barber contends that his counsel below was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">The district court had a sufficient factual basis to accept Barber\u2019s guilty plea: his stipulations in his plea agreement, his oral confirmation of those stipulations at the plea hearing, and the unobjeeted-to facts in the presentence report established that Barber directed and aided a codefendant to set fire to a building Barber owned so he could submit a fraudulent insurance claim, and that he used the mail in furtherance of the scheme. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>105 F.3d 1492, 1503-04 (1st Cir.1997) (defendants \u201cused\u201d fire to commit mail fraud within meaning of \u00a7 844(h)(1) where defendants set fire to clothing store to carry out scheme to deceive insurance company; fire was \u201cthe means\u201d by which defendants created appearance of apparent loss). In addition, Barber\u2019s 10-year sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tence, mandated by both the statute and the Guidelines, does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Farmer, </em>73 F.3d 836, 840 (8th Cir.) (level of punishment imposed for crimes is business of Congress, not courts; only in very narrow circumstances has punishment within statutory limits been held to violate Eighth Amendment; Congress has power to make sentences mandatory and to withdraw all sentencing discretion from courts, except in capital cases), <em>cert. denied, </em>518 U.S. 1028, 116 S.Ct. 2570, 135 L.Ed.2d 1086 (1996); <em>United States v. Foote, </em>920 F.2d 1395, 1401 (8th Cir.1990) (as matter of law, sentences imposed pursuant to Guidelines do not violate Eighth Amendment), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>500 U.S. 946, 111 S.Ct. 2246, 114 L.Ed.2d 487 (1991). Last, Barber\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim is more appropriately raised in collateral proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Upon careful review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no other nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-16\">. The Honorable Mark W.
