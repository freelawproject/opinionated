RApp. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). These cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The parties appeal several decisions the district court made in this diversity action governed by Oklahoma law. This action stems from work-related injuries Charles Southerland suffered in 1984, while he was working for Greenleaf Nursery. The Nursery\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, Granite State Insurance Company, through its claims adjuster, AIG Services, Inc. (collectively, defendants), paid Southerland disability benefits, as well as all related medical expenses, for over fifteen years. Although Southerland had never filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, defendants, during this fifteen-year period, mistakenly indicated in their files that the court had adjudicated Southerland\u2019s disability claim. When, in 1999, defendants realized there had never been a court-ordered compensation award, they stopped paying those benefits. Southerland then filed a claim for compensation with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and eventually reached a court-approved settlement of his disability claim with defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">These appeals stem from Southerland\u2019s Oklahoma tort claims, challenging defendants\u2019 decision to stop paying him disability payments in 1999, after discovering there was no court-ordered compensation award, despite having made those payments for fifteen years without any court order. Southerland alleged that defendants, in stopping these payments, acted in bad faith and intentionally inflicted emotional distress. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting defendants summary judgment on both these tort claims, as well as the district court\u2019s decision dismissing Southerland\u2019s amended complaint asserting these same claims against several additional defendants. In doing so, we review the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision <em>de novo. See Patton v. Denver Post Corp., </em>326 F.3d 1148, 1151 (10th Cir.2003). Defendants will be entitled to summary judgment only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">At the time defendants stopped paying Southerland disability benefits, the Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had not yet entered any award. Although the Oklahoma Supreme Court has \u201cexplicitly rejected the viability of a bad faith claim against a workers compensation insurer for [such] <em>pre-award </em>conduct,\u201d <em>Fehring v. State Insurance Fund, </em>19 P.3d 276, 284 n. 21 (Okla.2001) (emphasis added), the district court held that defendants, in this case, should be equitably estopped from asserting that Southerland\u2019s bad-faith claim was barred by the lack of a court-ordered compensation award, because defendants had already paid those benefits for fifteen years without any court order. In appeal Nos. 02-7085 and 02-7098, defendants challenge the district court\u2019s applying equitable estoppel under these circumstances. Southerland counters that this court, in a prior appeal, conclusively held that equitable estoppel does apply in this situation. We need not address these arguments, however, because even if defendants are equitably estopped from asserting that the lack of a court-ordered award precludes Southerland\u2019s bad-faith claim, the district court still appropriately awarded defendants summary judgment on the merits of that claim. Southerland appeals that summary-judgment determination in both appeal Nos. 02-7081 and 02-7093.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Oklahoma Supreme \u201cCourt has not unequivocally sanctioned the viability of a tort suit against a workers\u2019 compensation insurer for ... bad faith post-award conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284 (addressing bad-faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>claim for failing to pay award in timely manner); <em>see also Kuykendall v. Gulfstream, Aerospace Techs., </em>2002 OK 96, 66 P.3d 374, 376-77 (2002) (\u201cNo Oklahoma case holds that a workers\u2019 compensation insurer has a duty of good faith in paying a workers\u2019 compensation award, the violation of which is a tort.\u201d). However, for purposes of this appeal only, we assume that Oklahoma courts would recognize such a bad-faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">If the Oklahoma Supreme Court were to recognize such a claim, Southerland, to recover, would have to establish that defendants \u201cengaged in intentional, wilful, and malicious conduct.\u201d <em>Fehring, </em>19 P.3d at 284.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Southerland, however, failed to assert any evidence indicating defendants had acted intentionally, maliciously, and wilfully in stopping the disability payments. Rather, uncontroverted evidence indicates that defendants terminated Southerland\u2019s benefits because Oklahoma law did not require them to make those payments without a court order. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting defendants summary judgment on the bad-faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The district court also granted defendants summary judgment on Southerland\u2019s tort claim alleging they had intentionally caused Southerland emotional distress. Under Oklahoma law, this \u201ctort requires evidence of extreme and outrageous conduct coupled with severe emotional distress.\u201d <em>Computer Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Welton, </em>2002 OK 50, 49 P.3d 732, 735 (2002). Further, defendants must have intentionally or recklessly undertaken such extreme and outrageous conduct. <em>See id. </em>Southerland, however, failed to present evidence indicating defendants intentionally or recklessly acted in an extreme and outrageous manner. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting defendants summary judgment on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">In light of those conclusions, we need not address defendants\u2019 arguments challenging several district court discovery orders related to their defenses to these two tort claims. <em>See also </em>Cross-Appellants\u2019 Opening Br. (Nos. 02-7085, 02-7098) at 35, 63 (stating defendants appealed discovery orders <em>if </em>this court reversed district court\u2019s decision granting them summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Finally, the district court had granted Southerland leave to amend his complaint to add as defendants the New Hampshire Insurance Company, New Hampshire Insurance Group Holding Corporation, and American International Group, Inc. (collectively, additional defendants). Southerland asserted the same tort claims against these additional defendants. After granting the original defendants summary judgment, however, the district court dismissed Southerland\u2019s claims against these additional defendants. Southerland challenges that decision in appeal No. 02-7093. The district court, however, did not err in dismissing those claims. In light of that determination, we also need not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>these additional defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, No. 02-7098, challenging the district court\u2019s decision permitting Southerland to amend his complaint to add these additional defendants in the first place. <em>See also id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\">. Southerland argues that, in this case, he need not establish that defendants acted intentionally, wilfully, and maliciously because, unlike in <em>Fehring, </em>here there has been no court-ordered compensation award. We need not address this argument, however, because Southerland never raised it in the district court. <em>See, e.g., Quigley v. Rosenthal, </em>327 F.3d 1044, 1069 (10th Cir.2003). In any event, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has indicated that if it did recognize a bad-faith claim against a workers\u2019 compensation insurer, it would do so only where the insurer's conduct was intentional and wilful because only such conduct would justify permitting a common-law claim in the context of workers' compensation, which is otherwise exclusively governed by Oklahoma\u2019s statutory scheme. <em>See Fehring, </em>19 P.3d at 284-85.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
