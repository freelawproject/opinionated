After Vasquez-Rubio was sentenced to a 70-month prison term, to run consecutively to an undischarged sentence based on the violation of his state parole for a drug conviction, he filed a habeas petition, arguing <em>(inter alia) </em>that the district court was required, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 5G1.3(b), to make the federal and state sentences run concurrently. The petition was granted, but Vasquez-Rubio received the same (consecutive) sentence at his re-sentencing. He argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in failing to impose the concurrent sentence he argued for in his habeas petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 governs whether a defendant, who like Vasquez-Rubio is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment for another offense, should be given a concurrent sentence, a consecutive sentence, or some combination thereof. Subsection (a) requires imposition of a consecutive sentence if the instant offence was committed after sentencing for the other offense; subsection (b) requires imposition of a concurrent sentence if the other offense has been \u201cfully taken into account\u201d in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense; in all other cases, subsection (c) grants discretion to impose a sentence that runs concurrently, partially con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>currently, or consecutively to achieve a reasonable punishment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">This case is controlled by <em>United States v. Garcia-Hernandez, </em>237 F.3d 105 (2d Cir.2000), which Vasquez-Rubio concedes is \u201cprecisely the same as the present case\u201d and which presents an \u201cissue [that] is identical.\u201d In that case, we held that the district court had discretion, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), to impose either a consecutive or a concurrent sentence on a defendant convicted of illegally reentering the United States with an undischarged sentence for a parole violation triggered by the illegal reentry. <em>Id. </em>at 110. We reasoned that the state sentence was not necessarily \u201cfully taken into account\u201d by the defendant\u2019s offense level, so U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) did not apply. <em>See id. </em>Vasquez-Rubio asks us to \u201crevisit\u201d <em>Garcia-Hernandez, </em>but offers no persuasive reason for doing so, and we see none. <em>See Jones v. Coughlin, </em>45 F.3d 677, 679 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201cA decision of a panel of this Court is binding unless and until it is overruled by the Court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Los Santos, </em>283 F.3d 422, 426 (2d Cir.2002) (following Garcia-Hernandez); <em>United States v. Fermin, </em>252 F.3d 102, 108-109 (2d Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\">. The government contends that Vasquez-Ru-bio waived the argument he raises on appeal, since at the resentencing hearing he argued that the district court had discretion to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence. We assume <em>arguendo </em>that the argument presented on appeal was adequately raised by Vasquez Rubio in his habeas petition underlying the resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
