We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-20\">Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. The district court properly denied Untalan\u2019s untimely demand for a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Untalan waived her right to a jury trial when she failed to make her demand within \u201c10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issues.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to grant Untalan a jury trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, where, as here, the district court correctly concluded that it was \u201cmere inadvertence\u201d that explained why Untalan had not made an earlier request, the district court lacked discretion to grant a jury trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, Untalan\u2019s counsel attempted to excuse the delay by saying he had been busy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>settlement negotiations and discovery and that he had been out of town for two weeks. His excuses do not justify the delay. Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly denied Untalan\u2019s untimely request for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment in favor of Kapiolani as to Untalan\u2019s Title VII<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> employment discrimination claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Untalan failed to make out a prima facie case that her employer intentionally discriminated against her because she is Filipino.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She offered no evidence that Kapiolani treated persons of different national origins differently than Kapiolani treated her. Likewise, she offered no evidence that Kapiolani discriminated against other Filipinos either. On the contrary, the record shows that Kapiolani terminated Untalan because she was insubordinate. Therefore, we hold the district court properly granted summary judgment for Untalan\u2019s Title VII discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Untalan also asserted a discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d). Untalan failed to make a prima facie showing that Kapiolani terminated her because of a perceived disability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Untalan originally accepted, but ultimately failed to comply with, her conditional six-month suspension. She provided no evidence that Kapiolani would have refused to take her back had she complied with her conditional suspension. Thus, the record shows that Kapiolani terminated Untalan because she failed to comply with her suspension terms, rather than because it perceived her as disabled. Therefore, we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to Untalan\u2019s ADA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">Untalan\u2019s retaliation claim fails to survive summary judgment as well. She offers no causal link between her union complaints and her termination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, Kapiolani provided uncontroverted evidence that it terminated Untalan because of her misconduct and violent threats. Thus, we hold that summary judgment was proper as to Untalan\u2019s retaliation claim also.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">Untalan\u2019s state law claims fail on the merits. Nothing that happened to Untalan on November 27, 1998 (or thereafter) was unreasonable or outrageous for purposes of the intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d) claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, she does not make any showing of a predicate physical injury as Hawaii law requires for negligent infliction of emotional distress (\u201cNIED\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to Untalan\u2019s IIED and NIED claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Finally, Untalan\u2019s privacy claim cannot survive summary judgment. She stipulated that her claim was based on Article I, Section 6 of the Hawaii constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>However, her claim fails to demonstrate state action, as required for state constitutional claims.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The parties\u2019 requests for attorney fees and costs are denied. For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-11\">.
