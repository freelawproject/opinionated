Morris\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in conducting Morris\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 guilty plea hearing and by departing upward in sentencing her, but stating that, in his view, there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Morris has submitted a pro se supplemental brief challenging the district court\u2019s finding of drug quantity and its upward departure at sentencing. Morris has also moved to substitute counsel. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">Morris contends the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting her guilty plea. Allegations of Rule 11 violations are reviewed for plain error when, as here, there was no objection in the district court. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). We have reviewed Morris\u2019s Rule 11 proceedings and find no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-20\">Morris next contends the district court did not make adequate findings in departing from a Criminal History Category III to a Criminal History Category VI. Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2001), a sentencing court may depart upward from the otherwise applicable guidelines range when the defendant\u2019s criminal history category significantly under-represents her past criminal history or the likelihood that she will commit future crimes. The district court must conduct an incremental level-by-level analysis in determining which criminal history category was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>58 F.3d 115, 118 (4th Cir.1995). We review the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to depart upward from the applicable guideline range for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754, 758 (4th Cir.1996). We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing an upward departure and its stated findings were sufficient to support a departure from Criminal History Category III to Criminal History Category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In her pro se supplemental brief, Morris disputes the district court\u2019s determination of drug weight. Morris contends the district court erred by allowing a federal agent to introduce hearsay testimony regarding Morris\u2019s drug transactions. The district court may consider reliable hearsay testimony at sentencing and hearsay testimony may provide sufficient evidence to support a district court\u2019s finding of drug quantity. <em>See United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1019 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>881 F.2d 95, 106 (4th Cir.1989). While Morris argues the district court erred in determining the drug quantity attributable to her, the district court explicitly found information presented by the Government and the presentence report as to drug quantity credible. Because the district court\u2019s calculation of drug quantity finds support in the record, it was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 300-01 (4th Cir.1998) (stating standard). To the extent Morris attempts to make a claim under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Morris\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum for convictions in which drug quantity was not alleged. Therefore this claim fails. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-202 (4th Cir.2000). Lastly, we find Morris\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Morris\u2019s convictions and sentence. We deny Morris\u2019s motion to substitute counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
