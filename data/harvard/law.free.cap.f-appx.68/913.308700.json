Mr. Smith appeals. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the judgment and sentence of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">Mr. Smith conducted a fairly typical check kiting scheme. He operated two businesses: Cwik Truck Auto Sales, and B &amp; L Auto Auction. Mr. Smith opened a checking account for Cwik Truck at First National Bank in Liberal, Kansas. He also opened a checking account for B &amp; L Auto at Prairie State Bank in Maize, Kansas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Smith was a signatory on both accounts, and his son was a signatory on the B &amp; L Auto account. During the relevant time period, Mr. Smith\u2019s son would write checks payable to Cwik Truck on the B &amp; L Auto account. Mr. Smith would deposit these checks in the Cwik Truck account. Mr. Smith would then write checks payable to B &amp; L Auto on the Cwik Truck account to cover the checks his son wrote on the B <em>&amp; </em>L Auto account. His son would deposit these checks in the B <em>&amp; </em>L Auto account. Mr. Smith did not have money in his accounts to cover the checks. This process of check swapping continued over a period of time. Using the inflated balances in these accounts, Mr. Smith paid his financial obligations to third parties. When the scheme ended, Prairie State Bank lost over $700,000 on the B <em>&amp; </em>L Auto account. First National Bank did not suffer any loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>A jury convicted Mr. Smith of bank fraud for his participation in this check kiting scheme. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. On appeal, Mr. Smith argues (1) the trial court compelled him to testify at trial; (2) the trial court improperly limited his testimony; (3) the testimony of a government witness \u201cimpermissibly invaded the province of the jury\u201d; (4) jury instruction 17 was not consistent with the bank fraud statute; and (5) the trial court did not consider Mr. Smith\u2019s family circumstances which may have justified a downward departure from the relevant sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">I. Compelled Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Mr. Smith first argues a trial court ruling \u201ccompelled [him] to testify in order to present evidence of his intent to defraud in violation of his right against self-incrimination.\u201d Mr. Smith did not object to this ruling. We therefore review it for plain error, applying this standard with \u201c \u2018less rigidity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d to Mr. Smith\u2019s constitutional challenge. <em>United States v. Combs, </em>267 F.3d 1167, 1181 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Lindsay, </em>184 F.3d 1138, 1140 (10th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Prior to trial, Mr. Smith informed the court that he desired to show he did not have \u201cone iota of intention of defrauding anybody\u201d by presenting evidence of past investments and his belief \u201cthat these investments will result in income sufficient to repay any losses incurred by financial institutions.\u201d The government moved in limine to exclude this evidence because it was \u201cirrelevant\u201d and \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the charges in the indictment. The trial court ruled Mr. Smith will \u201cbe able to testify as far as I\u2019m concerned. The defendant can practically testify to anything he wants to.\u201d However, the court also stated that if Mr. Smith tried \u201cto bring [the evidence] in by any other means without his testimony, I would have trouble with relevance.\u201d Mr. Smith now asserts that by so ruling, the trial court forced him \u201cinto a position where he was compelled to testify in order to present his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">It is basic law that \u201c[r]equiring the accused to choose between complete silence and presenting a defense does not violate the accused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>7 F.3d 186, 190-91 (10th Cir.1993). \u201cWhile the Fifth Amendment guarantees the right of the accused not to be compelled to testify, it does not guarantee that the accused will not be placed in a situation where he feels he must testify or risk conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">In the case before us, the record is clear and uncontroverted that Mr. Smith\u2019s counsel represented to the trial court Mr. Smith would testify at trial prior to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the government\u2019s motion in limine. Consequently, we conclude the record does not support Mr. Smith\u2019s assertion he was somehow compelled to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">II. Limited Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Mr. Smith next argues the trial court \u201cviolated [his] right to Due Process and the right to present a defense\u201d by \u201cforcing [him] to testify in order to present evidence of his intent and then limiting [his] testimony regarding his intent.\u201d We review the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>82 F.3d 935, 940 (10th Cir.1996). Even if the trial court abused its discretion, however, we will not reverse where an error constitutional in nature is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">Mr. Smith identifies two separate trial court rulings as limiting his testimony. We have already rejected for lack of record support Mr. Smith\u2019s argument the trial court compelled him to testify. We reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>for the same reason Mr. Smith\u2019s argument the trial court limited his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The first trial court ruling occurred during Mr. Smith\u2019s testimony that he intended to pay the money back to Prairie State Bank. When Mr. Smith\u2019s attorney asked Mr. Smith \u201cwhat was the source of this money from what you were going to pay this back,\u201d the government objected.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmHb\">Government: I\u2019m going to object again, Your Honor, as irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-5\">Defense counsel: Your Honor, specifically if I may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-7\">Defense counsel: It goes directly to his intent if he had intent to pay the money back the source of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-8\">The Court: Well, he can say what he intended to do, but I don\u2019t think it has\u2014 I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to show his intent. He can tell what his intent was. It\u2019s his testimony, but I don\u2019t know that that has anything to do with what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-9\">Defense counsel: So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">The Court: So he \u2014 what he intended as a witness he can testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-11\">Defense counsel: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">As the above excerpt demonstrates, the record does not support Mr. Smith\u2019s argument the trial court limited his testimony. The trial court allowed Mr. Smith to testify of his intent, including the source of the income he planned to use to cover the checks he wrote. For example, Mr. Smith testified he knew there were insufficient funds in his account to cover the checks, but he \u201chad some investments that people owe me, and they promised to pay, and I was supposed to get money anyway.\u201d He testified about these investments and then-value. Mr. Smith testified he informed bank officials about these investments. He also introduced (and the court admitted) an exhibit that detailed his conversation with a bank officer about these investments. And, finally, his wife corroborated his testimony by testifying Mr. Smith received numerous telephone calls from people associated with his investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">The second trial court ruling Mr. Smith contests occurred during his testimony that he informed a bank official of his intent to repay the money. When Mr. Smith\u2019s attorney asked Mr. Smith to estimate \u201cthe value of any investment or stream of income that was supposed to cover these checks,\u201d the government again objected.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-15\">Government: Objection, Your Honor, immaterial and irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-16\">Defense counsel: Again, Your Honor, I say it goes to his intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-17\">Government: It\u2019s speculation, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-18\">The Court: Well-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJAJ\">Defense counsel: If I may, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-19\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-20\">Defense counsel: This is the very same question that [the government] asked [of a witness] ... yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-21\">Government: Your Honor, I asked about in that case [sic] [the witness] could actually see in the records. I didn\u2019t ask him to speculate about income of the business or what might happen in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-22\">Defense counsel: That\u2019s true. I still think it goes to his intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-23\">The Court: Well, he can testify as to assets that he had if they were listed in a financial statement or anything like that where he was \u2014 I\u2019ll let him testify about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-24\">Defense counsel: I think the judge has almost asked a question. If not I\u2019ll ask it. Did you ever list these assets in a financial statement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-25\">Mr. Smith then testified about the assets he had listed in a financial statement and their value. He never indicated there were other assets about which he wished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>to testify. He made no offer of proof and did not introduce any exhibits that were refused. In addition, he did not call any witnesses affiliated with his investments to testify about these investments. Once again, we conclude the record simply does not support Mr. Smith\u2019s argument the trial court limited his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">III. Testimony of Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Mr. Smith next argues a government witness\u2019s \u201ccharacterization of \u2018check kiting as a systematic scheme to defraud\u2019 impermissibly invaded the province of the jury by concluding that because Mr. Smith had check kited, he had the requisite intent to defraud.\u201d Mr. Smith also argues the witness\u2019s testimony violates Rule 704 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. We review this issue under the plain error standard discussed above because Mr. Smith did not object to the witness\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>See Combs, </em>267 F.3d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Mr. Smith\u2019s arguments rest upon the following excerpted testimony of a government witness \u2014 a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with extensive experience on check kiting matters. The prosecution asked the following question, without objection by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As5U\">Prosecutor: Would you please explain to the jury and the Court what you mean by check kiting or check swapping?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWO2\">Witness: Yes. Check kiting is a systematic scheme to defraud where nonsufficient funds checks are cross deposited between or traded between two or more checking accounts, and this is done to artificially inflate the account balances, and this is accomplished through the flow time in the banking system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-8\">Once account balances are artificially inflated, checks that would normally be returned for nonsufficient funds are, in fact, paid or honored by the issuing banks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">The witness did not testify that \u201cMr. Smith had check kited.\u201d Nor did he testify Mr. Smith \u201chad the requisite intent to defraud.\u201d These issues were clearly left for the trier of fact alone. Merely characterizing \u201ccheck kiting\u201d as a scheme to defraud does not impermissibly invade the province of the jury or violate Fed.R.Evid. 704. As with Mr. Smith\u2019s previous arguments, we conclude his objections to this witness\u2019s testimony lack record support.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">IV. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Mr. Smith also argues \u201cthe inclusion of the word \u2018defraud\u2019 in two of the elements of the offense listed in [jury] instruction 17 does not correctly reflect the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(1).\u201d He claims this error violates his \u201cright to Due Process under the Fifth Amendment and right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Once again, Mr. Smith failed to raise this issue at trial, and we therefore review it under the plain error standard previously discussed. <em>See Combs, </em>267 F.3d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">As discussed above, the government filed an indictment charging Mr. Smith with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. The jury instruction discussing this charge reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-13\">Count 1 charges defendant Duane Smith with a violation of Section 1344(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code. That section provides in part that, \u201cWhoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution\u201d shall be guilty of an offense against the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-14\">Before the defendant may be found guilty of [this] offense ..., the government must prove the following essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASe\"><em>First: </em>That the defendant Duane Smith knowingly executed or attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution as alleged in Count 1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-4\"><em>Second: </em>That the defendant did so with intent to defraud; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\"><em>Third: </em>That the financial institution was then insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Mr. Smith believes this jury instruction blurs \u201cthe line between establishing that a scheme existed and establishing that the accused had the intent to defraud.\u201d We disagree. This instruction correctly identifies the elements of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(1) violation as we defined them in <em>United States v. Hill, </em>197 F.3d 436, 444 (10th Cir.1999). We see no error in the instruction as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Y. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Finally, Mr. Smith argues the trial court \u201cfailed to consider the extraordinary family circumstances which may have justified a downward departure.\u201d He believes the trial court should have departed downward so he could care for his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">We cannot review, however, the sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 887 (10th Cir.1998). We lack jurisdiction. <em>Id. See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Mr. Smith nonetheless argues we may review the court\u2019s refusal in this case because the court \u201cunambiguously concluded that it had no legal authority to [depart downward].\u201d Although we may review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart downward when its refusal is based on an erroneous and unambiguous statement it does not have the authority to depart, <em>see United States v. Miranda-Ramirez, </em>309 F.3d 1255, 1258-59 (10th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1380, 155 L.Ed.2d 217 (2003), this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">At the sentencing hearing, the court heard testimony from Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith\u2019s daughter about Mr. Smith\u2019s family circumstances. The court then stated: \u201cThe Court will do what it has to do under the law. Thank you very much for your help.\u201d Mr. Smith believes this is an \u201cunambiguous\u201d statement reflecting the sentencing court\u2019s conclusion it did not have the ability to depart. We disagree. This statement does not indicate the court believed it lacked the legal authority to depart \u201cfor the entire class of circumstances proffered by the defendant.\u201d <em>Castillo, </em>140 F.3d at 887. Even assuming the statement is ambiguous as to this issue, we still must treat it \u201c \u2018as though the judge was aware of his or her legal authority to depart but chose instead, in an exercise of discretion, not to depart.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miranda-Ramirez, </em>309 F.3d at 1258-59 (quoting <em>United States v. Fortier, </em>180 F.3d 1217, 1231 (10th Cir.1999)). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s refusal to depart downward in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">For the reasons discussed above, we AFFIRM the judgment and sentence of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b944-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-18\">.
