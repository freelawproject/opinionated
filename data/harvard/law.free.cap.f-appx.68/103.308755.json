Lay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b134-12\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Petitioner Johnnie Sanders, Jr., appeals from a district court decision affirming an administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ) decision that Sanders is not \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">The ALJ erred by rejecting examining psychologist John Robinson\u2019s opinions that Sanders suffers from intellectual and psychological problems. The ALJ\u2019s reasons were neither \u201cclear and convincing\u201d nor \u201cspecific and legitimate,\u201d <em>Edlund v. Massanari, </em>258 F.3d 1152, 1158-59 (9th Cir. 2001), nor were the ALJ\u2019s reasons based on substantial evidence on the record as a whole, <em>see Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1043 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">Sanders\u2019s alleged lack of credibility was not a valid basis for rejecting Dr. Robinson\u2019s opinion. <em>See Edlund, </em>253 F.3d at 1159 (holding that an <em>ALJ </em>could not rely on a claimant\u2019s lack of overall credibility to reject the entirety of a psychologist\u2019s report, including portions that the psychologist deemed reliable). Dr. Robinson\u2019s opinion about Sanders\u2019s intellectual problems was based almost entirely on the objective tests Dr. Robinson administered, not on Sanders\u2019s subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">That Sanders\u2019s drank \u201ca few beers one or two times a week\u201d at home was not a valid reason for the ALJ to reject Dr. Robinson\u2019s opinions. <em>See id. </em>(holding that an ALJ may not reject an examining psychologist\u2019s test results as distorted by the claimant\u2019s alleged substance abuse when the psychologist never suggested that such distortion existed). The ALJ could not legitimately conclude, on this record, that Sanders\u2019s occasional moderate drinking at home resulted in the extreme intellectual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and psychological problems Dr. Robinson reported.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Robinson\u2019s opinions must be credited as a matter of law. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The ALJ erred by disregarding the opinions of examining physician Sherri Barrett, M.D., that Sanders (1) may have difficulty with prolonged sitting and (2) may sometimes be unable to stand or walk throughout a day. The ALJ offered no \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons based on substantial evidence for disregarding Dr. Barrett\u2019s opinions, <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 833, so they must be credited as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The ALJ improperly rejected Sanders\u2019s testimony about his limitations for reasons that were not \u201cclear and convincing\u201d and not based on substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>We reject each of the grounds set forth by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\"><em>First, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s testimony that he was severely limited on the ground that Sanders had worked in prison. Sanders\u2019s prison janitor job required him to work only forty-five minutes per day; his prison van driver job required him to work only a few minutes per hour. This activity level is not inconsistent with Sanders\u2019s claimed limitations, so it has no bearing on his credibility. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\"><em>Second, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s pain complaints on the ground that they were not fully corroborated by objective medical findings. <em>See Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1407 (9th Cir.1986) (superseded by statute on unrelated grounds). On this record, Sanders\u2019s pain had to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\"><em>Third, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s testimony that he found multiplication and division a \u201clittle tougher\u201d than addition and subtraction. That Sanders could recite \u201chis serial 3s and 7s\u201d does not substantially impugn his testimony that multiplication and division were more difficult for him than addition and subtraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\"><em>Fourth, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s testimony that he had trouble reading on the ground that his testimony contradicted itself. Sanders merely explained his method of reading, and he never contradicted himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\"><em>Fifth, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s testimony that he has memory problems. That Sanders remembers <em>some </em>important things (such as his social security number, his criminal history, his prison time in California, his past work, and his childhood) does not mean he can remember <em>all </em>things normally.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\"><em>Sixth, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning his im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>pairments and their impact on his ability to work\u201d because Sanders told the ALJ he last drank alcohol in 1996 but told Dr. Robinson he last drank alcohol in 1997. This discrepancy in dates \u2014 which may have resulted from Sanders\u2019s memory problems rather than a calculated effort at deceit \u2014 was not a clear and convincing reason based on substantial evidence to discredit the entirety of Sanders\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><em>Seventh, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning his impairments and their impact on his ability to work\u201d because Sanders \u201chas a criminal history of robbery and cocaine possession.\u201d That Sanders committed robbery and possessed cocaine does not bear directly on the credibility of his complaints about his physical and mental limitations, <em>see United States v. Glenn, </em>667 F.2d 1269, 1273 (9th Cir.1982), and the ALJ erred by disbelieving Sanders on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Finally, </em>the ALJ improperly disbelieved Sanders\u2019s statements on the ground that Sanders continued to profess his innocence after he pled guilty to burglary. But Sanders\u2019s guilty plea \u2014 an <em>\u201cAlford </em>plea\u201d in which he admitted no guilt \u2014 was not inconsistent with his protestations of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The ALJ improperly rejected Sanders\u2019s testimony as to his limitations, so Sanders\u2019s testimony should be credited as a matter of law. <em>See Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The record was neither so ambiguous nor so inadequate as to impose on the ALJ an independent duty to call a medical expert to testify. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001). The ALJ did not err in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Finally, the ALJ erred by failing to consider adequately whether Sanders\u2019s 72 verbal I.Q., when combined with his psychiatric problems, painful back, and anal warts, \u201cequals\u201d the mental retardation impairment listed at 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05C. <em>See Marcia v. Sullivan, </em>900 F.2d 172, 176 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 512-13 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand to the district court with instructions that it remand to the Commissioner for further evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b134-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">. The Commissioner argues on appeal that Sanders is not entitled to disability benefits because alcoholism or drug addiction would be a \"contributing factor material\u201d to any ALJ determination that Sanders was disabled. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(c). Even assuming the ALJ based her decision on this ground (which is far from certain), <em>Pinto v. Massanari, </em>249 F.3d 840, 847 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e cannot affirm the decision of an agency on a ground that the agency did not invoke in making its decision.\u201d) (citation omitted), we hold that the decision was not based on substantial evidence. The record contains virtually no evidence that Sanders\u2019s extreme psychological and intellectual problems would vanish if he stopped drinking \"a few beers one or two times a week.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1535(b)(1) (providing that alcoholism or drug addiction is not a \"contributing factor material\u201d when the \"individual would still be found disabled if she stopped using alcohol or drugs\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
