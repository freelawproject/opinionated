We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, but we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>286 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir.2002). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous and, based on those findings, (1) Mrs. Tando had authority to consent to the search of Tando\u2019s bedroom; (2) her consent was voluntary for purposes of the Fifth Amendment; and (3) the prior illegal entry into Tando\u2019s room did not taint her subsequent consent for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">1. Authority to Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">Based on its factual findings and the testimony regarding Mrs. Tando\u2019s access to Tando\u2019s bedroom, the district court correctly concluded that Mrs. Tando possessed authority to consent to the search. <em>See Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (defining \u201ccommon authority\u201d as \u201cjoint access or control for most purposes\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Additionally, Mrs. Tando had apparent authority to consent because \u201cthe facts available to the officer[s] at the moment [would] warrant [men] of reasonable caution in the belief that [Mrs. Tando] had authority over the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 110 S.Ct. 2793 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">2. Voluntary Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">The district court \u201cconsidered the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and manner while testifying\u201d and found that Mrs. Tando \u201creadily granted [permission to conduct a search of Tando\u2019s room] without any hesitation,\u201d and without being \u201casked repeatedly.\u201d These factual findings are supported by the testimony of Officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Schlegel and Patriquin, and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The district court also did not clearly err in using those factual findings to conclude that Mrs. Tando voluntarily consented to the search of Tando\u2019s room. <em>See United States v. Furrow, </em>229 F.3d 805, 813 (9th Cir.2000), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by United States v. Johnson, </em>256 F.3d 895 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA district court\u2019s determination of whether a person voluntarily consented to a search depends on a totality of the circumstances and is a question of fact reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d). The district court considered the totality of the circumstances and found that (1) Mrs. Tando was not in custody nor were her movements directed by the officers in any way; (2) the officers did not unholster or brandish their weapons; (3) Miranda warnings were not an issue because Mrs. Tando was not in custody or suspected of wrongdoing; and (4) the officers did not tell Mrs. Tando that a search warrant could be obtained. <em>See Jones, </em>286 F.3d at 1152 (listing factors to consider when evaluating the voluntariness of consent). Although Mrs. Tando was not advised that she could refuse to consent, she testified that she realized if she refused to consent the police would not have been able to search the room and that they would not do anything to her if she did not consent to the search. These factors weigh in favor of the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Tando voluntarily consented to the search of Tando\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">3. Taint</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The district court determined that the initial protective sweep of Tando\u2019s room violated Appellants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights. We conclude that Mrs. Tan-do\u2019s \u201cconsent is sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.\u201d <em>Furrow, </em>229 F.3d at 813 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The district court had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and it chose to credit Officer Sehlegel\u2019s in-court testimony over his declaration and to rely on Mrs. Tando\u2019s in-court testimony. The district court appropriately relied on this testimony to find that Mrs. Tando was unaware of the protective sweep and the discovery of alleged narcotics when she consented to the search of her son\u2019s room. The evidence Tando cites to support his version of the facts is not sufficient to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\u201cLack of knowledge of a prior search is an intervening factor which dissipates the coercion inherent in a request for consent made after an unconstitutional search.\u201d <em>Furrow, </em>229 F.3d at 814. Accordingly, Mrs. Tando was \u201cin the same posture for considering whether to consent to a search as a person not previously subject to an illegal entry,\u201d <em>id., </em>and her consent was not tainted by the illegal protective sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Appellants failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s factual findings or credibility determinations were clearly erroneous. Based on the facts as determined by the district court, we conclude that Mrs. Tando (1) had authority to consent to the search; (2) voluntarily consented; and (3) her consent was not tainted by the prior illegal search. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
