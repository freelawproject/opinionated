R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Appellant\u2019s request for oral argument is denied. In addition, we deny Hunter\u2019s request for appointment of counsel for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Arizona state prisoner James Ray Hunter appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which challenges his convictions for felony murder and robbery. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Hunter contends that the erroneous admission of hearsay testimony regarding the partial license plate number of the car used in the robbery violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. The district court properly denied habeas relief, however, because any error was harmless due to the substantial other evidence identifying Hunter\u2019s car as the one at the scene, as well as the other evidence of Hunter\u2019s guilt. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (holding that in a habeas case, an error is harmless unless it had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Hunter also contends that his appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to argue the hearsay claim persuasively and failed to raise various other issues. However, appellate counsel\u2019s brief adequately discussed the hearsay issue, including any resulting prejudice to Hunter\u2019s defense, and none of the additional issues identified by Hunter would have been meritorious. Thus, Hunter has not shown that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of deficient performance and prejudice); <em>Wildman v. Johnson, </em>261 F.3d 832, 840 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[Ajppellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise issues on direct appeal does not constitute ineffective assistance when appeal would not have provided grounds for reversal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b90-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
