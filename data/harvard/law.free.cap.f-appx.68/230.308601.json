At sentencing the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Shira A. Scheindlin, Judge) determined the drug quantity to be <em>more </em>than 150 kilograms of powder cocaine and one and a half kilograms of crack cocaine, and therefore assigned a based offense level of 38 pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 201.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">On appeal, Grullon argues that the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity was clearly erroneous. For the reasons given below we conclude that the district court\u2019s determination was established by a preponderance of the evidence and was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. McLean, </em>287 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In determining drug quantity, \u201ca court is entitled to consider all transactions engaged in by [a defendant] or by his coconspirators ... if the transactions were either known to him or reasonably foreseeable to him.\u201d <em>United States v. Richards, </em>302 F.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). There was significant evidence presented at trial of transactions of Grullon\u2019s co-conspirators that would support the district court\u2019s finding and that Grullon either knew of or were reasonably foreseeable to him. The district court specifically relied on the testimony of co-conspirator and cooperating witness Christian Velez whom the district court paraphrased as having testified to having \u201csold as much as one and a half kilograms of crack cocaine and half a kilogram of powder cocaine, per day.\u201d The district court also relied on the testimony of co-conspirator and cooperating witness Roberto Brinez who stated that Grullon participated in the conspiracy for one and a half years. The district court determined that, given the time frame and the amount of drugs sold by the conspiracy on a daily basis, the defendant was accountable for 150 kilograms of powder cocaine and more than one and a half kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Grullon argues that the district court misunderstood Velez\u2019s statement to mean that he sold one and a half kilograms of crack cocaine on a daily basis. It is clear from the district court\u2019s paraphrasing of Velez\u2019s testimony that she understood him correctly. Velez\u2019s testimony provides sufficient evidence that the defendant was accountable for over one and a half kilograms over the one and a half years Brinez testified that Grullon participated in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Grullon further argues, without citing any supporting precedent, that the district court was not entitled to credit Velez\u2019s and Brinez\u2019s testimony regarding the drug quantity because she did not credit their testimony regarding Grullon\u2019s alleged leadership role in their drug organization. We are aware of no precedent that so limits the district court\u2019s ability to parse witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Finally, Grullon argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court plainly erred in failing to consider that Grullon\u2019s co-conspirators\u2019 transactions were not foreseeable to him because of his impaired mental condition. The court ordered three different psychiatric eval\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tions of Grullon, two to determine his competence to stand trial, and a third to assess the likelihood that he had played a leadership role in the drug organization. None of these evaluations lends any support to Grullon\u2019s assertion that his co-conspirators\u2019 transactions were not foreseeable to him, and the district court therefore did not err in failing to consider these evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
