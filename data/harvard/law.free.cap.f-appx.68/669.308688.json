Spence did not pursue a direct appeal of his sentence. Spence now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to set aside his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because the record does not show that Spence instructed his counsel to appeal, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>has not established a Sixth Amendment violation. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Donald Spence pleaded guilty to six counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); one count of possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and one count of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). In connection with these crimes, Spence was sentenced to 228 months in prison and a five-year period of supervised release. Spence did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">On November 27, 2000, Spence filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to set aside his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel was ineffective in failing to file an appeal regarding Spence\u2019s conviction and his sentence. The district court concluded that Spence failed to allege that he directed his attorney to file an appeal and that Spence\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not, therefore, violated by his attorney\u2019s failure to file an appeal. On February 8, 2002, we granted Spence a certificate of appealability to determine a single issue: \u201cwhether \u2014 in light of <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), and <em>Ludwig v. United States, </em>162 F.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir.1998)-the district court erred by denying Spence\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion under Section 2255, we apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings and review its conclusions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Hyatt v. United States, </em>207 F.3d 831, 832 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">While Spence raised numerous challenges to his sentence, our inquiry examines only whether the failure of Spence\u2019s attorney to file an appeal violated Spence\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment. The now-familiar <em>Strickland </em>test requires that a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel show (1) that counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an effective standard of reasonableness\u201d and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 476-77; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under this standard, \u201ca lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable,\u201d while a lawyer who does not file an appeal based on a defendant\u2019s explicit instructions to forgo an appeal acts in a professionally reasonable manner. <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 477; <em>see also Ludwig, </em>162 F.3d at 459 (holding that \u201cthe failure to perfect a direct appeal, in derogation of a defendant\u2019s actual request, is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sixth Amendment\u201d). Where the defendant does not explicitly instruct an the attorney either way, an attorney \u201chas a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal ... or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480. If an attorney consults with the defendant, his performance will be professionally unreasonable only if the attorney fails to follow the defendant\u2019s express instructions with respect to an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 478. If the attorney failed to consult with the defendant, we must consider whether the attorney\u2019s failure to advise the defendant constitutes deficient performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Here, the district court concluded that Spence failed to allege that he had instructed his attorney to appeal. While the district court did not expressly consider whether Spence\u2019s attorney discussed the possibility of an appeal with Spence, it is clear from the record that such a consultation occurred. Indeed, Spence repeatedly acknowledges that he and his attorney discussed the possibility of filing an appeal. <em>See </em>J.A. at 17, 22, 28, 40. Given that Spence\u2019s attorney consulted with him regarding the possibility of an appeal, the attorney\u2019s performance may be found professionally unreasonable only if the attorney failed to follow an express instruction from Spence to file an appeal. <em>See Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 478. We agree with the district court that Spence did not allege that he expressly instructed his attorney to file an appeal, and we, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Spence\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As noted earlier, Spence proceeded <em>pro se </em>in this matter. Accordingly, we apply a less stringent standard to his petitions than we would apply to pleadings filed by a lawyer. <em>Franklin v. Rose, </em>765 F.2d 82, 84-85 (6th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972)). The lower standard \u201crequires active interpretation ... to construe a pro se petition \u2018to encompass any allegation stating federal relief;\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>White v. Wyrick, </em>530 F.2d 818, 819 (8th Cir.1976)). This standard, however, has limits and does not require the court to speculate about basic facts that could easily be alleged by the petitioner. <em>See Erwin v. Edwards, </em>No. 01-3387, 2001 WL 1556573, at *1, 22 Fed.Appx. 579 (6th Cir. Dec. 4, 2001) (unpublished); <em>Wells v. Brown, </em>891 F.2d 591, 594 (6th Cir.1989) (\u201cNeither [the Supreme] Court nor other courts ... have been willing to abrogate basic pleading essentials in <em>pro se </em>suits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Despite the relaxed standard applied to <em>pro se </em>petitions, Spence\u2019s motion fails. Nowhere in Spence\u2019s motion or the accompanying memorandum of law does Spence allege that he instructed \u2014 much less expressly instructed \u2014 his attorney to file an appeal. At best, the statements cited by Spence demonstrate only discussions with his attorney regarding the possibility of an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, Spence\u2019s attorney did not act in a professionally unreasonable manner by failing to file an appeal. The conduct of Spence\u2019s attorney cannot, therefore, establish cause to excuse the procedural default of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Spence\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">. We cannot conclude that Spence had to have requested or expressed his desire to appeal from speculation that otherwise Spence\u2019s attorney would have had no reason to consult with Spence about the prospects of a possible appeal. Spence's attorney may well have advised Spence about his appeal without a request because routinely advising clients regarding their appeal rights is good practice. <em>See Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 479. Further, where the attorney has consulted with the defendant, \"the question of deficient performance is easily answered: Counsel performs in a professionally unreasonable manner only by failing to follow the defendant\u2019s <em>express instructions </em>with respect to an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478 (emphasis added). Neither Spence\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion nor the memorandum in support alleges that Spence expressly instructed his attorney to appeal. Rather, the only such claim is stated in Spence\u2019s reply brief on appeal, which comes too late.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b701-11\">CLAY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ludwig v. United States, </em>162 F.3d 456, 459 (6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Cir.1998), Petitioner, Donald D. Spence, has sufficiently demonstrated that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel due to his counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal on Petitioner\u2019s behalf. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s motion brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 should be granted and Petitioner should be allowed to file a delayed appeal. In the alternative, I would remand Petitioner\u2019s case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">A. Background of <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Ludwig v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Inasmuch as this Court granted Petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability as to the single issue of whether \u2014 in light of <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>and <em>Ludwig v. United States </em>\u2014 the district court erred by denying Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, it is necessary to thoroughly examine the holdings of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">To prevail on a motion brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255 alleging a constitutional error, the petitioner must establish an error of constitutional magnitude which had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the proceedings. <em>See Schledwitz v. United States, </em>169 F.3d 1003, 1011 (6th Cir.1999). In this case, Petitioner alleges that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to file an appeal on Petitioner\u2019s behalf despite Petitioner\u2019s request for an appeal. \u201cThe Sixth Amendment entitles a criminal defendant to effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Hunt, </em>235 F.3d 892, 895 (4th Cir. 2000); <em>see also Ludwig v. United States, </em>162 F.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir.1998). To prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In <em>Ludwig, </em>this Court joined all of its sister circuits that had addressed the issue, and held that \u201cthe failure to perfect a direct appeal, in derogation of a defendant\u2019s actual request, is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d 162 F.3d at 459. The <em>Ludwig </em>court explained that when a criminal defense lawyer fails to file an appeal against the instructions of his client, \u201capplication of the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice component is inappropriate because it means \u2018that the defendant never receives the benefit of a lawyer\u2019s services in constructing potential appellate arguments.\u2019 Prejudice must be presumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Castellanos v. United States, </em>26 F.3d 717, 718 (7th Cir.1994)). The <em>Ludwig </em>court further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">[a] lawyer\u2019s failure to file a requested appeal at the behest of a defendant is particularly problematic because it does not merely deprive the defendant of effective assistance of counsel, it deprives him of the assistance of any counsel altogether. Thus, the failure to perfect a direct appeal when requested by the defendant violates the Sixth Amendment without regard to the probability of success on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-10\"><em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized, however, that a defendant\u2019s \u201cactual \u2018request\u2019 \u201d is a critical element of the Sixth Amendment analysis inasmuch as \u201c[t]he Constitution does not require lawyers to advise their clients of the right to appeal. Rather, the Constitution is only implicated when a defendant actually requests an appeal, and his counsel disregards the request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Morales v. United States, </em>143 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir.1998); <em>Castellanos, </em>26 F.3d at 719).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">About two years after this Court decided <em>Ludwig, </em>the Supreme Court clarified the application of the <em>Strickland </em>standard to a claim that a criminal defense lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>was constitutionally ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal. Specifically, in <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), the Supreme Court held that the two-prong <em>Strickland </em>test \u201capplies to claims [ ] that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal.\u201d The Court acknowledged its \u201clong held\u201d rule that \u201ca lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court further acknowledged that a criminal defense lawyer\u2019s failure to file an appeal over his client\u2019s express request denies the defendant of an entire judicial proceeding which the \u201cdefendant wanted at the time and to which he had a right[,]\u201d and a presumption of prejudice is thus warranted under such circumstances because a \u201cpresumption of reliability\u201d cannot be accorded \u201cto judicial proceedings that never took place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">However, the Court continued, in the absence of a direct instruction from the defendant to appeal, the question of whether counsel\u2019s failure to appeal is constitutionally deficient depends upon \u201cwhether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. The Court emphasized that it \u201cemployed the term \u2018consult\u2019 to convey a specific meaning \u2014 advising the defendant about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal, and making a reasonable effort to discover the defendant\u2019s wishes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If counsel has consulted with the defendant, the failure to file an appeal is deficient only if it contradicts the defendant\u2019s instruction to appeal. <em>See id. </em>If, on the other hand, counsel has failed to consult, the court must consider whether this failure constitutes deficient performance. <em>See id. </em>In making this determination, a court should consider whether \u201c(1) [ ] a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2)[ ] this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">If the court determines that counsel was ineffective for failing to consult with the defendant regarding an appeal, it must then be determined whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. In order to show prejudice, \u201ca defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 482. In determining whether the defendant has made such a showing, it will often be \u201chighly relevant\u201d whether there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal or whether the defendant promptly expressed a desire to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 484-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Although the prejudice inquiry to some extent overlaps the deficiency inquiry, \u201cthey are not in all cases coextensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. For example, a defendant may establish deficient performance by demonstrating that he indicated an interest in appealing, thereby triggering a duty to consult; however, \u201csuch evidence alone is insufficient to establish that, had the defendant received reasonable advice from counsel about the appeal, he would have instructed counsel to file an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, a mere inability to identify nonfrivolous grounds for appeal does not automatically preclude a defendant from showing prejudice, particularly when a habeas petition is filed by an indigent, <em>pro se </em>defendant. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[I]t is unfair to <em>require </em>an indigent, perhaps <em>pro se, </em>defendant to demonstrate that his hypothetical appeal might have had merit before any advocate has ever reviewed the record in his case in search of potentially meritorious grounds for appeal. Rather, we require the defendant to demonstrate that, but for counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>deficient conduct, he would have appealed.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In summary, the following illustrates the legal rubric under which a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of should be analyzed when the claim is based on counsel\u2019s alleged failure to file a timely appeal. If the defendant expressly instructed his counsel to file an appeal, and his counsel failed to do so in contravention of the defendant\u2019s request, the defendant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 477, 483 (\u201cThe ... denial of the entire judicial proceeding itself, which a defendant wanted at the time and to which he had a right, [ ] demands a presumption of prejudice.\u201d); <em>Ludwig, </em>162 F.3d at 459 (\u201cWe ... hold that the failure to perfect a direct appeal, in derogation of a defendant\u2019s actual request, is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">If the defendant has not clearly conveyed his wishes as to whether he wants to file an appeal \u2014 i.e., he \u201cneither instructs counsel to file an appeal nor asks that an appeal not be taken,\u201d a court must first ask \u201cwhether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal.\u201d <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 478. When counsel has consulted with the defendant, then \u201cthe question of deficient performance is easily answered: Counsel performs in a professionally unreasonable manner only by failing to follow the defendant\u2019s express instructions with respect to an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the defendant instructed his counsel to appeal, and counsel acted in contravention thereof, prejudice is demonstrated. <em>Id. </em>at 483. When counsel has not consulted with the defendant regarding an appeal, the court must determine whether the failure to consult constitutes deficient performance under <em>Strickland. </em>\u201cCounsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 480. These inquiries involve a consideration of the totality of the circumstances. If it is found that defense counsel acted deficiently in failing to consult with the defendant, then the defendant must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by showing that \u201cthere is a reasonable probably that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\u201d <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">B. Application of <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Ludwig v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The district court found that Petitioner did not allege that he requested his attorney to file an appeal. However, in his application for a certificate of appealability, Petitioner claims that he did ask his attorney to take an appeal and that his claim in this regard is evident from his district court filings. Construing liberally Petitioner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion and memorandum in support thereof, as we must, Petitioner\u2019s papers do raise this claim. Specifically, Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and memorandum in support claim that \u201c[o]n the advise [sic] of his attorney, no direct appeal was filed\u201d (J.A. at 22); that \u201c[t]rial counsel instructed petitioner that there was nothing to appeal in his ease and in fact counsel failed to timely file a notice of appeal to contest grounds for relief and thereby foreclosed petitioner\u2019s opportunity to seek said relief\u2019 (J.A. at 28); and that \u201cPetitioner\u2019s Constitutional [sic] rights to a direct appeal was [sic] foreclosed when counsel advised petitioner that no appeal could be filed in this case.\u201d (J.A. at 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In response to this Court certifying the issue before us for appeal, Petitioner continues to argue that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">[l]awyers are not required to advise their clients of the right to appeal. However, the decision whether or not to appeal rests squarely with the defendant, and if the defendant objectively indicated his intent to appeal, he is entitled to a new appeal without any further showing. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985, 1000 (2000); <em>Ludwig v. U.S., </em>162 F.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir.1998): Failure to perfect an appeal, in derogation of a defendant\u2019s actual request, is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">Spence [Petitioner] did ask his attorney to appeal. Spence [Petitioner] stated his attorney instructed him he could not appeal. Before an attorney can respond in such a manner, he would have first been asked to file an appeal, obviously, or given clearly incompetent advice. The fact that his attorney instructed him so, raises the presumption that this was in response to an inquiry and request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Appellant\u2019s <em>Pro Se </em>Reply Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">In its brief on appeal, the government does not so much as mention <em>Roe </em>or <em>Ludwig; </em>rather, the government, in a total of one and one-half pages, states that it is relying on the district court\u2019s order denying Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, reargues that Petitioner did not raise the issue that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file an appeal in his \u00a7 2255 motion or memorandum in support, and points out that Petitioner was provided an appeal packet at sentencing and that it is clear from the record that Petitioner was aware of his right to appeal, but that counsel advised him that there was nothing to appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">When reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion in a case where an evidentiary hearing has not been conducted, such as in the matter at hand, this Court will affirm only if \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see Baker v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 85, 92 (6th Cir.1986). This standard for affirming the district court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not met here. Rather, Petitioner\u2019s motion, files, and record clearly show that Petitioner requested that his counsel file an appeal, that his counsel refused to do so on the basis that \u201cthere was nothing to appeal in this case,\u201d and that his counsel \u201cin fact [ ] failed to timely file notice of appeal\u201d (J.A. at 28), thus establishing that Petitioner\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance pursuant to <em>Roe </em>and <em>Ludwig. See Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 483 (\u201cThe ... denial of the entire judicial proceeding itself, which a defendant wanted at the time and to which he had a right, [ ] demands a presumption of prejudice.\u201d); <em>Ludwig, </em>162 F.3d at 459 (\u201c[T]he failure to perfect a direct appeal when requested by the defendant violates the Sixth Amendment without regard to the probability of success on appeal.\u201d) Indeed, if Petitioner\u2019s counsel was of the belief that there were no meritorious issues to appeal, counsel was free to file the appeal along with a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). However, Petitioner\u2019s counsel was not allowed to foreclose Petitioner\u2019s right to an appeal based on his own beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Even if one were to maintain, as the majority does here, that this case presents the scenario wherein Petitioner did not clearly convey his desire to file an appeal to his counsel, thus triggering an inquiry under <em>Roe </em>into the threshold question of whether defense counsel consulted with Petitioner regarding an appeal, the result should be no different. <em>See Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 478, 483. The record indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>defense counsel consulted with Petitioner and, contrary to Petitioner\u2019s expressed desire to appeal, defense counsel failed to do so on the basis that \u201cthere was nothing to appeal\u201d (J.A. at 28), thus rendering ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, despite this Court\u2019s order to brief the issue on appeal in light of <em>Roe </em>and <em>Ludwig, </em>the government has come forward with nothing to rebut this conclusion that Petitioner should prevail under this authority. And the majority\u2019s contention that Petitioner\u2019s papers \u201cdemonstrate only discussions with his attorney regarding the possibility of an appeal\u201d is illogical and flies in the face of the record before us. Certainly Petitioner had to request or express his desire to appeal in order for counsel have \u201cadvised petitioner that no appeal could be filed in this case.\u201d (J.A. at 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">C. Evidentiary Hearing as an Alternative</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Although Petitioner is entitled to the relief requested, at the very least his case should be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing. As the record currently stands, there is sufficient objective evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Petitioner expressly instructed defense counsel to file an appeal. That is, the evidence indicates that Petitioner presented a meritorious claim, and Petitioner should therefore be allowed to further develop the record. <em>See Griffin v. United States, </em>330 F.3d 733, 739-40 (6th Cir.2003) (remanding the petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to the district court for an evidentiary hearing where the petitioner \u201cpresented a potentially meritorious claim for ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d while noting that the petitioner \u201cdeserve[d] the right to develop the record\u201d in order to demonstrate prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In light of <em>Roe </em>and <em>Ludwig, </em>the district court erred in failing to grant Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore, this Court should reverse the district court\u2019s order denying Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and order that Petitioner be allowed to file a delayed appeal. <em>See Ludwig, </em>162 F.3d at 459 (concluding that when it is determined that the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to his counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal over the petitioner\u2019s request, the petitioner is entitled to file a delayed appeal). In the alternative, Petitioner\u2019s case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
