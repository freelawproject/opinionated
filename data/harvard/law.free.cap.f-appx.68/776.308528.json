In <em>United States v. Mackby, </em>261 F.3d 821 (9th Cir.2001), we affirmed Mackby\u2019s liability but remanded for a determination of whether $729,454.92 in civil penalties and treble damages violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. On remand the district court upheld the full $729,454.92 judgment, concluding that it was not grossly disproportional to the gravity of Mackby\u2019s offense. We review the question of whether a fine is constitutionally excessive de novo, <em>United States v. Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 337 n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">A fine violates the Excessive Fines Clause \u201cif it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. The essence of Mackby\u2019s offense was his use of someone else\u2019s Medicare personal identification number to procure Medicare payments for which he was not eligible. Although not dispositive, we may properly consider Congress\u2019s judgment about minimum and maximum penalties as a guide. <em>See Balice v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>203 F.3d 684, 699 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>107 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.1997). Had the government sought the minimum statutory penalty for each of the 1459 claims for which it sought damages, the fine would have been over $7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">If we do as Mackby urges and compare the judgment against him to the criminal penalties he would have faced had he been convicted under the criminal False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, that comparison does not weigh in Mackby\u2019s favor. Using Mackby\u2019s own calculations, under the Sentencing Guidelines he would face not only up to a $75,000 fine, but also restitution for the full amount of the false claims and a term of imprisonment of 37-46 months. <em>See Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. at 338 (comparing the civil judgment to the total criminal penalty); <em>United States v. 3814 NW Thurman Street, </em>164 F.3d 1191, 1197 (9th Cir. 1999) (same). Even under the most lenient interpretation of the Guidelines, Mackby would face some mandatory prison time.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Finally, Mackby\u2019s conduct was not harmless. The government has an interest in preserving the integrity of the Medicare system and protecting against fraud. Fraudulent claims, even when the medical services were actually performed, hinder the effective administration of Medicare. Comparing the size of Mackby\u2019s fine to the gravity of his offense, we conclude that the former is not grossly disproportional to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b806-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
