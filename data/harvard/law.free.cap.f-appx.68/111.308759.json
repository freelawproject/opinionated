We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Dodd\u2019s contention that his sentence of 31-years-to-life is grossly disproportionate in violation of the Eighth Amendment is foreclosed by <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172-75, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that state court\u2019s affirmance of two consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences for petty theft was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law), and <em>Ewing v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1185-90, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (holding that a 25-years-to-life sentence under the California three-strikes law did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment). The district court therefore properly denied Dodd\u2019s petition. <em>Andrade, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b141-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
