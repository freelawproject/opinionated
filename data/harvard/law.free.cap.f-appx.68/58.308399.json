We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cox\u2019s claim that various defendants were deliberately indifferent to his safety by adopting a \u201cloose knife policy\u201d in the prison kitchen, because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any prison official knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834-37, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cox\u2019s claims against the medical defendants because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the course of treatment the prison doctors chose was medically unacceptable under the circumstances. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996). The record shows at most a difference of opinion about the proper course of medical treatment. <em>See Sanchez v. Vild, </em>891 F.2d 240, 242 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-23\">Cox\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AAK\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
