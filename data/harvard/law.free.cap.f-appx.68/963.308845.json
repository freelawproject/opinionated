RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">James W. Green appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the government on claims filed pursuant to the Federal Torts Claim Act (FTCA). The district court concluded that appellant had not complied with the FTCA\u2019s administrative claim requirements and dismissed the case with prejudice. We have jurisdiction over the appeal by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; our review of the district court\u2019s decision is de novo. <em>Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">Appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the administrative claim requirements of the FTCA do not apply to his case because his suit is against the judicial branch as a whole and not against any individual. This argument lacks merit because the statute expressly makes all tort suits against the government subject to those provisions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). The judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s motion to file a supplement to his appellate brief is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
