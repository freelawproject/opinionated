In an order dated December 2, 2002, the district court directed McCoy to file an amended complaint demonstrating that he had exhausted his administrative remedies and to either pay the fifing fee or to file an application to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The district court subsequently discovered that McCoy had filed another complaint based on the same facts and also raising a claim of employment discrimination. The district court clerk had docketed those papers as a separate case (No. 02-CA-3946-MJG). Because the second complaint was filed on the proper forms and because McCoy had filed an application to proceed in forma pauperis, the district court dismissed the first, incomplete action without prejudice. The second lawsuit \u2014 raising the same claim against the same defendant \u2014 is proceeding in the district court. Thus, the dismissal of the first action has not harmed McCoy\u2019s ability to pursue a remedy for the alleged discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The decision to dismiss the initial lawsuit was a sound exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion to manage the court\u2019s docket. We therefore affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
