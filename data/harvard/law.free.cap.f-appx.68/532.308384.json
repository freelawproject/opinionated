Defendant argues on appeal that he was denied due process at sentencing in that: (1) the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSIR\u201d) was prepared only two days before the sentencing hearing, contrary to the 35 day rule of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(b)(6)(A), and; (2) the district court failed to inquire whether defendant and his counsel had \u201cread and discussed\u201d the PSIR, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(3)(A). Defendant also challenges the denial of his request for a downward departure under United States Sentencing Guideline (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 5K2.12. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Defendant pleaded guilty to bank robbery, and use of a firearm during a bank robbery, based on the September 16, 1999 armed robbery of the PNC Bank in Louisville, Kentucky. Defendant reserved his right to argue for a downward departure in a written Rule 11 Plea Agreement. A PSIR was prepared on November 13, 2000, and was relied upon by the district court two days later at defendant\u2019s November 15, 2000 sentencing hearing. Responding to the district court\u2019s inquiry whether defense counsel and defendant had \u201creviewed the presentence investigation report including any revisions to the report,\u201d eoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>sel stated \u201c[w]e have,\u201d noting \u201ca couple of factual areas in the report, but nothing that effects [sic] the guideline calculation, minor things that we talked about him being in college for four years and he was actually in college for five, things like that, but I don\u2019t think really need to be changed.\u201d Defendant did not object to the timeliness of the PSIR. The district court heard argument on defendant\u2019s request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12 (committing offense under serious coercion or duress), recognized that the request could be granted if defendant was \u201ctelling the truth\u201d as to why he committed the robbery, then reasoned \u201cI don\u2019t find credibility in [defendant\u2019s] statements and so I am going to deny the motion for a downward departure.\u201d Defendant was sentenced within the sentencing guideline range to a total of 90 months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">II. 35-Day Rule of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(6)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">A PSIR must be furnished to a defendant not less than 35 days before the sentencing hearing unless the defendant waives this time requirement. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(6)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant did not object to receiving the PSIR two days before sentencing. While the better practice is to provide the PSIR to the defendant at least 35 days prior to sentence or secure the defendant\u2019s formal waiver of the time requirement on the record, the transcript in this case establishes that defendant waived the 35-day requirement of Rule 32(b)(6)(A). Accordingly, violation of the 35-day rule is not subject to review on appeal. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (recognizing that a criminal defendant may forfeit a right to appeal by failing to timely object in the district court). Further, defendant has not shown that the failure to provide him with the PSIR 35 days or more prior to sentencing affected a substantial right warranting correction under a \u201cplain error\u201d analysis. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (recognizing that a \u201cplain error\u201d not raised in the district court may be corrected by an appellate court only if a substantial right was affected and the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings). Defendant\u2019s argument under Rule 32(b)(6) has not been preserved for appellate review, and the record below does not reflect plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">III. PSIR Inquiry under Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(c)(3)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">Before imposing sentence, a district court must \u201cverify that the defendant and defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report made available under subdivision (b)(6)(A).\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the district court fails to determine whether the defendant and defendant\u2019s counsel have read and discussed the PSIR, the matter must be remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>243 F.3d 953, 955 (6th Cir.2001). \u201cThe district court need not make an affirmative inquiry, so long as it can somehow determine that defendant and counsel have read and discussed the report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>851 F.2d 140, 143 (6th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">The district court could reasonably determine from its sentencing hearing inquiry \u2014 whether defense counsel and defendant had \u201creviewed\u201d the PSIR \u2014 that appellant and his counsel had \u201cread and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>discussed\u201d the PSIR as required under Rule 32(c)(3)(A). Defense counsel\u2019s reference to \u201cminor\u201d factual inaccuracies \u201cthat we talked about\u201d confirmed that defendant and his counsel did in fact read and discuss the PSIR. Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the district court determined that defendant and his counsel had read and discussed the PSIR, as required under Rule 32(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">IV. Limited Review of Denial of Downward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It is well established that the denial of a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines is renewable on appeal only if the district court erroneously believed it lacked legal authority to grant the relief. <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>144 F.3d 412, 418 (6th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Ebolum, </em>72 F.3d 35, 37 (6th Cir.1995)). \u201c[T]he district court need not explicitly state that it is aware of its discretionary power to depart downward; as long as the record makes clear such awareness.... \u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>238 F.3d 786, 791 (6th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>144 F.3d at 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The sentencing transcript makes clear that the district court judge knew he enjoyed discretion to grant defendant\u2019s request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12 if he believed defendant\u2019s testimony that it was not defendant\u2019s idea to rob the bank, and that defendant was coerced into robbing the bank by threats of force. The district court did not believe defendant\u2019s testimony, however, and exercised its discretion in denying the request for a downward departure. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s argument that the district court made an \u201cuninformed\u201d decision when denying defendant\u2019s request for a downward departure is not renewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. This 35-day requirement is now found at Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e)(2) (amended 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-14\">.
