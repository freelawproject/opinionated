We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as well as dismissals for failure to state a claim. <em>See Hicks v. Small, </em>69 F.3d 967, 969 (9th Cir.1995). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The district court properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction Hale\u2019s challenge to the DVA\u2019s determination that she was not entitled to any portion of Master Sergeant Hale\u2019s disability retirement benefits. The DVA has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the \u201cprovision of benefits\u201d to veterans and their dependents under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a). <em>See Tietjen v. United States Veterans Admin., </em>884 F.2d 514, 515 (9th Cir.1989) (order) (construing former version of \u00a7 511(a), previously codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a)). The Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408, does not provide an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Steel v. United States, </em>813 F.2d 1545, 1548-49 (9th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The district court properly dismissed Hale\u2019s constitutional challenges for failure to state a claim because she did not allege any facts to support her conclusory allegation that the DVA failed to notify her of Master Sergeant Hale\u2019s disability reclassification hearing. <em>See Ivey v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Alaska, </em>673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We decline to consider Hale\u2019s contention that Master Sergeant Hale\u2019s retirement pay is 50% attributable to a longevity retirement and the remainder constitutes disability retirement pay, because she raises that issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Broad v. Sealaska Corp., </em>85 F.3d 422, 430 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b86-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
