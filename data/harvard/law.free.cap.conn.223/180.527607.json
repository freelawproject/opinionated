We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The record discloses the following facts. According to the factual statement made by the state at the time of the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, the petitioner picked up the female victim, who had been hitchhiking in Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ford, in November, 1987. He took her to his apartment, where he forced her to engage in sexual intercourse by holding the jagged edge of a broken ashtray to her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As a result of this incident, the petitioner was charged with the crimes of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70; see footnote 2, supra; and unlawful restraint in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95. The petitioner pleaded not guilty and elected a jury trial. He was represented by attorney Gerald Klein, who also represented him on three prior pending charges, including another sexual assault charge in which the petitioner\u2019s brother was a codefendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On several occasions, Klein and the state\u2019s attorney discussed the petitioner\u2019s cases with Judge Arena, who was, at that time, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the Hartford judicial district.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Although the case had been assigned to Judge James Higgins for trial, jury selection was conducted before Judge Schaller. The habeas court found that, during the third day of jury selection, Judge Arena was instrumental in procuring a plea bargain whereby he indicated that, in exchange for the petitioner\u2019s plea of guilty to the charge of sexual assault in the first degree, he would impose a sentence of ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after five years, followed by four years probation. Judge Arena also indicated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>defendant could argue for a lesser sentence, and that he might be favorably disposed to a lesser sentence depending on the attitude of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Accordingly, on January 5, 1989, the defendant pleaded guilty to sexual assault in the first degree before Judge Schaller. The habeas court specifically found that, in the plea canvass, Judge Schaller fully informed the petitioner that Judge Arena had \u201cput together the deal and that [Judge] Arena would be the sentencing judge.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the subsequent sentencing pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ceeding before Judge Arena, on February 16, 1989, the petitioner sought to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that he had been confused when he pleaded guilty. The court, <em>Arena, J., </em>denied his motion to withdraw his plea, and imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after five years, followed by four years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The petitioner appealed from that judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming that the court, <em>Arena, J., </em>had improperly (1) failed to conduct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea, and (2) sentenced the petitioner after actively participating in pretrial plea negotiations, thereby violating his federal and state constitutional rights to due process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>22 Conn. App. 531, 532, 578 A.2d 152, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 823, 581 A.2d 1057 (1990). The Appellate Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claims. With respect to the second claim, which is the only claim of the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal relevant here, the Appellate Court first noted that since the petitioner had failed to preserve that claim by moving for Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 997,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the claim could only be reviewed if it rose to the level of constitutional proportions. Id., 537. The court then stated that the prohibition against a judge participating in plea negotiations is not a constitutional matter, provided that the plea was not judicially coerced and thus voluntary. The court then concluded that since there was no evidence that Judge Arena\u2019s participation in the plea bargain resulted in a judicially coerced or otherwise involuntary plea, the petitioner\u2019s claim was not of constitutional proportions. Id., 537-38. Accordingly, the court concluded that, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), the petitioner could not prevail on that claim. The Appellate Court also discerned from the record \"the possibility that the defendant\u2019s failure to make his objections known at the sentencing was not mere inadvertence but a trial tactic.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>supra, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Meanwhile, the petitioner had brought this habeas corpus action. In this action, the petitioner pleaded four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>theories: (1) his plea had been involuntary because it was based upon misinformation supplied to him by his trial counsel; (2) his plea had been involuntary because it was based upon inadequate information supplied to him by his trial counsel; (3) his sentence was illegal because it had been improperly based upon extrarecord information within the knowledge of the sentencing judge; and (4) his trial counsel had been ineffective in giving him misinformation, in giving him inadequate information, and in failing to move for Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In its memorandum of decision, however, the habeas court considered the petitioner\u2019s claims somewhat differently. The habeas court considered the petitioner to have raised three claims: (1) his plea of guilty had not been voluntary and knowing because Klein had misinformed him about the sentence and had failed to apprise him of exculpatory evidence that had been unearthed during Klein\u2019s investigation on the petitioner\u2019s behalf; (2) his trial counsel had been ineffective because he had failed to inform the petitioner about the purported exculpatory evidence and had failed to inform him fully about the sentence agreed upon with Judge Arena; and (3) his trial counsel had been ineffective because he had not requested Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since the petitioner has not at any time during this appeal challenged this reformulation by the habeas court of his claims therein, we view his appeal accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The habeas court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claims. With respect to the first two claims, the habeas court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>concluded that the petitioner\u2019s testimony was not credible, and that he had failed to meet his burden of proof of the underlying facts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">With respect to the third claim, namely, that Klein had been ineffective by not requesting Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification, the court concluded that there had been no basis for moving to disqualify Judge Arena, based upon Judge Arena\u2019s knowledge of the petitioner\u2019s other charges, which had been nolled, and Judge Arena\u2019s knowledge of the disposition of the petitioner\u2019s brother\u2019s case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court concluded that since, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>199 Conn. 121, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986), a trial court in imposing sentence may consider information regarding counts that have not been prosecuted, Judge Arena was acting within his discretion in considering the charges that had been nolled. The court also found that Judge Arena had been instrumental in creating the plea bargain, and that the petitioner had been fully aware that Judge Arena would be the sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>fencing judge. The habeas court also noted that the petitioner\u2019s own expert witness had indicated that he might not have moved to disqualify Judge Arena. Finally, the court concluded that any prohibition against a judge\u2019s participation in plea bargaining is not a matter of constitutional dimension. Accordingly, the habeas court dismissed the petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The petitioner\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that Judge Arena was barred by Canon 3 (C) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> from sentencing the petitioner. The petitioner argues that, irrespective of the propriety of the information that Judge Arena had at the time of sentencing, it was improper as a matter of law for Judge Arena to sentence the petitioner because Judge Arena had actively participated in the plea bargaining that led to the petitioner\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>It is important to note what the petitioner does not argue with respect to this claim. The petitioner does not argue that his sentence was illegal because it had been based on improper information within the knowledge of the sentencing judge. Nor does he argue that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to move for Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification. The petitioner\u2019s claim is, rather, that his conviction should be set aside because Judge Arena\u2019s active participation in the plea negotiations was a per se violation of Canon 3 (C) (1). We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">First, this claim bears little, if any, resemblance to the petitioner\u2019s claim involving Judge Arena\u2019s conduct as the petitioner presented this case to the habeas court and as that court decided the case. In the habeas court, the petitioner\u2019s claim regarding Judge Arena\u2019s conduct was that his trial counsel had been ineffective in not moving for Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification. The petitioner did not claim in the habeas court that, irrespective of Klein\u2019s effectiveness, Judge Arena was required to disqualify himself as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Thus, the petitioner\u2019s principal claim in this appeal does not present any of the issues that the petitioner submitted to the habeas court for decision. The petitioner has continued the course of appellate advocacy that he began on his direct appeal, namely, shifting the grounds of his claim on appeal when the grounds he had asserted in the trial court proved unavailing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>supra, 537 (declining to review petitioner\u2019s unpreserved claim because, except in exceptional circumstances, \u201cappellate claims must be the product of trial counsel\u2019s efforts, not those of appellate counsel sifting through the record after the fact, trawling for issues undreamt of at trial\u201d). We see no reason in this case to depart from our general rule that legal claims not raised at trial are not cognizable on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>appeal. <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>220 Conn. 192, 197 n.5, 596 A.2d 396 (1991) .</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Our refusal to review the petitioner\u2019s claim is particularly apt because this is a habeas corpus case. The petitioner pleaded guilty to sexual assault in the first degree and was sentenced in early 1989. His direct appeal was decided in August, 1990. This habeas corpus action was tried in December, 1990, and decided by the habeas court in January, 1991. The petitioner has had, therefore, more than three years, and three opportunities properly to challenge in court Judge Arena\u2019s participation in his plea bargain\u2014before Judge Arena himself, before the Appellate Court in his direct appeal, and before the habeas court. Therefore, on this, his fourth opportunity, the petitioner should at least be required to present on appeal the same claims that he presented to the habeas court, rather than presenting yet another appellate afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Furthermore, the writ of habeas corpus, as a vehicle to challenge a criminal conviction, is reserved for \u201cconvictions that violate fundamental fairness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 460-61, 610 A.2d 598 (1992). In order to be successful, a habeas corpus petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice and not merely an error which might entitle him to relief on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 461. Thus, ordinarily a habeas corpus petitioner must establish some fundamental constitutional violation entitling him to relief. Id. A claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that a judge should not have participated in plea negotiations, based solely upon the appearance of partiality, does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. See <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>578 F.2d 80, 85 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 923, 99 S. Ct. 1253, 59 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1979). Nor does it constitute a miscarriage of justice, or other prejudice justifying the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The petitioner also claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that the petitioner\u2019s trial coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sel had not rendered ineffective assistance to the petitioner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In this argument, the petitioner swaddles his first claim\u2014that as a matter of law Judge Arena had been disqualified by Canon 3 (C) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct from sentencing the petitioner\u2014in the hopeful mantle of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, he argues that, because Judge Arena was per se disqualified by Canon 3, Klein was duty bound to move for Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification, despite Klein\u2019s belief that, as the petitioner characterizes it in his brief, \u201cit was the best bargain he could get.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The gist of the petitioner\u2019s argument is as follows: \u201cHad Judge Arena offered a suspended sentence to a misdemeanor plea, the analysis would not change. The habeas court\u2019s determination that counsel was competent clearly rests not on the law but on the success of counsel\u2019s performance. Counsel\u2019s deal-making ability has no place in the analysis of a court\u2019s appearance of partiality. It is axiomatic that the law and Code of Judicial Conduct does not protect the <em>outcome </em>of a case, it protects the process.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Taken at its face value, this argument in support of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is almost frivolous. Criminal defendants, the criminal defense bar, the prosecution bar and the bench would be surprised, to say the least, to learn that the sixth amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel requires that we ignore the results of counsel\u2019s performance on his client\u2019s behalf and gauge that performance, not by whether it fell below the standard of reasonableness to the prejudice of the client, but by whether it sufficiently protected the purity of the criminal process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>They would be equally surprised to learn that, even had Klein been able to secure from Judge Arena a suspended sentence to a misdemeanor plea on the facts of this case, his performance would have been constitutionally deficient.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Viewed more charitably, the petitioner\u2019s argument is simply without merit. \u201cEstablishing that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984)]. To demonstrate this the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Id., 687-88. In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. Id., 688. Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, and courts must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. Id., 689, quoting <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S. Ct. 158, 100 L. Ed. 83 (1955), reh. denied, 350 U.S. 955, 76 S. Ct. 340, 100 L. Ed. 831 (1956); see also <em>Burger </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>483 U.S. 776, 788-96, 107 S. Ct. 3114, 97 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1987); <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 185-86, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986); <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>[211 Conn. 352, 357, 559 A.2d 200 (1989)]; <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 86, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988); <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 636, 640, 490 A.2d 82 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 403-404, 559 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 107 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989). Gauging Klein\u2019s conduct by this standard, we agree with the habeas court that his performance as the petitioner\u2019s counsel was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">As <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>220 Conn. 270, 280, 596 A.2d 407 (1991), makes clear, there was no basis for a motion to disqualify Judge Arena.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, Judge Arena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>was entitled to take into account the petitioner\u2019s other charges in imposing sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>supra, 126-27. Moreover, the petitioner does not challenge Klein\u2019s judgment that the sentence suggested by Judge Arena was the best disposition he would have been able to secure for his client. Under these circumstances, the petitioner has not established that Klein rendered him ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Callahan and Glass, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\"> Upon a grant of certification to appeal; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b); the petitioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas corpus court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book 5 4023.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 provides: \u201cSEXUAL ASSAULT IN the first DEGREE: CLASS B FELONY: ONE YEAR NOT SUSPENDABLE. (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degee when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person, or (2) engages in sexual intercourse with a person under thirteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u201c(b) Sexual assault in the first degree is a class B felony for which one year of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\"> Although the petitioner in his brief in this court purports to raise two separate claims regarding the necessity for Judge Arena\u2019s disqualification, we can discern no analytical difference between the two claims.

Assignment of Judges, Vol. 49, C.L.J., No. 34, pp. 1B-11B (February 23, 1988). Among the responsibilities of the presiding judge are \u201c[ejxpediting the disposition, fairly, of the court business to which such judge has been entrusted,\u201d and \u201c[ajpportioning among the judges the judicial business to which such judge and other judges have been assigned.\u201d Id., p. 3B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> The plea canvass before Judge Schaller discloses the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYS\">\u201cThe Court: Now perhaps counsel would state what the status of the plea agreement, or the recommendation from the sentencing judge is. I can verify that, because I did also speak directly with Judge Arena, and we can be sure that we all agree on what Judge Arena has said. Mr. Klein?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUM\">\u201cMr. Klein: We did discuss the matter with Judge Arena, and he was familiar with the facts of the case from prior pretrials. And after discussing my client\u2019s background with him and some of the possible defenses, should the matter go all the way through trial, he indicated that on a guilty plea, it would be his inclination at this time to impose a sentence of 10 years suspended, after serving five years, and a period of probation; that I would have the right after a PSI, a presentence report, to ask for a lesser sentence, but that he would probably only be inclined to sentence Mr. Safford to a lesser term of imprisonment if something came up in terms of the position of the victim, who I\u2019m sure will have some input into the presentence report. So essentially, it\u2019s a ten-year, suspended after five year cap, with the right to argue for a lesser term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7N\">\u201cThe Court: And I understand a four-year probation period?

Let me just restate it, and that is, Judge Arena has indicated that he would impose a sentence of ten years, suspended after five years, followed by four years of probation, with any special conditions of probation he thinks are reasonable or appropriate in this case. You, Mr. Safford, and your attorney have the right to argue for a lesser sentence. However, if Judge Arena chooses to impose a sentence of ten years, suspended after five, with four years of probation, you do not have any right to withdraw your plea. He is free to impose that sentence. It\u2019s what we call a cap. If Judge Arena chooses to impose a longer sentence, more jail time, then you would have the opportunity to withdraw your guilty plea, but\u2014so that Judge Arena has committed himself, in a sense, to sentencing you to no more than ten years, suspended after five, followed by four years of probation.

The habeas court found, furthermore, that Klein had deemed the statement to be equivocal at best and that the witness if called might be more harmful than helpful to the defense, and that Klein had discussed the statement with the petitioner on more than one occasion. The habeas court concluded that Klein\u2019s tactical decision not to call the witness or to order follow-up investigation was reasonable and did not fall below the standard of competent counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> The petitioner\u2019s brother had been sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment for sexual assault.

If negotiations were not successful, however, a judge who was not involved in the plea negotiations would have presided at trial and pronounced sentence if the defendant were found guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>220 Conn. 270, 280, 596 A.2d 407 (1991). That procedure was essentially followed here where, although Judge Schaller conducted the plea proceeding, Judge Arena conducted both the plea negotiations and the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Such a procedure must be distinguished from the situation where the judge who participates in plea negotiations is also responsible for conducting the trial and, therefore, for sentencing the defendant in the event of a conviction. In that situation, the dangers we identified in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 47, 475 A.2d 269 (1984), are present. Those dangers are that (1) the trial judge\u2019s impartiality may truly be compromised by his own perception of \"a personal stake in the agreement,\u201d resulting in resentment of the defendant who rejects his suggested disposition, (2) the defendant may \u201cmake incriminating concessions during the course of plea negotiations,\u201d and (3) the trial judge may become or appear to become an advocate for his suggested resolution. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">These concerns are not present in a case such as the petitioner\u2019s original trial, however, where the presiding judge, without communication to the judge who will conduct the trial, participates in plea negotiations. As long as the defendant is free to reject the plea offer and go to trial before a judge who was not involved in or aware of those negotiations, he is not subject to any undue pressure to agree to the plea agreement, and the impartiality of the judge who will sentence him in the event of conviction after trial is not compromised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b217-8\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFh\">concurring in the result.

In this footnote, the majority gratuitously claims that the trial court\u2019s participation in the plea negotiations was proper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I strongly disagree and must set forth my reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The petitioner\u2019s attorney, Gerald Klein, had several discussions with the trial judge, <em>Arena, J., </em>regarding the numerous criminal cases the plaintiff had pending before the trial court. The sentence that was agreed upon in open court by the plaintiff was not recommended by the state\u2019s attorney, Herbert Carlson, but was one made by Judge Arena during negotiations in chambers. At the petitioner\u2019s sentencing on February 16, 1989, Judge Arena acknowledged that he took \u201ca very active part in all the discussions leading up to the entry of the plea. This court was involved in pretrial discussions I believe commencing last March or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>April of 1988. \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the habeas court found that \u201cJudge Arena was <em>instrumental </em>in effectuating the bargain that was struck by the state and the defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 484 A.2d 435 (1984), this court squarely addressed the issue of the propriety of a trial court\u2019s participation in pretrial negotiations that lead to a guilty plea. We framed this \u201cserious question\u201d in <em>Fullwood </em>as \u201cwhether the trial court undertook an impermissible role when it tried \u2018to settle this matter.\u2019 \u201d Id., 580. We held that if, by that statement, \u201cthe court actively participated in the negotiation of a plea bargain, <em>disqualification would have been required.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>634 F.2d 830, 840-41 (5th Cir.); <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>646 F.2d 873, 880 (5th Cir. 1980), modified in part, 646 F.2d 902 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 840, 102 S.

Bruckman, D. Nash &amp; J. Katz, Connecticut Criminal Caselaw Handbook (1989) pp. 57-58, and cases cited therein. In <em>Fullwood, </em>we concluded that the record in that case was inadequate to determine whether there had been \u201can impropriety.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra, 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The majority summarily disregards this precedent and relies instead on the dictum in <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>220 Conn. 270, 596 A.2d 407 (1991), to support its unwarranted footnote. The majority\u2019s conclusion, however, is unfounded for three primary reasons. First, the dictum in <em>Niblack </em>was not supported by any precedent. The only pertinent case cited in <em>Niblack </em>was the underlying Appellate Court decision in the present case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>22 Conn. App. 531, 537, 578 A.2d 152, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 823, 581 A.2d 1057 (1990). In <em>Safford, </em>however, the Appellate Court merely held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that the \u201cprohibition against trial judges\u2019 participating in plea negotiations is not, in itself, a matter of constitutional law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Second, the majority\u2019s conclusion does a grave injustice to our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>supra, 47. The majority implies that in <em>Gradzik </em>we held that the trial court would be disqualified from presiding over the trial <em>only </em>in situations where the judge actively participated in unsuccessful plea negotiations. It is impossible to read <em>Gradzik </em>in that manner. Rather, <em>Gradzik </em>held that a trial judge would not be disqualified merely by advising counsel that if the defendant pleaded guilty, \u201chis violation of probation [a separate pending offense] would be handled either in New Haven where he had been sentenced to probation or in West Haven before the same judge, at the defendant\u2019s option.\u201d Id., 45. In <em>Gradzik, </em>we concluded that \u201cthe court\u2019s comments regarding the probation violation did not warrant disqualification. These statements occurred during the plea negotiations and appear to be nothing more than an explanation of the procedure for the disposition of the probation violation in the event of a guilty plea. . . <em>.If the record revealed that the judge had been an active participant in negotiating the plea, we would view this claim differently. </em>The dangers of such par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ticipation are obvious. In the first place, judicial participation in plea negotiations is likely to impair the trial court\u2019s impartiality. The judge who suggests or encourages a particular plea bargain may feel a personal stake in the agreement (and in the quick disposition of the case made possible by the bargain) and may therefore resent the defendant who rejects his advice. . . . Moreover, the defendant is likely to make incriminating concessions during the course of plea negotiations. ... In the second place, judicial participation in plea discussions creates a misleading impression of the judge\u2019s role in the proceedings. As a result of his participation, the judge is no longer a judicial officer or a neutral arbiter. Rather, he becomes or seems to become an advocate for the resolution he has suggested to the defendant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Werker, </em>[535 F.2d 198, 203 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 926, 97 S. Ct. 330, 50 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1976)]. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>[supra, 840-41]. There is nothing in the record, however, to support a conclusion that the trial judge participated in the plea negotiations.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Lastly, the majority\u2019s application of the prohibition against judicial involvement in plea bargaining only where the same judge presides over the trial, overlooks the strong policy reasons for prohibiting such involvement. These reasons are brought to light by the federal system. In that system, plea bargaining practices are governed by rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which was amended in 1974 to include the absolute prohibition against judicial participation in plea negotiations to avoid \u201cthe \u2018chilling effect\u2019 such participation might have on a defendant\u2019s decision to either accept a plea bargain or go to trial. <em>Blackmon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>608 F.2d 183 (5th Cir. 1979) [reh. denied, 611 F.2d 882 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 852, 101 S. Ct. 143, 66 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1980)].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Frank </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>supra, 880; Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (e) (1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prohibition against judicial involvement in plea negotiations \u201cis necessarily absolute because of the role required of the judge once an agreement is reached; the court must decide for itself whether to accept or reject the plea bargain.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, 835.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Thus, when the majority asserts that the prohibition should only apply to judges who participate in the plea negotiations and then conduct the trial and the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tence, it only tells half the story. The majority fails to acknowledge the inherent dangers present when a defendant <em>pleads guilty </em>to an agreement negotiated by the judge\u2014the very danger the federal rule sought to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">There are several reasons for keeping the judge out of any plea negotiations: \u201c(1) judicial participation in the discussions can create the impression in the mind of the defendant that he would not receive a fair trial were he to go to trial before this judge; (2) judicial participation in the discussions makes it difficult for the judge objectively to determine the voluntariness of the plea when it is offered; (3) judicial participation to the extent of promising a certain sentence is inconsistent with the theory behind the use of the presentence investigation report; and (4) the risk of not going along with the disposition apparently desired by the judge may seem so great to the defendant that he will be induced to plead guilty even if innocent.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>supra, 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As the District Court for the Southern District of New York has explained in often quoted language: \u201cThe unequal positions of the judge and the accused, one with the power to commit to prison and the other deeply concerned to avoid prison, at once raise a question of fundamental fairness. When a judge becomes a participant in plea bargaining he brings to bear the full force and majesty of his office. His awesome power to impose a substantially longer or even maximum sentence in excess of that proposed is present whether referred to or not. A defendant needs no reminder that if he rejects the proposal, stands upon his right to trial and is convicted, he faces a significantly longer sentence. One facing a prison term, whether of longer or shorter duration, is easily influenced to accept what appears the more preferable choice. Intentionally or otherwise, and no matter how well motivated the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>may be, the accused is subjected to a subtle but powerful influence.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Elksnis </em>v. <em>Gilligan, </em>256 F. Sup. 244, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The court in <em>United States ex rel. Elksnis </em>goes on to state that \u201c[t]he judge stands as the symbol of evenhanded justice, and none can seriously question that if this central figure in the administration of justice promises an accused that upon a plea of guilty a fixed sentence will follow, his commitment has an all-pervasive and compelling influence in inducing the accused to yield his right to trial.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Judicial participation in plea bargaining is a serious concern. Many defendants perceive or are led to believe that if the \u201cdeal\u201d offered or suggested by the presiding judge is not accepted and if he or she is ultimately convicted, then the sentencing judge, although not the same one as the negotiating judge, will \u201cthrow the book\u201d at him or her by imposing a much harsher sentence. In this case, on the basis of the representations made by the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, it appears that this scenario transpired.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the habeas hearing, trial counsel testified that he had advised the petitioner to accept Judge Arena\u2019s plea offer because \u201ca jury might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>very well [have found] him guilty and I [had] told him about [a certain judge] and I [had] told him the type of sentence that he could expect if he were convicted.\u201d He testified that he had been told by the state\u2019s attorney and Judge Arena that this other judge would have presided over the petitioner\u2019s trial. The petitioner\u2019s attorney also testified that he had told the petitioner that, if convicted, the judge who was to be assigned to the case would have given the petitioner \u201ca very, very long sentence.\u201d That the petitioner had this perception should alone be sufficient to condemn this practice in Connecticut of allowing active participation by judges in plea negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">I recognize that there is a need for the trial court to <em>facilitate </em>reasonable agreements between the state\u2019s attorney and the defendant. That need, however, can be met without allowing trial judges actively to participate in the negotiations because doing so jeopardizes the integrity of the judicial process. Under standard 14-3.3 of the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice (1986), if the judge agrees to participate in plea discussions, he or she \u201cshall serve as a moderator in listening to their respective presentations concerning appropriate charge or sentence concessions. Following the presentation of the parties, the judge may indicate what charge or sentence concessions would be acceptable or whether the judge wishes to have a preplea report before rendering a decision. The parties may thereupon decide among themselves, outside of the presence of the court, whether to accept or reject the plea agreement tendered by the court. . . . All discussions at which the judge is present relating to plea agreements should be recorded verbatim and preserved, except that for good cause the judge may order the transcript of [the] proceedings to be sealed. Such discussions should be held in <em>open court </em>unless good cause is present for the proceedings to be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>in chambers. Except as otherwise provided in this standard, the judge should never through word or demeanor, either directly or indirectly, communicate to the defendant or defense counsel that a plea agreement should be accepted or that a guilty plea should be entered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If no agreement is reached, or if subsequent events require the withdrawal of the plea, the facilitating judge must disqualify himself or herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The commentary enunciated the reason for the open, recorded negotiation session as follows: \u201cNormally . . . a judge should not allow plea discussions in which he or she is involved to take place in chambers. The judge is the ultimate dispenser of justice, and justice should be publicly done. In rare situations where full public disclosure would not be in the interests of justice, for example, where it would jeopardize ongoing police investigations or where it would force disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity, the judge may permit discussions to take place in chambers.\u201d III A.B.A., Standards for Criminal Justice, c.14, Pleas of Guilty, standard 14-3.3 (c) through (f), commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The commentary to the A.B.A. standards further states that \u201c[t]hese standards do not suggest that the court should play the role of active bargainer. Instead, paragraph (c) states that the judge \u2018shall serve as moderator,\u2019 and paragraph (f) admonishes that the judge \u2018should never through word or demeanor, either directly or indirectly, communicate to the defendant or defense counsel that a plea agreement should be accepted or that a guilty plea should be entered.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Appropriately, the standards attempt to stake out a middle ground between an absolute prohibition against judicial participation and unfettered judicial involvement in a process best left to the parties. Clearly, the standards are consistent with our present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>rules of practice. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 686 through 707. This court, therefore, should be guided by the standards set by the American Bar Association as to the judge\u2019s participation in the plea negotiations. Accordingly, I disagree with the dicta in footnote 16 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Finally, I feel compelled once again to express my concern on the direction of the majority with regard to the future of the great protector of liberty\u2014the writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 467 n.1, 610 A.2d 598 (1992), I wrote of that concern as follows: \u201cI fear that the true purpose of . . . [the majority\u2019s] dicta is the beginning of an assault on the writ of habeas corpus as a vehicle for justice.\u201d In <em>Bunkley, </em>the majority wrote that the writ was reserved for \u201cconvictions that violate fundamental fairness\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 460-61; but today, the majority elevates that dicta to a requirement that the petitioner must ordinarily \u201cestablish some fundamental constitutional violation..<em>..\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">We have never held before that the \u201cgreat writ of liberty,\u201d which has its roots in the Magna Carta, is ordinarily reserved for a conviction that involves a constitutional violation. Rather we have held that the special and extraordinary legal remedy is for a \u201cmiscarriage of justice or other prejudice.\u201d <em>D'Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 156, 476 A.2d 543 (1984). Although most cases are predicated on constitutional violations, I am unwilling to circumscribe the writ of habeas corpus as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the majority suggests. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-466. Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote over fifty years ago that \u201c[i]t must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas corpus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty and there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired.\u201d <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>306 U.S. 19, 26, 59 S. Ct. 442, 83 L. Ed. 455 (1939). The writ of habeas corpus \u201c \u2018holds an honored position in our jurisprudence . . . [as] a bulwark against convictions that violate \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 516, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984), quoting <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 126, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783, reh. denied, 456 U.S. 1001, 102 S. Ct. 2268, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1296 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">What is particularly troubling to me is that the majority, in order to achieve its goal, appears to use dicta and cases that are inapposite to proclaim eventually for a future case that its holding is based upon rock solid precedent. This is why I believe it is necessary to answer the dicta of the majority concerning the trial judge\u2019s participation in the plea negotiations, as well as its seemingly innocuous reference to the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Because I agree with the majority that the issue regarding the trial judge\u2019s participation in plea negotiations as a per se violation of the cannon of judicial conduct was not raised before the habeas court, I concur in the result. I also agree that the remaining claims of the petitioner are without merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-10\"> My reference to \u201cplea negotiations\u201d encompasses sentence negotiations as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> Judge Arena also noted on the record that \u201c[t]his court was involved in extensive discussions concerning this matter over a long period of time. That started when I was first assigned here in March of 1988. This defendant is familiar with the criminal justice system.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> Rule 11 (e) (1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \u201cThe attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se may engage in discussions with a view toward reaching an agreement that, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charged offense or to a lesser or related offense, the attorney for the government will do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201c(A) move for dismissal of other charges; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">\u201c(B) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose the defendant\u2019s request, for a particular sentence, with the understanding that such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon the court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u201c(C) agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case. <em>The court shall not participate in any such discussions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 694 provides: \u201cIf a plea agreement has been reached by the parties, which contemplates the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tendere, the judicial authority shall require the disclosure of the agreement in open court or, on a showing of good cause, in camera at the time the plea is offered. Thereupon the judicial authority may accept or reject the agreement, or he may defer his decision on acceptance or rejection until there has been an opportunity to consider the presentence report, or he [or she] may defer it for other reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">Practice Book \u00a7 706 provides: \u201cIf the parties reach an agreement which contemplates the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, they may advise the judicial authority in advance of the plea. The judicial authority may indicate whether he will concur in or reject the proposed disposition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> Moreover, the facts in <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>220 Conn. 270, 596 A.2d 407 (1991), are inapposite to the facts in this case. In <em>Niblack, </em>the plea agreement was for a sentence term of a fixed number of years. In this case, the plea agreement merely set a cap\u2014that is, a maximum of ten years, execution suspended after five years with four years probation and the right to argue for a lesser sentence, which the petitioner\u2019s attorney chose not to exercise. In other words, the \u201cten years suspended after five\u201d was not a certainty, as the sentence agreement in <em>Niblack </em>was. We recognized this distinction just recently when we held that, for purposes of sentence review, a sentence cap is not a plea agreement. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>220 Conn. 400, 406, 599 A.2d 738 (1991), we held that \u201c[a] defendant who reserves the right to argue for a lesser sentence anticipates that he may be able to persuade the court to impose a lesser sentence than that which the state is recommending.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> See footnote 3, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\"> When a federal circuit sought to interpret rule 11 (e) (1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, it turned to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969) (court held that a defendant whose guilty plea to a tax evasion charge had been taken in a court procedure that did not fully comply with rule 11 was entitled to withdraw his plea without having first to show prejudice). Although the court in <em>McCarthy </em>interpreted an earlier version of rule 11, \u201cthe application of <em>McCarthy </em>to violations of [r]ule 11 (e) (l)\u2019s prohibition of judicial participation in plea discussions is not difficult, at least where the defendant has pled guilty and seeks only to withdraw his plea. That prohibition serves to strengthen the prophylactic scheme established by [rjule 11 and enforced by <em>McCarthy, </em>that is, it helps to insure that involuntary, unknowing and unfounded guilty pleas will not be entered.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>634 F.2d 830, 839 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">\u201cThe applicability <em>of McCarthy </em>. . . is not, however, so clear where the defendant has in fact pled not guilty and received a full trial. . . . The explicit [r]ule 11 purposes discussed in <em>McCarthy </em>do not involve these dangers to defendants who plead not guilty after unsuccessful plea negotiations in which the judge has participated.\u201d Id., 840-41. Of course, the federal courts have also held that rule 11 (e) (1) prohibits judicial involvement in plea negotiations where the defendant does, in fact, have a trial. The reasons given for so doing are virtually identical to those discussed by the majority in its footnote 16. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra; <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>646 F.2d 873 (5th Cir. 1980), modified in part, 646 F.2d 902 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 840, 102 S. Ct. 148, 70 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1981). That scenario, in which the defendant proceeded to trial, has been described as the \u201creverse side of the coerced plea situation.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>supra, 893 (Hill, J., dissenting). Although the coerced plea situation was the original catalyst for the prohibition, the federal courts extended the prohibition against judicial involvement to cases where the negotiations are unsuccessful and the defendant goes to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> The following is what transpired at the habeas hearing between the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, Gerald Klein, and the petitioner\u2019s habeas corpus counsel, Karen Goodrow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201c[Goodrow]: . . . What, if any, advice did you give him with regard to entering a guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u201c[Klein]: Well, I told him that a jury might very well find him guilty and I told him about [a particular judge] and I told him the type of sentence that he could expect if he [was] convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">\u201cQ. And is it fair to say that [this judge] would have sat on the trial, had he had a criminal trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u201cA. That\u2019s what I was told by the state\u2019s attorney and Judge Arena, that it had been assigned to [this particular judge], although we were picking a jury with Judge Schaller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u201cQ. And what did you tell him with regard to [this judge]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">\u201cA. That I thought he\u2019d get a very, very long sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> Although not completely reassured, I am pleased to read that the majority, in footnote 13 of its opinion, acknowledges that the writ of habeas corpus is not limited to constitutional violations but is also a remedy for a \u201c \u2018miscarriage of justice or other prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 461, 610 A.2d 598 (1992). When, however, the availability of the \u201cgreat writ of liberty\u201d is qualified in any manner that is not recognized by our law, I will continue to speak out, as it is my obligation to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
